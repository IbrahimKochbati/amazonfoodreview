I picked this up at my local grocery store in the seasonal aisle [with the Easter goodies].          This moist cake mix can be made with or without eggs. I used them, and wasn't the least bit disappointed.          I paired the cake with Pilsbury's Pink Lemonade frosting, too. But you could have it totally un frosted if you'd like! You will still love it!          Perfect for the family dessert, children's cupcakes, or a lovely addition to the ladies afternoon tea! If you love pink lemonade you are going to love this!          The color just screams Spring and Easter! And the taste will leave you screaming for another bite!          I give this 5 stars and my thumbs up!
