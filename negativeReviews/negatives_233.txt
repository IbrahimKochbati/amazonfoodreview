They claim this product is "unadulterated", which would make you think "oh! sweet! it's going to be the BEST, because nobody else's coconut oil says it's "unadulterated".  I checked out their website, and for those of you who don't know... you want to go for COLD PRESSED oils. If they're not cold pressed, it means they've been processed with major machinery and subjected to high heats, which as anything goes, can and usually does, kill any good minerals and vitamins. Their site posts information on their extraction process. As of today, this is what it states:          ""Manila Coco oil extraction method is through a proprietary, state of the art mechanical expeller (Manila VirginFlo), thermo stable to hold off the lowest moisture possible (0.1%) to avoid rancidity and keep shelf life consistent up to 3 years under normal conditions. Our oils are 1st and 2nd stage press induced, without chemical solvents, no bleaching, no deodorizing, no hydrogenation, no fermentation enzymes   to keep its natural light sweet coconut aroma and taste. This method sustains its unique character even when subjected to high (up to 170 degrees Celsius) heat temperatures.""          Mechanical Expeller is their form of extraction. And they also say it sustains unique character... blah blah blah... when subjected to high heat temperatures. Therefore, in my personal opinion, it is not as "unadulterated" as their information on their products on Amazon make them sound. I will be steering clear of their products.          I'm sorry if my review offends some, but if you're going to pay good money for something, you should know about it. I would use different  ands before sticking yourself with this one. I was looking for larger quantities, which is why I looked at this product, however I will be sticking with Nutiva. As their coconut oil is cold pressed soon after the coconuts are cut open. The information below is direct from their website.          ""What makes Nutiva's virgin coconut oil so special? Much of the magic lies in the way the oil is processed. Within several hours of the coconuts being chopped, the meat is cold pressed, unlike other varieties of coconut oil which can be left for more than 10 hours before pressing. Nutiva's approach preserves as much of the oil's natural color, flavor and aroma, giving you the best results for any use.""          If you don't care about how it's processed, it is still going to be much healthier than your average grocery store found vegetable and canola oils. If you want to read some scary things, look up the dark information on how those are processed. YUCK! Talk about horrifying.          Thank you for your time.      Amy          PS. I used to be one of those "organic? what kind of fruitcake are you? Think you're more special than anybody else?" people. But I have learned so much in the past year and a half, dealing with my son's allergies and intollerances. There's more to it than "oh it's more expensive, so it's just making me feel special because I can afford it." No. There's WAY more to it than that. I urge everybody to talk to people about organic foods. It's a way of life, a healthier way of life. We all deserve to live healthier. If you live healthier, even though it costs more, in the long term you're saving money because you are healthier. So that means less doctor visits, less expensive (and nasty harmful) medications, etc.
