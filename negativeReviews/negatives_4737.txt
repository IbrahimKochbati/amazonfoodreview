Torani is a  and that sells their products in GLASS BOTTLES.  The product description here on Amazon.com of this package did not specify that the bottles are PLASTIC.  I would not have ordered this product had I known the bottles were plastic due to concerns about toxins in plastic.  I pay extra for Amazon Prime and expect to be able to return an UNOPENED ITEM if it is not what I thought it would be.  Not only will Amazon.com not allow me to return this item, they have deleted my prior feedback on the item.  Hopefully they will not delete this feedback too as it is VERY RELEVANT for customers in deciding which items to purchase.  If you don't want plastic bottles, do not order this set.
