This quickly became my favorite cereal next to Peace Cereal's Ginger Hemp cereal. I like it because it is made from guaranteed good quality organic non GMO ingredients, and because the price is extremely cheap.          Save a bundle by doing a recurring subscription for the cereal. You can cancel anytime so there's nothing to lose.          I'm now looking for other Peace Cereals to try out; I'm sure I'll love them as well.
