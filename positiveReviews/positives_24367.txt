I'm addicted to Yogi Teas and have vowed to try them all.  This Indian Spice tea is delicious. I've found that many of the Yogi teas are not as strong as I want them to be, so the tea bag stays in until I've drank all the tea. Not so with this tea, this tea has a VERY strong Cinnamon taste, which I find enjoyable. In truth, I may have left the bag in too long today, as the cinnamon flavor is burning a little.     The directions on the box say to add milk (or milk substitute) and sweetener to the tea. They mean it. I tried to drink it plain, but couldn't, it just didn't taste right. However, I did add a popular flavored coffee creamer, and that worked beautifully.  This is a whole new drink now, doesn't feel like tea, it feels like a treat. Enjoy.
