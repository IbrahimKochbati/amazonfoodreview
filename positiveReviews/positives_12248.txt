Nabisco "Big" Wheat Thins taste great despite a name that didn't exactly excite me about trying them. They make great snacking crackers; and when you serve these to your guests you're gonna be loved by them forever! Hehehe          The crackers are very low in fat; and there are no trans fats at all in a serving  hooray! These crackers contain no cholesterol and you do get 5 grams of whole grain in a single serving. Excellent! The crackers contain a relatively low amount of sodium which is more good news.          Moreover, the crackers contain defatted wheat germ; this is very healthy for you.          The extra large size of these crackers makes them particularly useful when you serve them with a dip to guests. Of course, you can also treat yourself to this same delight! They taste wonderful with a garlic and herb cheese dip I sometimes use.          One small caveat: Eat these before any expiration date printed or stamped on the top of the box. You wouldn't want to eat stale crackers, now would you?          Overall, Wheat Thins are some of the best crackers on your grocer's shelf. Buy a box and enjoy some today!
