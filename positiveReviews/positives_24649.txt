I buy Farmer's Market organic pumpkin to mix in with my dog's meals.  I've seen the comments about dented cans and have to say that I think it's the manufacturer.  When I buy in the store I always have to sift through the cans to find the least damaged.  The metal seems to be pretty thin.  My Amazon order was in much better shape than the cans I've seen in the stores.  Price is good too.  Locally, I've seen this product priced between $2.39 and $3.69 a can.  And even though the Amazon price is only pennies less a can than my lowest local price, it's incredibly convenient; especially with the free shipping.
