This company's ghee was highly recommened in a book called Cure Tooth Decay  Heal & Prevent Cavities with Nutrition, The Author, Ramiel Nagel, referred to ghee as one of the nature foods that contains a healthy and natural fat to help us rebuild tooth enamel and keep gums strong and healthy.  I purchased the ghee because I observed a cavity starting..and wanted to fix it without going to the denist & using harmful drugs.  Since I have been following a few simple suggestions in this book, the tooth enamel is rebuilding.  This book also contains other recipes and foods that can help cure and prevent cavities.          Getting back to the ghee.  When I visited Pure Foods website, I was very pleased that they had several kinds of ghee including the regular.  For example, they have digestive ghee..which includes spices (helpful for digestion) some of which are also traditionally used to make chai tea. I love this digestive ghee because I can make regular black tea and add the digestive ghee & a little sweetner and it makes a nice chai tea.  It warms me up during the cold and dampness and another added benefit..my stools come out much smoother..and constipation is usually eiliminated completely when I use it consistently. They also have ghees for recipes with chicken, fish and stake.  I've used these other ghees in a few receipes for chicken soup, on salmon and of course, lamb stew..I enjoy it very much.  Yes, they are sold separately from the regular ghee. Oh, they also have very small sample sizes to try before purchasing a large size.
