I like this coffee, it has a little more bite than the super creama but all in all a good drink. It may be a little more suited to milk base drinks. When it is all said and done Lavazza comes throuth again with their 100% Arabica blend. Super Creama is still my favorite of the Lavazza  and, but this may be my second choice.
