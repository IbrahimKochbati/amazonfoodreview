My son is allergic to milk and wheat on on the ASD spectrum so he's been on the Gluten free Casein free diet all his life. He loves these  ownies. I make them with egg white and water instead of the oil to cut out the added fat, but they are still great and easy to make. The only drawback is that they are full of sugar, which makes my son hyper stim so we have to dole them out one at a time.          We buy them buy the case from Amazon every few months. Thanks Gluten Free Pantry.
