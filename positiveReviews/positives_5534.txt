This is the wondeful white popcorn we ate in Iowa years ago! I am so glad to find it. And what a great price too!     I got it today and popped some right away. I used the microwave popcorn bowl I bought from Amazon, put a tablespoonful of extra virgin olive oil and two tablespoonsful of the popcorn in the bowl.     I placed the bowl, with lid on, in the MW and turned it on for 1 minute and then pushed the popcorn button to pop it.     After moving the popped corn to another bowl I shook the shaker with the popcorn seasoning several times and oh what a delicious hulless treat! The hulls seem to have vanished during the popping. I felt nor found any.     AND ALL OF THE ITEMS I USED, INCLUDING THE MICROWAVE, I BOUGHT FROM AMAZON.
