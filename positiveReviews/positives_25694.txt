Based on the current retail price for 3 one pound packages of $22.73, this product is fairly priced. I can buy it locally for $7.99 per pound at our local health food store.  It is a great tea "staple" to have on hand because you can mix it with other herbal, black or green teas.  It definitely gives you a non jittery energy boost and it is an excellent source of chromium plus it has some iron, magnesium, niacin, zinc and riboflavin.          Please note this one major difference that I just picked up on:  The kind that I purchased is called "Green Energy" and it is packed with vitamins including riboflavin, niacin, iron, magnesium and zinc.  No chromium, however.It has 80 mg of caffeine.  As far as I can see, "Green Energy" is only available on Amazon as tea bags not loose leaf.
