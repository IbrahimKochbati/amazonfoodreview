These chips are some of the best I've had  ever! They're so good I dare say that they're addictive from the very first time you try a few. The taste of the salsa is delicious and the fresh chips go with lots of other foods.          The main ingredient is whole grain  own rice; and yes, this is good for you. I haven't had regular potato chips in quite a while; but I would imagine that these chips have less fat then potato chips have. There are no trans fats, no cholesterol, no preservatives, no and artificial flavors. They are even wheat and gluten free! Very good! They have less than 1 gram of sugar per serving.          They do have some sodium; they have about 200mg of sodium in every serving; and there are roughly five servings to a bag.          If you have further questions, the company maintains a website and an email address so you can contact them. Good PR!          Overall, these are some very awesome chips! I highly recommend them. Enjoy!
