Pros:     Tastes pretty good     Slightly lower sugar than soda     Vitamin C     Carbonation adds a little pizzazz          Cons:     Leans toward being too sweet (at least for me)     Not significantly healthier     3 4 size can compared to regular 12 oz drink          Bottom line:     It's an okay but not great blending of the soda and juice worlds. Personally I would say stick with the real thing for more satisfaction. IE, if you're in the mood for a juice beverage, grab juice. Soda same thing.
