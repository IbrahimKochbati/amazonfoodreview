According to the package, Petite Cuisine is 100% nutritionally complete, has added vitamins and minerals, no wheat gluten, and contains gourmet ingredients, and has no bad odors.          While I can say nothing about the taste, my two cats lick their plates and even like it cold   straight from the fridge. But they're cats with no gourmet values. And picky me can't detect an unpleasant odor.  The nutritional values seem comparable to the Wholesome Goodness I've been picking up at WalMart.  Is gluten free an issue for cats?  As far as safety of ingredients, additives, and processing, who knows?  And unless one can be assured of safety, why pay so much more?
