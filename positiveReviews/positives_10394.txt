These Keurig cups are are perfect match to the Earl Grey teabags Twinings has. I know Keurig has expiration dates on all of the cups, but these cups are far more shelf stable and fresh tasting than a box of teabags that have been opened. I occasionally like a cup of tea and this makes sure the last cup is as fresh tasting as the first one.
