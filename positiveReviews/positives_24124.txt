I love this Kcup for summer. The product is not too sweet and I load it up with extra fresh lemon juice and its so delicious and light tasting. I don't taste any kind of aftertaste or artifical flavor.  I admit, I water it down quite a bit though (just a preference along with the lemon juice).  When I  ew this Kcup, I use the maximum water amount (I have the mini  ewer) which I believe is 12 oz...for me, this gives two large glasses of tea once I've added ice and lemon. I also cool the tea off before drinking...I realized that actually  ewing it over a cup of ice significanly waters down the product (I believe it is intended to be that way) but if I cool it off, then I can water it down at my discretion, not add as much ice, and I end up with more tea from the Kcup.  Enjoy it~!
