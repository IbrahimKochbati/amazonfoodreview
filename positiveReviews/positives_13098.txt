I would have to say this is one of my all time favorite foods.  My personal favorite way to eat it is to roll it into balls then place the balls into a shallow dish of freshly  ewed green tea ('pi lo chun' in case you wondered).  Sometimes I use a flavored green tea as well and I also use other teas, black, herbals and even a couple of rooibos taste good this way.  That is about Thai Sticky Rice in general though, now let's talk this particular bag of the stuff.          I got this with free two day shipping through my Prime membership so no worries there, the price per pound winds up quite reasonable at $2.34 lb. so that's great too.  It cooked up easily and nicely and I was able to roll it up as well as any I have had, that makes four good things and now the taste... I really liked this one a lot.  It is a nice and tasty rice and it sticks together well and soaks up the tea nicely without having the balled up rice disintegrate into a handful of soggy rice in my hand (yes, I do in fact use my hand to eat this, rather my fingers. 8 )          I think I will lay in a supply of this one for sure... I'd hate to run out.
