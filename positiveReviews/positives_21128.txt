If you like black tea you'll love Typhoo. I saw it mentioned on an English show and as always thank you Amazon for carrying things no where else does. This is a really strong black tea that you have to make correctly (read: can't just leave the tea bag in like most Americans do...) and goes best with a little milk. My roommate (who has given me a hard time for having an unreasonably large quantity of tea, with good reason) has even fallen in love with this tea and steals at least a few bags a day from me so it is that good. If you're even on this page looking at it I say you pick up a box or three and give it a spin, it's way better than any black tea I've come across state side.
