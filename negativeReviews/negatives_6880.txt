I remember years ago the first Wasabi peanuts I bought from a local gourmet food store were 100 times hotter then theses cheap knock offs.     They were truly wasabi covered peanuts. These peanuts are covered first in a layer of soybean paste than a very thin coating of wasabi for color. I would say they are using a green food colored horseradish not true wasabi.          If you like something crunchy and very mild heat, buy these. They are like eatting M&M candies. I read the other reviews before buying and all said "Wow these are HOT! I say Bologna!          Which goes to show... you can always make something cheap.
