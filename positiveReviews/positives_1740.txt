My husband LOVES pudding and any kind of dessert at the end of dinner. This is a great way to appease his cravings while not being full of butter and fat. I love that I can add whatever I want to it to fancy it up a little. I love to put cocoa powder and make a more elegant tasting chocolate pudding or mix it with berries for my kids.
