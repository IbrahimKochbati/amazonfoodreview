Am a recent burr grinder user and have tried a few different beans and this one lacks flavor or body, something's missing.  Had the Kirkland Columbia coffee and that was better but still looking for a really good coffee to  ew and this isn't the one.  As one other recent reviewer noted, this just seems weak, not much taste.
