Other reviewers here that gave this bar a good review must have been paid off by thinkthin.  Theses are the worst tasting protein bars I've ever tasted in my life.  At least other  ands try to make their bar taste alright, thinkthin basically said nope, not even going to try.  The bar barely has any white chocolate taste to it.  The bar is bitter and dry.  It took me 30 minutes to finish 1 bar because it tasted so bad.  Will never buy another thinkthin product.
