Hi! I bought this item to distribute as a birthday "gift" for students in my classroom.  When I recieved the item, I was disapointed that the pixy stix were not larger.  I did not read the size online because they listed them as Giant Pixy Stix so I thought they were what I was looking for. I did not have time to return them before school started. I made them work, but I will serch for really giant Pixy Stixs in the future!
