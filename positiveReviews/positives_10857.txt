I've got an out of shape Jack Russell and a diabetic chihuahua.  They are definite chow hounds but are a bit spoiled when it comes to treats    they have developed discriminating palates.          I watched closely when introducing them to these Newman's Own Organics Lamb Barley Ranch Style.  They were a little puzzled at first . . . . The texture of these treats is extremely hard and crunchy and they are in an irregular square shape and have a rather "handcrafted" appearance.  The chemical free nature of these and the  hard texture have obvious health benefits.  The taste test? . . . . .          In short, after a couple of introductory feedings, my dogs absolutely love these Newman's treats.  They snatch them and immediately retreat to munch and enjoy in private and with gusto.  And I feel like I'm providing a quality wholesome treat.  I'm very happy with this product.
