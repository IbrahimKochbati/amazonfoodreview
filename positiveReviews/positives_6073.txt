I have previously  ought habanero powder from a gourmet store at The Grove in LA.  It was roughly 3 oz for $5.95.  This has the same great flavor and intensity that a habanero powder should have.  We use it to season fried fish and chicken and all  aised meat dishes.  I highly recommend buying this product.
