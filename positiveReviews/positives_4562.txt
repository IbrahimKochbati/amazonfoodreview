With all the meds I take, I have a lot of problems with my stomach. I try a cracker first, when nausea hits, with Gaviscon or Tums being the next up to bat if that doesn't work.          These are so wonderfully yummy that I then bought the Pumpkin Seed Cheddar too! The flat ead is great alone, or used instead of  ead.  The crunch is intense, although I love it that way. I keep these next to my chair and next to my bed and look forward to trying other flavors too.
