Since shifting to a Paleo diet, I've been limiting my butter intake to nearly none at all... and to be honest, I miss it from time to time.  When I saw that the Whole9 approved this particular ghee for their Whole30 program, I was ecstatic.  I immediately ordered it and have been thrilled ever since.  The texture, the flavor, the smell   it is all so incredible!  A little bitty bit goes a very long way.  I love cooking with this, eating it on sweet potatoes, mixing it with mashed cauliflower... anywhere I would've used butter, I use this ghee instead.  It is so buttery rich delicious, I highly recommend giving it a try.  It doesn't leave my counter, it adds such great flavor to all the meals that get cooked in it.
