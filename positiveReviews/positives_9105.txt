I was originally looking for Keurig coffee on Amazon and stumbled across this gem.  I bought it for work to centralize my coffee "stuff" and it has been perfect   k cups, stirrers, sweetener packets, all fit nicely in one place...right below my Keurig!  The only thing that would make this product better would be if the dividers in the drawer were solid so stirrers didn't have a chance to roll around, but since I can tell it was originally designed to only hold k cups I can't complain.  Great for saving space and looks nicer than the tall, spice rack looking k cup holders out there   would def recommend.
