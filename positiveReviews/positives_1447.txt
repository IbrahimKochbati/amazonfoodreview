I have been on weight watcher's for about 13 months.  I have lost 60 pounds.  The most important part to being on weight watchers is too find food items that let you feel like your not giving anything up.  Popchips do that for me.  They are only 2 points plus on weight watcher's.  They go great with every meal (salad,soup,sandwich,etc). I can not live without them.  So i say BUY BUY BUY AND BUY
