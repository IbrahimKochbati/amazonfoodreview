I've used this many times over the past couple of years. Biscuits,  eading for fried chicken, low carb  ownies, etc. If you are following a low carb lifestyle, this is a great substitute for white flour laden products. It does have a different taste, and a little aftertaste, but if you are doing the low carb thing, you're probably already familiar with that. I use this for anything I would usually use Bisquick for. I hadn't had a biscuit in over a year when I tried this...I was so glad I found it. Carbalose  the flour they use, is also available from some sites by itself  You can use this in even more recipes.
