I've tried every single flavor of Pop Chips they make.  They are all tasty, but barbecue is IT for me!  These have been my salvation while dieting.  One serving practically fills an entire cereal bowl, but has way less fat and calories than traditional chips.  I'm hooked!  I highly recommend trying these!
