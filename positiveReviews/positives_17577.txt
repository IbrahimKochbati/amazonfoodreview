No coffee gets 5 stars from me unless it was just roasted and ground within the last half hour. Additionally, I have no problems with acid reflux. Given that, I do like a light roast; not a fan of french roast or anything Starbucks.     Given that, this is the first french roast I have ever liked. I found it mild smooth and drinkable. I was surprised, especially given my low expectations. If the acid in some coffee bothers you, I think this is worth a try.
