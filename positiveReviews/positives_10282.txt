I bought these to freeze my son's baby food. Well, they work just like you want them too. The best thing about them is that the food pops out great and then I put the frozen cubes of food into labeled freezer bags. The one major disadvantage to these is that they are extremely expensive! If it wasn't for the price, I would own a few more!
