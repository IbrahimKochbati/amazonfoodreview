This is by far the best Peppered Country Gravy mix you can buy!  I have tried them all(almost).  It is also very diverse in what you can do with it..  Add sausage for sausage gravy, chicken  oth and chicken for an awesome creamy chicken gravy.  Same with turkey, ham, etc..  Nothing compares to SM's mixes, unless you make it from scratch and are good at it.
