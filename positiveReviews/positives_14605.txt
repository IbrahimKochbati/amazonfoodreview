The price on this product was just right.  After searching (and failing) to find ANY loose Gunpowder Green Tea at any of my local grocery stores, I resorted to Amazon, and Twinings came through.  The tea is very fresh and comes separately packaged in 6 tins.  Although I personally would prefer a larger single tin (I'm already through tin 1 of the set), this does ensure freshness for the rest of the tea.
