This coffee tastes very flavorful and is not too strong, but I have to say it almost ruined my months' old Keurig Personal Brewer. The coffee is ground so finely that when the K Cups are punctured by the needles (top and bottom), it gets packed into the needles and also sifts out through the holes made by the needles, going into the coffee cup creating a very nasty "sludge" in the bottom of each cup. I purchased a pack of 2 (48 K Cups) and didn't even use one full pack. I do not recommend this  and or blend. It is a waste of money, which is something I couldn't really afford at this time. I sent a letter of complaint to the Wolfgang Puck company and, except for a "cookie cutter" letter acknowledging receipt of my comment, I have not received any further contact from them.
