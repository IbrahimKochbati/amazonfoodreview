Just tried this for the first time today.  To be honest it's been years since I've had a "real" mac and cheese from the box.  However I thought this was great.  I adjusted the ratio for the sauce, using 1 tablespoon of oil instead of 3, 2 tablespoons of water and adding 1 heaping tablespoon of Tofutti sour cream to powdered sauce mixture.  This worked great for me, and made it seem much creamier than I had expected from other reviews.  I also kept out a little of the starchy pasta liquid before I drained it to help coat the pasta with the sauce.  Added in some cooked chicken, fresh tomato and parsley.  It was delicious,  I'll definitely do this again!
