I loved these chews until today... and so did my 40 lb akita puppy. These are great for keeping your dogs teeth clean and my dog loves them! She runs to her cushion and sits down as soon as I grab the bag from the shelf. However, the major problem with them is that my dog attempts to swallow them as soon as she can and has almost choked on one twice now. The first time I easily pulled it out of her throat but today it almost killed her. I should have known better because I'd been told as much by many people at my vets (one dog even choked to death) but the reviews online were so good I didn't listen. I always watch my dog with chews but even under supervision she will try and swallow them ASAP. These are great for your dogs teeth but please watch your dog!          Also, the sizes are very inconsistent... in the four bags I've ordered to date I've had to throw a large number out (basically one full bags worth) because they are too small to even attempt to give to my dog.
