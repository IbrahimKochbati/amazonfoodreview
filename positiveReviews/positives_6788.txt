I recently visited Paris and when I came back to the States I couldn't drink the coffee. So I found a French website that had some great  ands but it cost and arm and a leg to send them here. LavAzza was one of the Italian coffees on the French website and I found it here on Amazon!! So now I can have excellent espresso for a decent price!!! Thank you Amazon!!!
