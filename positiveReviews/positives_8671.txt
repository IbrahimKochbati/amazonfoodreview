These crispy squares are lamb lung.  Our older golden retriever doesn't care what they are, he likes them so much he actually dances around when we get them out!  Even the cat loves them and comes running for a few crumbs when we open the bag.  Our dog is a somewhat picky eater so sometimes I shave bits of these treats over his dry dog food and he loves it.
