If you can't stand what your stewardess is serving,     ask her to pop one of these in. Also applicable if     you are an astronaut and the pea soup powder is out.          Otherwise, you might be better of eating something else.          The Beef & Steak Pepper dish doesn't seem to separate properly,     staying somewhat lumpy and gelatinous even after heated. It is     also quite bland, though not under salted. I can't say that it     is inedible, but Hormel certainly makes tastier dishes with     more appealing presentations.
