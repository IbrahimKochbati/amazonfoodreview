In my opinion, Healthwise does not have the rich taste of Trader Joes Low Acid Coffee     Not worth the price. Taste like upscale Yuban to my palette.     Plus did you know you can cold  ew REGULAR COFFEE and its considered low acid. Google it!     In my opinion,  whats the point of Healthwise coffee? On the directions it reads...     and I quote from can "Use cold water and  ew at least two 5 ounce cups at a time using one tablespoon of ground coffee." Hello!     and I dont see any reports or data sheets to confirm its "low acid" rating.there could be, but i have not been able to find them..if you do let me know!     Cold  ew regular Coffee. its waaaay cheaper and for really low acid coffe try cold  ewing Trader Joes Low Acid Coffee! Yummy!!     Their cinnamon is off the hook GREAT!! :)
