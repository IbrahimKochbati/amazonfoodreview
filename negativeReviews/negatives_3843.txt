I love the idea of carbonated juice   I really do. I love carbonation. I love juice. Put them together and you should have a sweeter version of what you can make with club soda and juice. So one star earned for the idea. One star for the convenience of me not having to mix my own club soda with juice and one star for convenience that it is in a can. As for taste   I didn't like it much at all. It was just too sweet. I like soda, but this was just over the top. This particular version my wife and I both agreed that it tasted really close to strawberry poprocks, which in and of itself is a good thing. I just didn't care for it as a carbonated fruit juice.  I'm going to give this a partial fail. It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't buy it again.
