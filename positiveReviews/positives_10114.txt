Amazon seems to have combined the reviews for three different products here, Italian, French, and Columbian. I picked up a box of the Italian Roast at the grocery, and I really like it. It is strong and full flavored without bitterness. For hot coffee, I make the larger size cup, and the smaller for iced coffee. I checked Amazon to see if I could save money, but it looks like the same price I paid at the store ($9.99 for a box of 12).
