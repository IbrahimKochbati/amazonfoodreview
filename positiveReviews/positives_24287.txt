I bought this for my girlfriend for her birthday. My girlfriend is VERY picky when it comes to food and drink choices and she couldn't be happier with Big Train Chai! She was first introduced to Big Train at a local coffee shop so I decided to buy her this to save cost and time. She actually makes her chai with cold milk and loves how easy it travels and stays fresh throughout the day. Her only complaint would be that the chai powder sometimes clumps because there is not hot liquid but it doesn't affect the taste. I would definitely recommend this product for any chai or coffee lover!
