The Vanilla Chai is my favorite, makes a great iced chai on a hot summer day. I can't get it at the local coffee shops that used to carry it, so I was glad to find it here. I tend to want my chai drinks a little less sweet and strong, so making it myself lets me have it my way, and with this large can I can make whatever size I want at the time.
