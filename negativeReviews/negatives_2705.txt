Excellent size and not too many are  oken, but they may be RAW, not ROASTED, so beware. Would be nice if the merchant was more explicit or offered options.          I bought these for my wife who is somewhat salt intolerant, so would buy again IF they were prepared (or presented) properly.          UPDATE: Contacted the vendor, who apparently has a problem with English, and does the "run around" game, so BEWARE.
