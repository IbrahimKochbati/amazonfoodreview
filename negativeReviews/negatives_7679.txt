Quaker advertises their Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies as made of whole grain oats and a good source of fiber. It says so on the box. It also contains enough oils, fats, and butter to have one cookie make up 8 grams, or 12 %, of your daily recommended intake for total fat. One cookie. And it says so on the box.          They are soft and come separately packaged for lunch boxes. I think the separate packaging is to prevent the cookies from falling apart.  The box also says they contain chocolate and almond. I think out of the 2 cookies I tasted, there was a hint of chocolate with the taste of almond. To me, they are bland, chalky and not very palatable.          I know it's a cookie, but it doesn't taste like one and the high fat content with low quality flavor will prevent me from purchasing them in the future.
