I was leery about buying this product, but I decided to give it a try anyway. It's great, and a lot less fat for those who would like eat to peanut butter more frequently than its natural fat content allows. It tastes like a natural peanut butter  and, not like a Skippy or Jif. I like to add 1 teaspoon of honey to it sometimes. Be aware that 1 serving of prepared PB2 is not the same amount as a TBSP of peanut butter, it is a little less.
