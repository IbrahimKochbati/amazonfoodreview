I first bought this product at Walmart but when they stopped stocking it, I was very pleased to find it on Amazon. When you add a sweetener and milk, it tastes just like the expensive Chai tea you get at coffee shops. However, for the cost of one shop drink you can have 20 at home. I've also tried every other company's Chai teabags and this one has the best blend of spices, not overdone.
