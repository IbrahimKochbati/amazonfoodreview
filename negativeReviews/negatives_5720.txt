Very disappointed with the direction Healthy Choice has taken with all of its former "Fresh Mixers" line, especially the ones that contain chicken.  I am changing my rating on all of these products from 5 stars to 3 stars.  With the switch to "Lunch Express," apparently they decided to lower their production costs and make more on each unit.  First, they removed the handy green plastic strainer    consumers are now supposed to be able to judge the exact amount of water that can be absorbed by the pasta or rice, aided by a lower water line in the container.  Second, in case you haven't read the fine print on the sauce containers, they have replaced the nice large chunks of white chicken meat with smaller, diced pieces of dark chicken meat.  I saved a few of the old green plastic strainers and they still fit the newer containers.  The convenience, taste and portioning are still attractive, so I'm continuing my subscription for now    which is probably what Healthy Choice is counting on    but just wanted to state my disappointment over yet another company placing greed over customer satisfaction.
