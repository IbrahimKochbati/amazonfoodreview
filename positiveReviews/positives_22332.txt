My 5 lb. Yorkie LOVES these chews.  I give her one at night and she is so engrossed in chewing, I can actually groom her without a fight.  Each chew lasts me about a week if I don't let her chew it too long.  After she choked on a rawhide bone, I researched other forms of chews and found these to be the best.  They are expensive, but totally worth it to me.  Plus this price on Amazon.com was great.          I highly recommend these chews if you have a small dog.
