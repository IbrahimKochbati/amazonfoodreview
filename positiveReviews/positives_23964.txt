I absolutely love these chips.  All the flavors are great, but my favorites are Plain, Cheddar and Sour Cream & Onion.  I started eating them when I was trying to lose weight, and now that I lost the weight, I continue to eat them because the taste so great    much better than greasy potato chips and more flavorful than baked chips.     I love the portion control size. Keep up the great work PopChips!!!!
