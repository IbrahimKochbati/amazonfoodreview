On the first offer my ferret didn't want the treat. But a couple of days later I noticed him trying to steal the whole bag, so I offered a piece again. This time, and ever since, he's loved it. Go figure!          I like this treat for ferrets because the pieces are appropriately sized (ie  small) for a ferret, and the ingredients and stats are superior to most ferret treats! His digestion has been less affected by these than by many ferret treats also :)
