I am not a fan of raisins, fruitcake or any of that stuff but I just had to know what Spotted Dick tastes like so I bought one. It wasn't as bad as the name or the picture on the package would suggest...but it wasn't exactly great dick either. I could see this going well with tea or a strong alcoholic beverage. Overall this dick wasn't particularly good or bad but it isn't something I will be rushing to eat again. It's a bland, spongy cake with fruit in it and it didn't taste particularly bad or good.          The can is good for a laugh if you are a slightly (ME!) immature American! I am sure some American words and names are quite funny in England too. Whatever the case may be, if you are feeling randy go grab yourself a can of Heinz Spotted Dick. If you are into Spotted Dick you may find this stuff very satisfying!
