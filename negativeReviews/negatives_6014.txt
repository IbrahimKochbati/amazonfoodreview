the first shipment of this mix was excellent and we used it all, but the second shipment must have been old because it had a flat, sort of rancid taste. i wound up throwing most of it away, which i can't afford to do.  i love bob red mill products but i think i'll shop around for it at the local health food store where it will be more likely to be fresh.
