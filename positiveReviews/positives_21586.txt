I use these tea filters to make iced tea in a medium sized pot.  I just heat the water and clip a filled filter to the edge; the tea is ready in about ten minutes total time.  Real simple.  I use Lipton loose tea I keep in a sealed cannister.          About buying the filters.  My grocery store was out of those filters.  I am pretty sure I bought them there when I first tried them.  The store was unaware they sold them, and could not find them anywhere.          I am very impressed with Amazon, so tried them for the filters.  They had them, I bought them in about 2 min; and they were delivered in about 2 days.  I got 6 packs of them, cheaper than the store.          Anyway, this purchase was easier and quicker than writing this review.  I like Amazon enough to write this review.          GatorNorm
