The dog weighs about 12#, and this is just a little too big and awkward for her to wrangle.  I can draw her into a fierce game of tug of war with it though.  A slightly larger dog might have a better time with it.  The toy itself seems very sturdy, and the screw cap (on the bottom) makes filling very easy.
