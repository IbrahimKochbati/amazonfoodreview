My dog and i love the Busy Buddy bottle.  I fill it with dog food and some treats and he spends lots of time bouncing it on the floor to get the treats out.  He did eat the rope in the top right away, but I put it into the bottle and it helps to block the top so things are harder to get out.  Great toy for my cocker  iel.
