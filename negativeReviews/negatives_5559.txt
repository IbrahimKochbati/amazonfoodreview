I can't think of a product that Newman's Own makes that I don't like.  This is probably the closest.  Perhaps a more refined palate of a coffee connoisseur would disagree, but I find this coffee to be disappointing.  To be sure, it is "extra bold", but I also think it tastes extremely earthy.          I can't recommend it, but if you like bold, strong blends, it might be more to your liking.
