Ok So I saw a Video of this online and I was like Dang I really want to make this at home. So I bought it and Wow the shipping is fast.  I've bought things from different countries and this shipping is fast considering that it's from japan. Well let me tell you about my experience with this candy.  Making it is fun it takes about 10 15 mins. to make it and you can get the instructions in English from [...]. The best part was making the fish eggs. The texture of the fish eggs is cool because it is like a skin around the egg and liquid in the center.  The rice smells like Sour apple and the fish eggs were sweet. The taste of the Fish gelatin (Red colored Gelatin) and the egg gelatin (The Yellow Colored Gelatin) was not too tasty.  It felt weird and not normal in my mouth and wouldn't eat it again.     I consider  this to be a fun little gift for a young teen or a kid that likes to make food.
