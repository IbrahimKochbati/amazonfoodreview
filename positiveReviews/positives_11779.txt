First when I opened the box the smell was divine. The pancake batter before mixed w  water smells like fresh baked sugar cookies. Then I added water and poured it into my waffle maker grill. Cooked up fine with no graininess or lumps. I didn't follow the directions of 1 cup water to 1 cup mix. I just added water and stirred until I  got my desired consistency. My waffles looked like any other waffle. I poured my syrup and it was to my surprise delicious. Very light flavor. Not bitter or too sweet. I expected a strong bitter taste when I saw wheat flour and a gritty or graininess b c it's organic but it's a smooth texture like ihop pancakes or regular pancakes. The vanilla and the honey in the mix give a nice mild taste to it without making the pancakes too sweet. I think the buttermilk they use makes the over all product not taste like cooked grain mush as well. I would definitely buy this mix again. I got the 3 pack for $11 through amazon's subscribe and save. I've heard 1 box can run you anywhere from $6 8. I'm not a big  eakfast person, but will look forward to these 4  eakfast. My friend is a southern and he makes chicken and waffles with this mix , but he uses tofu instead of chicken though since he's vegan.          p.s   be careful using oils such as olive and coconut that over heat to easily when using waffle maker or even on the stove. I wasted a whole box on pancakes that would turn hard as a  ick on the outside and still be mushy and uncooked at the center.
