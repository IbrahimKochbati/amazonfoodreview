the cookie is moist and chewy and has a great deal of sweetness from the combination of almonds and oats. if it had a little more chocolate it would be an excellent cookie. i couldn't help it, but every time i had one, i was chewing for the chocolate after the first few bites. and there wasn't enough there to keep me interested. but, i wouldn't put them out of my lunchbox by any means.
