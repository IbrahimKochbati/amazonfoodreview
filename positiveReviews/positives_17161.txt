I started with Newman's Own Pretzels with the Protein ones.  The Protein ones are too salty for my taste, and cause me to have sweet cravings.  The Spelt ones are awesome, with a slightly nutty flavor and just the right amount of salt.  As a person with a digestive condition, the higher fiber content is a wonderful thing.  Since Amazon sells them in bulk, these bags of pretzels are less expensive than in the stores, with normally run $2.19 a bag.  My only complaint to Newman's Own is that the bags are too small at 7 ounces.  Other than that, it's a great product!
