I would like to remind everyone that the restaurant Serendipity 3 in NYC was closed down by the NYC  Health DEPT some years ago beacause they were infested with roaches and mice, they found live roaches in the chocolate, they had to exterminate the entire place and reopened. But since they functioned in such disgusting conditions, how can you trust they are clean?          Do a Google search: Serendipity 3 NYC roaches mice closed          Lots of info comes up, dont buy this.
