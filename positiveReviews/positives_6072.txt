I love hot foods, and love this product,  but it is dangerous! I have dogs, and the air born powder travels in the air  fast and hard!  Their eyes were watering, from five feet across the room at my first serving.          I hadn't even opened the container, I only unwrapped it out of the mailer box, touched the OUTSIDE of the bottle and rubbed my eyes and WOW! H O T!  I thought about smelling it, and am glad I didn't. It would have burned the inside of my nose majorly.          I decided to take out a small portion, and move it into an old spice jar with a sprinkle top to control the amount I am serving on my meals. The larger bottle, is to big to work with such a a hot product.  I needed more control on what I was eating.  If you decide to do this, make sure that you do it in a sink, then wash the sink out, and DO NOT  eathe when you are doing the transfer, or better yet; use a mask.  I made a paper funnel, and when it was traveling from the larger bottle to the smaller bottle, it when into my nose, and I had a five minute sneeze attack.  (In fact, every time I use it I do.) I stored the larger bottle in a plastic bag, until I need to refill, and plan to wash the outside of the smaller bottle after each use, so no one else in the house gets hurt.          HOUSEHOLDS WITH PETS AND TEENAGERS:  Please watch out for your sneaky animals, that try to swipe your food off your table, it could hurt them and send them to the vet.  And watch out for teenagers with a bad sense of humor, it could hurt someone badly if they decide to play a joke on someone with this pepper.  Seriously.          Also, I guess I really am bad a math... this size will last me a lifetime!  It is a very great tasting pepper, smoky flavored, if you can get past the hot part!
