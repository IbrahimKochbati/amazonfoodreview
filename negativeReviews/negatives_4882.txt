Why aren't there more negative reviews on the site?  Greenies are known for the harm they've caused many dogs; just look it up to see for yourself.     Years ago, my Pomeranian died due to biting off a chunk of a Greenie bone and having it obstruct her intestine.     It was a painful and horrific death and I found out the same thing has happened to many other dogs to the fact that they are full of cellulose fiber.  There are many other types of teeth cleaning bones out there that WON'T seriously injure your dogs.  They're probably cheaper as well.
