This is a great product. Very comforting for owners that it is all natural (and mostly organic) with no by products and preservatives.          We gave our dog (a 7 year old lab mix) PetPromise before. After the transition it took a couple of days for her to get used to it, but once she did she loves it. My dog is quite picky about her food and she likes "junk food" better rather than wholesome food and treats (of course!). She is very used to Newman's own now and it gives her very good bowl movement. Always a plus!
