I put this in Bertolli's Extra Light Tasting Olive Oil and it was amazing!  I did cut the amount of seasoning just a smidge though.  Everyone loved it.  Not one of the ingredients is stronger than the others and you can taste them all.  I found this at a store that let you taste test all the Dean Jacob's Bread Dipping flavors and this was the best by far.
