A truly tasty medium heat paste that is delicious on a wide variety on food.  From mixing with yogurt for a dipping sauce to serving on eggs, mixed in with vegetables, or spread on sliced beef, this is excellent!  It has a slightly grainy texture from the ground spices, and has just the right amount of salt and garlic.          Delicious!  I ordered four more!
