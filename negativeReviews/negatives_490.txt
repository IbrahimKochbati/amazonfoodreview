Just got my teabags today, and the first bag I made tea with... the part of the teabag where the string is connected to the bag tore across the bag after seeping.  The bag remained intact though. The second bag, while unwrapping the teabag... the tag ripped the bag right open.          The tea tasted fine, not very strong like most other oolong teas.  The quality of the tea bag is like some flimsy material.  Two out of two  oke... I guess I need to be more careful with the others.
