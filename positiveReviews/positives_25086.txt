I put these on a Nordic Ware Beehive cake I baked for Rosh Hashanah last year for a centerpiece cake.  Everyone commented how cute the bees were.  I stuck some of them on toothpicks with a little cake frosting so some of them appeared to be flying around the hive.  I ordered them again for this year's apple cake centerpiece.  The bees face different directions so I put a pair in the doorway "kissing".  Beautiful addition to our holiday table.
