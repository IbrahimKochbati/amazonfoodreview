I despise low fat non fat dressings and would prefer to eat a salad plain rather than use them. In addition, I don't like Thousand Island at all. But these Walden Farms Dressings taste great and make a diet less monotonous.  My husband likes them too, and he always prefers the high calorie version of anything.
