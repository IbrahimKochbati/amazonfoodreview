I love this coffee, but will never buy it again. More than half of the cups tore open on the sides during  ewing   the foil cover pops open on the sides. The coffee spills out the sides, the coffee grounds end up in my coffee, it splatters all around the machine as it's dispensing. Very disappointing.
