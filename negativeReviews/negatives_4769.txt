Obviously, by looking at the other reviews people think this stuff is either really good or really bad. I think it is all according to your taste and what you are expecting for this price. I ordered packets from two different web sites and they both taste ok just like a frosty rich shake ordered from a drive thru window. It was ok but I wouldn't pay the price for it again. I found a recipe from the Serendipity 3 restaurant where you make your own Frozen Hot Chocolate by adding tiny bits of REAL chocolate, a bit of milk, cocoa,and some ice into a blender. I have a feeling that is the recipe that taste much more like what Oprah said was so good and more equivalent to what the restaurant actually serves. If you want more than just an expensive milkshake I would try the recipe using real chocolate and stay away from this drive thru milkshake mix.
