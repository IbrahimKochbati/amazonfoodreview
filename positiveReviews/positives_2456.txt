Not much to say. I ordered two large cans of "Chopped Clams" for some clam chowder that I will be making soon and they arrived in good condition and in a timely manner.           I have not opened them yet but will in Fe uary at my boss's home in the country. I will be making clam chowder in his kitchen with his wife's blessings. There will be a small group of us there and we will be shooting guns as part of the day's activities. I hope they like the clam chowder! Things could get ugly... L.O.L.
