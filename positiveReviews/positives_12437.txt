Coach's Oats are steel cut instead of rolled, which means they are are cut by steel blades instead of rolled flat; this process helps maintain more of the benefits of eating oatmeal. I eat oatmeal 4 or 5 days per week. However, the real benefit of Coach's Oats is that my wife likes them and is starting to eat more oatmeal.
