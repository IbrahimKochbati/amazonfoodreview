I used this a lot for white bean   chicken chili, chicken salad, fettuccine alfredo with chicken and mushrooms.  The flavor is very good, it's low fat, the sodium count isn't outrageous, and it works well with a lot of things.  Yes, I prefer using fresh chicken  east, but when I don't have any on hand or can't get to the store, this works very well.
