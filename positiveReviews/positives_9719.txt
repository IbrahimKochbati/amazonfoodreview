I was very pleased with the shake. I sometimes mixed it with water and rice milk. Based on the other reviews I went slowly so not to get too much fiber at once. I go easy with anything to change digestion. But it is really good. I eventually used less and mixed it with the hemp protein, since that has less flavor. Because of my LBS and low protein absorption I was having a difficult time finding the product for me. BUT THIS IS IT!!!!!!
