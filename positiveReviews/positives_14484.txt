I bought some of this stuff at Costco. Then I drank about 3 4 of an 8oz can before I went to Ballys.  Wow what a difference it made for me.  Up to now, I always would take an cytomax drink with me because I would get the sugar shakes and or have an energy lag or crash during my workout that the extra carbs in the drink would mitigate.  Anyway, I did not use one this day and I felt so energized that I swore that this product would be taken off the market for being too good.  I am 62 and I felt like this was a drink from the fountain of youth.  I did not get a low sugar crash even though I worked out longer and harder then I have for ages.  (I usually work out 2 or 3 times a week). While I was riding high during my workout I thought that I would pay an energy price later.  Nope! I was just energized the rest of the day and was able to sleep fine when I went to bed at night.  This stuff worked for me.
