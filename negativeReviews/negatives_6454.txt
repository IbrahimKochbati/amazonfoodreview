I tried really hard to like the product (it comes in a case of 12 after all) but I just could not take the taste. It looks like regular chili, has some fat like regular chili, has a texture like regular chili, and it almost tastes good, if you can get past the salt.          This is the second, and last, of this  and and type of veggie product I will try. They rely too much on salt to compensate for the perceived lack of flavor from real meat. A much better, IMHO, veggie chili can be made with some diced onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers, a hot chile of your choice, garlic, oregano, chili powder, a little masa, tomato paste, and one or more types of beans, like pintos, kidneys, mayo coba, etc. Just a pinch of salt and your done, or add your own meat or substitute if you have to.          I hope there are some vegetarians at the food bank.          Edit: I'll add that many canned foods tend to be a little salty to me, so we don't eat too many of them. I will say that compared to other canned chilis I have tried, vegetarian or not, this compared favorably. But, I can't take salt out of a prepared food whereas others can always add salt. This was the deal  eaker for me, as it is with other prepared, canned chilis.
