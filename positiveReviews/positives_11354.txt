I love Hunt's sugar free vanilla snack packs.  I frequently take a cup of raspberries or sliced strawberries and mix them with a pudding cup for a tasty, low calorie snack that keeps me satisfied between meals.  The cup itself is 60 calories and when paired with a cup of fruit you are looking at a 100 120 calorie snack. Each cup also has the equivalent of 10% of your daily calcium. It doesn't get much better than that.          Eaten alone, the flavor of the no sugar added cups is not as intense as the regular Hunt's pudding cups.  With my preferred way of eating the no sugar added cups, I don't even notice.          I like that these are shelf stable and can be left in an office drawer when the need for a snack hits.  They are a good treat for those who enjoy pudding and don't mind a flavor that is a little less intense than the regular Hunt's pudding cups.          It should be noted that most grocery stores carry the Hunt's snack packs for the equivalent of .25 a cup.
