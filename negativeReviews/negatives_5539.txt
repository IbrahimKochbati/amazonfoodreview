For much less than the buck per package it costs, you can easily make a tastier  eading.          The entire family gave this a 2 star rating (two adults and 3 kids).  There was not much flavor nor texture added to the pork chops.          It was certainly easy, but it doesn't take much to fix up your own  eading so saving an extra couple of minutes is not worth the lack of flavor in my opinion.          Unfortunately, I would not recommend this product and will likely stay away from other Shake 'N Bake products.
