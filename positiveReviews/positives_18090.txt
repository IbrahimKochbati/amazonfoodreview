We use Illy in both drip and espresso machines. Their darker roasts are wonderful, not bitter, and form a nice crema when used in our espresso machines.     Drink Illy any time of the day  use decaf at night as needed!          Do not feel pressured to buy whole beans and grind them every day. This ground coffee is great! The Illy canisters are vacuum sealed and have a long shelf life. Buy several at a time if you see a good price, and enjoy!
