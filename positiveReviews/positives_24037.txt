I love eating these chips. They have a nice nostalgic smell that reminded me of my old grandpa's butt when he walked by. Every time I eat these chips I feel like I am taking a whiff of the old codger's rear, and it  ings back memories. Sometimes I just open up a bag and deeply inhale the crotchety old aroma. Scottyboy and I eat these by the dozens, and I requested them so much that ol Scottyboy, who's in charge of snack purchases, bought these in bulk, which makes up for the week he bought ten boxes of edible strawberry underwear for the office.
