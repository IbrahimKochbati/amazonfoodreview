Personally, I loved the Quaker Oatmeal cookies. But, I usually eat healthier cookies, so I don't know if that makes a difference or not. To me, they had a great oatmeal and chocolate taste. They were soft and chewy. Also, they are easy to take places, because they are individually wrapped. They are pretty big cookies, so they will be a great on the go snack. I would recommend them, as I thought they were really tasty.
