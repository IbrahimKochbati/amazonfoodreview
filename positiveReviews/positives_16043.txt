After reading some of the customer reviews, I was worried that these biscuits would arrive all crumbled and close to the expiration date.  To my great delight, we have opened two of the six packages we ordered, and they are fresh, crisp and DELICIOUS.  They have a use by date of December 2012, and they will be long gone before then. I always used to buy these when I was in England and haven't found them here except at outrageous prices. By combining these with one other item, I got free shipping.  Really worth it.  Having these Rich Tea Biscuits really  ings back wonderful memories of teatime in London, and we were enjoying them today on an unusually cold and rainy day with a huge "cuppa" British Blend tea.  Yum!
