I thought this is a pretty good food, and a great value for the money. As the previous review stated, it contains a bit too much grains and byproducts.     I was really surprised by the kibble size. It's too big! I thought first I received dog food by mistake; re read the label   no, that's cat food. Wow, way too large for my cats' little mouths. They seem to have fun with it, though   crunching on the pieces (good teeth cleaner at the same time?).          However, as two of my cats can be considered seniors, I will have to switch to a different food, something with smaller bits, to make it easier for them.
