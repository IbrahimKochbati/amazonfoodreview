Green Mountain Hazelnut Decaf is one of my favorite K Cups out there. It's amazing! I love the smooth taste, it's a great cup of coffee that goes down easily. I'm not a fan of really strong coffee's, nor strong flavored coffee but this is just right. It gives you a perfect balance of flavoring & coffee.
