These Piquillos are packaged in a thin plastic package, though I thought from the picture that they were packed in a roll top tin (like sardines are packed in).The peppers that survived the shipping were very good, lightly roasted and with good tangy flavor. However, one of the packages was damaged in shipment and leaked red oil all over the rest of the packs, making a huge mess.
