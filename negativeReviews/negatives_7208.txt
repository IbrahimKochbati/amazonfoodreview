I bought these for my 100 lb lab shepherd mix and the first one he got out within 5 minutes.  I takes me about 10 minutes to get the stupid things in! I have to use a screwdriver to get it in the ball.  Unless I have the time to get the large and medium ones in the toys, it's not worth the trouble.  If my lab mix can't get the treat out, he tends to give up and leave it for our smaller dog to just lick.  Wish there was an easier way to get the treats in if anyone knows of one, please let me know!
