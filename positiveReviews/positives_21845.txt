Best on the market! I give it 6 stars. If you want good fajitas similar to the Mexican restaurants in Texas, this is it!! I've tried many different  ands but the Figaro Fabulosa Fajita marinade is definately the best. I've even had a dinner party and served fajitas and everyone loved them   no leftovers.
