The Switch Kiwi Berry is very sweet, but tastes much better than the Orange Tangerine or the Black Cherry. It has a nice refreshing flavor though it's still not something I would buy.          Ranking the Switch drinks from best to worst:          1. Watermelon Strawberry     2. Kiwi Berry     3. Black Cherry     4. Orange Tangerine
