I think that Kelloggs Frosted Mini wheats is absolutely wonderful because it's sweet and because it's filling.  I have it every morning. It is so full of fiber that it makes for a  eakfast that will stick with you for a morning free of cravings.  The best part of the 58.8 size of Kellogs Frosted Mini Wheats is that it has two complete bags of cereal inside.  Love it!
