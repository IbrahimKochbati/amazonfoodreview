If I want to make Bear Creek Soups I put them in the crock pot to cook on low for 8 hours and get wonderful results.  For the Chili I add 1 can of green chili and diced tomato and a can of tomato paste with a couple of soup can's of water, I think I used 4.  I also added some precooked hamburger and red pepper as well.  Great thing is you can add what you like and this soup tastes great and you can make it thicker or soupier what ever you desire.  I took it to a pot luck and it was gone in no time.  I am a repeat buyer of this mix and will purchasing more in the near future.
