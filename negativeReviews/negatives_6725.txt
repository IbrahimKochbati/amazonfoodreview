These bars are tasty. Recently, many  ands of health bars have come out with chunks of fruits and nuts glued together with a sticky sweetener, such as aguave syrup, honey or evaporated cane juice. KIND Bars are not exceptional among these bars, and all of these types of snacks are very good in my experience.          What makes KIND Bars different is that a portion of the profits is directed to the PeaceWorks Foundation, which is a charity that supports peace in the Middle East. By "peace in the Middle East," they mean support for the "Palestinian Resistance" againgst the Israeli "occupation." This charity is considered centrist, and it rejects extremism, which it finds to be ineffective.          Executive Manager of the PeaceWorks Foundation, Fathi Mohamed Hamdan Darwish, had this to say about the strategy of driving Israel into the Sea: "That solution is unrealistic and ineffective and can't be realized. We as a Palestinian people have historically paid the price of hundreds of thousands of martyrs and injured people and haven't reached this solution."
