Decent product at a decent price.  I started using extra virgin olive oil for most of my cooking now because it helps lower cholesterol.  Plus it has no bad effects on your body, unlike certain veg oil or even lard (which I can't  ing myself to use anymore).          Tastes good mixed with spices on  ead, or even to fry up a steak with!
