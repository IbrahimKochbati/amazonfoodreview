My daughter absolutely used to love the original version of the Chick Chick baby food (with Chicken, Sweet Potatoes, and Brown Rice). Unfortunately, the recipe has apparently just been updated (though not reflected on Amazon's page as of 2 24 2012) to include totally different ingredients (except for the chicken). Now my daughter absolutely refuses to eat this product. The consistency and flavor seem to have drastically changed. Hopefully your child will enjoy the new blend, but I wanted to provide a warning for those of you that may have tried the other version...
