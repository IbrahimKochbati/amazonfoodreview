being a coffee addict for years and being told I had to stop not only drinking caffeine but also I needed a acid free option I found this to be an excellent choice.     I drink it like I used to drink regular caffeinated coffee.  Don't get me wrong the caffeine withdrawls were no fun, but I really do feel great.
