As the other 1 star review said, this was received as ONLY ONE 58.8 ounce size box, despite the product features section stating specifically that the product is "Pack of two, 58.8 ounce(total of 117.6 ounce)."  However, after complaining to Amazon customer service they did refund me half the purchase price. In any case, only 1 star because it was not as advertised.          For a better deal, I recommend Frosted Mini Wheats Bite Size Cereal, 18 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4).  It is a better price per ounce than this even if I had received both bags as advertised.
