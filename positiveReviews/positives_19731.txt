I've tried all flavors of Primal Spirit Vegan Jerky and the Mesquite Lime is my personal favorite, but it depends on your taste. If you're a fan of limes as I am, you'll love this flavor. Its a bit tart. It is also a very tender texture as compared with the others. The Hot and Spicy flavor is my second favorite. It has the toughest texture which is closest to regular jerky and is the only one made from mostly mushrooms. It is a bit spicy if you never eat spicy foods!
