I bought this for my last birthday, thanks to a gift card I was sent.  I should say that for it's price, this is a perfectly decent  and of white truffle oil.  I use it for making omelets, sauteing vegetables and even as an ingredient for salad dressings.  If you like a garlicky white truffle flavor, this is a good  and and can even make a good gift, depending upon your budget.          There is a bit of confusion.  When I read about this on line, it says it is an infusion.  Other places both on line and by the manufacturers say it is "truffle essence."  There is a world of difference between these two things.  An infusion is easily the best way to try truffle oils, truly meaning that genuine truffles were infused with a high quality olive oil.  An "essence", on the other hand, generally means it's been made to taste of white truffles, perhaps even using very synthetic methods.  This  and could be both and as a general rule I trust Urbani products.  Still, for a simple and less expensive oil used for general cooking, this is good for its price point.  I would generally recommend a truffle salt (with truffle shavings) for a more authentic truffle experience.
