I have long known that if my dogs had to rank their love for treats against their love for me, I'd probably rank first.....but it would be close.  And then we discovered the CET chews.  Not only would the CET chews win over me, my dogs would not hesitate to sell me in exchange for them.          Every dog in our extended family is addicted.  I think they lace them with something.  Put them up against a regular rawhide and there is no contest.  We all gave each other chews as gifts for Christmas.  (Which in retrospect was dumb, we could have just kept them and saved on shipping...but who knew?)          They do work for teeth cleaning by the way.  I have one dog, a rescue, who has some damaged teeth (one  oken, others degraded).  He came to me that way.  I've had them cleaned by the vet more than once but since we've discovered a heart murmur sedating him for a cleaning is no longer an option.  The CET chews have helped.  His teeth are still not great, but there is a noticable improvement in the amount of gunk.  My other dog has nice mostly white teeth and the chews have really helped keep them that way.          These were also wholeheartedly approved by my vet.          And one last benefit...if you want your dog out from under foot for a few minutes these are also handy for that.  I do use them occasionally when I need some quiet or am feeling like there are just too many german shepherds in the house crowding me.  They happily take them to the back yard and chew away quietly.          So big thumbs up here (or paws up, or dew claws up or....you know what I mean)
