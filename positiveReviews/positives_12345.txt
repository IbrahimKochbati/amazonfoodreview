I discovered pickled okra (another  and) in a local store, but haven't found it again.  After developing a craving, I finally went to Amazon and found several  ands.  There can be an enormous variation in taste and texture in this kind of product and went with Tabasco out of faith in the  and.  For $2.50 for a 12 oz. jar, the price is more than reasonable.  Tastes great.  Just crunchy enough, but the $7+ shipping makes the total cost at least $4.00 over comparable product if available here.  An included $1.00 coupon took a little off the pain.          I sure liked the taste, but total cost outweighs value.          I'll try a similar product with cheaper shipping and hope for luck of the draw good taste.
