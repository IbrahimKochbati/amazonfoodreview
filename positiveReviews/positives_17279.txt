For any of you tea lovers out there, this  and of Chai has got to be the best.  FORGET Starbucks!  There is so much flavor bursting out of that tiny little bag, you wonder how they packed it all in.  I've even attempted to make my own chai, figuring hey, if it's fresh, it's better.  Not so here.  The only thing that compares is German Fruchte tee (which is so much better than American herbal teas) that engulfs the water with red juice the moment you touch hot water to the tea bag.  Definately worth buying in bulk.
