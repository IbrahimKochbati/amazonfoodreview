If what you are looking for is raisins and peanuts, the Emerald Hartmony Raisinberry Nut trail mix is fine. There are plenty of good quality peanuts and raisins in each package (9 oz.). But don't buy this if you really want cranberries, almonds or cashews, because there are very few of these treats. The yogurt covered raisins are very sweet. My carton was delivered on a sunny September day and when I opened the psckage 90 minutes after taking the carton out of the sun, the yogurt raisins were still melted.
