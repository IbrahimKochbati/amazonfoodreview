Hershey has closed their Reading, PA plant and moved the production of York Peppermint Patties (along with other candies) to MEXICO. Although cutting thousands of US jobs and moving to another country evidently hasn't  ought the price down, just the quality (and probably safety) of the product. Look for Pearson's Mint Patties instead, they're still MADE IN THE USA, and they're usually cheaper as well.
