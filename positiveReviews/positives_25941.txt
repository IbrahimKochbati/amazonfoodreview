These aren't available in stores where I live, but I ordered a case after reading rave reviews about Booty on this website. I am now addicted, and so is my four year old. He absolutely loves it, and I love that it isn't as unhealthy as what he normally grabs from the grocery store shelf. This is a light snack that is full of cheesy flavor, and it doesn't make a mess on our hands. If we're not careful, we can eat almost an entire bag at one sitting    it's that good. I've ordered it several times since 'discovering' it.          Now    if only it was available on auto delivery!
