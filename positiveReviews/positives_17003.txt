Was surprised to read some folks lost this to their power chewers.  Our Brittany, Husker, is a MegaChewer and has been loving this thing for months.  It shows no signs of wear and tear, even after he carries it around several times a day.  Our Golden Retriever, Gennie, will follow him around and help with "clean up", so she loves it, too!          Why not five stars?  It's a bit difficult for those with grip problems to load the kibble treats in the bottle and keep it from falling out.  Would make more sense if the part that screwed off was at the end with the hole rope spikey rubbery thingey.
