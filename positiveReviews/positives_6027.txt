Sure, this rawhide is expensive at 5 6 dollars per rawhide.  However, it is excellent quality (many rolls very tightly rolled) and takes my GSD hours to go through one.  For reference, he can eat a thick bully stick in 5 minutes and a Himalayan Dog Chew in 30 minutes.  For the time spent chewing per dollar, these rawhides are a deal!  I also love that my dogs can't get big chunks off, so even though I keep an eye on them I have very little fear of choking.
