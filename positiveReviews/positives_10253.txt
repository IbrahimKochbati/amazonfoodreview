This product is sturdy and well made.  The portion is perfect. It has a lid which keeps food clean and easy to stack. I have one in orange as well as green.  My baby is 11 months now.  I wish I would have purchased more in different colors but I got by with freezing and storing in freezer bags.  I think I can reuse Beaba freezer trays after I stop making baby food.
