I was drawn in to this  and by all the advertising and great reviews. However it did not work well for my dog. This food gave my puppy the worst diarrhea. It is hard enough to potty train her as it is and then I had to deal with her not being able to control her #2. I do care about what goes into my pets because they are like family so I wish that this food did not cause the gastro  problems. So I started feeding her a  and that people dismiss as inferior (Science Diet). I have two other pets who have eaten Science Diet since I got them and they are 16 and 12 years old. So they must be doing something right.
