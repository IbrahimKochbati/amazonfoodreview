I first had sunflower oil when I was in Germany 2 years ago when my roommate at the time made me potatoes and drizzled a little oil over. Since then I had been looking for sunflower oil in markets but to no success. I finally decided to buy it online and it's just as I remember it. So delicious, and it  ings back so many great memories.
