I was very excited when the Tug a Jug arrived.  I was looking for new toys to keep my 1 1 2 yr old Lhasa busy.  This did keep her busy.  It kept her busy trying to get at the treats that she could see and smell without any reward.  The treats only come out when I turn it upside down and play with the rope.  I felt bad watching her trying to get the treats, and she tried so hard for such a long time. There is no way she would be able to turn it upside down.  It is also SO loud.  We had to take it off her the first day because my husband and I could not hear each other talking!  It was a waste of money. We will stick with Kong dispensers.
