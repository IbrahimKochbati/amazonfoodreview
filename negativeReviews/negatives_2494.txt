I was very disapointed with these flowers. Several of the  stargazer buds were damaged, as if they had been frozen, and several others are such that they will not  open very well, although there is still time for them to improve perhaps. But, the number of flowers for the money was wholly inadequate. On the  ight side, the Iris' are blooming nicely and are beautiful. Based on the condition of the stargazers, and the inadequate number of stems,however,  i do not think I will order from this company again
