After taking my first sip of Switch Orange Tangerine, I raised a suspicious eye ow because it didn't taste the way I expected it to. Then it dawned on me that my mouth was prepared for more of a fake, amped up "Orange" soda, but what I was tasting was real, natural juice. Yes, I knew that from the label, but that's not the same as experiencing it.          The taste was a nice blend of orange and tangerine, not too sweet, and the carbonation adds a nice touch. A bit like a non alcoholic Mimosa cocktail.          My only reservation is that the calorie count is (perhaps unavoidably) too high for me to drink this on a regular basis   though let me be quick to point out that this is a "no sugar added" product. For those who aren't counting calories, a nice refreshing "Switch" from soft drinks!
