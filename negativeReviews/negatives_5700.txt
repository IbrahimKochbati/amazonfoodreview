This is a ketchup I've been really looking forward to trying. Having read the reviews, here and elsewhere, there is pretty good agreement about its merits. Depending on where you look, some people concentrate on its similarity to Heinz, while others talk about how different it is. Here on Amazon, a lot of reviewers feel it's similar to Heinz, some even say it's the same. I expected it to be comparable. It isn't, except that both are good.          The difference is in the taste and consistency. The taste of Heinz is much more aggressive than Organicville. You could say it has more zing or kick. I'd imagine its vinegar and sugar content is pretty high. The consistency of Heinz is thicker, and yet smoother, sort of like paint. The Organicville feels lighter, and looks "grainier", though it is smooth, of course. It looks more "natural", while Heinz has a processed, technicolor look.          Neither is better than the other. They're two different animals. Having said that, I'm not sure I like the Organicville, at least on the hamburger I tested it on. I also tried it plain. So while I seemed to be enjoying the new and different taste and texture, and letting myself adjust to the more laid back material, by the last bit of my burger I wasn't dipping it in  and enjoyed that better.          Rating the item is actually easier than I thought. One star means "I hate it", two stars means "I don't like it". I certainly don't hate it, and I wouldn't say I actively dislike it. Five stars means "I love it", four stars means "I like it". I don't love it and I really can't say I like it, leaving 3 stars or "It's OK". I think it's better than ok. But somehow, it doesn't grab me.
