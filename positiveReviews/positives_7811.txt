I was surprised at how well the rinds "popped," and didn't have any difficulties as other reviewers did.  I made sure that I unfolded the package (it's folded into three just like a microwave popcorn pack), unbent the folds so that the product could move between the three areas, then I shook it vigorously several times, trying to distribute the contents somewhat evenly throughout the bag.  Two minutes in my microwave (1100 Watts, but 10 years old) is perfect, and virtually all rinds pop every time.          This is a low fat product, so it isn't nearly as tasty as the supermarket pork rinds you may have tried.  One could easily eat an entire package, although there are three servings per bag, but you will pay the consequences in terms of salt intake and MSG overload.  The MSG triggered a migraine for me, so now I don't eat it frequently, and make sure I only consume half a bag at most.  When I get near the bottom of the bag, where the most salt and MSG ends up, I try to  ush off as much as I can.          Still, a good snack option for those with blood sugar sensitivities.  Zero carbs is always good! The only reason for my 4 star review is that the amount of MSG per bag seems to be pretty high, and that's not disclosed on the product's Amazon page.
