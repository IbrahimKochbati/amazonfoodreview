Wrigleys' 5 FLARE sugarless gum is Wrigleys' sugarless replacement for their "Big Red" cinnamon gum. 5 flare seems to be difficult to find in stores. Thanks to Amazon I always have a supply. 5 FLARE is also the longest lasting gum I have ever experienced both in flavor and durability. It is positively the best cinnamon flavor currently on the market.
