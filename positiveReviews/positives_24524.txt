Purchased this item to bake with and was hesitant to order due to the negative reviews of dented cans with packaging.  I went ahead and ordered, received free shipping and the whole case was delivered DENT FREE.  The entire case of pumpkin was bubble wrapped and then enclosed in a box.  The taste of the product is great, a little less dense than the usual Libby's I have baked with in the past.  Will definitely purchase again.
