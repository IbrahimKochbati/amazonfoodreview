We are a household who once held peanut butter near and dear, but due to my youngest child's peanut tree nut allergies we can no longer have any peanut butter in the house.  It has also severely limited the type of bars we can buy.  However, Enjoy Life's Sunflower Bars fill the bill! We all love them!  They are perfect for lunches and for snacks.
