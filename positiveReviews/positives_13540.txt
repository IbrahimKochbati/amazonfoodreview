I have never been a believer in any herbal teas until a coworker gave me a mug of BREATHE DEEP tea with honey last winter when I was coughing a lot.  Even one sip  ought relief to my throat and by the time I had finished the mug, the coughing was over and done with.  I immediately went on a search for the product and finally found it in the gourmet section of a local grocery.  Then, I found it on Amazon... and a LOT less expensive!  BREATHE DEEP tea has not only helped me with my respiratory issues (asthma,  onchitis, chronic sinus congestion, etc.), I've shared it with family members and friends who are also amazed at what one cup of BREATHE DEEP tea can do.  I'm getting ready to order my supply for the upcoming winter.  I do NOT want to be caught without this in the cupboard.
