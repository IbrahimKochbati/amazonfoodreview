Tartaric acid and cream of tartar are not the same thing. Cream of tartar is made from tartaric acid. It is a weak salt derived from tartaric acid, when it is half neutralized with potassium hydroxide.          In most home recipes that call for tartaric acid can substitute 2 tsp cream of tartar for 1tsp tartaric acid. But if you are buying tartaric acid, you are not looking for cream of tartar and the seller should not label cream of tartar as tartaric acid.
