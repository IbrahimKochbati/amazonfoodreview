I order these on a yearly basis for my gluten intolerant girlfriend.          Pros:     She loves these, which can be tough to do because she still remembers her pre gluten free days     They are easy to make (although she has me make them most of the time because I never over mix them, her's always have a cake consistency)     Well priced on Amazon, unlike in most stores          The girlfriend is so impressed with Pamela's products, she has subscribed to the monthly newsletter and received countless recipes we love (e.g., gluten free crepes).
