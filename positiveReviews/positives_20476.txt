After trying Rescue Remedy for our pup while on a flight to Europe, tried this product the second time and it actually worked!  Very happy and there are absolutely no side effects.  Out dog weighs 9lbs and stayed alert when addressed, but also remained very calm and relaxed on the 14 hour flight from Europe.
