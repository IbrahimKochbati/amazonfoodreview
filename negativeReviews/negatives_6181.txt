I purchased this coffee to replace my Lavazza because Lavazza quality has been inconsistent.  Upon opening, I noticed no date on the package... concerning.  I tuned my Vario grinder to ensure the correct grind for this new bean.  I pulled a shot of espresso (I have an Andreja Premium from QuickMill)... Horrible.  I adjusted the grind three more times with as many shots.  The shots were consistently watery, bitter, and, quite frankly, embarrassing.  DO NOT purchase this product.  I will use these beans to pull throw away shots after cleaning my grinder and espresso machine... that's all they are good for.
