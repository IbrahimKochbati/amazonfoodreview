I don't usually drink buy instant coffee, but since I got a sample of these I had no reason to not try it. It is very quick, empty the packet in a mug, add 6 ounces of hot water and stir. In a standard coffee mug, 6 ounces is slightly over half a cup so that was a little disappointing. The flavor was not the best but if you are really jonesing for a cup of coffee and don't have a lot of time or don't want to  ew a whole pot, it will do the trick.
