Before I bought these on Amazon, I had bought them locally for about $2 more a box. A lot of money for crackers! But I thought they were a lot like Ritz crackers and liked them. I tried getting them from Amazon because it seemed like a better price. After I ordered them, I read the reviews that said a lot of the crackers were  oken and was a little nervous. Fortunately, that turned out to not be a problem for me. A few of them were  oken, but I've had that same problem buying them in a local store. All in all, a very good deal!
