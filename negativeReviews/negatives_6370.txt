BUYERS BEWARE   I guess it's my fault I really thought when I ordered this coffee I was gettinng TWO BOXES of coffee for 22.50 like almost every other coffee dealer on Amazon sells this stuff for. But this guy sells this coffee for 22.50 for ONE!!!!! box of coffee.When it arrived at my house I asked my wife where the other box was and she said: "Thats It just one box arrived!" I looked my order over and sure enough he does sell it for 1 box of coffee for 22.50 making this probably the MOST expensive k cup coffee on Amazon. So shame on me for not looking the order over before I purchased it. If you look at all the other sellers, their coffee is 23.00 for TWO BOXES OF 25 count k cups. Thats 50 k cups. This guy only gives you 25 k cups for 22.50 which is EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE!!!!! congratulations you fooled me, but I hope this review warns others off.
