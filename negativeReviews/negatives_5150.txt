My puppy is under 40 pounds, and loved this toy.  He chewed the rope apart in one day.  Well, I unscrewed the bottom and inserted a golf ball.  It did the job of the rope and made it tough to shake out the treats.  Kept the pup occupied for two hours.  Then he figured out that tossing the bottle would shake loose the treats.  the plastic bottle cracked in minutes.          This would be an excellent toy if the plastic was tougher.  the design is great, especially with the ball addition.
