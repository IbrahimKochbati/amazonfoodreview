I visited the theo chocolate factory in Seattle and fell in love with this chocolate bar.  It is the purest chocolate around, they do not remove any of their cocoa butter, and replace with fake emulsifiers.  I love the combination of salt, hazelnuts and chocolate.  I get one of these everytime I can.  It is a little expensive, but so worth it for pure chocolate.  The salt might scare you at first, but it combines perfectly with the chocolate.  Love this!
