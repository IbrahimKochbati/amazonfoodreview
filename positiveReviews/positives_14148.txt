My Maggie L I V E S for Her Treatie Time          Every evening, after the dogs have eaten and played outside until bedtime, it turns into "Treatie Time." Both of my girls, Lucille and Maggie, are allowed two treats, or sometimes three each if they really beg. They have to sit or down or do something special to "earn" their treatie, but it's a special time for us.          I value my dog's health, as I'm sure you do. I want them to live a long time and have a trouble free existence   no scratchy skin allergies, etc. Therefore, I've explored using organic treats, and have even purchased some expensive ones from a local dog bakery. I must tell you that the "girls" were underwhelmed with those treats. Despite their healthy ingredients.          Therefore, when I was approached to review the new  and of organic treats for Barksters, I was ambivalent. Organic treats haven't been very well received in my household in the past, but I was game to try them again.          I believe in organic treats, but if the girls don't eat them, it's really money down the drain. Especially since we're not depending upon the treats for total nutrition, I'm also concerned with treats being of the the low calorie variety. I was horrified to learn that one of the standard biscuit y treats contained over 500 calories in each one. That's terrible.          As I opened the two packages of Barksters, one was Sweet Potato and Chicken Krisps and the other was Brown Rice and Beef Krisps, I was glad to see two things on the packaging:          1.The treats are made in the good ole' U.S. of America. This is important, especially because of the recent pet deaths from pet food manufactured in China.          2.The treats are wheat free and gluten free.          The second is most important for my "grand dog" Dutchy, the Siberian Husky. Ever since he's been a pup he's struggled with digestive issues. Our vet recommended that he have a gluten free diet, which has helped him tremendously. We don't want to ruin his digestion with treats.          As we spent the afternoon on the deck on a steamy Georgia Sunday afternoon, I  oke out the two types of treats to see what the doggy reactions would be. I was surprised to see that the treats reminded me of rice cakes   very puffy   and wafer like, instead of a biscuit. And, I must say that they were both a great hit with all the dogs. They couldn't get enough of them.          The wafers tended to  eak, but that allowed me to give smaller treats more often to the group. They didn't mind if it was  oken in two, that just meant two treats   Bonus!          The treats cost approximately $10 per box which contained 5 ounces, which seems pricey. But, since it's a "luxury" item, I can go with the price. I was pleasantly surprised at how much the dogs liked these treats, especially since they didn't look like the ones they're used to getting for their "treatie time."          I'd highly recommend that you try Barksters!
