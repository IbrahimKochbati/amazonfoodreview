I had been waiting for my regular coffee to become available again (Jet City Whole Bean Espresso), when I received one container as a gift and  ewed it in my drip coffee maker just as it came out of the package.          I was pleasantly surprised by this coffee.  I had no real expectations that it would be any good.     It was better than most commercial Mainstream coffee, but nothing to rave about.          Then I decided to run this ground coffee through my Capresso Conical Burr Grinder (with it set to the finest grind), and lo and behold this coffee was transformed into a pretty damn good cup of coffee. I purchased a pack of 6 and it is the best commercial coffee I have ever used.          While I prefer my Whole Bean Jet City, this coffee is far more than just acceptable.          So, if your regular coffee is not available, try this one and Grind it on Fine and give it a try.  It will hold you over until your favorite is available and the price was not bad at all.
