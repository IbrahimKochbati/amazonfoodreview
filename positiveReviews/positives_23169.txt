Iv'e tried a few different gluten free  eads and they all left a LOT to be desired.  I ate them only because I hadn't stumbled across this  and of  ead mix yet.  When I did, I really liked it and then I ordered it by the 6 pak.  I've made, plain, cheese and cinnaman in my  eadmaker and have enjoyed them all.  I do have to hold myself back from slicing off the first warm piece and loading it with butter.  Other then that I have NO complaints.
