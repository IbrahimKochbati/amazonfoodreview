The label says "Go Lean," but it should say "Go Diabetic" instead. According to the nutritional information, one cup of cereal has 15g of sugar, which is almost 1 4 of the total package! I had one of these for  eakfast and it gave me a headache because of the excessive amount of sugar. This is not cereal, it's candy disguised as  eakfast food.
