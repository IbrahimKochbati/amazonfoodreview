I don't like strong coffee but this is so weak and watery, it's like drinking...something other than coffee. I tried  ewing a small size, using a different size cup, adjusting my cream and sugar, nothing works! It's really disappointing because I've had other good blends from Green Mountain in the past. I'll stick with Wolfgang Puck's Rodeo Drive or Breakfast In Bed.
