I eat a lot of cereal, and that includes a lot of the high fiber kinds. Oatmeal, Mini (Frosted) Shredded Wheat and Raisin Bran are usually what I'd eat when I needed to lose a few lbs., but there have been a few instances where I tried the "healthier" options. I've tried several of the Kashi cereals, but they weren't very appetizing. The plain one had a cardboard taste. Next, I tried Grape Nuts, which is like a horrendous yeast flavored cat food (though it's closer to kitty litter in texture.) That  ings me to FiberPlus Antioxidants.          This Berry Yogurt Crunch is certainly one of the better tasting high fiber cereals I've eaten. It's like a decent health bar  oken apart into cereal. The clusters of yogurt really help, but even the plain cereal is decent enough on its own. Yes, there are 12g of Sugar per serving, but the 10g of Fiber and 170 Calorie parts more than make up for it. Especially if you compare it to Raisin Bran and Frosted Shredded Wheat, which are typically higher in Sugar and Calories, yet lower in dietary fiber. The antioxidants are a nice bonus, too.          The bottom line is that I'll add this to my grocery list whenever it's on sale or the price is right.
