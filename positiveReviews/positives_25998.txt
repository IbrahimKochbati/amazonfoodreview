I originally bought this on a whim after reading several positive reviews about it (that, and it was on sale).  This stuff is wonderful.  My kids actually prefer Pirate's Booty to Cheetos ("can we please have the healthy Cheetos instead?")  coming from my kids, that's saying something.          It's a much better alternative to Cheetos (and cheaper as well).  I love this stuff!  And if you're trying to count calories, two big handfuls of this (which equals 1 serving) go a lot further than a serving of Doritos or an equivalent.  I've actually given bags of this to friends  family, and they always want to know where I bought it from!  Great snack!
