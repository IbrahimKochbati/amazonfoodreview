This "Wonderful Bread Mix" makes pretty good  ead, but it takes a while to really appreciate it.  I can tell that's it's wheat free, but it really isn't bad compared to other  ead mixes.  The pizza crust recipe on the back made absolutely FABULOUS pizza!! I couldn't get enough!! I don't buy the mix for the  ead so much as for the pizza.  You can't even tell it's wheat free!!  I will definitely buy this product again and I highly  recommend it to people with wheat or gluten allergies.
