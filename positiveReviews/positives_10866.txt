We have a couple of small dogs and for them the treats are to big. We  eak them down to smaller pieces and that's not easy because the treats are hard.  One dog likes them a lot and the other so so.  We always feed our dogs all natural foods(they love cooked vegetables) so Newman's Organics were just what we wanted.  Recommended if you have medium to large dogs.
