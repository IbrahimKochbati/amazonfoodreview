The wife comes home from work, goes into the kitchen and suddenly i hear "oh my god.. these are soooo good. get more of these at the store!!" i go in and see that she had torn open one of these and gobbled it down.          i told her i got from amazon, and that these were gluten free... to which she replied with a dropped jaw. shes a choc a holic for sure but even those taste buds have limitations.          she said it was a great even taste.. not really artificial flavors and said they were perfect size for her purse to grab on the way out the door or for just keeping at her work desk.          all in all.. i guess i will have to get em again!
