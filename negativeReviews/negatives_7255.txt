These treats are much smaller than I thought they would be, and they only lasted a few seconds with my dogs. For the price, I could have bought a whole bag of treats and the dogs would have gotten the same enjoyment. I gave them two stars only because my dogs did seem to like the taste. But then, they're not exactly picky.
