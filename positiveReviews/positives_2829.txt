We have two Great Danes and it is very hard for us to keep the weight on them.          EVO is the first dog food that both of them enjoys.  I dearly enjoy not having to chase them down and make sure that they eat.          I have also notice that our older Dane is more active since he has been eating EVO. We feed them a mixture of the Innova EVO Red Meat and Innova EVO Large Bite Dry Dog Food.
