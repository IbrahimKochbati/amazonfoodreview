Our cat is enthusiastic about the taste of these fish flavored Petite Cuisine meals. (I'll try to post a video review also.) However, this assortment has tuna in two thirds of the flavors. From research online, it seems doubtful that it's good for cats to eat much tuna    so these are better for occasional treats than for a steady diet. One site even warns that cats can get addicted to the taste of tuna (even though it's not healthy for them) and refuse other food.          To cap it all off, tonight my roommate didn't realize it was cat food, and split a can of Petite Cuisine Snapper as part of tonight's dinner for the two of us. On the plate it looked like a little side dish, and I figured it was some kind of leftover. For what it's worth, it tasted fine. However, we plan to feed the rest of the samples to the cat.
