Yeah, I'm a guy. Just because I'm a guy doesn't mean I can't want smooth, hydrated skin. I bought this stuff on a whim. I love it! The scent is light, so as not to overpower. And it does make you feel a little cooler, as well as hydrated. I am no longer dry and itchy after a shower! I combined this stuff with a bodyscrub  ush...WOW!
