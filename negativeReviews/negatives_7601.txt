I grew up drinking Hibiscus most of my life. Of course there are many kinds of hibiscus with different flavors. The good ones usually great deep red clear drink with some acidity and a nice mild distinguished aroma. This hibiscus looks great from the moment you open the package. It is clean small flattened flower individual leafs.  The first thing I noticed is the absence of the hibiscus aroma. It smells like an old black tea that has been opened for long time.            Now for the drink, once added to boiling water, the drink looks good. It has a nice deep red color and the drink is clear.... Now for the taste: There was no taste what so ever. Juts a little acetic taste and that's it.            The drink has the expected effect of making your body getting rid of excess water but I couldn't enjoy it as a drink at all. I had to add more of the hibiscus with a lot of sugar to create a drinkable drink.... Well, that's not what I expect from hibiscus drink. I would give it only one star just because of the flavor. I am going to increase it to two stars because I used it as a tea additive to give a nice acetic flavor and the anti oxidants.            My explanation of the lack of flavor is that they picked the younger hibiscus flowers that have the deep color and acidity but didn't develop the real hibiscus taste yet.  Or maybe they dried it fast in machines that caused it to loose flavor. But looking at the leaves and how thin they are makes me think that is the first one.            I tried other Hibiscus products from Amazon and there were some really good ones.
