From reading all the amazing reviews, I expected it to taste better than it did. I love regular peanut butter, so I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up. I think if you manage your expectations about taste, this is a good purchase to ease your PB tooth! It works best mixed with some regular PB and in recipes (versus eating it plain or on a sandwich). Def worth a try!
