I ordered because of the great price....BUT yuck the stock is stale .     Tastes like old iced ted left in the fridge toooo long.     Not my first yogi tea flavor and not my first box of detox , so know it is not supposed to taste like this. Worst part that is the one I ordered the most of :} Others seem fine so far :}
