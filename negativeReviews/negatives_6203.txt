This is the third Tasty Bite entree I've tried and the first I've been truly disappointed in.  The picture on the box is very misleading as the actual product is much soupier with much less solid substance.  Also, the taste of salt completely overpowers the taste of the lentils.  I like the convienence of the packages and the nutrition so I'll probably try other Tasty Bite entrees   but not this one again!
