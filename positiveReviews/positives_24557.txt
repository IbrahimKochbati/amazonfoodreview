This is the best pumpkin available    if you are using it for your dogs or yourself. I have two dogs with issues    one is older and has a little trouble with upset tummy from time to time, and the other was on prescription food    but this product fixed all that.          Now they can eat the same food as the dogs with no issues    and they all love it! That is a nice plus    if you are worrying that your dogs won't eat pumpkin, I will be surprised if they don't eat this. My pickiest dog thinks it is wonderful.          I also eat some of it myself, because I read somewhere that it is good for humans too, and I like the flavor. However, I didn't try to bake anything with it, so I can't say if it makes good pie or pumpkin  ead . . .          When I read the reviews, I was a little worried about getting dented cans, but mine were fine    no dents at all, and nicely packaged in a box.          Five stars and two thumbs up from me    your experience may vary . . .
