As with Thomas Wolfes' theme in the novel "You Can't Go Home Again", attempts to relive youthful memories will always fail.  Just as these Broadway Rolls have for me.  If you are looking for a very tart strawberry flavor and gummy consistency, then this is your kind of licorice.  If you are looking for the subtle taste and firmer texture of the original Delfa Roll you had when you were a kid, forget it.  This will disappoint you.  Obviously, there was some demand for the company to attempt to  ing it back, but if they went to the effort to do so, how come they did't obtain the recipe patent?!?!
