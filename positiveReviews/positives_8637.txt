I got this coffee based on the reviews and fair trade category.  My husband is a big coffee snob (he used to roast his own beans, and uses a burr grinder and french press only) and we both enjoyed this coffee.  We live in Europe and have been using Lavazza Qualita Oro whole beans without complaint and I figured I would give these a try due to the reviews and origin.  The flavor is full bodied and rich with a chocolate depth to it that I really like.  When we ran out we went back to the Lavazza and upon our first cup we immediately noticed the bitterness and lack of character and were sold on the Weavers and I am now putting in my order!
