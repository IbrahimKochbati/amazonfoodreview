When we lived in Omaha we fell in love with Pears coffee.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  For the price there is really no comparison.  We've tried other flavors, but always end up going back to colombio supremo.  We are now on direct ship every three months with Amazon.  Try it.. it's better than the grocery store options and less expensive.
