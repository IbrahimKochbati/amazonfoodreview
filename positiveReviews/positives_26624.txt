Perfect food for the Shar Pei  eed ... after raising Shar Pei dogs for 20 years, it is obvious that this food is the healthiest found for their particular skin problems and allergies.  This is a wholesome food that is all natural, without dyes and unnatural ingredients.  I would definately recommend this food for any  eed but definately for the Shar Pei  eed.
