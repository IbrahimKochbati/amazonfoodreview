Pantoufle is six months old and has had this cat food from age 10 weeks.It really enjoys it . Since it is a growing boy its food is always available.I wonder if short hair cats get fur balls problems  it has never been sick , it is very energetic and has the softest fur in the East . The dry food is all he eats . I am very impressed with it and Pantoufle has no complain unless his dish is empty . I have noticed no shedding but we are in Winter so I will know later in the year .
