Somewhere between a rice cake and a potato chip in texture, PopChips are an excellent low calorie snacking choice. I've tried all of the available flavors and here is my assessment of each:     Barbeque   A little too sweet for my taste but not bad overall     Jalapeno   High on Spice, not too salty, not much other flavor. I guess I was hoping for a cheesy jalapeno.     Original   Not super flavorful but great for dipping     Cheddar   Yummy     Parmesan Garlic   So Garlicky. Good but make for stinky  eath     Salt & Pepper   Good     Sea Salt & Vinegar   If you like Vinegar you might like these but I wasn't as big of a fan of them as I expected     Sour Cream & Onion   Hands down the BEST flavor
