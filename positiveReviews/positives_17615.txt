This coffee certainly doesn't taste like it is missing something, it has a bold, dark flavor.          It was actually a bit stronger than I prefer when it comes to my coffee, as I like a more mellow flavor.  I really liked the way this coffee didn't have a biting aftertaste.          My husband prefers the stronger espresso or French type roasts, and he liked this very much.  Actually, he said he was impressed with how the low acid nature did not sacrifice the flavor at all.  He is prone to stomach acid issues, and had none after drinking this.          We have a small coffeepot that makes 4 cups.  We were able to make 2 pots of coffee with one 3 oz. packet, 8 cups total.
