My husband loves pumpkin spice coffee, but unfortunately it is not available year round in our grocery stores.  When I looked on Amazon, I discovered this.  I was a little concerned about the "vanilla nut" part, because it's not a flavor he usually likes.  However, this was excellent!  For those looking for vanilla, this probably won't cut it, but pumpkin spice fans should enjoy it.          The price is very reasonable, especially if you don't have to pay shipping.  Highly recommended!
