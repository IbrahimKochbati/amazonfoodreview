I've been eating healthy foods almost exclusively for the past 7 years, so I end up eating things like this when I need a snack.  It's whole grain and has the lowest salt content of just about any cracker type product that I can find, i.e., it's a reasonably healthy food.  Of course, the downside is that it doesn't taste  good.  I couldn't possibly eat it plain.  Instead, I spread on some healthy (i.e., no salt, no sugar, etc.) peanut butter, homemade hummus, or homemade guacamole.  That makes for a decent (but certainly not delicious) snack.  I often wonder if all this healthy eating is worth it.
