I love this tea, its everything everybody is saying about it. But from the first time I  ewed this tea, my husband took one look and said to me that its not hibiscus but sorrel tea. I argued, whatever but I decided to look it up anyways  because the tea did look and taste like sorrel drink that we make in the Caribbean.  In the US its called red hibiscus or roselle or Florida cranberry. It does lower blood pressure and it is healthy. My point is that folks think they are drinking actual flower tea and it is misleading when  advertisers have these pretty hibiscus flowers on the cans etc (not this particular  and). This plant is comercially grown in the tropics and also in the US in Louisiana and Florida.
