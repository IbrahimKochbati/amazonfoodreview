We really love Popchips or at least we love the BBQ and the Orginal. Good and crunchy without all the fat and calories. The single serve bags are really great. Costco really has the best price, when they are available there. Since we are a big fan of Jalapeno, we went ahead and ordered them here at Amazon,even though the price was high, and we regret that purchase, the Jalapeno flavor is just wrong. Awful would be the right description. We also tried the Cheddar and that on also failed badly for us. So, we will stick to the BBQ and the Orginals.
