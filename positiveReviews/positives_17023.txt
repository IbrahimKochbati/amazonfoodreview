My 13 lb dachshund is extremely destructive with his toys and needs a lot of interaction with most toys constantly.  I filled this toy with organic cheerio type cereal and he was delighted.  It took him about 3 minutes to work out how to get the treats out.          I dropped a star because he is able to pull small chunks off the purple molding.  I sort of expected that because he is like that with everything though.  Luckily, he spits the rubber out after he pops it off, so I can let him play with it when I am home to supervise his play.
