As others have said this drink is 100% natural and contains none of the things that we don't want in soda.  My family really enjoyed it.  I thought it had a great bubbly and fruity taste.  None of us found it overly sweet.  We're not big soda drinkers, but this would be fun on a hot day as something different.
