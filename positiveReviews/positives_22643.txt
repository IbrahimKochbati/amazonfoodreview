This is the best tasting popcorn we've found for our stand popcorn popper.  We've tried a few others and this tastes the closest to movie theater type.  It pops well and tastes wonderful!  Works well on the stove top, in the counter stir type popper and also in the popcorn cart type popper.  Highly recommend!  Glad we found it, plus the price is great!
