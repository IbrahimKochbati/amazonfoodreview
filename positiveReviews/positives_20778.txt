This is a great soup mix. I didn't find it salty at all. I actually add some seasoning and stir in frozen veggies and spinach. I've ordered on more than one occasion and recommend it. You can experiment with the consistency by adding or subtracting the amount of water used. I find it comes out less thick by keeping it covered as it cooks. otherwise it tends to get pretty thick. Its all your preference though.
