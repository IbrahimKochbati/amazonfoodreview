My 10 month old twins LOVE these tiny dried fruits!  I love that they are organic!!  We've had the strawberry mix, the apple and the blueberry mix and they love all of them, but are particularly fond of the blueberries mixed in.  They pick out the blueberries before eating the rest.  These are freeze dried so they aren't gummy, but if you leave them out on a tray they will get gummier over time (maybe the moisture from the air?)  My twins didn't have a problem chewing them, but they've both had a lot of teeth for a while now.  One had 8 teeth at 7 months, the other had 6 teeth at the same time.  We started eating these at about 8 months old.  They have never choked on these (where they have with mum mum's and other types of crackers)
