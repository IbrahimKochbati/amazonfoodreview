I've tried a few Tasty Bites, and this one is good. Not great, but good. The flavor was a bit one sided   lentils and cumin were all I tasted. I'll eat it again, but I will probably add a cutney or some ginger cilantro tomatoes to the mix to change the flavor a bit. You have to like cumin (I do) to like this dish    there were a lot of whole cumin seeds in it.
