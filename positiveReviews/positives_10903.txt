We have a two spoiled dogs who really enjoy their treats.  While they are somewhat like pigs when it comes to their extra dietary choices, they have been known to show greater enthusiasm for some.  We have also found that so many of these treats on the market are unhealthy and mostly comprised of fillers and junk.  We decided to try the Newman's Own because it was organic (which we like for ourselves so we thought it would also be good for our treasured pets), and it looked like it was a total package healthy choice treat.  We have also used other Newman's Own products for our personal food selections and have never been disappointed.  These treats quickly became the favorite choice for our dogs.  Our English Setter began salavating as soon as we opened the package.  If these don't make your dogs wag their tails in appreciation nothing will.  I have even thought of trying one myself, but whenever I open the package the dogs come running and since I don't allow them to eat my treats I would feel bad to eat theirs.
