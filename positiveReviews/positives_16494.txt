Our Shiba loves these. Over a three week period we have observed a reasonable reduction in the amount of tarter on his teeth, especially the molars.          We would continue to buy them from Amazon if the price were lower. However, a large shopper's club sells essentially the same product (ingredients, and including the capped box and inner packaging), while offering the product at a consistently lower cost: 10% 12% per unit.
