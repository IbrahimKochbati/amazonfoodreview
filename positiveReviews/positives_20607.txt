We bought 6 very small "on sale" azalea bushes last year.  They made it through last summer and winter without dying and that was about it.  This spring, as everything around was turning green and lush, these little bushes were pretty sad looking and very  ittle.  No flowers and  own looking leaves.  In fact, they almost looked like they were dead.  My husband (better known as Eeyore) was sure that they were as good as dead, said that fertilizer would never work, and was getting ready to pull them up and go buy some that were already large and healthy looking  and also very expensive.  I said, hold everything  before we give up, let me look online and see if there is something we can do to save these.          I read a review here and some at epinions on Miracid azalea camellia rhodedendron food. I then promised him if this didn't work, we could pull up those plants and start over.          Thank you to all of you who wrote reviews here and elsewhere.  I want to add my own recommendation.  Because  unbelievably, within two days after feeding, the first flowers were peeking out.  It is now not even a full week later and all 6 bushes have flowers and or buds.  I counted at least 22 buds on one bush alone.  My nay saying husband first said that it was a coincidence but now he is talking about feeding them every couple of weeks!!  I think he has become a believer.  Me too  I never did tell him but I really thought those bushes were probably dead, too.          Really amazing stuff!
