These olives were introduced to me by a food freak; nothing but the best for his family.  When I tried one, I immediately went online to try to find them.  Fortunately, Amazon handled them.  I knew they were coming in large cans so I had 3 one pint caning jars on hand; just scoop out the olives into the jars and keep in refrigerator until you need the next can.  These olives are a different universe from premium stuffed olives in supermarkets.  You will never know what a really superb Martini is without them.
