My wife recently traveled on Delta and loved these Biscoff cookies they were serving. She asked me to order some for her online and I found a great price for them on Amazon. She has been very happy with the taste and high quality of these european style cookies. Her friends and relatives love them too. To tell you the truth I love them too.
