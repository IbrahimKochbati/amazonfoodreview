Little morsels of moist, pure beef that taste like high quality roast.  I got the Teriyaki by accident   I normally don't like teriyaki ANYTHING   but the only hint of added flavoring on these is a little sweetness.          Lean, good cuts of meat with no nasty little gristley surprises.  My only criticism is they must cook these in crack cocaine, because I'm absolutely addicted to them.
