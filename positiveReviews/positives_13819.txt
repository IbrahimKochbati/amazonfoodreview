I was impressed. It smells like peanut butter & has the same consistency as peanut butter. It really doesnt have much taste to it. The chocolate pb2 doesnt either. Theres a slight taste of peanut butter but I'm not sure if I'm tasting it or just smelling it. I love it cause it offers a protein without all the calories. Btw the calories as well as other values are identical in the plain & the chocolate. The real challenge is finding something to eat it on. Better on a cracker than  ead. Best on toast
