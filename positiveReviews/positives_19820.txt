I've had grapefruit candy before, but these, even with all the sugar, I LOVE.          I couldn't believe how much I actually ordered when I got the candy in the mail. I had every intent to mail some home, but they never made it to a post office. It was perfect for my mid pregnancy cravings. my significant other must've been having sympathy cravings too, because he helped me devour these things.          Great grapefruit flavor. it is coated in sugar as anyone can plainly see, so i dont see how anyone can complain about the sugar. its CANDY! lol.          i love these things and will be ordering them again as soon as i get the chance & hopefully share some this time!          unfortunately, these do not ship to alaska. i see this as a problem considering this is my home state. i don't know what i'll do when i move! yikes.
