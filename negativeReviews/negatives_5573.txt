Earlier this year, a colleague pointed out that I live right next to an illy.  Hearing that they have good coffee, I went and found my latte to be marvelous, better than anything at Starbucks or Caribou coffee.  Since then, I gone in on numerous occasions and had their full range of drinks, including their drip coffee.  Thinking that I could save some money, I bought this coffee to make myself a fresh cup in the morning.  I was careful to get the right grind size for my french press.  My homemade coffee does not compare with the illy's made coffee.  I dunno if they use fresher beans or what, but I found this coffee from Amazon to be dull, flavorless and definitely not worth the $26 price.  I only used 1 2 of the canister before switching over to Peets.  If you're in the mood for illy's, you should just go to their cafe to get a cup, otherwise  ew something else at home.
