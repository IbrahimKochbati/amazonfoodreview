In general these Walden Farms Dressings taste great and make a diet less monotonous.  My husband likes them too, and he always prefers the high calorie version of anything.          But the Ranch is very bland.  It's not bad tasting, just not great.  Possibly you could add a little garlic or onion powder to make a dip.
