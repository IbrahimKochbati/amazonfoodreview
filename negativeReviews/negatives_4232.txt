I bought this for all my deck containers this year, and I'm not really that impressed with it. The plants look fine, but I have way fewer flowers than I've ever had using regular potting soil. I also had two plants die, and I have no idea why. I read one other review that said her plants were cooking in the sun   that the contents of her containers felt HOT to her. This could be my exact problem as well. Both plants that died were in full sun. Next year I will buy regular potting soil and a big package of Miracle Grow plant food instead!
