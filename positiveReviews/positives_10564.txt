First Impression: The friendly folks over at "Exclusively Dog" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.     Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.          Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4.
