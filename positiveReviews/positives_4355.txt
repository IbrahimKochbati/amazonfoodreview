I bought these one time at my local Safeway and absolutely loved them.  I dipped them in a creamy cucumber dressing and the combination was awesome.  Next time I went to buy a box... gone, not even a spot on the shelf where they might have been sold out.  This happens to me frequently    I find a product and really like it and then the next time I go to purchase it, it's gone.  I looked for these Crisp 'n Lights at all our large grocers and other stores like Target and Rite Aid.  No luck.  Fortunately, I picked up a case here on Amazon and will covet every box.
