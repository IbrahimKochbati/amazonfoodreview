I ordered these white peppercorns from JR Mushrooms & Specialties via Amazon.com, and I have to say that these are the best white peppercorns I think I've ever had!  The amount you get (one pound) for the price completely blows local specialty shops and grocery markets right out of the water!  (Sorry local guys, but a rip off is a rip off, and frankly, JR's peppercorns are more fresh and flavorful!)  You won't regret shopping at JR's via Amazon.  The packaging is excellent, the delivery timeline is excellent, and the product is... well, I've already sung those praises above!  Oh, and a tip for you who order these, once the plastic bag is opened, just fill your pepper grinder(s), and put the remainder in a canning jar with a tight fitting lid, and store in a cool, dark place.  They stay fresh that way!!
