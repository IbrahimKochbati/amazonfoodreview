Our family eats a fair amount of chicken, and most of it is either grilled or baked. When we bake it, we typically use a Shake 'N Bake mix with it or something similar. Prior to using this product I requested from amazon Vine, however, we had never used a Shake 'N Bake product with pork. In all honesty, I absolutely love pork, whether it be pork loin, bacon, baked ham, deli ham, pork sausage, shredded BBQ pork, pork ribs   whatever. It's my favorite meat, bar none. Why I never thought to try something like this before surprises even me. Maybe it's because pork doesn't need a lot of help to taste good. Unless I'm eating BBQ pork, I don't like to put a whole lot of "stuff" on the meat, because I like the natural flavor of it. Fortunately, this mix adds just a bit of zest without drowning out the natural flavor of the pork (in this case, it was pork chops I was fixing). I liked it well enough to try it again, and my kids thought it was good enough to eat again, too. Not fantastic, but a good thing to try once in a while.
