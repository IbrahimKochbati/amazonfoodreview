This is awful tasting and for the price with shipping turned out to be $10 a bottle. Bought for my son's birthday party and some of the boys were puking and gaging it was so bad. You are better off buying a bottle of Franks hot sauce and chugging it down...at least it tastes good. This was my BIGGEST rip off buy EVER!!!
