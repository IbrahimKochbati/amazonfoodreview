I enjoyed these chopped walnuts very much. They are fresh and crunchy and are perfect for use in trail mix or as a topping for ice cream, yogurt, etc.          I like the small eight oz. bag.  It's a very convenient size that doesn't leave me wondering how to keep a whole pound of nuts fresh if I have to open the bag just to use a few walnuts on my granola in the morning.          However, for some uses (i.e. making chunky chocolate chip cookies), I have found that the shelled walnuts work much better for me than these chopped walnuts do.  The small pieces (chopped walnuts are really just walnut crumbs) seem to blend more into the background of baked goods than the big shelled walnut chunks do.          For that reason, I prefer the Diamond shelled walnuts to their chopped walnuts.  However, both products are very good.
