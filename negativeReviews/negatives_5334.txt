I bought the SmartyKat CatnipMist because it received a couple of decent reviews and it was one tenth the cost of "From the Field" Catnip  Essential Oil Rejuvenator, which I had tried before. Well, you know what they say, "If it's too good to be true, it is too good to be true."          SmartyKat CatnipMist just didn't work with my two cats. They sniffed it and then just walked away. They weren't remotely interested.          Like I say, I have tried and liked the effectiveness of "From the Field" Catnip  Essential Oil Rejuvenator. But, From the Field is costly. Well, you know what they also say..."You get what you pay for." I'll stick with "From the Field" Catnip  Essential Oil Rejuvenator.
