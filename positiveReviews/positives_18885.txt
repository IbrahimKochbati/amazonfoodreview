We have loved ZiwiPeak for a few years now, when it was introduced to us by our local pet boutique.  (which is now out of business, unfortunately) It is available in venison, venison fish, beef...and our dog loves all three, but due to past health issues we tend to stay with one of the 'venison' ones.  There is no odor, they look like little dried out beef jerky, but are not that hard.  They also have great treats.  It is a complete diet and it IS concentrated so feed only about 1 3 of what you would normally feed.  I recommend it highly.
