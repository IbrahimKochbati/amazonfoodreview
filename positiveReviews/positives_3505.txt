I'm far more of a tea drinker than a coffee drinker, but I can't start the day without a cup or three of coffee. Plus, I'm not really awake until I smell the coffee  ewing   just not morning without it.          I tend to buy more affordable (e.g., supermarket type  ands) of coffee so I can splurge on tea. So this was a real treat   outstanding aroma just opening the bag, and even better when  ewing. Delightfully smooth taste, and highly drinkable black (the only way I drink coffee or tea).          My only complaint is opening the bag. Based on what other reviewers stated, I opened it over a plastic bin so it would catch any spills. Very glad I did   an appreciable amount was spilled when I cut into the bag. I decanted it into an air tight container. I've had this problem with other vacuum packed coffee, but the very fine grind of the Melitta made it even more of a problem.          Still, not enough of a problem to warrant taking away a rating star. This makes a wonderful cup of coffee!
