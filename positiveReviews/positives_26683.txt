If like me, you were looking for chips that are actually hot as the label says, these are the chips for you. They are tongue burning, sinus clearing, eyes watering hot if you eat more than a few chips. Also they have a nice hint of barbecue chip flavor, and that good crunch of kettle chips.     They are enjoyable to eat, and not just for the novelty of eating the hottest chip you can find.     I bought the case and shared a few bags with other lovers of hot foods.
