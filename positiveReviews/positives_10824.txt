He loved this cookie as a treat.  Not sure if this is available in a smaller size of cookie, but the bars seem larger than the heart shaped chicken cookie treats I have been buying.  The lamb one does not upset my older English Cocker Spaniel who has a sensitive tummy, and isn't any more fattening either than the other cookie, but I do  eak each bar into two or three pieces to feed it to him.  He can actually deal with the size just fine, tho this particular style is more appropriate for a large dog vs a middling size dog like him, but he counts the number of treats we give him and isn't happy until he gets three pieces : )  I feed him one bar  oken into three pieces, while I feed him two to three of the little heart shape cookies(depends on how much food he's cadged from my toddlers that day) I totally trust the Newman's  and of dog food and have been happy with my baby's silky and healthy coat and no tummy upsets on the Newmans food or cookies.
