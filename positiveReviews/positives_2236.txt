Growing up on Oreos and milk is common. So I was taken aback with the  and extension of Oreo's to cakesters. And while I had low expectations, I must say these are better than normal Oreos. Although I can't say it'll beat the combo of oreos and milk, these are fantastic treats and relatively guilt free.  If you like cake and like Oreos you can't go wrong with Oreo cakesters.          The filling will  ing you back to your childhood while the cake will provide you with a whole new Oreo experience. Certainly worth a try   guaranteed enjoyment!
