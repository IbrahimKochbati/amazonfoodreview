I've been eating a lot of dried mango lately and have tried several  ands. This one is by far my favorite so I feel compelled to write a review.          The pro:  TASTE!  Tastes like a mango, maintaining a hint of moisture. Very seldom have I found any less than desirable bites ( own bites) which happens in other  ands pretty often.          The cons:  Small amount in the bag (price...)          Neutral: I agree with another poster that the bites are small. This is pro nor con for me.
