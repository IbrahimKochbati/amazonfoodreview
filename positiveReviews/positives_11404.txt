These are very good, and so easy!  Plus, I never fail to be impressed at how CHOCK FULL they are of chocolate chunks.  No skimping here.  I order it through Amazon's "Subscribe and Save" program, which makes these a very good deal indeed.  What makes these cookies an even BETTER deal is that you can make them healthier by substituting ingredients.  This mix calls for one egg and 1 stick of butter.  Instead, I use the egg and a generous 1 4 c. peanut butter plus a generous 1 4 c. plain yogurt (and a bit of water as needed for consistency).  No butter necessary.  They still come out good, and I feel even better about them.  Eat & ENJOY!
