Well, the other reviewer are correct; this is a very fine cat food. Yes, it looks and smells tasty  flakey chunks in gravy. Probably tastes as good as human food (and just as expensive, but I presume it is formulated for cats). I like the way it is packaged and the small servings are just right. I actually divide it in half for my two cats, because I free feed them kibble. They snarf it down!
