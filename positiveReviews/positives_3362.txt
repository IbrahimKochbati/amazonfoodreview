I am not happy about the lack of fiber, and the the starchy flours used. But a handful of ground flax seed makes up for that.          I am also happy about a  and that helps you to make biscuits and other things from the same mix. Other companies sell biscuits and pizza dough as a separate item, duping the customer to spend even more money.          Compared to the many other  ands, these do not have a "funny" taste or smell from odd flours. These are made mostly from Rice and Potato flours. You just feel NORMAL.          I hope they will come out with a "whole grain" version from Brown Rice and Bean flour.          TIP: To get the fluffiest texture use BUTTER instead of oil. Room temperature butter.
