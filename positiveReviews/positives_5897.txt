We've been using Meyenberg Powdered Goat Milk for our little girl since she was 6 months of age.  My wife and I love this product.  We opted not to feed our child any formula milk out there.  My wife  eastfeeds and due to low  east milk production, we also feed our child goats milk.  Dr. Sears has an awesome web page on info about goats milk and it's uses for babies.
