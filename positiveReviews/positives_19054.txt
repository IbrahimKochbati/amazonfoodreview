Any baker can tweak Carbquick to fit their expectations. Much simplier than working with individual formulas. Bonus, I got a shot of Amazon's price and my local health food store was happy to beat it and they deliver 2 boxes to me every 3 wks. Just like amazon's subscription service. Since this is such a lo carb staple it was worth setting up a cheaper option.
