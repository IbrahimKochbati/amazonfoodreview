These are wonderful products. It has been a trial getting our ten year old dog to take any pills. Since we discovered the pill pockets (he loves the chicken variety), giving him a pill has been a  eeze. We always buy the large size and cut off a little to give to our other dog as a treat at the same time so the dog getting the pill is none the wiser. I can't imagine needing to shove a pill down our dog's throat again.
