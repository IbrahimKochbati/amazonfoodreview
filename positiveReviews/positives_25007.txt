My family likes Crystal Light and we drink it to lower our calorie consumption and avoid drinking so many soft drinks.  This is pretty good ice tea with just enough peach flavor to make it unique.          It contains no sugar, not fat, no sodium and no carbohydrates.  Just your fresh water and this powdered mix that makes it more flavorful and enjoyable to drink.  We love it on a hot summer day and with our meals.
