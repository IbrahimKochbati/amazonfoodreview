I have a KerryBlue Terrier who won her Championship several years ago.  We have always been conscious of a nutritional healthy diet.  All at once we were not able to buy the products locally.  I have always been able to find "anything" on Amazon and once again we were successful.  We knew this was a great product,we just could not buy it without Amazon's help.
