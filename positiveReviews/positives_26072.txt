Chances are if you are looking at Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance, you are looking into finding a quality cat food for you animals.  I'm a firm believer in buying the best quality foods for my animals in order to ensure their optimum good health, especially since the 2007 pet food recalls from melamine adulterated food.  Initially, when I purchased this food that didn't factor into my decision.          I had a long haired cat who gifted me with hairballs on a frequent basis.  A friend told me about this food and swore by it, claiming her rugs and furniture no longer suffered from constant scrubbing.  I decided to give Natural Balance a try and was amazed at the results.  I no longer have that cat, but did inherit another long haired cutie pie who LOVES this food.  I changed her food to this one a month ago, gradually mixing it with her previous food, and it somehow helps her body minimize the hairball activity.  I want her to be healthy and happy and find the expense to be well worth it.  This is  ief blurb from their website, information that can be found on the bag as well:          *  Fresh Chicken, Salmon Meal, New Zealand Lamb Meal This unique blend of fresh, high quality proteins provides the essential amino acids to help maintain strong muscle tone and a healthy, shiny coat.          *  Taurine Fortified To help maintain a healthy heart and good vision.          *  Fresh Potatoes Rich in potassium and an excellent source of highly digestible carbohydrates.          *  Preserved Naturally To maintain freshness, Natural Balance uses only mixed tocopherols (Vitamin E) in all of its formulas and will always be free of artificial flavors, colors and chemical preservatives.          *  Skin and Coat Essential Fatty Acids are combined to produce an excellent skin and coat for your cat.          *  High Digestibility          No Artificial Preservatives, Flavors, Colors, or Bleached Ingredients.          If you need to find out more, you can check out this food at Petco, where I purchased it, or head to the Natural Balance website.  Of course everyone has their own opinion and will look at several factors when purchasing for their animals.  You and only you know your needs, but I find that this food satisfies not only mine (I don't have to invest in so many paper towels), but obviously that of my cat.  I was using a perfectly acceptable organic food, but when I mixed this with it ... well, lets just say she likes Natural better than organic.  I'm happy if she's happy and I'm not constantly cleaning up after her these days!
