I was a skeptic.  I thought I would have to have my dogs teeth cleaned by a vet at a cost of $150.00 plus.  Their  eath would knock over a horse.  Then I heard of Greenies!  Wow can I say,  ight teeth and great  eath and I feed them only 1 2 of a regular one a day.  They love them! Great product, fast shipping, there is nothing more that needs to be said.
