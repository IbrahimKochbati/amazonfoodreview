I eat a variety of shelf stable microwavable lunches.  This is the best of the bunch, to me.  It has good flavor and is well seasoned without being overly spicy.  It has 6 grams of fiber and tastes good at the same time.  I prefer to eat it with saltines and shredded cheddar, but have eaten it with only the saltines and enjoyed it.          I usually prefer chili without beans, with Hormel prefered and Wolf  and as an alternate, but I really like this chili "soup" with beans.          For thos who have trouble with the chili popping and banging, turn the power level of the microwave down.
