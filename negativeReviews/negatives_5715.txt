I remember eating Shake 'N Bake when I was a kid. I think I even got the privilege of shaking the ole Ziploc baggie. I recently tried the Original Chicken flavor. I think the individual serving packs are great size. I even tried this on Tilapia tonight and it was pretty good. It's a great alternative to fried foods. I like that it is a really quick and easy meal solution. It takes less than 30 minutes from start to finish.
