I haven't written reviews, only 1 or 2.  Now is the time people should know how I feel about these C.E.T. HEXtra Premium Bones.     Our Vet, who sells those C.E.T. Bones, I tried one pack, but relized after seeing how good they are, I checked Amazon, and sure enough, they sold them, and at a better price.          Our Vet said when dogs reach 4 to 5 years old, regular rawhide does grind chip their back teeth. That worrid me, but Vet said they're not bad, and introducted me to C.E.T. bones.  Dogs have been on them for long time now, and I continue, oftened, to buy C.E.T. HEXtra Premium Oral... chews.          And when so much time passed, and recently Vet both dogs teeth, the older dog, her teeth are the same, they arn't worse.  That to me is GREAT.  Now I order from whoever has the better prices for C.E.T. chews.  (NOTE: I would check, though, make sure if you want to try these, make sure if you order $25.00 or over, that there's NO POSTAGE, some are 3rd parties, some 3rd parties offer free postage.  Just letting all the Dog lovers know this.)          We've been using these Chews for so long, and when it's time to give each of them one, all I say is "how about a 'Chewy Bone'....WOW, no matter where they are in the house, they come a running, right to the closet in kitchen where I store them.  They also, when I open the pantry, they run to other room, next to kitchen, and sit and wait, while their tails wag alot.  That, at least to me, tells me they really like them.          So for anyone out there who wants to know what I think.....I think these C.E.T. HEXtra Premium Oral ARE THE BEST, and I would NOT recommend any other chewy bones, especially rawhide, or any other hard bone.          If this previous isn't enough to convince you, I don't know what else to say, other than "Maybe you should at least try 1 bag, even if you pay postage.  I bet after that 1 bag, depending on size, which I buy the 30 extra large, which is much better price, they have small, medium, the right sizes for any dogs.          That's about it. If anyone wants to ask me questions, feel free to write ask. I'll be happy to answer any questions.
