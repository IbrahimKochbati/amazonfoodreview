IN A NUTSHELL: THIS REALLY MADE ME INTO A BELIEVER IN 'CERTIFIED ORGANIC' PRODUCTS          Everything that one could want in a boxed 'Macaroni & Cheese' meal is in this excellent product from 'Annie's Homegrown'. Its ingredients are 'Certified Organic', with real cheese and whole wheat pasta. The rusult is a very healthy fast food that tastes significantly better, creamier, richer and more satisfying than its processed counterpart and WITHOUT COSTING THAT MUCH MORE!          I had never heard of this product until I received a sample of it in the mail several months ago. Now, I exclusively consume only this 'Annie's'  and Mac & Cheese, and essentially refuse the other major  ands which do contain artificial ingredients. I have tried many of the different varieties that Annie's offers and have been universally satisfied thusfar.          [I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY BUT I DO BUY AND EAT THIS STUFF]
