This NurturMe All Natural Baby Food actually resembles the taste of fresh peas, and not just a little bit either.  I'd say the taste is STRONGLY reminiscent of fresh garden peas.  That's amazing considering most baby food just tastes like yucky, watered down mushy imitations of the real thing.  Not so in this case.  Highly recommended for all mothers and fathers that want their baby to eat only the most nutritious and edible foods.
