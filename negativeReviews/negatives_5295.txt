It is not fair to say I give this product one star as I haven't even tried it, but the label states that it has "hint of heat from chiles" in it. I can not eat anything with chile in it and would not have ordered it if it had been indicated on the web site. If you like a bit of heat you may love this and give it a 5star rating, just be aware.
