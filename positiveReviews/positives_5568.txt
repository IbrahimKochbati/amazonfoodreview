If there is one good thing about a cold Winter's day it is hot soup. The Women's Bean Project provided me with one of the best and it is good for me too. How often can we do something that is good for us and so enjoyable at the same time?     I have told all of my friends about it and I hope they will, in turn,spread the word so that the women of the Bean Project are kept busy and prosper.
