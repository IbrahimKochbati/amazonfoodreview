It's hard to review something a dog eats. Our dog didn't say anything about this treat, but he did gobble it up heartily. Then again, he gobbles up any treat I give him. I can't say I noticed anything different about his reaction to this treat than compared to, say, Milk Bones, except it takes him longer to eat these (they are hard). The makers leave it up to the dog owners to know or assume the benefits of this treat, because it doesn't say what they are on the bag. The bag lists a lot of features, like Organic, No Wheat, No Corn and Baked in Small Batches, but it doesn't say why these things are beneficial. The back of the bag has a fictional story about Newman's dog rumored to be writing a Tell All book. I assume it must appeal to Newman's target audience, and I'm not in that audience. Maybe it's just the marketing consultant in me, but I think it would be useful to list the benefits as well as the features.
