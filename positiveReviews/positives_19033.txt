I have been doing Atkins for months now and having Carbquik has really helped me stay on it without cheating (much). It takes a little experimentation to make recipes come out right, but once you do it is really good stuff. Adding cream and butter liberally helps make really good biscuits. My girlfriend also makes some great meat and Carbquik casseroles.          Some people complain about it not being perfect but ITS LOW CARB BREAD. It tastes amazing when you don't have  ead. Anything with a biscuit like texture will come out good and will be a joy to eat.          I can only hope that they come out with more products like this. I love my food and this definitely helps me eat the dishes I crave while staying on a diabetic friendly diet.
