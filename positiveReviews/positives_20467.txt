First things first: if you've been drinking powdered drink mixes flavored with aspartame or similar chemicals, True Lemonade will probably take a bit of getting used to.  These days, everything is ridiculously over sweetened, and our taste buds have become accustomed to it.  Now that I've been drinking True Lemonade for years, I don't know how I ever drank the other stuff.  It's all sickeningly sweet.          True Lemonade is milder but perfectly palatable.  It won't replace fresh squeezed lemonade or anything of that sort, but when it comes to naturally flavored, low calorie drink mixes, it's the best game in town.  I can't stand plain water, and this jazzes it up very nicely.  The flavor isn't watery or over sweetened (and I actually use the packets meant for 16 oz in my 25 oz water bottle, so I get a much milder flavor than most people do).          My only complaints might not apply to everyone, since they have to do with the packaging.  I wish True Lemon offered a container of just powder, sans the packets, since I don't use it on the go, and the packets just create extra waste.  I also recommend ordering from Amazon, because the official True Lemon store likes to send outrageous amounts of plastic packing peanuts along with the order, which shows a real lack of environmental awareness.  Amazon's packaging is much less wasteful.
