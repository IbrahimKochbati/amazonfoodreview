This is a pretty nice starter kit for the price.  My only complaint would be the light damage done to my tree by the display box that it was obviously in for too long.  But just a few months later, and my bonsai is doing just great now!  There is new green growth on the old damaged  anches, which is nice.  Still, overall a good deal for the price.  Would make a great gift!          Ok, it's been 5 months now, and the tree is doing absolutely great!!  I woudn't worry AT ALL about how I said it came in the box... very strong and dependable tree regardless.  I'm VERY pleased with this tree, and it's now been moved to a bigger pot as it's doing so well!!  By far my FAVORITE of my 8 different bonsai trees ordered online!!          Almost a year now, and still growing strong!  I've had three other bonsai plants die from different companies, but this one continues to thrive!  I'm now using the small pot it originally came in for another bonsai.. yes the pot it comes with is small, but it's very durable and great for starting small bonsai or other plants.  I'd still strongly recommend this starter kit to anyone interested in starting the art of bonsai.. and even for experienced growers.  It's such a wonderful kit.  The tree is healthy, the pot is durable, and the soil works great!
