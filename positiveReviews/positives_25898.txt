There is no other  and that offers a vegan organic pet product like this. I am very happy with it. I feed my dogs organic raw food, but when I ran out of ingredients or while travellin I open a can and give it to them. The food is very dry and I usually have to mix a bit of water so my dogs don't have a hard time swallowing. They absolutely love the food. I have a peace of mind that I'm giving them the best I can find.
