I have used Lavender Essential Oil for years and loved the idea that these were food grade.  I ordered 7 different oils about a month ago   at the time of this purchase   but have only received 5.          First the oils: They are mostly comparable to other  ands but seem a thinner and do not seem to last as long as others   I expect that is due to the food grade. The bottles do not come with droppers   this makes it difficult to use as everything with essential oils is based on drops.  Depending on how often I actually use in food   I may or may not purchase this  and of lavender again.  The price is good but if I have to buy my own dropper tops it outweighs the better price.          The company   faerie's finest   I was okay with the delay I was informed of on two of the oils in this purchase; however, when I recently emailed them to find out when those two oils would arrive I was informed that they were supposedly mailed before the date I was told there would be a delay.  When the issue is resolved   I will update this review.  In the interim, I will not recommend the seller nor will I buy from them again.  Which is unfortunate as they have nice selection of essential oils.
