Over the past few years I clearly have developed a problem with drinking coffee and indigestion. I tried quite of number of coffees and this one just works for me. Coffee flavor is very good even though I make somewhat thin  ew. I find it easy to drink black, and the coffee really remains ok even if it sits around my desk a while. Whenever I switch away the indigestion problems start again.     I don't know if this type of coffee would be of benefit to others but it sure has been for me.
