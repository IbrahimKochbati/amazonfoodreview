I agree with the other reviewer about these tasting nothing like a real latte. The Maxwell House ones are much much better. The problem is that the vanilla flavor that they used to flavor the espresso is extremely strong and powerful but it has such an artificial taste to it. Brewing it did give my house a wonderful vanilla fragrance and it didn't taste completely horrible which is why I am giving it some stars...I will drink the rest of the package however...I would never buy this again. The plain lattes with a little bit of vanilla syrup are exponentially better. I do have to say that the creamer that comes with this though is the best creamer I have had from the tassimo line. That said...I won't pay this price just for a slightly sweeter creamer disc.
