Most babies I know get ear infections, and other illnesses a lot. My son has only had a fever 2 days and a cold lasted for 4 days. This stuff is amazing, it really does help a babies immune system. He doesn't get sick at all and he is growing rapidly every day. I highly recommend this for sickly babies and toddlers. I just mix it with his formula or milk and he enjoys it. It is certified organic. It is a must if you have babies and if you are a first time mother.
