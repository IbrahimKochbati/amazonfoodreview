We have bought this gyro meat several times. It's good and since we don't have a greek deli for almost 60 miles, it's as good as we can get for now. My problem is the shipping. Yes it has to go by next day air, that is fine, but we'd buy 4 or 5 loafs if they would combine shipping. But they do not. It's $50 loaf shipping. I know it does not cost much more to send 5 as it does 1. Other than that, it's good meat.          Note: this is the sliced version. It's sliced very thin. Too thin for my tastes, but others love it. I prefer to buy the load and carve thicker pieces.          Either way it's good, but we can only afford it for special occasions due to the price of shipping and the lack of combining shipping options. They really need to add this item to prime program.
