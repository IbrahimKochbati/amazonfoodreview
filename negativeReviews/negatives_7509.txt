It was somewhat thirst quenching, but I was not totally satisfied. Maybe it was because the 8.5 oz. size seems like less than I want after I really work out. Maybe it was because the coconut guava flavor (both are flavors which I actually love) seemed super watered down...they should have added more guava! The upshot? I just felt this product fell a bit short on all counts. If I get it for free on bike to work day, I won't turn up my nose, but I wouldn't buy it when there are other options.
