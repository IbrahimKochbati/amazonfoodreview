After trying many of the other hot cocoa k cup options, I find that the Grove Square product tastes the best.  For my personal taste, I find that  ewing on the medium cup size setting creates the best taste.  Just add minature marshmellows and it is a great treat.  However, this is not hot chocolate, which may be a turn off for some tasters.
