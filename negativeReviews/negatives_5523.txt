Even though I followed the directions to a "t", my lunch was a bit saucy and mushy because of the extra liquid.  The taste was fair.  It did the job and kept me full for 4 hours. I liked that it didn't require draining. I also like that I can reuse the container. Not a fan of the price per serving. However, in a pinch...it's worth it to have a semi healthy lunch that I can make in my office.          I usually don't eat much sodium and this has way more than I would normally eat. I was impressed at how many grams of protein are in this though. That is what sold it. Next time though, I'll probably opt for a little tuna fish lunch kit instead.          I like the idea of being able to buy something semi healthy at a 24 hour drugstore. This flavor is not for me though.
