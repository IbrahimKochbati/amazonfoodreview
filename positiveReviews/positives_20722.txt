I first tried these drops when a friend left them at my house by accident.  I instantly loved it and ended up using the rest of the bottle over the next few weeks!  (Note to self buy a replacement for my buddy!) One to two drops and you will have SUPER minty  eath.  I use them at work and people twenty feet away will start saying they smell peppermint :)          They can be very strong so start off with one drop and work your way up.  Currently I will use two to three drops on my the back of my hand and then lick it up.  It sounds funny but these are the directions for use.  I believe you can also mix a drop or two with a glass of water and use as mouthwash.  If I eat something like onions or garlic I will use up to four drops, but I love the mint smell and sensation of inhaling the vapors so you're milage may vary.  You can also put a tiny bit uder your nostrils and it will help with sinus issues.          As far as any negatives go one I can think of is that after putting the drops on the back of your hand it will leave a white residue behind but it is easily washed off.  Also the price is a bit high in my opinion but a bottle can last about a month and its a good alternative to gum or mints.  Lastly I wish it came in a larger bottle size even just for refilling the small 10oz bottle it comes in.          Some people might not like this product.  I have let some co workers try it and a couple have said its just too strong for them and I have heard one even say he did not like the way it tastes.  Personally for me it's a smell thing and to me it tastes fine, basically like nothing if you take the smell part away.  Some of my friends just think I am weird for putting drops on the back of my hand and licking it off :)          I love this stuff and highly recommend it if you want some serious minty  eath!          Also I think its a natural product with the ingredients being peppermint oil and chlorophyll if that kind of thing is important to you.
