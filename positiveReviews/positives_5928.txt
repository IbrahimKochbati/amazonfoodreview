This is the best alternative to cows milk for the first 2 years.  My daughter loves it and it is easier for her to digest and has been known to lesson the occurance of certain allergies in children in given in place of whole milk that is recommended up 'til age 2.  This is my second child that I am using it with and I love it and so do they.
