Amazing! My roommate  ought this home because it was on sale and at first I just gave it a shrug. Within a week I was adding it to every combination of  ead, peanut butter, muffins, sauces, meats I had in my kitchen   guiltily apologizing to my roommate as I scooped and slathered away. Anything I added it to, even if it seemed strange was immediately transformed into something wonderfully delicious. Even sweetening my tea and coffee with it had me in bliss. Needless to say, the jar was emptied quickly. I went back to the store to try stock up but they were all sold out and I haven't been able to find anything like it since. Please MacKays!  ing your deliciousness back, I have a long life ahead of me and I've only just discovered you!!
