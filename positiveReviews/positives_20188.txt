I am diabetic....so I was looking for a good replacement for standard sugar, Coconut sugar did it for me.     Hardly any BG level changes an great taste. Be aware that there are 2 different Madhava Coconut sugars, blonde which is this one and the dark. Both are great, the darker version has a bit more of an "own" taste which is fine in any kind of baked goods and for example coffee, I absolutely did NOT like it in my iced tea. I cant tell you why...its a taste question.          Even the blond comes with a bit of a taste, but much less then the dark.          Oh..important! The taste I speak about is not Coconut...it doesnt taste one bit like coconut...sweet....bit of a candy taste which is great in baked goods and coffee.... for Iced Tea I use blue agave...fits perfect          Enjoy!          Oh...and dont trust my words my words regarding BG of you are diabetic.....everyone reacts absolutely different.
