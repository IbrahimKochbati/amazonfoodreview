You think you're doing something good for your kid when you invest a little more to get an organic formula.  Sadly, that's not the case here.  This is a horrifically constipating formula...lots of pain and straining, guaranteed.  Having to take measures to prevent this (offering juices, water, etc) is just not a sensible approach.          Also, the manufacturers use sucrose instead of lactose to save money, and they use a LOT of it.  With the same sweetness as country time lemonade, Similac Organic's sucrose based formula may also set your child up for future diabetes.  Check the NY Times article for more info on this.          Bottom line: painful constipation in the near term, possible diabetes and certainly a sweet tooth in the future...no, thanks!
