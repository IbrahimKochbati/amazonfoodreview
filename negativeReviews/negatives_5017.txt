Our dog likes this toy which we had gotten hastily at a drugstore when we realized we left her toys at home while on vacation. We fill this with Zukes or with crushed Nuturo choice snacks and leave it for her when we go to work. This can be a really long toy for your dog due to the small opening near the rope and it's good to check that what you put in will actually come out. Our dog gets her treats out be picking this up by the rope and then flinging it across the room (much to the chargin of the tenants below our apartment). She also just chews on the rope when she is bored and also tries to tug the rope back and forth in order to dislodge some of the treats. The best method for her however is to throw it and although it's durable, your wood floors may not like it and it can be somewhat noisy. But for this price, your dog will get a relatively long lasting treat dispenser that you can manipulate in order to increase or decrease the difficulty of earning their treat.
