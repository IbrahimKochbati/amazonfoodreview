Wondered how quick my dog would catch on to this.  She's pretty smart!  She's playing with this a lot and knows that even though she can smell the treats better at one end, they only come out on the other.  Luckily, it does take a while to get all the treats out.  You'll need tiny treats for this.  I got the Busy Buddie buddy berries (or something like that!).
