I am not coffee connoisseur, but I love lattes and coffee in general. I usually drink instant coffee, but recently realized that it tastes sour acidy. For some people making a coffee is a ritual and they probably will think I'm a heretic (like my friend from Ethiopia is always shaking head when I show up with Starbucks in my hand  I'm from Central Europe and shake my head when someone makes mashed potatoes out from the box desecration of potatoes;)          To try Puroast low acid coffee I poured hot water over 2 big teaspoons of Puroast coffee, add some powdered coffee creamer and it was tasty! Of course the coffee grounds are annoying, but there was no acid outcome.     I guess now I will try to find low acid instant coffee or maybe will finally buy small coffee maker (I'm the only coffee drinker in my house).
