I found this product in a local Walmart, after trying vainly to find  ead that i liked that is gluten free.  (Stay away from the Ener G  and, in my opinion)          I have been gluten free for 3 weeks now, and seriously craving  ead products.  I made some pancakes this morning from this product, and wow!!  very tasty, very light, I needed to thin them a bit more to have them spread correctly, but, this was the first real carb product that was " ead like" that I have eaten in 3 weeks.  Needless to say, I ate too many, and now have a carb headache!  :)          Seriously though, this product, used in moderation, may help you not miss your gluten products quite as much.  I look forward to making bisquits and some of the other recipes on the box.     Way to go on this product,  it strikes a home run in the gluten free market.
