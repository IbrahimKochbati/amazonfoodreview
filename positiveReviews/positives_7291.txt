After trying different citrusy flavors of gum (including Orbit Citrus Mint, Orbit Sangria Fresca, Orbit Fabulous Frutini, Extra Fruit Sensations Island Cooler, Trident Tropical Twist, and Stride Always Mandarin), I have concluded that Stride Forever Fruit takes the crown.          There is a real burst of flavor (and natural tasting sweetness) as you pop a piece in your mouth, and although it doesn't last "forever," it definitely holds its own against each of the flavors mentioned above.          Feel free to conduct your own taste test to find your own favorite, but I suggest you take my suggestion to try Stride Forever Fruit.  Who knows...you may realize that you won't even want to try any others!
