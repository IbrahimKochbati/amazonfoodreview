I bought this without realizing that it is a product of Taiwan.  Considering all the health risks from eating foods made in China, I don't think I can trust the ingredients used in this product.  As I understand, Taiwan, Japan, and Korea, all import many food ingredients from China, and they have found many harmful chemicals in them (I am not even including those that are unsanitary, i.e. made from sewer water).  So what guarantee is there that this product do not contain carcinogens or other harmful chemicals?  FDA do not, and cannot, test every single foreign product coming into U.S.          Eat at your own risk.
