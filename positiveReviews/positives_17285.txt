If you're looking for real Vietnamese pho, this isn't what you're looking for. The noodles are much heavier than what I'm used to, and the taste isn't quite right.          But with all that said, this is a pretty tasty bowl of instant soup. It's definitely a step up from cup o noodle or ramen noodle packs, but still lacks something that'd you'd get from just making the dish yourself (I think the freeze dried vegetables don't have as much flavor, and the noodles aren't as good as fresh noodles).          If you like instant soups, ramen noodles, or any of that stuff, I strongly recommend checking this out, you won't be disappointed.
