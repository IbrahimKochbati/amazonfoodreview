This is one of the best new products I have ever tried in a long time.....These are delicious chips, they taste like chips, ( not styrofoam) and are all natural !     The Barbeque are outstanding, as are the plain, sour creme and onion, salt and pepper. I don't love the Cheddar or the Salt and vinegar, they are a bit strong.          If you are on weight watchers each bag is 2 points, and are a great find to cover the crunchy salty crave, If you are not on weight watchers, you will still enjoy them. My husband loves them, my co workers love them, kids love them. They can not believe their Mom is allowing them to eat a bag of chips a day!          Overall an excellent product !
