Not too weak, not too strong, it's juuuuuust right     I found these first at my local supermarket. I've been looking for a blend that I could use as my standard every day cup of coffee and, finally, this was it. I've tried so many of the other blends and  ands and they were either harsh and bitter (I know, some people think coffee *should* taste that way!) or too bland and weak. This is smooth but with a nice "coffee"...          ~~~~~~Now if I could only get the decal  easkfast blend for the same price!~~~~~
