In years past, I have eaten instant oatmeal for a quick, easy, hot  eakfast when I am in a hurry. I have eaten various flavors including the  own sugar and maple flavor that was offered here. I have to say that this is not the same product that I am used to from years past.          The maple flavor was bland and chemically, and although it was sweet ish, I really couldn't detect the flavor of  own sugar. It did, however, have a significant amount of sugars in it. When I reviewed the nutritional information I was stunned at just how much sugar was present in the package.          In addition, the portion sizes are almost comical. There is no way that one packet will serve adequately as a meal for  eakfast. It requires, at a minimum, two packets to make a bowl of oatmeal that is sufficient for an average adult male. That provides a significant amount of your daily intake of sugars.          I was not enamored with this product, and would not go out of my way to buy it in the future. However, as part of a variety pack, I would probably have it on hand for those days when I desire oatmeal, but do not have the time to cook it from scratch.
