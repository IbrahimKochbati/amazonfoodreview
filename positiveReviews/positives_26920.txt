I have to get this for my son because it's the only one he likes.  I tried to get him the "Bare Fruit" chips which are in my opinion tastier and also made in the USA but they are definitely hard to eat for a 2 year old (plus the bag doesn't have a Mickey Mouse on it...sigh).  So, these are good and easy to eat and all is great if the severely faulty Chinese quality controls don't fail yet again.  It worries me that these come  from a country that has sent us deadly toys, deadly toothpaste, deadly baby formula, deadly dog food and treats, amongst many others, but hopefully he'll outgrow these ones quickly.
