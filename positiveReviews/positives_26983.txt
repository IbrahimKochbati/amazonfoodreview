It is tender like the other guys have said, I like mine crunchy and harder, but it's not terrible.  For the price product you get a pretty good deal considering how much jerky sells for at gas stations and stores.  I recommend it.          Hickory:  I just tested this flavor out.  The original is much much better I think.
