I completely agree w Grace Brunelle's comments. This the perfect dessert tea. I have given up sugar, but love coconut, and this is the perfect replacement. The smell in the bag is intoxicating, but it mellows to a soft vanilla almond coconut smooth sweetness when  ewed. I have many excellent teas in my collection, but this beats many of them, especially if you are craving something sweet. Thank you Lana, please keep making (and quickly shipping) this fantastic tea!
