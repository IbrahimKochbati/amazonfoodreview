As a mom to a child with severe peanut and tree nut allergies, it was quite challenging to find raw pumpkin seeds that were free of allergen cross contamination concerns (the same is true for raw sunflower seeds, something I also purchased from Gerbs).  The pumpkin seeds worked wonderfully and tasted great in the recipes where I needed wanted raw seeds    our bag emptied too quickly!  It's a relief to find another source for safe, allergy friendly food for our family.  Gerbs also is great to work with; one of our bags arrived to our home already opened, spilling most of the bag of seeds inside the packing box.  Gerbs responded immediately to my e mail by shipping a new bag via priority mail.
