THESE ARE CHINESE NUTS, NOT AMERICAN.     I was deceived.     The country of origin is listed as "America" on the product's Amazon page.     However, when I received the nuts, they looked just like the Chinese nuts I had obtained from another vendor.     I checked with J&D (something I should have done before ordering) and was told the nuts are indeed Chinese.     I see from previous critiques on this page that I am not the only person who     was misled by the information on the Amazon product page.     Of course, there is a disclaimer on the page.     "Let the buyer beware."     Let the Amazon buyer be doubly beware.
