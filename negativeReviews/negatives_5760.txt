I've been trying to find treats that have no sugar, are low in fat and made in USA for my diabetic yorkie poo. Thought I'd found them. Search Amazon with made in USA dog treats and see this product appear on the list. Go to Smokehouse's website and red that only SOME of their CHICKEN products have product of China on the label. So by omission I think, OK it's duck, NOT chicken so it's made in USA. I order them. My dog loves them. I come back to Amazon to buy more and notice something I missed the first time: someone has written a review saying they're made in China. I check my package and sure enough, it days product of china. I don't know who to be more angry with: Amazon for listing it as USA when I search. Smokehouse for misleading me on their website, or ME for not reading the label after it got here.
