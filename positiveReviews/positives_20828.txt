Let me start off by saying that these product by Jack Links are very attractively priced and fulfill a specific snacking need for me. When I read that these were bulk packed and that I would not have all this additional packaging to dispose of, I was really pleased. I am not a conservationist extroadinaire or particularly green, but there is no reason for something like this to have to be ind. wrapped. I always keep reusable containers around for when I tote a snack with me or send one with a family member, it just makes sense. These dried meat snacks will not get ruined by being opened and dried out a little further!          The taste is totally what I expected compared to ind. wrapped store purchased items. I will definitely repeat!
