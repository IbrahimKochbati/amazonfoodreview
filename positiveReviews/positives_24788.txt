The Wabash valley purple popcorn is really good & a lot fewer hulls than the regular grocery store  and. It is the favorite in our house! However, if you go to the company's own website you can buy the 6 lb bag for $8.99   almost twenty dollars cheaper than here! You will have to pay shipping, but even with the shipping it is still cheaper than the amazon price.
