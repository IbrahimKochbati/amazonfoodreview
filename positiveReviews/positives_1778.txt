I am a middle aged runner and take this cherry concentrate to help my recovery time between long races.  This works better than Ibuprofen and is all natural.  After each long run I take a couple tablespoons with my Gatorade and my muscles recover quicker (I experimented with not taking it).  I love this stuff.
