Giving the other 17 bags of these to the local food shelf just seems too cruel, better to throw them away.          I don't know what good the 'popping' does except make them sort of hot. They're too salty, have a hideous flavor, taste nothing like pork rinds. They don't even taste as good as _bad_ pork rinds. They're also loaded with chemicals I want to avoid (probably part of the source of the hideous flavor).
