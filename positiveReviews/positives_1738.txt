I'm on my first jar of this, and am really enjoying what it adds to my "concoctions"   vegetarian one pan mix ups of onions, garlic, vegetables, usually tofu, rice or pasta or quinoa, sometimes olives or capers.     I may have purchased it at Uwajimaya, when on sale...I will be buying many more jars of this mixed spice paste.  It's not really a paste   more liquid, with easily identifiable basil leaves.  I highly recommend this chili paste.
