The Beaba Multiportion Freezer Tray is one of our favorite baby products.  We use a steamer and a food processor to make baby food.  We put the food in one of these freezer trays, freeze for a couple of hours, and then pop the food out and store it in the freezer in Ziplock bags, labeled with the type of food and the date.          I saw a previous comment that the serving sizes were too large.  Um, no they are not.  If you want less   don't fill the cup all the way.  Crazy how that works!  I fill the cups to the top, and my son eats almost the entire serving.  I am glad that the cups are as big as they are.          Clean up is a  eeze   we don't put it in the dishwasher, we just run it under hot water.          To prepare the frozen cubes, I pop them in the microwave for 15 seconds   then stir.  Another 15 seconds, and another stir.  Sometimes, another 10 seconds if I want to serve it warm.          Great product for those who want to make cooking their own baby food even easier.
