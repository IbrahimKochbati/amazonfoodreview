When they say good condition they mean it. My bonsai came in great condition. It was on top of newspaper with styrofoam  filled to the top. It was even tightly wrapped with bubble wrap. Keep in mind that they really mean it when they say each tree is different. The tree i got was smaller than i expected it to be. But i dont know much about bonsais. And it came in a cream pot with moss. Which i love. SO when ordering a bonsai try not to get your hopes up because like i said each is different. THe one in the picture is just for to show you the type. For a four year old the price is pretty resonible. Most go in the thousands.
