Unfortunately, I am conflicted with my purchase.          Although the final product was quite good, 4 stars. The quality of the delivery is why they lost an additional star. I opened the Amazon box to find that there was hot chocolate powder coming out of the Grove Square packaging. I opened it to find that 2 of the K Cups weren't sealed properly on top and were spilling into the box. I inspected both the Amazon package and the Grove Square both of which had no visible exterior damage.          I was disappointed with both Grove Square for the quality of their product and as a result I am not sure I would buy this product again.
