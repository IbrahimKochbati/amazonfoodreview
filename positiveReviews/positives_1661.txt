I purchased this at my local health food store and I am enjoying it immensely.  The juice has a nice, robust texture, and it is not overly salty. The flavor is amazingly fresh and refreshing.     I combine it with Odwalla flash pasteurized 100% carrot juice for a well above average vegetable juice that is a good energy booster and makes for a great alternative to orange juice or other sweet juices.     Enjoy!
