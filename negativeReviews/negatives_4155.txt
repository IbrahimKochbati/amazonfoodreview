I like this product because it is low in calories and it  produces a smooth PB of good quality, if you follow the instructions.          However, it is not as tasty as any other peanut butter, especially the commercial ones such as Jiff, Skippy, etc. And it does not satiate you in the same way, since it doesn't have the fat.          I happen to like natural PB and this one tends to resemble their taste. I will conyinue to buy it for what it is and despite the price.
