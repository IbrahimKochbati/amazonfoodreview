Having recently purchased a single cup coffee maker, we discovered Green Mountain and their delicious varieties of coffee.  I love the Island Coconut flavor so much it is now a staple in our household with all other flavors taking a 2nd seat.  The roast of the coffee is wonderful and really lets the coconut shine through.  Try it with a little Chocolate Coffee Mate Creamer and you'll swear you were having a decadent treat straight from the Islands...  YUM!!!
