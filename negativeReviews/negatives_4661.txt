Dash loves it. Jasper does not. Dash Hoovered both his bowl and Jasper's, while Jasper took two bites and then moved over to the kibble bowl. We've tried three different flavors so far, and the verdict has been the same. So safe to say, not ALL cats want to eat "people food." I don't know much about this product except what's on the label. The fact that it's a product of Thailand concerns me a bit    I don't know what their standards are for pet food, and after the scandal with the lead in Chinese manufactured toys, well, I'm a little skeptical. It's also an expensive product. Since I don't have a consensus among the house felines, I doubt I will purchase any more of this product.
