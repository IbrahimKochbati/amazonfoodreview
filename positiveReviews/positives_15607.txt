I haven't tried this product myself, although it does smell yummy and is marketed as "People Food for Cats."  Our cat seems to like it better than her regular canned food, Fancy Feast.  Nutritionally it seems on a par, but at more than a buck a can I wonder whether "people food for cats" is really "ploy for people who think their cats are people."          It is nice to know that, if we're snow bound for a few days, we can eat the cat's food.
