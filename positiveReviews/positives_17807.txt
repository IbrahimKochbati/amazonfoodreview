I think some reviewers must have got into a bad batch, or maybe did not read the directions.  I found this quite easy to prepare (fill water to the fill line, clearly marked, and microwave for 3 minutes 30 seconds).  The topping should be heated for no more than 30 seconds.  I found that the flavor was very good.  It will not compare with good Chinese take out, but is OK for a quick lunch if you don't have time to go out.  It is listed as having 13 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber.  It has 600 mg of sodium which is somewhat lower than competing  ands.  Overall, this is the best  and that I have found.  I usually add something like a fresh apple after the microwave meal.          For those worried about the environment, the steamer tray (with lid) can be saved and reused for preparing instant rice or other meals at home.          An alternative meal is the Healthy Choice Sweet and Sour Chicken which I have also tried.
