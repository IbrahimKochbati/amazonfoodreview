I bought this for my 3 month old puppy, thinking it would keep her busy and entertained. It took her about 20 minutes to figure out that she could lay in her bed with the bottle tilted against the side, and the food would keep coming out if she just moved it periodically. I ended up giving the toy away because she was able to be too lazy with it. I gave the toy 4 stars, though, because I doubt this would happen with most dogs. Quite frankly it shocked the heck out of me when I saw what she was doing.
