Ginger Peach Tea has the most amazing peach smell.  Who does not love peach?  It feels so luxurious to smell and sip a sun ripened peach.  Even though I'm down South, I enjoy it warm or hot all year long.  (Thank the Lord for air conditioning!)  The warmth enhances the odor and thus the flavor.  It's also good cold.  It has become my favorite tea.        "
