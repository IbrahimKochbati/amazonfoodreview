Our Shiz Tzu, Kodiac, was having allergy problems, causing Kodiac to chew on his paws, to the point of bleeding.  We were told about Blue Buffalo. We tried the Lamb and Rice, and Kodiac, loves it and has since stopped chewing on his paws.  We love the wonderful products that Blue Buffalo uses for thier pet food, it very nutritus! I would highly recommend Blue Buffalo pet food for all those who wish to feed thier pets the very best!
