These are a great grab and go snack that satisfy.  I love pop corn but don't eat it that much because my husband hates my  eath while I am eating it at the movies, so I take Grandpa Po's Originals instead and he keeps hogging the bag!  I know soy beans are healthy for you and this is the only way I enjoy to eat them.  I love these!!!
