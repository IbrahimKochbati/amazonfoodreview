It may be unfair for me to rate this one star for something that I should have noticed beforehand, but so be it. I bought these beans as part of my preparation for moving overseas. I was able to get most everything I needed locally but wanted some beans and ordered them here. I didn't look at the receipt until I got settled in Nigeria and the bulk shipment arrived. Imagine my shock at realizing I'd paid $26.21 for the beans and $20.89 for shipping on them. And this was with the "We've shipped this part of your order separately at no extra cost"!          If you've got Prime this may be worth the convenience but otherwise, don't bother.
