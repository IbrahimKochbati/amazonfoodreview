This is my first experience with antioxidant rich white tea.  Also, I like the fair trade and organic labels.  Since I prefer mild teas, the subtle, honey like sweetness and floral, fruity notes of white rose tea are immediately pleasing.  A stronger  ew intensifies the rose flavor, but the tea remains smooth without bitter tannins often found in green and black teas.  The white tea and rose blend is exquisite   a wonderful, soothing treat by itself or with dessert.          This has become my favorite tea!
