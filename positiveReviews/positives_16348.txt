My Pug puppies absolutely love these bones.  The only negative aspect is that they get sticky & leave a green film that dries to a green crust on their front legs & paws (& whatever they're laying on, usually the sofa!)  Long after the bone has been chewed to a little nub & swallowed, my beautiful girls are licking their paws & staring at me, begging for another with their big, sad eyes.  Even though my puppies are only 12 lbs & just under 8 months old, I give them the regular size.  The smaller ones just don't last long enough with my power chewers.  I usually try to wrestle the small end from my girls before they get swallowed, as I do with EVERY treat they get, but I'm rarely successful.  They have the habit of swallowing pieces that seem far too large for them, but I've never had a problem with these bones.  I've never had any pieces reappear later (in any form) or had any blockage or choking problems.  I'm fully convinced that the bones dissolve quickly & safely in their tummies.     A lot of people have negative things to say about these treats, even our vet has a note about these specific bones causing "digestive upset" on his website, but I have had nothing but wonderful experiences (since purchasing washable slipcovers for our furniture!)     If you're worried about trying these treats, I'd suggest giving a larger size than is called for & observing your fur child like any good parent should.          Common sense for all pet owners:  Take the end of any treat away before it can be swallowed.  If you haven't already, ask your vet to teach you the doggie heimlich maneuver & doggie CPR, just in case.
