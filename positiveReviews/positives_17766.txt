As a young kid my Mom always made us this Italian Soup for     Sunday dinner as a starter.  At that time she used the Goodman's     extra fine noodles.  Now that I am diabetic, we have tried     the Manischewitz  and and you can't beat them!  Don't hesitate     to buy the fine or xtra fine for your soups   yummy!
