I have to give my lab mix 6 capsules a day. This being the dog that can somehow spit out the teeniest tiniest pill no matter how much good stuff is wrapped around the medication, I was thrilled to find this product. The capsules I have to give her are actually too big for this pocket (hence 4 stars instead of 5) but I can moosh the pill pocket around the capsule well enough that she's eaten the pill pocket and looking for more before she realizes that there's medication hidden inside. With only 30 pill pockets in each 7.9oz pouch, I'll definitely have to buy in bulk. I'm saving so much time and energy and wasted medication; I'd definitely recommend these to anyone who has a dog who hates takes their meds.
