This is my first review ever on Amazon, but this product deserves attention. I have eaten this product for 5 7 days a week for an entire year now.  The only time I didn't eat it was when I was on vacation.  Even then, I began to miss it after a week.  This product is amazing, and I've yet to tire of it.  Don't get me wrong, nothing can replace hash owns for  eakfast in the morning in terms of flavor, but this product has helped me get into the best shape of my life while still enjoying the food I eat.          The versatility of this product is amazing.  If I want a porridge consistency, I add slightly more water. If I want a bowl of something with more chew to it I add slightly less water. If I'm extra hungry , I'll cook it on the stovetop with frozen veggies (carrots, peas, corn,  occoli, etc) with some garlic salt and hot sauce and you've got a savory and healthy dinner. If I'm in the mood for something sweet, I'll add bananas and drizzle in some honey. A bowl of this with an over easy egg and you've got a very filling snack under 250 calories. With a regular meal, I'll sub out my starch (rice, pasta,  ead) with this oatmeal for a healthy alternative. For me, I feel more full with oatmeal as the side dish probably because it fools my stomach with extra water weight but the fiber content keeps me feeling full or at least content until the next meal.          Think outside the box and be open to new flavors and new textures, and you will thoroughly enjoy this product as much as I have, AND feel healthy doing so :)
