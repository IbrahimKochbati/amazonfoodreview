My pug almost died from this product. A piece did not digest and got stuck in his intestinal tract. He had to have emergency surgery and 3000.00 later is now OK. Any knowledgeable pug  eeder will tell you not to feed these to your pug. All the company did was refund me 25.00 for the cost of the product.
