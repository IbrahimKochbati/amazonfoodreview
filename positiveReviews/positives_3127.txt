I bought the Blue Icicle because I had to quickly record some trumpet lines and I didn't have an interface. Well, actually, I did pick up an open box unit that didn't work because they couldn't provide me with the external power supply, so I took it back and got the Icicle as a quick fix that would get me where I needed to go in a timely manner.          Hardware: iMac, dual core 2.0 GHz processor and 4 GB or RAM. OS 10.5.8.     Software: Garage Band.     Mic: Shure SM57.          Pros. For recording trumpet with an SM57 it was perfect. Clear sound, low noise, LOTS of signal. With the gain a little over half way on the Icicle and about 58% in Garage Band I got hot horn lines with gain to spare.  Any hotter and they would have started clipping, so it definitely gave enough signal to get the job done.          Cons. The gain knob has no dial or indicators for how far you have turned it   it has to be done by feel making it almost impossible to duplicate your settings exactly. This could be improved with a knob with an arrow and a marked dial so you can see where it's set. It also feels a bit cheap   it's lightweight and feels almost fragile. Treated with care it's fine, but I doubt it would take much abuse before it would  eak and I have been ultra careful with it because it feels so lightweight and cheap.  I also used it as recommended in the accompanying literature and didn't plug it directly into the back of the mic   I used it with a mic cable.          For what I needed it was perfect   simple plug and play that got good sound into my computer, and it worked well in a pinch.  I just wish it was a little higher quality in terms of construction.  A bit heavier and a better dial for the analog gain, and I would have rated it a full 5 stars but as it is, I can at best give it 4.
