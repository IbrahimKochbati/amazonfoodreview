I bought this sugar because I looking for Swedish pearl sugar, which is used in the baking of fine Swedish cookies. I thought this looked similar, but since there wasn't a reference to determine the scale or size of the sugar pearls, I didn't realize that Belgian pearl sugar is much larger than Swedish pearl sugar.          That said, this product was great. I made some Belgian waffles for the kids using this and we all ate and smacked our lips. We'll be having them again soon since I bought a 5lb bag!          If you're looking for Belgian pearl sugar, look no further. If you're looking for Swedish pearl sugar, look for the Lars  and (which I bought later).
