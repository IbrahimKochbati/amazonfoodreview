I was expecting this to be a weak bodied coffee, but I was pleasantly surprised! I used this in my Keurig with a reusable K cup and it's probably one of the stronger blends I have gotten with the reusable cup.  I tried it without cream or sugar first (I'm normally a 2 and 2 kinda' girl) and even without anything in it, I can drink it.  It's full flavored without the burn and dread of serious heartburn half way through the cup. With cream and sugar, the flavor was even better and super smooth going down. If you're looking for a morning pick me up without the afternoon heartburn, this is a great full flavored choice!
