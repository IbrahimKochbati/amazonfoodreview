I first saw this product, Panda Licorice, at the Memphis, TN zoo at the Panda exhibit.  I thought it was just a promotion for the zoo. I bought some. It was the really good old fashion black Licorice I used to get when I was a kid. Not the chalky no taste stuff most is today. While at the Norway part of Epcot at Disney FL this year I found the same thing. Then I realized it is a company  and name made in Finland not a zoo promotion. I bought some more. It cost $5 per 7 oz box. When I got home I checked several websites and Amazon was the cheapest. Pack of 12 boxes total cost shipped to me(there was a free shipping deal) Came to $2.50 per 7 oz box. It is totally delicious. When this is gone I will surly order more.
