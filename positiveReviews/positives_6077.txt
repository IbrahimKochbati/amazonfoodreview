This stuff is gold for the hot spicy food enthusiast.  I put it on most everything other than  eakfast (Grape Nuts).  I really think you get way more value from this than any hot sauce in a bottle...  This is basically what is in that fancy bottle hot sauce, just without a fancy label.  Try it.  16oz goes a long way!
