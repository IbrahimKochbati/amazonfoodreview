The flavor of this reminded me somewhat of candy, but I can't recall which one. It's fruity but not too sweet. I'd give this to my kids over a regular sugar laden soda.          Ingredients include: 100% (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry, and strawberry juice concentrates) natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C).
