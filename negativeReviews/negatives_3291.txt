Ordered OVEN ROASTED TURKEY NUGGETS*** for the first time. Meat is dry. Expiration date is too close; received today, SEPT 9, 2011, expiring NOV 21, 2011.          In the past, have had very good experience with the Chicken Teriyaki nuggets. Jack Link's used to use dark meat. Jack Link's changed the recipe to white meat and the nuggets do not taste as rich any more.          *** Very disappointed with Amazon's approach on linking ALL Jack Link's nuggets together. Meaning: If you post a review for the Chicken Teriyaki ones, you can NOT post one for the flaming chicken, turkey over roasted, etc.?! And the same review will show up under any and all of them. I contacted Amazon and customer service first tried to convince me I was doing something wrong. On the third e mail, the senior CS guru indicated the nugget products are all linked together and nothing will be done about the issue.
