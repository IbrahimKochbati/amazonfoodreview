I am a huge hot sauce fan, on top of being a huge health fanatic. I decided to try this out because I heard about it on my favorite bands website, the Offspring. As this is made by their lead singer, I was intrigued. The thing that made me want to try this the most is the great reviews and the fact that it has a low amount of sodium compared to many other hot sauces.          I was not dissapointed at all! This stuff is absolutely delicious, I seriously put it on everything. I keep a bottle in my office with me for my lunch everyday. I seriously can't get over how good this stuff is. It reminds me of a more tasty taco bell hot sauce initially, then the tangyness kicks in, next thing you know the burn of the spicy habanero is there. Seriously is delicious and not just spicy enough to not be too spicy for someone who isn't big on spicy food. I highly recommend this hot sauce for its delicious taste and its low sodium.          Things I put it on...           Egg Whites      Talapia      chicken      rice          Makes all the plain tasting healthy food I eat bearable and delicious!
