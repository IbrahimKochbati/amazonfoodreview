Our two dogs love this product, and we love the fact that it's not loaded with chemical preservatives and fillers.  The fact that the pieces are irregular is not a drawback and is not surprising.  I do cut up the larger pieces as I don't want to give them too much at once.  The prospect of getting one of these treats makes them much more receptive to training and just coming when you call.  Also, we find the largest size very economical as you don't pay for shipping.
