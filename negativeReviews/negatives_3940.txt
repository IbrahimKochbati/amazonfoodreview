Overly sweet w  a slight fizzy touch on the tongue. My husband and 4 year old appeared to like it, but overall I could barely take a couple of gulps.          It reminded me too much like candy.          I would not recommend this item personally, but some may find the drink enjoyable w  the combination of juice and carbonate.
