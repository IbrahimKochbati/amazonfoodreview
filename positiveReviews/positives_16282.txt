Greenies are great dental chews that keep my dog with minimal plaque.     My 3 yr old loves it.     The price of the 96 Teenie Pack (or more) from Amazon is unbeatable.          Of note, my dog didn't like it very much when he tried it the first time when he was 2 months old. He grew to love it more and more. So don't give up and give it to someone else if your puppy is not crazy about them from the first day.
