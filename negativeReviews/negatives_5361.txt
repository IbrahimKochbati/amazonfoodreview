While I like my coffee strong, I am slightly susceptible to acidic coffee   just not enough to have to seek out alternatives. If you are to that point, I would recommend this coffee as a good alternative, but if you are not quite to that point, this is not a substitute for great coffee. It's good enough to compete with the pre ground mass market coffees but doesn't match up to the more premium beans. It has a mild, nuttier flavor than I'm used to, and a hint of aftertaste comparable to a diet beverage.          What confuses me is that the description claims this is a good choice for decaf drinkers looking for a more robust flavor. I'm not sure I agree with that, but what confuses me is: is this decaf or not? I didn't think so, but this claim makes it vague.          20 minute later update: oops, definitely caffeinated... gotta run!
