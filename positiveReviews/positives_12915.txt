LOVE IT!!!  I have so far tried the watermelon, the cherry and now kiwi and this is my favorite one. It is all fruit juice and it is tangy, fruity and wonderful! It has in it the following in this order: 100%juice sparkling water, apple,grape,kiwi,acerola cherry,raspberry and strawberry. The raspberry adds a little more zing then the other flavors but they are all really excellent. You can taste a little of all the fruits in this drink but the raspberry, strawberry and kiwi jump out the most. I would recommend this to anyone. Would make a great mixed drink but it's so good you probably won't get that far. Really good stuff!
