This food has worked fairly well for my two not quite senior feral rescues, one of whom has CRF and one of whom has IBD (eating pigeons and food left on the ground apparently isn't so good for young kitties' digestive systems and other internal organs, I guess).  It is a lower protein and phosphorus food, but the first ingredient is real chicken (unlike some renal foods that are made with mostly by products).  It also doesn't cost an arm and a leg, compared to other special foods, and my CRF kitty, who often rejects a perfectly delicious food once she has tasted it in reverse, has been willing to keep eating this even though she's been sick on it more than once.
