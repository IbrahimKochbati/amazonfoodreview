I never eat bars but I do a lot of weight loss programs with hypnosis for clients so I bought a bar in every flavor to taste assuming I would not like it. A friend does marketing for a protein bar and had me taste it and it was inedible!! To my surprise, I thought they were delicious and now recommend it to my clients.     I found them satisfying and fun to eat and a fair price point!
