Ok, I'll admit, I do bake a lot, so maybe my expectations were too high....My first impression was that it was a nice big cookie, but it didn't smell like an oatmeal cookie.  Next I  oke off a bit, thinking, ok, soft, usually means butter or shortening, so I didn't expect the cookie to crumble...ok, I was disappointed right there, but the real disappointment came at the first bite.  I don't know, but this did not taste like any oatmeal cookie I've ever tasted....no cinnamon or  own sugar flavor, just....well, kind of sawdusty.  I couldn't make out the almond and barely tasted the chocolate.  I think on every level this cookie was not a winner.  If I was absolutely desperate to eat something I would probably eat one I suppose, but I definitely would not buy these.          Overall, no taste, terrible texture and a disappointment from start to finish. Quaker would do well to go back to the drawing board on this one and make a chewier, soft cookie with a bit of flavor to it.
