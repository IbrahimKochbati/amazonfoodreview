This has been a boon for my digestive system! I take 3 tablets twice daily    morning (after  eakfast) and evening (after dinner). I haven't had any problems whatsoever for at least the last couple of months of taking the Hemp Oil capsules! I plan to continue taking them for a long time into the future!          BTW, I started taking these capsules because Hemp Oil contains essential Omega 6 and Omega 3 fatty acids in the 3:1 "balanced" ratio, and the capsules don't have the "weird" after taste that plain Hemp Oil does.
