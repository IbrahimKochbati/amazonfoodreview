Not all cats are lactose intolerant and my kitties have gotten real cream now and again as a treat.  I thought I would give this stuff a try just out of curiosity.  I was not prepared for the reaction.  Both my cats turn into meowing, begging lunatics as soon as they see the box.  They both recognize the box when I pull it out of my grocery bag.  It is absolutely insane.  My local Petco has stopped carrying this, which is very sad because shipping these little suckers is expensive.  Amazon... please start carrying this stuff!!  Until then I will have to pay for the outrageous shipping because there might be a cat mutiny at my house if I run out!          UPDATE:  Petco is obviously stocking this stuff again!  Yay!
