My Mom and Dad loved the price, and I just think these are way yummy. Keep 'em coming I say! As for delivery time, they ordered them and we had them in a box within a few days. Not quite as fast as the pet store, but they say for less money   even with shipping. Personally, I need them more frequently than my parents give them to me, please can I have another greenie, I love minty fresh  eath! I'll be good! by Alex a Vizsla
