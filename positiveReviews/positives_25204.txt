There's maple syrup and there's maple syrup. My wife and I are from the East Coast (she from Vermont) and we've tried maple syrup from other regions and those just don't measure up to a Vermont syrup. Although this product does say some of the raw materials come from Canada, this is an excellent example of a Vermont Maple Syrup. As a "Grade B" product, it has the rich, deep bodied flavor and color one would expect, but this one makes pancakes and waffles a different experience entirely. I would recommend the Coombs product highly to anyone who's looking for a top quality maple syrup.
