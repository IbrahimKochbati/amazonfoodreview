My dogs very much enjoy getting treats or food out of this toy (they enjoy getting treats out of anyting).  I will say this is a fairly simple and easy toy to get treats out of.  All the dog need do is move one star point and all the points underneath are exposed at once. Plastic is easy to clean if needed.
