I used to eat these all the time when I was in Japan. They didn't cost nearly that much though. In Japan they're about $4. You can get them for about $5 at [...]          They're a lot of fun, I sent a few to my niece and nephews. Definitely fun for kids. Asian food grocer also discounts if you buy more. I'd check them out before buying these.
