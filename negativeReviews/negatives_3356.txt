Was making homemade Farmer's cheese for one of my cooking videos. Had GF toast points, grapes, and these crackers on a plate. Slid a knife full of cheese across the top...all going well... and then took my first bite on camera, had to fake a smile. These were very dry at first, and then turned rather pastey in my mouth. Took them home, noone in the family would touch them after one try. I ended up giving these to my active duty hubby who took them to the base. He described them later on as "hard to choke down, even with milk" crackers! Nice try though. Keep it up. You'll get it.          Other products by Glutino, like the preztels, are delish. Someone needs to come up with a good cheddar cheese cracker. Then I'd be happy.
