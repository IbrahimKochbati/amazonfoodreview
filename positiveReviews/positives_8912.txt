I just took out my freshly baked whole wheat and rye  ead out of oven, waited until it cooled down.. cut a slice and put some of that awesome ghee on top .. that is all no jam no nothing.. and this is definetly the taste I have been looking for. Pure natural butter taste, just even a little would do the trick. Wholesome butter taste just like my grandmom used to make back at home. I am not Indian, but still this is the pure and healty butter I remember from my childhood. I am not a typical review writer, but this Ghee deserved an extra effort. My kids love the taste as well.. We will never buy that famous store butter sticks anymore.
