I bought this because it shows that the Hazelnut Dark Roast is part of the mix. It is not. Instead it is the regular version of GMC's Hazelnut. The regular version is weak   I knew it was from past experience, so I would not have bought this product if I had realized it contained their regular hazelnut coffee. Amazon has a terrible time with keeping up with accurate information on their website at least as it pertains to k cups. (I called in w a question about product count for packaging on another occasion due to the price point for the qty shown   their C S people couldn't confirm one way or another. The result   I didn't buy the product from Amazon) You have to change out descriptions and product information and keep it up to date   but instead, I see they put a disclaimer that they are not responsible. That the descriptions and counts may not be accurate. Choosing to make that statement versus the effort of updating their product information doesn't make me want to buy my k cups from Amazon.
