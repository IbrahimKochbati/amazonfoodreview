Well, I'll begin by saying that I was really looking forward to this product. I tried TruVia's erythritol stevia sweetener when I ran out of the stevia sweetener that I used before and wanted to get something instead of plain sugar. I figured that I liked the mix and wanted to try this powder because I had already ordered stevia from amazon. When it got here I used it right away, and did not taste the difference. I was very conservative in adding this to my coffee because I didnt know how sweet it was. After adding 3 large spoonfuls into my coffee I gave up, and I usually add 1 spoonful of sugar to my cup. if you want a sugar free sweetener that you can even make at home, get stevia. I have used it from local health food stores and always ended up with that funny aftertaste from stevia. the one I ordered from amazon, sweetleaf vanilla creme didnt have that aftertaste, and I used 12 drops in my coffee looking for it, typically I only use 4 drops in my coffee.
