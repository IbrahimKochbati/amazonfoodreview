These have good flavor. Plenty of other reviews address that. I also like the thick zipper bag they came in. My only real issue with these is that mine grew mold. I've never had vanilla beans do that before. These seemed unusually moist, so maybe that contributed to the issue. It started as a small spot, but grew so that it was on the ends of most of the beans. I finally got them all out, trimmed off the moldy bits, and froze what was left.          It took 2 3 months for the mold to start, so if you use them quickly maybe that won't be a problem. But, I don't go through them that fast. I've had beans dry out in the past, but this is the first I've seen of mold. If you don't plan to use them within 2 months or so, I recommend keeping them in a fridge, freezer or coming up with some other way to stop the mold before it starts.
