Twinings Variety Pack of Four Flavors, Tea Bags, 20 Count Boxes (Pack of 6) at $17.14 is a STEAL.

It appears that in this variety pack you are getting the following: English Breakfast, Irish Breakfast, Earl Grey and Lady Grey.

So there you are: a world of tea in one neat box, from my ONLY tea providers and lifelong at that. You can visit their site and buy direct; you can examine    "
