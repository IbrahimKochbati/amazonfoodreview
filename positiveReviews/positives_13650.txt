I like this product because it tastes just like sugar.  It is non clumping so it flows very freely.  It doesn't attract water like sugar does so it stays dry even in very humid air.  Some have said that it has a cooling effect like xylitol, which is sometimes undesirable, but if it does, it is very mild to the point that I was not able to perceive it.  To my taste, it is about a half as sweet as sugar so it takes more but I've detected no digestive upset whatsoever, which is not true for many other sugar substitutes.
