My MMJ plants are prone to spider mite infestations and this helps alot. I spray my plants according to directions, twice a week, every week, but I alternate with Safer's Insect Killing Soap. I get great results! A bottle of this concentrate usually lasts me about 6 months at a half gallon of solution once per week. And it's organic too!
