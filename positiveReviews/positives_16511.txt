Our dogs love these.  The vet always compliments us on  ushing the dogs' teeth, but we never have.  (Seriously, if someone has ever accomplished this without the dog making various dramatic escape attempts and trying to eat the toothpaste, please tell me your secret.)  We just give them each one of these every day and a bunch of rawhide to chew on, seems to do the trick.
