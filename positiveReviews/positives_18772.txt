These cookies are simply scrumptious! I gave my mother some as a gift, since she loves lemon flavored desserts. What a hit! They became her instant favorites, and she begged me to get her some more. They are small and round, about the size of a large marble, with a crisp, light consistency that just melts away in your mouth, covered with powdered sugar for sweetness, combined with that tart little zing of lemon. A very elegant and grown up sort of cookie. I love them, too. Highly recommended!
