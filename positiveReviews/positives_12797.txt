Normally, anything with strawberry and kiwi flavor tends to actually be mainly grape juice and taste like over ripe fruit.  Not this one... it's absolutely delicious, not overly sweet, and actually tastes like the fruit pictured on the can.  I like that it is naturally sweetened, using no corn syrup.  It's not too sweet either.  Just tastes like fizzy fresh fruit.  Highly recommended.
