I have two dogs that absolutely love these treats!  The 5lb bag size that I purchased is very convenient and long lasting.  The vendor that I purchased them from is very thorough; several emails were sent updating me on the status of my order and it's upcoming delivery. The price was extremely reasonable.  The best part is the fact that my pups adore these treats and they are good for them to nibble on throughout the day.  A guilt free doggie reward!
