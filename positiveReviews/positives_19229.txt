i have to admit   i was worried this was a big mistake when i first gave this toy to Bacon.  he was confused.  he first tried barking maniacally to get the treats to appear.  he then tried digging into the carpet next to the toy.  i wondered if i'd be able to send the toy back, as there was no way i would pull this toy out again if all it did is prove that my dog is not smart and barks too much.  luckily, within 15 minutes, he successfully unearthed a treat.  it's not an easy toy for him   but it's amazing to me that he has learned how to do it.  he's learned a bit of patience and problem solving.  two things i doubted he'd ever learn.          the yellow plastic parts   we've lost one.  i'm really not sure what Bacon did with it.  i just use that open cubby as the 'easy hole' for him to find a treat in.  Bacon is a schnorkitzu (schnauzer yorkie shihtzu). i imagine larger dogs would chew the yellow parts up pretty quickly.          i'm looking forward to getting another puzzle toy in the future.  i recommend this toy.
