I've tried a bunch of Walden Farms dressings, and this is one of the better ones. It tastes like a decent (not great, but decent) regular thousand island dressing. It makes a good dip for celery. I've given this to people and not told them it's diet dressing, and haven't had anyone ask about it. If it were a non diet dressing I'd give it 3 stars for flavor, but considering the small number of calories (the "zero" on the label means "less than 5 per serving"    thanks, FDA) it's pretty impressive.
