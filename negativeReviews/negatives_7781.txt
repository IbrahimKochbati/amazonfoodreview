We have 3 cats, 2 male and 1 female.  They adjusted great on it, and their stool was quite less smelly :)  BUT after 3 weeks of use our female cat developed a urinary tract infection and the doctor said some cats can't handle the high levels of protein in some foods and higher levels of ash, magnesium, and calcium.  He told us to switch foods immediately.  So we did, the last thing you want is a cat with a uti!  If your cats are sensitive like ours seems to be this isn't the food for you!  But for bigger stronger cats it seemed ok.  Our female cat does fine with table scraps, but she is a petite cat so all the protein and minerals was too much for her.  We switched to Purina Pro Plan chicken, special urinary tract formula and they seem to be adjusting well (all 3!)
