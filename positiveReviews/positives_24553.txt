I use pumpkin in baking and for  eakfasts year round for the taste and nutrition benefits. Going the organic route is SO much better than the stuff that predominates around the holidays. Just looking at the color of the pumpkin in the can you can see the organic is more natural. Farmer's Market is consistently good and buying it on Amazon is cheaper than getting it at Trader Joes or Whole Foods.
