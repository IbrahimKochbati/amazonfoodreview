This is the worst tasting cups of coffee I've had in quite some time. I've had generic instant decaff coffee that tastes better. I don't know if it's their roasting technique, the quality of the beans themselves or the de acicification process, but it leaves you with a very bland tasting cup o'Joe. I was hoping I'd finally found a way to have caffeine again but I guess I'l have to stick with the decaff.
