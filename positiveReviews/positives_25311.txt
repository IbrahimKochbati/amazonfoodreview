I have used CET chews for years as I worked at a vet. They work great to keep your dogs teeth in good shape if you can't  ush their teeth. Make sure to only use them once daily and the chlorhexidine coating them will work to keep their teeth as pearly white as possible! And these were about 1 2 the price they are at a regular veterinarian.
