My cat gets some every morning for  eakfast.  He only gets about 4 tablespoons in a little bowl, but asks for it if I don't put it down in a timely manner.     It's great if your cat likes milk or cream products because it won't upset their gastrointestinal track and satisfies their craving and or need.     The price is right and I always keep some on hand.
