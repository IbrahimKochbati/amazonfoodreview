I hated this K cup and couldn't wait to be done with the box.  (We hate wasting unless toxic.)  So while not toxic, the best I can say for this variety is that it tastes like bitter, yet weak "sock water".  Now, after reading the many good reviews this blend has received, I'm apprehensive to trust the reviews of the other K cup varieties.
