Your basic pretzel  salty and crunchy. They're good, they're organic, and the price is good. The only drawback is the Newman's Own products seem to have highly variable availability. I ordered 3 things at the same time. All were delayed due to availabilty issues; two arrived within about 3 weeks, one hasn't arrived yet (about 1 1 2 months after order).
