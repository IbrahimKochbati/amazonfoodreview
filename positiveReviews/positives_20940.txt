I am a Snapple diet peach tea drinker and when I saw that they had come out with an instant "on the go" I was ecstatic. I was not happy with the flavor or the way it didn't dissolve easily. However this crystal light version is so much better. The flavor is not exactly like the Snapple but it is very pleasant and it dissolves perfectly. I actually use more water to mix it than suggested just to stretch it out a little but it still has a good flavor.
