First thing I did was check the ingredients.  No wheat and no corn.  That's good.  The main ingredients are good animal protein sources.          There were two flavors in the pack I received:  Chicken pot pie and sesame chicken.  The sesame chicken smelled great!  I literally could have been fooled into eating it myself.  It had a high moisture content and the chicken was shredded.  My cat at all the liquid and then went to work on the meat stuff.  Shredded isn't his favorite texture at all, but he finished all 3 oz in good order.          Next was the chicken pot pie.  Decent smell too.  It was very watery though.  My cat didn't seem to mind so why should I?  He ate it all.          Bottom line...good ingredients, cat likes it.  Five paws up.
