My 60 lb 13 month old La ador LOVED this toy but she cracked the top, effectively ruining it, within a few days. I'm not sure what size we had but I'm thinking it must have been the middle size (small?)   it was a good size for her insofar as she was able to fit the whole thing in her and tilt it on its side to let treats out but that's also how she cracked it. I'm going to get the biggest size, which I think will be able to withstand her, but I'm also predicting that she won't like it as much if she can't fit it in her mouth. Too bad they don't make this same toy with a rubber coating.
