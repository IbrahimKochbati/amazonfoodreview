Very tasty chips, healthier alternative to regular chips without compromising on flavor. In fact, the taste is better than most regular chips I've had. Would highly recommend this product! If you had to choose, my favorites were the sea salt and vinegar, followed by salt and pepper. Ironically, the original flavor was my least favorite, probably because I was spoiled by all the flavor the others offer.
