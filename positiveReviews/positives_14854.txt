When it comes to Earl Grey, I am a fan of "sharp" ones, like Williamson Tea, but this tea is extremely good! It has a bit smoky and oily aftertase that is very mild and lingers for a while. A second  ew is especially enjoyable. Plus it's USDA Organic and Fair Trade Certified. I like it more than Two Leaves And A Bud's Earl Grey. I highly recommend this tea!          3.5 months later: I have finished a 3rd can of this delicious loose tea and am going to buy more! Excellent stuff!
