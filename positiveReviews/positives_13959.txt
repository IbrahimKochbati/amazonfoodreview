But it's really expensive. I was disappointed at how small the jar was and how long it didn't last me. But I can't explicitly fault the product for being too good to last.          I add this to protein shakes, my low carb cheesecake, and I eat it straight. So very good. I recommend if you're a PB addict like I am.
