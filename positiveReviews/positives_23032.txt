There are cheaper coffees out there and I have probably tried a good percentage of them.  I always end up coming back to Folgers about it there is just something natural about or maybe I am used to it.  The prices on Folgers can vary greatly in stores and the deal is better on Amazon.  I would recommend it at this price.
