I ordered the pepper one and sent it to my son in Afghanistan. He loved it. He doesn't ask for much when he's deployed but does love jerkey. I bought this because it came in a 1 lb package. He told me this was the best he's ever had and not to buy the Jack Link's any more. Must be really good for him to like it that well.
