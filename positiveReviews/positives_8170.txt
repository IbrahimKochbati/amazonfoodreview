Our beloved Bengal kitty, Isabel, is 13 years old and suffering from kidney stones, which are inoperable in felines. For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she'd eat: "She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years."          So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet sold  ands and repeatedly rejected one national  and and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice: this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she'll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can't resist.          We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it's not the best choice for managing kidney stones, but she's got to eat. (So you won't worry that we're ignoring her renal problems, she's on daily medication and is doing quite well.)          It's not an inexpensive cat food, but its packaging is very convenient and space saving. The Amazon auto ship program is a life saver. The cartons always arrive on time, and the per package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities. Also, our local Target was the only place we could find this exact variety, and now the store no longer carries it. (Remember, our cat demands GIBLETS and GRAVY and accepts no substitutes).          Give autoship a try. The price is better, and you can easily adjust the quantity and frequency of shipment or cancel altogether.
