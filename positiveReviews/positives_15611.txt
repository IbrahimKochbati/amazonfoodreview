Feeding this to my 12 year old cat, she enjoyed the chicken pot pie quite a bit...and went through an entire can in one sitting. (Not sure if this is a good or a bad thing though!) The chinese chicken she ate, but didnt seem thrilled about. Giving a container to two other cat owners produced the same results. So, if I were to buy in the future, which I very well may, I would hope I could buy a carton of the Chicken Pot Pie by itself. But all in all this is quality food, and seemed to sit in my mature cats stomach easily   very important as all pet owners are still very cautious after last years awful pet food poisonings.
