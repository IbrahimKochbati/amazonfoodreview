Whose crazy idea was this?  Someone who used to work for Bear Sterns or AIG selling derivatives?  Or is this Bernie Madoff's way of getting back at us all from jail?  Why take a nice juice like Kiwi Berry and add carbonation to it?          Not only is is toooo sweet for a refreshing drink the carbonation makes me want to lose it.  The two things you can say for it is that it's ONLY 8.3 ounces (why not 8.2 or 8.7) or 245 ml (why not 250), and the can is returnable for a 5 cent deposit.          It's not that this small amount has 33grams of sugar, it's that it's like chewing gum, the flavor lasts and lasts and lasts...rinse out with mouthwash or beer to get rid of it.  Yuch.
