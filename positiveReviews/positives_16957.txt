My 35 pound pit bull mix chewed the rope in half in less than 20 minutes (I knew it didn't stand a chance), but she still has a blast with it. I put two ping pong balls inside so it's not too easy to get the treats out. Often she would rather chew on the rubber around the bottle neck than try to get the contents, and it's stood up pretty well. It does have a couple bits and nubs missing.          Also, it your dog is playing with it on a hard surface, it is LOUD! For me, this is a small price to pay for knowing my girl is having fun with something other than my sneakers.
