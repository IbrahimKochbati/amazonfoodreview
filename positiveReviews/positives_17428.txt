If you like coffee, but don't need the caffeine, check this product out. Works with any coffee maker. I used it in my espresso machine and make my own latte with chocolate almond milk, a little stevia, and a few shots of this Teeccino. Alkalizing and and inflammatory properties. It really does taste good plain (black) too.
