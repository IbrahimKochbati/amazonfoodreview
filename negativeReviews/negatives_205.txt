I introduced my daughter to Earth's Best Organic Turkey Vegetable Dinner at 4 months. A bit early, but she's advanced, as she was 6 weeks overdue.  She loved it at first.  But, I bought every other kind and now this is her least favorite.  I've tried some of it as well.  Of all of them, this is also my least favorite.
