I couldn't find my dog's favorite treat anywhere in any of my local pet stores or grocery stores.  I decided to check out Amazon to see if by chance, I could find them here.  Sure enough!  I was able to purchase them with no problem at all.  Shipping was quick and the price was good!  Recommend to everyone who gives their dogs dental treats!
