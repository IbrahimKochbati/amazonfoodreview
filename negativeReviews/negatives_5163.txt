Dog: 10 month old Lab  GSD mix who's an aggressive chewer          Good:     concept          Bad:      LOUD toy, keep in mind your dog has to drop this thing to get the treats to pop out and it is made of hard plastic      NOT durable. Tug insert (plastic)  oke off after about a week (should have used a rope here). I may do this myself but I'm still debating if I want to hear this thing get dropped over & over & over & over again...
