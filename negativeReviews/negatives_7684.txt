Oatmeal cookies can be found in pretty much any store, in a variety of  ands. So, in order to get my attention it has to be something pretty special. This, is just average, but at a premium price.          For starters make sure to pay attention to the box. There are only 6 cookies in a rather large box. Now, flip the box around and look at the ingredients. When I hear oatmeal and almond cookie I expect something at least mildly healthy. To put it frankly the nutrition value of these cookies is lacking.          The taste is ok. Nothing really special about it. It didn't seem overly flavorful, but I can't say I disliked them either. The best thing I can say is, it's a good indication of quality if I would get them again. Sadly, I don't see this being my first or second choice when I am looking to buy some cookies. Not even in my top ten if I was being 100% honest.
