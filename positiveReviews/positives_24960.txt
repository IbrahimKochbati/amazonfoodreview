Rocky is a beautiful Collie but a very picky eater with a sensitive stomach.  He will not eat store bought dog bones and I have made him home made ones in the past.  However, he loves Happy Hips and they agree with his sensitive stomach, so they are not only good for him but apparently taste good also.
