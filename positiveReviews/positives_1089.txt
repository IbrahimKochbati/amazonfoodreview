I was quite skeptical about stevia at first, but tried it with another  and and thought there wasn't much difference in taste and I felt better about using a more natural product than the other artificial sweeteners out there. I then started looking at getting a bulk container and happened upon this product. I now have purchased this same product 4 times and am quite pleased. The product is a bit more concentrated and we are using less of the product in our drinks and cooking than other competitors.          The deliveries are always quick and we have not had any issues at all with the product or packaging.
