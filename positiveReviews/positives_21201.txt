I have been using these tablets for years and as another poster stated my market also stopped carrying them, I was getting them from Efood pantry but again cannot get them there.These things are great! I also make ice coffee in the summer with 2 tabs just crush them 1st or they don't dissolve well. I have tried the Carmel flavor but nothing can replace the dutch choc. and for "no calories" you cant beat it.
