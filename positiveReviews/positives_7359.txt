Before I bought this product I read several reviews saying that this stuff was amazing, that it made everything super sweet. So I thought I would try it out, and it is pretty cool, but not worth the outrageous price. About one minute after I sucked the tab I tried eating numerous things like limes, lemons, and oranges, just to name a few. It did make everything that's sour sweet. Not to the point of "oh my god, it's amazing" but it did work. So to sum this up, this stuff was good for a one time deal, but after doing it a few times it lost it's appeal.
