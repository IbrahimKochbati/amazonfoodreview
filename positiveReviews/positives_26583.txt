OK, so I'm a high school English teacher and a total Caribou addict.  There is not one in my city, but whenever I travel to Minneapolis, I hit a Caribou at least three times a day.  My school li arian got a Keurig coffee maker and made me a cup of this stuff.  I was immediately hooked!  I started buying boxes of these K Cups so I could enjoy Caribou coffee all day long while teaching, and now students see a smile on my face, cup in hand, and my coffee fueled lessons have been taken to a whole new level.  While I'm  ewing my coffee, I communicate more closely with the li arian, and this has resulted in some collaborative efforts between myself and the li arian, particularly concerning research, which in turn positively impacts the education of my students.  I savor every delicious drop of my Caribou coffee while the other teachers choke down the weak and bitter rat pee in the teachers' lounge.  Guess who looks forward to coming to work every morning?  Thanks, Keurig, for making Caribou a part of my daily life!
