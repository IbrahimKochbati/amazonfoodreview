Hint, pour on a bit of seafood sauce with horseradish in it and microwave a few seconds to warm up.          I just tried a can of these for  eakfast this morning.  There were about 9.5 ounces of actual sardine in there and the rest was sauce.  Still not bad considering that's the equivalent of just over two cans of sardines for somewhere under three dollars if you buy them 24 at a time.          The fish weren't the freshest tasting I've had, but they weren't that bad either.  At least they're the medium size sardine fish and not the herring you find in the really cheap sardine cans.          Here's way to beat the recession and get your protein and calcium.
