Wow, I had high hopes for a great addition to my low carb diet, but these rinds were very disappointing.  Tried several bags, but could not get the cooking time right.  Taste was dreadful, texture downright rocky.  I guess I'll stick to off the shelf rinds.  Won't be getting these again.  Can't recommend, and would warn of anyone asking for my opinion.
