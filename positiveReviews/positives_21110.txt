Our 7 year old boxer is allergic to many store  and dog foods. We spent months trying to find one that didn't make him sick. The solution in the end was to make his dog food ourselves. It was quite a procedure since he's 70 pounds, but Dr. Harvey's food has made that SO much easier. I prepare it according to directions, add the protein and then divide it into his containers for his meals. I freeze lots ahead so I don't have to make it every day. If I had small dog, making it every day would be easy, but for large dogs, I find it easier to make a large batch and freeze ahead, taking them out a day or so before needed. Best dog food ever.
