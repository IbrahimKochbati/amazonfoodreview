I have bought all of the various flavors of Caring Candies.  They are well made and look great.  Most of the candies are what I would call blander.  (I think Americans are used to more flavoring added to their candies).  But This licorice one is  imming with great licorice flavoring.  I know with sugar free candies you never know what you are going to get.  But if you like licorice, you will like these.  Even my husband (who does lots of sugar) really likes these.
