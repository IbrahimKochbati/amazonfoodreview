I have one cat who cannot tolerate THIS PARticular Fancy Feast Salmon Product. It is only the Shredded one that gets her, but get it does.     Everytime she eats it, she throws it up all over everywhere. My shoes, the white rug and gratefully, the tile.          She ate this for several years with occasional upsets, but now it is EVERY time. No more for this family. I realize that this occurs on an individual basis USUALLY.          But, I also have one younger kitty who is at the "occasional upset" stage. So, if you have a kitty with a tender tummy, I would avoid this!!
