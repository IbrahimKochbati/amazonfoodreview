These bars by Pamela's Products are OK.  They are very chewy and moist.  Also very stick to your teeth.  However, taste is limited.  There is a general bland undertone, overall, but somewhat heavy on the oat flavor also with a bit of a coconut undertone.  There is no noticeable chocolate taste (to me).  However, the chips' soft slick variance from the other chewiness is obvious.          Bars (of any kind) can be very personal to folks in taste (like or dislike).  Try and see for yourself.
