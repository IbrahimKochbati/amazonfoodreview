I didn't like this coffee at all.  I like strong, full flavored coffee and this is not it.  There is mild bitterness and the coffee was slightly weak.  So far the only K cup coffee that I enjoy is the Barista Prima Italian Roast (I think that's the  and), but I wanted something I could order on subscribe and save, so I always had coffee.          I ordered the Tully's Italian Roast to see how it is, but it too isn't as good as the other.
