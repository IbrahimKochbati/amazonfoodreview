This is my favorite "assorted" candy ever!  I SO wish they'd release white or dark chocolate only bags because these are the treats I look forward to all year.  We scour the local stores around Halloween and usually buy their entire stock.  I love the KitKat crunch and each flavor of chocolate makes picking a favorite difficult.  (Which usually means I have to eat three at a time *giggle*)  I'm glad to see Amazon has them in stock in case I can't find them locally; unfortunately, though, shipping them runs a risk of them melting, even in fall winter. Alas, the chance would still be worth taking in order to get some this year. :)
