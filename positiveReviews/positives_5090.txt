These are really good!!!  Also, be sure to try the Cherry Blossom flavor if you can   that one tastes absolutely wonderful!!  This doesn't stick to your teeth at all and it has a very pleasant taste and even smell to it.  One pack has just enough pieces.  Great to  ing along when you're traveling.  I gave some to a 7yr old and she loved it!  Because it's not too sweet (none of that dreaded corn syrup in here), people of all ages would easily approve of this   I certainly do and would not hesitate to recommend this to everyone!
