This is the only way I can get my daughter to eat fish.  I often add extra coconut oil and cinnamon to improve the taste though.  She didn't like it the first time, but after a few attempts she enjoys it.  She screams when I try to feed her any other  and of salmon, and so I think this one is worth a try.  If they don't like it, just mix it with something they do like. Great ingredients, great product.
