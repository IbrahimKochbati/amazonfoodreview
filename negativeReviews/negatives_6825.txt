I purchased this product for use with my new Maxi Matic popcorn machine, with the goal of producing that movie theater taste that none of my previous popping efforts had replicated. These portion packs succeed in that the flavor is spot on. They might even be better than what you'd get in a theater because the flavor is so fresh when just popped.          Unfortunately, the flavor alone doesn't make this a great purchase. As others have mentioned, the texture of the popped corn varies widely. Of four pre portioned packages that we've popped so far, three produced stale, chewy popcorn. When we tried the fourth batch using the packaged butter salt and coconut oil with an equivalent amount of another  and's popcorn that we had on hand, it was much more tender.          Also, if the packs are poured directly into the kettle as intended, the resulting popcorn is almost inedibly salty. Much more palatable results were produced using about half of the packaged amount. But by the time you're customizing the pour, the 'convenience' factor of these packages is shot. Not that they're very convenient, anyway   the 4 oz. portion was very difficult to transfer into our 4 oz. kettle. The bag is very big compared to the working space inside the heated kettle elements, and it's almost impossible to make popcorn without oil, salt, and kernels falling all over the place or dripping all over the bag.          Considering the portion issues and difficulty of use, in the future I'll be buying the three components separately. I'd stick with this company's coconut oil and butter salt, but would likely get different corn.
