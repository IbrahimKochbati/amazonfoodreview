Ive had my bonsai for about 3 days now. I love it! I was a little upset at first because this product wasn't eligible for prime but despite that the plant still arrived in 2 days after shipment. Everything was in place and the plant was lively and not damaged. Came with easy to follow instructions and guide. Would definitely recommend for the price.
