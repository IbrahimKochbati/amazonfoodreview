When I got my Keurig  ewer last month, I bought two different types of hot chocolate.  The Grove Square Hot Chocolate is far superior.  I have so far  ewed it on 6oz and 8oz with good flavor at both sizes.  The flavor is rich and it leaves no residue in the bottom of the kcup (the other  and does, maybe I got a bad batch?).  Overall, I will happily buy this one again.
