I appreciate the effort for going the healthy route, unfortunately this totally destroys the taste.  I had the regular root beer by Blue Sky before, at least it was decent.  While the taste of this is so bland that I don't know how to describe it, the only way to make it bearable is by adding a packet of Splenda for every can.
