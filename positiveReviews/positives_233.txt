I've been feeling extremely tired around the late afternoon. As a software engineer, this is entirely unacceptable! So, I asked the nice lady at the counter of my local Whole Foods Market, for something that will give me that extra energy I need to get through the day.          She excitedly returned with a suspicious little green bottle. Over three hours after drinking whatever that was, my  ain is still working at unnatural speeds. To summarize my experiences: I believe this works.          She did explain that I needed to drink plenty of water with it, which I personally feel helped the energy level. So if you're feeling tired during the day and hate coffee, give this a shot   preferably before you eat anything.          Woot!
