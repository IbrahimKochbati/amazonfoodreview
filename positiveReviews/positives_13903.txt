I really like the flavor, not exactly like real peanut butter but still tasty. And I don't feel bad about eating it like I do when I eat 10 grams of fat on regular peanut butter. I do agree with the previous review, price is high especially since it doesn't last as long as the regular PB. Although there always seems to be a higher price on unique products like this one. I bought both the original PB and Chocolate PB, I like original better. I'll buy it again.
