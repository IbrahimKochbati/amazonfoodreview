I kind of expected something that would taste nothing like peanut butter. Not only does this stuff taste like regular peanut butter, it has the same consistency once you mix it. It has a taste similar to a low quality peanut butter or a high end less sugar healthy kind. Peanut butter has always been my weakness and I am so excited to have an alternative that wont kill my daily diet. It's even good enough to eat by itself without and kind of cracker etc. . .     The only down side, why I gave it 4 stars, is the price. It is much more expensive than regular peanut butter, but considering the trade off with so many fewer calories, I consider it worth it.
