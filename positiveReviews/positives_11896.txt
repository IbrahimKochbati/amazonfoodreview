Pros:     Dog will do anything for this treat.     Doesn't smell as bad as many other treats.     Easy to  eak into smaller pieces.     Nothing artificial, easy digestion.          Cons:     More costly than other dog treats.          Overall, this is a great product. While more expensive, my dog will do anything for this treat. He has several phobias, including getting in and out of the car, and walking through doorways, but he ignores all of his fears to get to this treat.
