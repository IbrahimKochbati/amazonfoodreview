These are the best potato chips that money can buy.  There is just enough salt to taste it, but not so much that it masks the lingering potatoey awesomeness after you've wolfed down a bag of these beauties.  Each chip has the perfect thickness   my teeth get excited every time I put one in my mouth!  Everything about these chips is so perfect, it's like they were made by God and delivered by Ga iel himself.  Now that I know Amazon carries these, I don't even have to leave my house to buy them!  I may never eat anything else again!
