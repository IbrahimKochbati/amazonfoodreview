My kitties and I love this catfood. Had some problems with the boy kitty after neutering and he went off his food for over a week. He was wasting away. When he got back to having an appetite (no amount of treats or special foods would tempt him) he went back to chowing down on the GoodLife Recipe food, and regained all the lost weight and muscles he had lost. I believe this food saved his life.
