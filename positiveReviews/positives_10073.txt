Strong and good, that's what my wife said about me   no she didn't. I made this coffee exactly like I make my daily Yuban, 8 cups and 4 teaspoons of coffee. When I tasted it the first thing I noticed was the flavor was considerably stronger than what I'm used to. Nevertheless it tasted very good and in all honesty it is better than Yuban but costs more too. Some people might not agree because they would prefer a milder blend. I suggest giving it a try and make up your own mind.
