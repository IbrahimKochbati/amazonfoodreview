Sunday  eakfast   sausage and bell pepper scrambled eggs and a piping hot mug of coffee.          This morning that coffee was the Puroast Low Acid French Roast...I received one bag to review and it had enough coffee inside to make 8 cups, so I went ahead and  ewed the whole thing.          One in the household is a coffee purist and drinks it black, while I prefer sugar free creamer. I poured the mugs, sat down to  eakfast and waited until it was a bit cooler to drink. I was the first to take a sip and even with my creamer there was an underlying bitterness that hit me hard. I paused a moment, took another sip and the same bitterness was there.          So I asked for additional feedback from the coffee purist. The first words out of his mouth: "UH! It tastes like gasoline! It takes like...fuel!"          Forgiving the fuel pun, we explored the coffee a bit more and it seriously got worse. I grabbed the pot from the coffee maker and took a deep  eath. Bitter, foul, with an undertone of...you guessed it...gasoline. I wanted to make sure this wasn't just a gut reaction so I asked for another opinion. The purist took another sip. "Yep, gasoline or some kind of fuel taste...and I know what gasoline tastes like."          Ignoring how he knew what gasoline tasted like, I grabbed the pot of coffee and dumped it in the sink. Really disappointing way to start the morning, and I'm sorry to say that I won't be purchasing this  and   even though I like the concept of the low acid  ew. But if you want to stay all natural low acid, just go with a wonderful Hawaiian Peaberry vs. something that has been "processed".          1 start out of 5.
