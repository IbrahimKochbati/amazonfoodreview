I ordered a whole box of 6 cans of the cereal. When I opened the first  one,  only a little more than half of the can is filled with the cereal. Well, I thought I got a lemon. I opened another can, surprise, the similar half full amount. It turned out all 6 cans were just like that. Why would they use such a big can when they only fill half of it?  Although I like the ingredient, I will never buy the  and again. It's not the way to do a honest business. So I am not going to trust its listed nutrition.
