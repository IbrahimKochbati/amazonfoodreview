I like this coffee and placed my second order, but be aware who you order from. First time I ordered, it came through amazon.com, 2 packs off 22 count. The second order I thought I was getting the same from the Amazon site, but it came from Deals On Call and I only receive ONE pack of 22 count for the SAME price I got 2 packs in the first order.          Amazon has agreed to send me a return lable and I will reorder from Amazon making sure it is from Amazon directly.
