I always thought alot of salt was tasty and good for you. Maybe that's why I need to take pills for high blood pressure. Bout time someone steps up to the plate to help provide products that improve your health if you choose.     The strangest thing that happened is that I have tried a number of no salt items, and I thought that I would hate them. Guess what, a number of items are much better tasting than the same items with salt. I am stunned and healthier.
