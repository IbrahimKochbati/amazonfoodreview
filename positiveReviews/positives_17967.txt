The instructions for the "Shake 'N Bake" advise you to moisten the chops with water before dipping and shaking.  I use and egg and water mix, and put the contents of this pouch in a large, plastic bag and add an equal amount of panko  ead crumbs (for added crispiness), and several other spices of my own liking.          The results are very good, but I can easily do the same with adding flavored  ead crumbs to the panko ones, spices, and continue as described above without getting  all of the added sodium, "dextrose" and carbs in the packet of Shake 'N Bake.  So can you!  :)
