I bought my dog the ball to go with the treats, nervous about spending the money because he chew apart every toy I get him with in hours.  I only have had it for  a day now but the toy is still in once piece and the disc is still partially there.  He really likes the treat.  I think this is good for dogs who are pretty destructive, I hate spending that much on a toy but if it keeps him from eating the walls I'm happy.
