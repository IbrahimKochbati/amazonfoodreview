My husband  ought this home from Whole Foods.  I thought it was frippery, but it is the most delicious thing.  As a classical Chinese medicine practitioner, I only use this as a medicine (it's made from red chili peppers and garlic, which means it has very strong energetic properties), but wow what a medicine!  I use it to help chase out a cold or flu, and it works beautifully.  Better still, it's addictively delicious!  I don't dip anything in it, I just eat a 1 4 teaspoonful right off the spoon.  And I keep wanting another 1 4 teaspoonful!  YUM!!!!!!  Also, a single jar lasts forever.
