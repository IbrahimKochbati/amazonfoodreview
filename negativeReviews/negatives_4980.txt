I thought this was a great toy, but my shepherd mix (supposedly very smart according to several different trainers we've worked with) never really got into it.          He likes tug toys, but this is not a great tug toy because the dog will grab the rope end, and you'll grab the plastic jug end. If your dog is any good at playing tug at all, you will lose every time.          He did not seem to enjoy chewing the purple spiky part either.          There was some interest in getting the treats out, but it never lasted very long. The treats have to be fairly small to come out. I spent nearly an hour cutting up treats to make them easy to get out, and that helped perk his interest a little, but he always went back to other toys.          Maybe its too complex for him. He does LOVE another puzzle toy we have. Its like a buster cube, but its a tough rubber ball (melon sized) with a maze like center. You put treats in one side by pushing them through a crossed slit, and after some rolling they fall out a hole on the other side. He loves that toy. I think its cool, too, but I fear what might be growing inside it, and the only way I've figured out to clean it is to soak it in vinegar and then put it in the dishwasher and hope.          This toy is at least easy to clean.          I ended up giving it to a neighbor to see if her dog might like it better.
