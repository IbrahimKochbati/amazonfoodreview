We started using ghee in place of oils to help our daughter with severe autism.  She appears to be in better health and mood since this change.  We have tried four different varieties of ghee, but this is the best tasting and fits into more recipes because of the mild taste. There is a big price difference, but this  and is worth the extra money.
