I have used this product multiple times.  In fact, I purchased four tubs of the gold and silver luster dust (2 each) five years ago and I am JUST NOW running out!  I use this stuff to gild all sorts of things for Renaissance themed banquets   including gilding an entire roast duck and then, using vodka, painting filigree designs onto it!  The clients thought it was prop food it looked so beautiful.  I can't recommend this stuff enough!
