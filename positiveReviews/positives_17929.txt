I normally buy House Autry or similar specialized  eading when frying or oven baking up some fish, pork or beef.  So I was a little skeptical to try an old  and  eading "Shake n Bake".  I grew up on shake and bake.  In the early days it had a cheap garlic paprika flavor that lingered in your mouth after a meal.  However, they must have improved the product because this Shake N Bake Pork was great.  It was not cheap or stale tasting.  Working it in with a little flower produced a very mild and pleasant experience.  I highly recommend considering this product when  eading some thick pork chops.
