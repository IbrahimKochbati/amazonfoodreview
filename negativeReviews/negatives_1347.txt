I have a One:One Coffee Pod machine and have ordered pods online before.  These looked good and sounded like high quality coffee  albeit a little pricey for 12 pods.  This was the worst cup of coffee I have ever tasted!  It left a bitter taste in my mouth that lingered for hours.  Yuck!  Don't be fooled by the fancy name and packaging. It tastes like rocket fuel.  Fortunately, Amazon refunded my money when I explained how bad it was. Throwing the whole box away!
