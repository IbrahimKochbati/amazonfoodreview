It's some good Joe. If you are looking for a mild to medium  eakfast coffee to start your engine in the morning, this is the real deal.  It's the kind of coffee that when you inhale the fresh steam before the first sip, you get goose bumps. Definitely full of flavor without any hint of bitterness. Drink it black and enjoy.
