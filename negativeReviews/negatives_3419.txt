The bonsai itself is fine.  You cannot immediately tell it's artificial.  It just looks like a healthy little tree.  That being said, I have pretty much an exact identical from a set of three I also purchased online here.  I could have bought another set of three with the money I paid for this one.  The picture used makes it look like a larger bonsai and is clearly not the one you receive.  Live and learn.
