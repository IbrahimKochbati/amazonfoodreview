My picky eater loves this! She will eat only Gerber Organic Mac n Cheese and Gerber Organic Green Beans w o any fussing. Yes, it is a bit runny, which makes it perfect for 4 6 month olds but it gives you the flexibility to thicken it with whatever you want for the older babies (e.g. rice cereal, meats, spinach, etc).          Mommy loves it, too! Great taste!
