I purchased this for my dogs. One is a male 13 yrs old sharpei golden retriever mix, another is a female 4 yrs old black lab, and the other is a 1 yr old great pyrenees. All of them ignore it completely! They seem to like the kong with treats in it best or the buster cube or a toy similar. However my sister's dog is a mix of german shepard and she loves this toy. So it kind of depends on the dog. Some dogs love it, some dogs ignore it.
