I started using these pill pockets in an effort to get my adult GSD to take her antibiotics. She figured out that peanut butter was a ploy and I needed to get her to eat it. The pill pockets were initially amazing because it wasn't as messy as peanut butter and instead of waiting 5 mins for the dogs to lick the spoon clean of med and peanut butter, she took the med in 5 seconds. That is, until she figured that there was a pill in the center. Now, she'll take it in her mouth and either spit out both pill and pocket or suck off the pill pocket and spit out the pill. Back to square 1 with her.          My little pup also required meds for a time and he was still eating it up without a care in the world. Overall, great time saver, it's not as messy, and hopefully, your dog will keep eating it without noticing the pill inside.
