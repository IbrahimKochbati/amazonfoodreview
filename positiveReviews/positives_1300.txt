i am trying to eat healthy and could not really find any good tasting low fat snacks. my friend told  me about pop chips that she bought from amazon. she said she loved them and i should give them a try, i said what the heck if she likes them they must be good. and what do you know i loved them and i have a bag almost everyday for a snack
