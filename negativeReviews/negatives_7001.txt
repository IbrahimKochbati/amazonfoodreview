I have really enjoyed a few flavored coffees, such as the Pecan product on Amazon. The price was good and the reviews decent for this one, but the flavors dont' really meld, they kinda battle each other. It's like a nice medium roast coffee, it's really a nice coffee underneath, but then it has this whammy of aromatic pumkin, not very complimentary. My wife and I both enjoy nice coffee and have similar opinion on this one. It is holiday ish and smells GREAT as it's  ewing, as the little woman said "I just wanna dive in there!" But the flavors just don't meld. Nice try but not awesome.
