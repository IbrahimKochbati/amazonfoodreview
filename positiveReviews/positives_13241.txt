I love Crystal Light. My mom used to give it to me when I was a kid, instead of buying sodas. I didn't drink it for a long time and when I saw this I bought it as an alternative to buying diet sodas. Let me just say, DELICIOUS!!!! I make sure my water is absolutely cold before I mix in the crystal light and it is SOOOOO refreshing. My favorite is the wild strawberry. It reminds me of the strawberries my mom used to grow. I'm going to buy three more of these. Hopefully it will last me till the summer but I doubt it.
