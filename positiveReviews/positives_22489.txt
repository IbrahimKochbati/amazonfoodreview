I bought a Pasadena Popper from Discount Tommy about 2 years ago. It's been one of the best things I've ever bought. Their popcorn is the best ever!!! Cooks up nicely, has great flavor and comes out just right. We have it at parties all the time, I will not use anything but this popcorn. I highly recommend it, you won't go wrong.
