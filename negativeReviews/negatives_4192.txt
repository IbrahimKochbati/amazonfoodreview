I ordered an 8 pack of this jerkey to try and stay range grown and healthy in my eating, but when I got it, it was a disaster!          First, I only got one of the 8 packs I was paying for.  I can't fault this  jerky, but Amazon's shipping folk for that.  However, the bag had jerky in it that had a strange gray fungus growing on it!          I was told this was good jerkey, but I guess I'll never know now.  I may have gotten a very rare moldy pack, but I'll shy away from this stuff.
