My cats (who are different in almost every way) totally agree on this food   its healthy so i dont feel guilty spoiling them, they slurp all the juices, nom all the real meat, chomp the nuggets and veggies and lick their lips forever after ! I am a huge fan of all Merrick foods but the Pot Pie, Turducken, Thanksgiving Dinner, and California Roll are my cats' favorites!
