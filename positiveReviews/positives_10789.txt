Ok.... so all the fancy name effort means nothing in the long run. I mean goodness...TEN words in the name alone... for dog biscuits! LOLOLOL However, the nutshell is pretty straightforward. The dogs like them and they have healthy ingredients in them and that is all that really matters to me! The ONLY negative I noticed is that these cookies were really hard   not just crunchy, but HARD and several of my older dogs had some difficulty  eaking them down and chewing them. Even so, all the dogs in this house have enjoyed them and the biscuits did improve the Walker Treeing Coon Hound's notoriously disgusting  eath issues. I would probably buy these again for the younger dogs and find something less  ick like in texture for the elder statesmen in my pack.
