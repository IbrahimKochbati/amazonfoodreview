Our 2 year old pointer mix dog has a variety of allergy issues. After she developed hair loss and red spots on her hip, head, and paw that would not heal, we decided to put her on an elimination diet. She has been eating this product for about two months now, and with the help of some antibiotics to treat a secondary staph infection, and daily Benadryl, her skin has healed and her fur is growing back. I am very happy with the way this food appears to be hypoallergenic for her. She likes both the food and matching treats.          FYI  We also provide her with smoked elk bones from Venison Joe's, and she LOVES them. I want to mention this because it is hard to find appropriate bones for dogs on an elimination diet.
