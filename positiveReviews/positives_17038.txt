whoever invented this is BRILLIANT !     my 6 mo old lab is completely mesmerized by it.     the tug a jug combines all the things that interest a young energetic dog;     food, noise, food, mental challenge, something to chew on and food.     somehow it dispenses the treats at just the perfect rate to keep him interested but not allow him to over eat.     outstanding product.
