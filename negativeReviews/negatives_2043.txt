I had tried Green Mountain Sumatra Reserve and found it delicious and strong. It's not available on "subscribe and save" so I read the reviews and opted for Wolfgang Puck. My husband likes it and I like the flavour but it's very weak in comparison to the Green Mountain. I have to order something else for me.
