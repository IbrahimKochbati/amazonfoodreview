I found this cocoa at Bristol Farms while looking for a healthier cocoa without the partially hydrogenated oils in most of them.  I love the spiciness of this cocoa and put half a scoop in my coffee every morning.  I don't drink straight coffee so I carry this powder with me when I travel too.     I was thrilled to find this item on amazon after Bristol Farms ran out for a while.  I have received a few of the 25 lb boxes with no problems, but my last $113 box is in the trash after I cut the plastic tie and found baby silverfish in it.  These bags are not sealed, just have a plastic tie aroung the bag opening so lots of tiny things can crawl in.  I know we have silverfish here at my husband's house, but now that I have just thrown $100 in the trash I wonder why they can't seal these bags?  I'm going to have to start buying a smaller quantity and just pay more per ounce so this doesn't happen again.  Unless a few people are drinking this or you only have one serving a day you need to plan for storage of this powder for quite a while.
