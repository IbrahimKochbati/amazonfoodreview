This was one of the best purchases I've done in years! It was well wrapped, moist and is a very pretty little tree. Some people mispronounce the name and call it: Bonzai whuch means to kill. Bonsai (bone sigh) means 'to plant in a basin'. This the correct sound. It is relaxing and very comforting creating and taking care of these miniatures. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs to de stress their life alttle!
