This is a very mild taco seasoning.  I added chili powder, garlic and onion to spice it up.  I do like the fact that there is no salt in it.  It is a good starting point for flavoring taco meat.  Since tastes vary widely, starting mild may be good.  For those that like a bolder flavor, have some chili powder, cayenne pepper or fresh chili to add to your dish.
