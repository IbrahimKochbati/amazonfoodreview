The seeds are fresh, the shells are hard and the seeds are JUMBO sized.  The taste is good, but the over powering amount of salt ruins the experience.  The 'ranch' flavor would be much tastier if the salt used were lessened.  Then again, without the overwhelming amount of salt, David might have to use a bit more of the flavor for which you are actually paying.  By the way, I don't often find items too salty, but this borders on the ridiculous, IMO.  I wholeheartedly endorse the Jumbo size seeds, as they are MUCH more enjoyable than the puny 'regular' sized sunflower seeds by David.          I will be buying another  and of sunflower seeds in the future, hoping that it will not have the amount of salt the David's have.          Update: I finished all but a little of the case of David buffalo ranch flavored seeds and bought a case of the Jumbo  and ranch flavored sunflower seeds.  I compared them back to back.  The Jumbo  and is far less salty and flavorful compared to David's.  It will be interesting how I will find the Jumbo  and to be after eating them for awhile.  Right now, they seem a bit 'under flavored'.  Still, that is preferable to David's overuse of salt.
