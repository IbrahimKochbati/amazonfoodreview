I used to buy these at World Market however they discontinued them :(     So I am forced to buy them online!  The rose and violet flavors are good however I did not like the anise flavor because they were too strong and licorice tasting for me.          I carry these in my purse to freshen my  eath and they are really good.     Also the tin is very cute.
