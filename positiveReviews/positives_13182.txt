This is a great blend for those who do not like just the  own rice by itself. It is also tasty when you cook it with salt and butter. I've also tried adding dried cranberries and peanuts to give it a different flavor...yummy! It is a healthier alternative over the regular white rice. Although it is pricier than regular white rice, buying it from Amazon in bulk reduces the cost per container. I've seen it in the standard markets for over $7 each. My only gripe about cooking  own rice is that it takes longer to cook than regular white rice. However, I do recommend this mix to anyone looking for a healthier way to eat!
