I should point out from the get go that to the best of my knowledge, I don't suffer from any sort of celiac sensitivity in the slightest. However, I'm very aware that this is a problem for many people, some of whom are unaware that they have a problem but know they're not functioning as they should. I do know what it's like to be unable to digest food that you like (in my case, any sort of meat) and wheat is even more difficult to avoid, so I can sympathize.          Pamela's Products Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Whenever Bars are meant to provide a tasty, healthful snack for the gluten intolerant. They're sweetened with agave and the ingredients are palatable to both celiac sufferers and those who just want a snack that's devoid of white sugar. These bars are guaranteed gluten free, come individually wrapped, and are packed five to the box.          The cookies themselves are actually pretty tasty  their lack of ingredients like stevia ensures that they have a pleasant sweetness that's gentle and tastes completely natural. And the other flavors are well balanced as well  there are plenty of chocolate chips of good quality and the presence of coconut is a plus. But the fact of the matter is that Pamela's Products Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Whenever Bars suffer from a fault that's pretty consistent in individually wrapped desserts of this kind: they're just too damp and lacking in crispness. Yes, I know that we all want chewy cookies nowadays and that cookie dough is held to be a gastronomic pinnacle to some. But I prefer my "soft" tempered by some external "snap," so this isn't the ideal snack for me. It tastes nice but the texture, for me, falls short (your own mileage may vary).          Regardless of my personal quirks, the fact that the food industry is accommodating those with food sensitivities and doing their best to do so in such a way as to use quality ingredients is fantastic. For those who like a damp, moist cookie, these just might be your idea of heaven  gluten intolerant or not. Not my first choice for a nosh but this, I reiterate, is a purely personal call.
