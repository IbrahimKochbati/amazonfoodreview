These are so pretty and the subtle plum flavor coupled with the toasty nuttiness of the sesame seeds gives the culinary curiosity seeker some taste bud adventure as well as a unique visual display.          This year [2011] I plan on making a non traditional Christmas dinner with 5 different kinds of Sushi and I can't wait to use these for my Sushi. I'm going to buy the green Wasabi sesame seeds by Roland next month so that I can do a cute red and green inside out Sushi. Maybe I'll even take a picture and upload it to Amazon.com if it turns out well.          The bottles are convenient in size and I like the little twist off lids for shaking the seeds on your choice of food. I like to shake some of these on my stir fries and soups after plating. If you stir these into something during cooking, their pretty color WILL wear off, so they are best used after cooking rather than during.          Note: These plum sesame seeds are NOT vegan. These contain 'carmine' which comes from beetles for the red coloring.          Here are the ingredients listed on my bottles:          Sesame Seeds, Seasonings, Salt, Citric Acid, Natural Plum Powder, Carmine, Spices, Sugar.          These are a product of Taiwan.
