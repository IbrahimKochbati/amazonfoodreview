Not nearly as eloquent as some reviews here on the subtleties of the espresso, with my Isomac Venus it pulls a lovely, dark shot with a nice crema. A real treat. The beans, grinds smell absolutely delightful and espresso is delectable. I'd consider this on par with the quality of Illy espresso, a leg up from Coffee Bean Direct Six Bean Espresso, and in a whole different league than Starbucks, Kicking Horse Cliffhanger, Community Coffee Extra Dark. Very nice... highly recommended!
