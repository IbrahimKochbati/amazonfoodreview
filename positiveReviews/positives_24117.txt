I don't usually like domestic lagers especially from large  ewing companies.  This however is a wonderful example of the fuller European style, something akin to a full bodied Belgian Lager.  So easy to make. I recommend getting the full kit which has appropriate malts and sugars and the carbonation drops!  I live in New Hampshire and I  ewed this in January when it was very cold.  After the initial fermentation it's been sitting in the bottle at around 50 degrees for a couple of months. The larger yeasts can survive at these cold temps where an ale yeast couldn't.          This is so good I think I'm going to have to  ew another batch so it will be ready for summer!
