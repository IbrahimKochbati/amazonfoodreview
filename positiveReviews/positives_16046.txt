McVities make a great product. Unfortunately the shipping still leaves much to be desired, though it has improved somewhat. In order to protect the biscuits bubble wrap has to completly wrap the product. Simply putting it across the top doesn't protect the bottom and sides and you end up with a case of  oken pieces! it is very frustrating as this does seem to be the least expensive way to buy them (short of going to England where you can get them for about 70 cents for a 14 oz pkg.)
