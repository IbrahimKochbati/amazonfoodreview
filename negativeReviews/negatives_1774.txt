Check out the nutritional info, the SODIUM: 5,510 grams! 230% of your daily requirement. I used this and our casserole was ruined because it was so salty!!!!!! And what's up with that price? My box cost a dollar. Unfortunately I bought two boxes, so I'm throwing the other box away. No bargain here. It is wildly UN delicious and UN healthy for you!     (Yeah, I'm embarrassed that I didn't read the label first!)
