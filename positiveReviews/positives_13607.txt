Having bought various types of vinegars hoping to find the right one but never did until now.  My local hyper market sells various  ands of balsamic but some have a heft price tag, the more aged typically the more it cost.  Honestly have bought some cheap ones but got a glorified bottle of plain vinegar or was un naturally sweet.  Made a pot of my homemade(from scratch)pasta sauce, while it's also been really good 2 tsp of Alessi made it great.  Can't believe the taste it gives to a tomatoe based sauce, was eating by the spoonfuls before adding to the pasta.  Wanting to experiment some more, I have been wanting to make some roasted red pepper remoulade to jazz up a BLT or Roast Beef sandwhich.  This was the key ingredient even more so than the roasted red peppers.  The balsamic cut the fatty taste of the mayo(not a fan of may alone except potato pasta salad)and added an interesting sweetness but not like sugar.  Ate couple spoons of that as well.  Not to worry I am not a double dipper even in my own house.  I think this will wake up a roast beef gravy and who knows what else.  Now I know what to buy and can also afford.
