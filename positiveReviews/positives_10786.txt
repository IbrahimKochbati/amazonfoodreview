These ranch style dog treats are made with all organic barley, and contain no wheat or corn.  They are roughly about 1.25 x 2.25 inches a piece in rectangular shape, almost like a fat fig newton. My 10 oz package had a total of 16 biscuits.  Upon opening the package, it had barely any smell to them.  Almost like a bland cookie smell.  The package doesn't have a recommend serving suggestion, but I would basically give my dog 1 to 2 treats a day.  The cover says the treats are baked in small batches.  They have been certified organic by Oregon Tilth and are a product of New Zealand.          I gave these treats to my 80 lb Lab mix and he tore it up.  He must enjoy them because he keeps staring at the bag sitting on my desk, even as I type this review.  However, my dog doesn't discriminate between organic treats or Milk Bones, he'll eat whatever and begs for treats all the time when he sees them.          Guaranteed Analysis on package says:          Crude Protein  9.0% min     Crude Fat  4.0% min     Crude Fiber  4.0% max     Moisture  11% max          I would try these again in the future and recommend them.
