I really, really like this ghee. Not sure if I love it yet. All I know that my food doesn't burn as fast. For All Clad frying pan owners, you will love this. Food does not stick and burn onto the frying pan so clean up is much faster. Not sure if there is a taste difference from my previous ghee but the grass fed component does make it seem better. 4 golden  own french toasts out of 5.
