I'm no coffee expert but since purchasing our Keurig, I've been trying lots of different kinds of coffees to find an everyday, dependable coffee that tastes great.  Newman's Own is bold without being too bold (I didn't care for the French roasts  too strong for me) and has that restaurant  ewed flavor that's so hard to find.  No bitter aftertaste. It's nutty and delicious with a bit of half and half and no sugar (the way I drink coffee). I purchased these at our local grocery store as the price was a bit better than Amazon (sorry Amazon!). If you like great tasting coffee without your socks being knocked off (by a super dark roast), then try Newman's.
