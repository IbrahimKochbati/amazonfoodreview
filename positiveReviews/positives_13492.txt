Bedtime Tea Is the "icing on the cake" for me.  It has become part of my bedtime ritual now.  It adds just that little 'extra' that my system needs to sleep more soundly.  I have to tell you that taking two 'Calcium Magnesium Zinc pills are crucial for me.  The magnesium really does calm down the nervous system, and don't drink coffee at 11 a.m., but since I found Bedtime Tea, I don't go anywhere without it.  I order 6 12 boxes at a time.  Good Stuff.
