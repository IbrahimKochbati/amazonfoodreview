The bars are about 3 4th the size of a Clif bar and have the same sort of consistency. The smell of the coconut is pretty powerful when you open the package and the bars themselves don't really have a decent taste. I don't know if this is because it's gluten free or what, but it tastes sort of like a dry tasteless oatmeal cookie. The chocolate didn't help add to the flavor. It's moist to the point where it feels damp and you can easily  eak it apart but I thought it was kind of bland and I felt like I needed to wash it down with lots of water.          I'm a guy who likes snacks, and I'm a sucker for chocolate chip granola bars. This should be right up my alley. But it doesn't taste that great. If you're under certain dietary restrictions, you might feel differently but I wouldn't buy this as a snack.
