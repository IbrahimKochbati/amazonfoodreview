I've tried coconut water a few times and never liked it, but had to try this when I saw it at the store last night. I am so glad I did...it is really refreshing and the best tasting milk I've ever had.          It's unsweetened, 45 calories and gives you 45% of your daily calcium per cup. If only I could have discovered this as a kid; I would have quit normal dairy milk immediately. In a blind taste test, I would choose this every time.
