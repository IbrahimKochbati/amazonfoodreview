This is by far the best Earl Grey tea ever. The bergamot is not overpowering, but pleasantly soothing. To me, organic tea is the best. It has no bitterness the way "regular" teas sometimes do. This is a very relaxing tea blend, a perfect way to start your morning. The price is more than reasonable, especially for organic tea. If you're an Earl Grey tea lover, you won't be disappointed.
