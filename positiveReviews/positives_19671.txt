The flavor is robust and tangy, and the texture is very pleasing and moderately chewy   not enough to hurt your teeth, just enough to satisfy! Also, they're not salty tasting at all. The "jerky" flavoring is moist enough to make a little mess on your fingertips, but you can suck it right off. :)          I have bought these in single serving sizes in our local grocery store as well. I buy them every week and carry them with me for emergency sustenance.
