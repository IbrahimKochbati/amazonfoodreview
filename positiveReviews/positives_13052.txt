I've tried several different varieties of Dolce Gusto coffee capsules and so far this is my favorite. It's the most versitile too. It makes a great expresso if you use a demitasse cup, cappuchinno if you add your own milk, or a 14 oz mug of American style coffee. I'm so hooked I drink two big mugs a day   one truly delicious vice.          This coffee is strong and dark but not harsh or bitter. Other strong or "full bodied" coffees often have a burned taste   as if burning the beans is the only way to add flavor to an inferior bean.          Nescafe, the largest selling  and of coffee in Europe, has developed a fantastic coffee. I also love the convenience of individual servings.
