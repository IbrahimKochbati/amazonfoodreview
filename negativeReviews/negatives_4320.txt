So, I really really wanted to like this stuff, and I tried to make it all the way through one can, but alas I lacked the strength of will. I love ginger ale, and Jamaican ginger ale in particular, but this flavor (and maybe we had a bad batch?) was a whole new, disgusting animal that took me quite a lot of time to pin down my feelings on. Firstly, I felt I was drinking water that had been poured into a glass that used to have Pepto Bismol in it, but had not been rinsed out first. Secondly, I thought maybe it tasted more like truvia had been simply mixed with water into a sickening solution. Third, it made me think that i now know what it would be like to drink generic birch beer after someone else had thrown it up. And, lastly, when i finally gave up, as if giving up on a bet, it just tasted like hostility and sadness.          Do yourself a favor and try a different flavor!          One caveat  Usually, when a company screws up any kind of ginger ale, it is because they seem to make it taste soapy. Kudos to Blue Sky for finding a whole new way to make ginger ale so vile. It doesn't taste soapy at all!
