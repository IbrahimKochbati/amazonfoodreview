Our 3 dogs love Dingo bones.  But these peanut butter flavor bones are an obsession of our smallest rat terrier.  He's only 5 pounds, so bones tend to last several sittings for him.  Give him one of these and he's occupied for as long as it takes to finish.  He'll still play with other bones, but he loses his mind when he sees me go for this bag.  I just wish they were priced as well as the other Dingo products and less difficult to find.
