This is good sticky rice which is indeed very sticky, in fact it congeals together even to make nice sticky mush.  I have cooked it with just water in my Zojirushi rice cooker and it turns out all right.  It tastes even better with some artifical sweetener.  I'm sure sugar would taste better still but I'm trying to trim down.          This with coconut milk and sugar or artifical sugar in a rice cooker should turn out very tasty sticky rice.  I recommend this item even thought it is a tad costly at this price point, but not so bad with free shipping by Amazon Prime.
