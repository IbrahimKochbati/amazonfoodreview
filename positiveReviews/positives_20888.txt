I've tried all the light roast decafs and this is the VERY BEST!  Its light, not at all smoky like other  ands, and it "gets" you in the back of the jaw with its zing. I dont know how else to describe it. Its absolutely the best.          I drink it on its own all day and sometimes use it to add to a cup of flavored! yeah its THAT good!
