This review is for Pamela's Wheat Free Bread mix; some of the other reviews here are for other products in the Pamela's line.          The mix contains several alternative flours: sorghum, tapioca, sweet rice,  own rice, white rice, and millet, along with molases, honey, and other ingredients.  The yeast packet is included in the package, but is not mixed into the flours.  2 eggs and 1 4 cup of oil are needed to complete the recipe. The label has recipes for pizza crust, bagels, and pie crusts using the mix.  I have not tried these applications, so I cannot comment on them.          I love this  ead. The mix makes a large loaf (I use the mixer method and bake it in the oven; I don't use the  ead machine).  The  ead has a nice, soft texture.  It is not crumbly at all.  I have shared it with several people who eat gluten, as well as others who cannot; everyone likes it.  The flavor reminds me of a soft whole wheat  ead, and is slightly sweet. I keep the  ead at room temperature, and it tastes great even without toasting or heating first   an amazing feat for GF  ead.          The option for making rolls (in a muffin tin) with this mix is wonderful  finally, a roll that looks "real" and tastes good. I let the loaf  ead cool fully before cutting it, but the rolls can be eaten piping hot, right out of the oven.  The rolls can also be frozen and reheated when needed.          Try this  ead   it is so much better than any of the frozen pre made GF  ead out there.
