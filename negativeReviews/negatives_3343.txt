I wanted to like this product. I have 2 dogs, first I gave one of the treats to Giz, my 6 year old Zuchon who is a little picky.  He took one sniff and walked away, when I laid it on the floor he shoved it under the couch. So, I thought I give one to Pete, our 18month old bloodhound who eats everything and then some.  He wouldn't eat it.  I couldn't believe it, a dog that literally will eat wood, bark, dirt, etc and he wouldn't even put these in his mouth.  If he won't eat them, I would guess most dogs won't.
