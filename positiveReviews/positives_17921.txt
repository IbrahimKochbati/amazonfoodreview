Unconventional, I know   classic Shake n Bake is made for pork, and who doesn't love a Shake n Bake pork chop?! But I eat more chicken than pork these days and I wanted to try classic SnB with chicken.  I used skin on chicken legs thighs. Coated them, placed in pan, covered with foil and let cook at 400 for 30 mins. Then I uncovered the pan, sprinkled on the remaining mix and cooked for an additional 35 minutes. Loved it! The coating stayed with the skin, and crispy chicken skin+Shake n Bake coating   delish!
