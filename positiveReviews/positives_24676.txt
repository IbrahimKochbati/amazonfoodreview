I love to make pumpkin muffins and  ead. I first ordered this product over a year ago when pumpkin was hard to find in the store. Although I like to use natural organic products, pumpkin is not necessarily one of those things that you need to have organic (due to the thick rind). However, the price of this is impossible to pass up   with S&S, the per can price is cheaper than the local store generic! I didn't think there was much of a difference in taste, until recently I made my muffins with another "name  and" pumpkin my muffins were just OK, certainly not as yummy as usual. The pumpkin was the only difference. So here I am ordering more! Unless the price shoots up dramatically, I won't use anything else.          I didn't realize the dented can thing was a widespread issue. If I remember correctly, I do think some of my cans in my first order were dented, but not badly enough to make them unusable (obviously   we've eaten them all with delicious results and no ill effects LOL!)          UPDATE: This latest order arrived in perfect shape in a well reinforced box   no dents or dings anywhere!
