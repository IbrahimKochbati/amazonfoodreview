This is the first morning my dog is using this toy. So far, it seems great. She is a 7 month old german shepherd husky mix with a lot of energy who loves to play and figure things out. Sadly, she has a soft tissue injury so is not allowed any walks, running or playing in the park for 3 whole weeks! We needed to find alternative outlets for her energy so she wouldn't turn into a raving beast from the frustration. The Tug a Jug has kept her full and undivided attention for 45 minutes so far. We also purchased the Busy Buddy Bouncy Bone, which she also loves. I'm very happy with this product. She's a powerful chewer, so I know she's going to chew right through the rope and spikey ball on the top. But I will take the advice of another reviewer and just put a tennis ball inside and I am sure it will still work just as well.
