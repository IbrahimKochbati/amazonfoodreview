I discovered KIND bars in stores like Wild Oats and Whole Foods.  They are made of a combination of dried fruit and nuts.  Each bar has a unique flavor and provides a satisfying snack.  I also eat these bars regularly after workouts.          In stores, KIND bars are usually about $2 each.  So, Amazon's 8 pack is a great deal.
