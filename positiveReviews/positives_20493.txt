I've been using Swheat Scoop for years   switched from World's Best(which, alas, had too much dust for me.  Swheat Scoop is fine with the cats and doesn't get tracked around as much as some other  ands.          There is a problem with food moth and other bug infestations in our now hotter summers. Cure: crumple up a few bay leaves in the open litter tray and pop a few in the bag of unused litter.  This also works to protect your herbs, dried beans, grains, etc.
