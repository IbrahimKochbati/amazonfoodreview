A dark, bold, robust French Roast coffee with low acid content for those who suffer form heartburn and or acid reflux. It is a delicious coffee, earthy and has a very good flavor. The only other alternative is the New Orleans style coffee with chicory which some people either love or hate, but it also is less acidic.          So enjoy your coffee and forget about heartburn problems.
