I bought this tea because I enjoy mint iced teas.  I find the flavor refreshing when it is hot out.  This tea just does not deliver the mint like other  ands do.  I find this to be problematic when I bought the tea specifically for this purpose.  I confess, it could be that this tea just does not like cold  ewing, but that would make it unlike every other tea I have ever bought.          If you wish to enjoy the tea as a cold  ew, look elsewhere.
