I have tried many flavors of Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies, and until I tried this one, I liked them all.  The ingredients list mentions that they have a touch of carrot cake spice added..........but it's more than a touch. Unless you really, really love carrot cake, you might want to make a different flavor selection. My favorite is the chocolate chunk cherry but it appears it is only seasonal.....I wish I could get it all year long. The oatmeal raisin is my second favorite. I wish I had ordered them instead of these morning glory.
