I love these cookies.  You just mix them all up in a bowl together and bake.  I ADD MORE CHOCOLATE chips  at least 1 4 cup more of whatever flavor I am craving at the time  or better yet chop up some chunks from a semisweet baking bar!  This makes it better, I think, as it doesn't have enough chocolate in them when I really need a chocolate fix.  The package says  to melt the butter.  You do not have to do that if you have a hand mixer with some guts.  Just use soft butter or butter substitute.  Also, watch how long they cook as mine never need the full time.  My kids like them softer so I bake shorter for them and make a crispier tray for me.  The only caveat is that each bag only makes a small batch and it is expensive.  BUT this is the BEST tasting gluten free mix I have ever found.  My kids love them and they are eaten quickly.
