I reviewed Werther's original chewy caramels, caramel chocolates, and creamy filled     hard caramels as a BzzAgent and found the chewy caramels came a close second to the     original hard candies.  Still has that great unique caramel flavor from Werther's but     now in a chewable form.  I prefer the original hard candy as those little gems last     a little longer but these are a nice second choice.
