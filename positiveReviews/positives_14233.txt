I did not find this product to be oily at all.  I buy them at our local health food store and mix them with a variety of organic nuts, raisins and coconut. Everyone I've shared them with has enjoyed them a well.  Maybe the other reviewer just happened to get a bad batch?  Who knows, but our family loves this product.
