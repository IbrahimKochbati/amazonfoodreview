I have a english bull terrier with ALOT of skin problems so he takes medication and vitamins 2x per day and some of them are quite big and the zinc pills apparently taste extra bad so he has become very difficult to give pills and actually hides with he hears the bottles being opened and when you get him you have to pry his very large jaw open and hold it closed until he swallows because he'll spit it out. With pill pockets I even combine a few together and he LOVES it... he will even do his tricks to take his meds now and I'm not sure he even chews ha.. Its a little expensive but combining the pills together makes it last longer and it saves time and my fingers!
