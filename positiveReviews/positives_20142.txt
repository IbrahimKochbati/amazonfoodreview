Yes, with this juice. Apparently I'm not the only person who loves this drink, it is the leading orange carbonated soft drink in France. What I love most about this drink is the not too sweet flavor of the carbonated juice. This is not like the super sweet orange drinks that are normally carbonated. It is more like carbonated water with a splash of real orange juice and flavor.          I think I first tasted this juice in a caf&eacute; next to the Moulin Rouge in Paris. At least, that is what I remember when we ate lunch after stepping off the tour bus. Anyway, imagine my surprise when I found it was also being sold over here in local tea shops and grocery stores. And now it is here at our very own Amazon!          A deliciously light taste and not overly sweet. Perfect for picnics and parties.          ~The Rebecca Review
