My westie has food allergies and has had tummy problems since a puppy. He had soft stools and was gassy. I fed him really good food. He started scratching, licking paws, and getting waxy yeasty ears. He would vomit first thing in the morning. These are all signs of food allergies. I tried the grain free foods. They seemed to help but he still had problems. I changed his food to one  and and he got very sick to the point he had to spend a couple days at the vets. My vet recomended the California Natural no Grain. My dog is doing so much better. His stools are normal, almost no gas, and his itching is almost gone. If he does get grain like a stray cracker or cheerio he is a sorry puppy (he just turned one) for a couple of days. I'm so happy my vet recommended it and it is available at other places too.
