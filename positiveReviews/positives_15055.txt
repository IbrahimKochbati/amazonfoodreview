I used to buy these cheaply when I lived in WA State (they're made there) but these are cheaper than anyplace I saw there. Cat owners should just order the dog treats and split them up. These are a little large for most cats but if you  eak them down with a knife or box cutter they're every bit as good as the cat treats and much cheaper.
