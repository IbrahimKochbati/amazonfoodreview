When I discovered my sensitivity to gluten about 6 months ago, I was dismayed by most of the horrible gluten free foods on the market. I have since found some substitute foods that are acceptable to me. Bisquick gluten free pancake and baking mix is one of them. I use it every Sunday to make either pancakes or waffles. I recommend this mix whole heartedly!
