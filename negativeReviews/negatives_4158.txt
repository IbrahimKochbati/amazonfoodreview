I was really hoping this would be good.  Unfortunately it is not. Overall, the nutritional composition of peanuts is extremely good, with most of the peanut's fat being monounsaturated. They also provide an excellent source of protein, vitamin E, and fiber. So make your own peanut butter, or just buy the natural with no additives.
