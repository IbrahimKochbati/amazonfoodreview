This is a great treat for dogs, but do read the label: dogs of certain sizes can only have so many of these per day. I violated this and my dog got an upset stomach, so I am just giving a heads up. The cost is a bit high for these treats, but you get a lot of you buy the largest tub. My dogs go crazy for them too!
