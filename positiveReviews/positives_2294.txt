My primary reason for ordering, was the picture had shown the cookies as green. I will acknowledge that the "Important Information" heading listed a warning that the actual product may be different, compared to what was shown. Aside from the color problem, they were shipped quickly, and properly. Only one or two  oken cookies on arrival, but it's no big deal, I eat a few when they come in anyway. I'm not sure what flavor they are, but they are delicious, as per the description. If you're not picky on color, good value.
