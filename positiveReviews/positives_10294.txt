I was given this as a shower gift   I never would have spent the money. I have used a couple other baby food freezing trays, and this one is my favorite   it seals tightly and the food is easy to get out of the tray after freezing.  The portion sizes are a bit big for us now (with a 6 month old) but I suspect we will grow into it.
