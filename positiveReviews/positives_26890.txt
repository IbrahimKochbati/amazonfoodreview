I love Earl Grey tea, and this is the best I've ever had. An extra kick of the bergamot, I'm guessing. Or just better bergamot.          I first tried this in the Stash Organic Tea Sampler, and it's easily my favorite in the box, and the first one I run out of.          I'm mostly a green tea drinker these days, but when I want an extra kick of caffeine, this is my tea. Yum!
