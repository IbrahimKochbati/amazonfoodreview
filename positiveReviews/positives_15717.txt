Most people know that cats can be finicky eaters.  They devour some food and simply walk away from others.  I guess that is one trait that I find most interesting about our three Bengal cats.  They can eat like horses and yet are rather picky about what foods they will eat.  They all like tuna, ham, and even beg for a potato chip from time to time, yet they don't seem to care for turkey and even some types of cheese.  My family and I love our cats very much, and we are concerned about their health and want to feed them nutritious food.  Since all of our Bengals love chicken, I was delighted to recently have the opportunity to try the new Petite Cuisine Chinese Chicken and Chicken Pot Pie Variety Pack.          We received a 24 pack, which includes 6 individual boxes, each containing two 3 oz. cans of Sesame Chicken and two 3 oz. cans of Chicken Pot Pie cat food.  The ingredients for each flavor are as follows:          Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;e:  Chicken, Chicken  oth, Carrots, Sesame oil, Soy bean oil, Rice, Tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, Tapioca starch, Calcium sulfate, Salt, Vitamins & Minerals (Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Vitamin D3, Zinc sulfate, Thaimine mononitrate, Manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfite complex &lt;source of vitamin K , Riboflavin, Folic acid, Pyridoxine hydrochloride, Copper amino acid complex, Iron amino acid complex), Carrageenan, Choline chloride, Taurine.          Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e:  Chicken, Chicken  oth, Sweet Potato, Carrots, Soy bean oil, Tapioca starch, Tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, Calcium sulfate, Olive oil, Vitamins & Minerals (Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Vitamin D3, Zinc sulfate, Thaimine mononitrate, Manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfite complex &lt;source of vitamin K , Riboflavin, Folic acid, Pyridoxine hydrochloride, Copper amino acid complex, Iron amino acid complex), Carrageenan, Choline chloride, Taurine.          As you can see, the ingredients in the two flavors are nearly identical.  One controversial ingredient contained in both flavors is Menadione Sodium Bisulfite, which is a synthetic version of vitamin K.  MSB has been called "potentially harmful" by many researchers, and is not allowed in human food.  However, the FDA does not restrict the use of MSB in pet foods, and these pet foods are even able to proudly claim "Natural" on the label, even if it contains this un natural ingredient.  Studies indicate that Menadione Sodium Bisulfite can be toxic in high doses, and the tests indicate that this synthetic vitamin supplement can prove toxic to kidneys, lungs, liver, and mucous mem anes.  Since I only use the Petite Cuisine food as a supplement to my cat's regular food, I don't consider the levels of MSB to be high enough to put my animals in any danger.  However, it is up to the owner to determine if they find this risk acceptable or not.  You can find more information about Menadione (Vitamin K3) here:
