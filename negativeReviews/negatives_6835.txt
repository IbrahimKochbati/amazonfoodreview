This is a tough popcorn. It's not bad just not the best. I have a popper that is a dome type with a wire sweeper that goes round and round. Most of the oil and salt stays in the bottom of the popper and never comes in contact with the corn kernels at the  bottom long enough to get on the popped corn. It is randomly spread and half of it is like air popped corn and tasteless.
