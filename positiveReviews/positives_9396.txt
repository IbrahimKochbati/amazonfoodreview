This canned chicken is the perfect thing to make a quick salad, sandwhich, or toss into a soup for lunch or dinner.          While it will never replace a roast chicken in the oven ready to be served, it's got a nice chicken taste. It's just not as firm as regular chicken you prepared yourself.          If you remember to keep a can or two in your desk at work, you won't be without some solid nutrition in a pinch. Try it cold with some yummy salad dressing and a few crackers!          Swanson Premium Chunk Chicken Breast is an excellent buy.
