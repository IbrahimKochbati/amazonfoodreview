My goldendoodle is picky and likes to change up his food once in a while. So I decided to try two other  ands....what a mistake.      Newman's own is really the best: my dog looks better, feels better, and the quality of food is very good. Do not do like I did and experiment around...my poor dogs stomach....stick with Newmans.
