I found this product when I lived in Hawaii 20 years ago and have used it ever since.  It has a wonderful flavor that is better than many fried rice dishes I have been served in restaurants.  I have tried many times with the help of Asian friends to make a comparable seasoning mix for my homemade fried rice and always went back to using the NOH's  and.  I am not sure why I tried for so long since this product is delicious and inexpensive to use.
