These taste great and have a great texture.          Our 2 year old has little interest in eating fresh vegetables, but she loves these.  She actually prefers these over goldfish crackers or other products of dubious nutritional value!  To me, that fact is worth the expense    it is worth the cost to get her to eat vegetables.
