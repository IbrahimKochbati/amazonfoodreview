Although I love to cook, I rarely if ever bake due to a health condition. I probably have hypoglycemia   I haven't taken the definitive three tiered test to determine if I have the condition (after fasting, you are given a drink of pure liquid glucose, and then your blood sugar is measured three times over the next several hours); however, when my doctor had me fast for twelve hours on two occasions, then measured my blood sugar level, my readings were below normal the first time and at the very low end of normal the second time. He gave me the preliminary diagnosis of hypoglycemia and warned me not to eat concentrated sugar.  The third time I had my blood sugar tested, I had avoided concentrated sugar for a whole week, then fasted for twelve hours, and my blood sugar reading was very normal at 90. I probably also have Candida, which is a very annoying and difficult to get rid of condition. My Candida tests showed that I have Candida, yet the readings were not high enough to merit a prescription to get rid of it (a Catch 22). Candida thrives on sugar and acidic foods. Therefore, added sugar and I are not friends, and I try to avoid the addictive stuff to the best of my willpower's ability.          Yet I was craving homemade chocolate chip cookies last week. I haven't eaten, much less made, chocolate chip cookies in a few years! One of my friends who also has Candida (be careful of antibiotics   they can mess up your body's flora, and avoid sugar while on antibiotics and for a good few weeks after you finish taking your course of antibiotics   a lesson I learned a little too late!) said that if I ever do indulge my sweet tooth, take a TBS of Raw Apple Cider Vinegar beforehand, and it will help keep your body alkaline and therefore, offset the sugar.  I also take Cinnamon capsules or New Chapter Cinnamon gel caps to help with my blood sugar.  (If I don't take all of these precautionary pre sugar ingesting steps, my facial dermatitis will flare up for a good three weeks, and I'll look and feel just awful.  Nothing makes you feel more unpretty than red patches of inflamed skin.  Gluten, or at least refined glutinous grain, also seems to exacerbate my dermatitis condition.) So I was stoked when I saw a gluten free chocolate chip cookie mix in the Natural Department of a local grocery store.  I didn't feel like spending a lot of money and time chasing down organic chocolate chips, non gluten flour, organic vanilla extract, etc. to make the cookies I was craving.          Although I was happy to see this mix and give it a try, I honestly didn't think they'd taste especially good   enough to satisfy my craving and then I'd move on.  O Contraire.  These cookies are beyond delicious! As a person who is passionate about cooking, I can't help but mess with a recipe, even when it's already prepared for me in a mix and I only have to add an egg and butter (or in my case, a combo of Earth Balance Organic Coconut Spread and Goat's Milk butter).  I added a small amount of crushed walnuts, crushed Brazilian nuts, a spoonful of raw almond butter, and a light dusting of Cinnamon, Ground Jamaica Allspice, and Coriander Seed.  The result?  Amazing!  (I added the nuts, almond butter, and spices because I thought that that would help moderate the cookies' concentrated sugar.)  Another nice thing about this prepared mix is that it would be great for a vegan, which I  iefly was (I still remain an adamant "cruelty free" vegetarian), and then vegans can use applesauce for the egg and Earth Balance for the butter requirements.          The only problem  I don't want to eat added sugar on a regular basis.  Definitely believe we should all really, really limit sugary foods, only as a special occasions treat.  These cookies make my resolution to avoid added sugar a bit more challenging.  Yet my chocolate chip cookie craving is satiated for the time being.
