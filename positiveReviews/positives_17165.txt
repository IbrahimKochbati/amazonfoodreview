I love Pretzels and have to say that after trying my way through many different kinds, these are The BEST.          The taste great, are REALLY crunchy   a key requirement for me   and have just the right amount of salt. The Newman's Rounds are just as good   maybe even better.          And as an added bonus, Paul Newmann donates all his after tax profits from the sale of his products to charity   an unbeatable combination in my book!
