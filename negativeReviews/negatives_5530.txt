It had all the excitement and sensation for my dog (and still does) when I give him one.  But after eating one, kinda finishing a second one a few days later, by the third one, he took off, went to his spot, and seemed to enjoy it.  But alas, it stayed there for days ... uneaten.          Smells like the real thing, but my little baby AMERICAN PIT BULL TERRIER (B I G  D O G !) just looks at it sitting there with such sadness and disappointment on his face ...... If only he turned around to see how sad I felt trying to pass off some HEALTHY knock off for a real pigs ear!          My poor baby. :(          GOOD THING I BOUGHT A BAG OF 36 THOUGH ..... IT TAUGHT ME! A LESSON.
