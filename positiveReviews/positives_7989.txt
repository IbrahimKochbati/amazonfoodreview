Forgot expedited delivery and it is hot here in the South but the meat was cool and still very good.  The cucumber sauce is a great addition.  I didn't have any pita  ead but this is still great on white dollar rolls, sub rolls or wheat  ead.  Can't wait to try it on pita  ead tonight!  Highly recommended.
