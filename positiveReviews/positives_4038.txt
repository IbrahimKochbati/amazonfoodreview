This stuff is awesome!          Grows very fast and grows into a full grass section.          My cat loves it and with other cat grasses I have purchased, she has vomited after sometimes, but this stuff she hasnt (so far)          Like another reviewer said... shipping for one package is same price if you buy 10, so stock up and save on shipping, and the package was very nice, wasnt just thrown in an envelope!
