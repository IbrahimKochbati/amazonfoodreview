I love this sugar.  It is the only sweetener that I use now.  I bought my first case a few months ago and am getting ready to order the 2nd one.  For me... a little goes a long way as I don't care for anything overly sweet.  I use the same amount of this product that I used with the organic sugar I've now replaced.  For Lucy who is wondering whether this is 100% organic coconut sugar, the ingredient list states: organic granulated coconut nectar (it is made from the flower buds of the coconut tree).  It is very yummy!  I have even introduced others to it who like it so much they are now "converts".
