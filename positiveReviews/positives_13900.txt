This product is a delicious, satisfying alternative for anyone who is trying to cut calories and fat (or on Weight Watchers), without losing great taste.  It's easy to make and my kids even love it!  Great eaten alone or with celery. I've even used it with banana and fat free vanilla yogurt for a smoothie and it was excellent! Highly recommend!
