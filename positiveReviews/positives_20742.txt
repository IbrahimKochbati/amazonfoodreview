I first tried chai tea when I was in Nepal about 9 years ago and this is the only chai that I have found that comes close to the chai I had there.  The others I've tried have all been to heavy on one spice or another and this blend is perfect.  I have it every morning and subscribe to have it delivered to me automatically every few months.  I'm very thankful I can order it from Amazon because none of the stores in my area carry it.  I highly recommend it.
