Gracie's teeth started to show a slight build up of tarter, bought these and most of the tarter is gone. Her teeth are pearly white and her  eath is fresh.  Saying she loves these chews is a grave understatement. A true golden (2yrs old), she is not picky and will eat most of what we give her, but with these, she will act foolish until she has one in her posession.          Choking on the chews:     Every time she chews one of these treats, she tries to swallow a large, unchewed portion of the rawhide strip that never fails to get lodged in the back of her throat.  I keep thinking she'll learn to chew the entire treat, she is a smart dog in all other respects and only chokes on this particular treat.  Yet with every one of these treats given to her, I have to reach in to her throat and pull out that lodged piece of rawhide. May try cutting them in half.          I am torn on these treats because they do such a great job on Gracie's teeth, she just loves them and they are affordable for daily use(unlike Greenies). Just wish they weren't rawhide.
