In all honesty, I initially tried these flapjacks out of convenience.  I was having a bunch of people over for Christmas morning  eakfast, and forgot to buy waffle ingredients at the grocery store.  I instantly came to Amazon, and with being a Prime member, knew that I could receive these the following day. Amazon only stocks limited pancake waffle mixes, so I chose to try the Kodiak Cakes and I am SO GLAD I had.  As I write this review, I am back to order my second and third pack of 3.  My kids LOVED them (I added chocolate chips to the mix, and we made waffles) and since they are whole grain, they are incredibly satisfying and delicious.  Can't say enough about these  they taste homemade and I am intrigued to try the entire baking mix line from this company.
