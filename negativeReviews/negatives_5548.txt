This is a pretty standard shake and bake with no shaking bag in the package. I used a Ziploc bag instead. The seasoning was OK; that is no clumping. I used this product with chicken  east and it baked fine and there were no soggy spots on the meat. The flavor is fine but if you are looking for  something with a bold flavor or spicy, you may consider looking for another product.
