As with all the Ryvita Crisp ead's I've tried, these are very filling, taste great and you can eat them with absolutely no guilt.  At 35 calories per crisp ead and no fat or sugar, you can eat three and be completely satisfied without having blown your diet.  I eat them with some fruit as an afternoon snack.  They perfectly balance the sugar hit you get from the fruit and keep you going for hours.
