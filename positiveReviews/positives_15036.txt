Revolution's White Pear Tea is my most often repeat requested tea by guests. People just love it, with or without half & half. The pear flavor is pleasantly accurate  natural taste. Very appealing! But when adding this tea to your collection, don't forget Teaosophy's Black Kerala (an absolute 5 star black), Teaosophy's Darjeeling Green and or Two Leaves and A Bud's Tamayokucha Green. Finish it with a good quality monkey picked oolong and you will have the best of the beloved Camellia sinensis plant!
