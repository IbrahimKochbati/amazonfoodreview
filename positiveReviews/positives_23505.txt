I came across this cereal in a supermarket and decided to buy it, not for the cereal itself but for what the box represented (Peace...go figure).  Well, it turns out that not only did I feel I was making a positive contribution to the world but it turned out that I fell in love with this cereal!!  The taste, texture...it's just soooo yummy!!  I used to order it from the Peace Web site, but have found that it's more inexpensive to order it via Amazon.  I keep coming back for more...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
