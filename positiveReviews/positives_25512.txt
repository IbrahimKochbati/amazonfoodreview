After watching Dr Oz show, immediately I called several of my local store in order to get several teas that had been shared on the show. However with much disguise and disappointment, I couldn't find anyone of the teas nor Coconut Palm Sugar.  I went online thru eBay and then Amazon and found most of the items that I had been looking for. The seller ship quickly and shipped the actual products. I love the the products I received.
