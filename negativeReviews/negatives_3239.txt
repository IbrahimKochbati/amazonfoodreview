My German Shepherd is incredibly picky when it comes to treats... So I was incredibly excited that he was finally happy about a toy I had given him.          I, however, was not happy that it only took him 8 minutes to eat the entire thing.          I was also not happy when he puked the entire thing up (and his dinner) 12 hours later at 4AM... Customer reviews are pretty consistent that this product is too expensive for what it is, and is making the dogs sick.          I would never recommend this product to anyone, and will be informing my fellow dog rescue colleagues never to buy this product.
