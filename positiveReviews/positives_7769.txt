Great product, BUT!!!!! It's a little tricky to figure out the best time needed for YOUR microwave oven. Ours is pretty strong, and 1 minute 40 to 50 seconds is about right. However, BE WARNED! If you have an inexpensive or "low power" oven, the results will be very poor at best. (Just ask the crew where I work) When I tried to make a bag in the company cheap oven, it was SUPER slow to expand, and after the better part of 4 minutes, the burnt smell forced then to keep the door to the  eak room open for the rest of the afternoon! Bottom line....if you don't have a quality oven, don't buy these. One last word. After you remove the bag from the oven, carefully open, shake, and simply blow on them until they stop crackling. Otherwise they will seem stale until they cool. All this sounds like a pile of work, but after the first couple bags, you will NEVER buy pork rinds at the store again. I get a discount on the price because I have a box sent automatically every month. Works out to just under $13.00 a box with free shipping. Enjoy!
