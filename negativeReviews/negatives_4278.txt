My dog loves peanut butter, but she really didnt like this particular treat.  I've given her Zuke's beef treats and she liked it very much, so thought would try peanut butter.  She tolerates one a day (I'm giving it to her for the glucomasine part) but thats it.  Will go back to beef after this bag runs out.  Just a heads up!  I still like Zukes' products tho!
