I was hunting for rasberry honey mustard to dip pretzels in since Omaha Steaks no longer makes theirs so I checked this website. Since there were so many of the same bottle I checked them all to add up prices and shipping (which I find annoying done on a per item basis!). I was thrilled when the last one I checked was the cheapest and happened to be from a company that I was considering reordering some other items. American Spice Company has a set shipping charge no matter the size of the order so I knew I had found my new source for mustard. When it came, it isn't quite the same as Amazon, but it is excellent in its own right. Enjoy!
