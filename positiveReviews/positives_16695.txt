Bentley LOVES Greenies!  He has a lot of tartar and he is only 2 1 2 so we use them hoping it helps.  He gets one every night if he has finished all his food.  He will go to the closet and cry if I forget.  All I have to say is "puppy crack"  and he goes crazy for it!  It seems to be helping, but I can't really tell but we will continue using it always.  I priced them several places and Amazon was the best deal.
