I got this Keurig for my mom as a christmas gift. I picked it initially because it was one of the more affordable, nicer ones. From what I can see its, great! it makes coffee almost instantly. The only thing I noticed is this Keurig is made cheaper than the more expensive ones, for example I own the 179.99 Keurig and the handle and base are made out of metal while this one's handle and base are made out of plastic. Its not necessarily a bad thing its just something I noticed. And its kind of unfortunate that it only allows you to choose two sizes of coffee and thats it. Basically what i'm trying to say is for someone like me whose a mild coffee drinker its great! But for someone who drinks coffee more often you might want to spring for one of the more expensive ones that allow you to be specific on different settings such as cup size and temperature.
