I'd rate these as better than average but since I am not a fan of flavored coffees, I'd only give them a 3 rating as to me they taste artificial and weird like all flavored coffees do. The regular coffees were very good better than many. I really liked the Amazonia and the Africana medium roasts, not so much the Colombian. The dark roast Eclipse, Mexican, and French Roast were very good. I made them into ice coffee, strong but not bitter. I didn't care for the Costa Rican light roast, it had an artificial taste to me. The House blend was good but nothing to write home about. I hate decaf so I used that K cup to water my plants with, so as far as taste goes I have no idea but my plants perked up. The Chocolate raspberry went nicely into a chocolate cake batter in place of water and it was delicious. If priced right I'd buy them again.
