The Pork Shake N Bake has always been a simple way to make any old chop a good bit tastier. With minimal mess, trouble and time, you get healthier than fried  eaded chops that are juicy and taste good. It's not exactly gourmet, but after a long day, it's an easy way to start a meal without having to resort to fast food. The seasoning in the Shake N Bake make the pork sufficiently tasty, but doesn't overpower it like some mixes can.          If I have one complaint, it's that you may need more than one pouch if you're cooking more than 3 or 4 chops. I was probably being a bit liberal with them, but I had enough for three thick cut boneless pork chops and there wasn't much left over (maybe a tablespoon). That's a minor gripe, but if you're cooking a lot of chops, especially thick ones, you're going to need more than a single pouch.
