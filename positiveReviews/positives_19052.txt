This is an excellent product for those on a low carb diet.  It makes excellent waffles and pancakes.  Great for an occasional treat that's not off plan.          Agree with the others that it's overpriced here.  Came here to order via Amazon Prime and found it was more than double for the same product, same size at another site.
