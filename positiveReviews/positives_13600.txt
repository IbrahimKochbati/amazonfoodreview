When the Turks came up through Europe, all the way to the Gates of Vienna, they  ought Marzipan with them.  The Croissant  ead (Turkish Crescent)  was developed to warn people the Turks were coming           The Germans, Swiss, Austrians, and Swedes are most renowned for Marzipan in Europe. Check out the Niederegger site  a nice site! Great site learn about Marzipan quickly nice story.          Niederegger Marzipan is made with more Almonds, less sugar, filler than others. Simply, ground almonds, rose water, sugar make the best Marzipan.  No filler, no almond extracts.     Lower quality Marzipans need that since they have a lower concentration of almonds.          With WWII, the Cafe Niederegger in Lubeck, Germany (East Germany for many years) was destroyed: 1942 "The caf&eacute; was destroyed by bombing and the company's archives went up in flames."          Thankfully, the cafe  was rebuilt & this fine Marzipan is still available. With German reunification, it is easier to get this great marzipan again. Highly recommended!
