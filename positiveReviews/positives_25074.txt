I bought two boxes of these jelly beans as they were the closest thing you can buy (at a reasonable price) to the Harry Potter "Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans". I bought two boexes because I thought there'd only be 20 beans in a box but in fact there must have been at least 40. We had way too many left over. The kids got a huge kick out of daring eachother to try one. Shipping was fast and included in these $6 box jelly beans.
