I found it difficult to get the pump nozzle UP after I'd screwed on the top   best you get the nozzle up before you screw it on.          One of my bottles had a small crack at the bottom, the box was full of sticky goop...I washed both bottles to find out which one was leaking. Amazon was super fast to credit that amount back to me.  Amazing Customer service, thats why I buy so much from Amazon!!!          I really would have liked to know the calorie count prior to buying, been watching what I eat for a good few months, so to let everyone else know   its 25 calories per pump, sadly I need 2 3 pumps to make my coffee sweet enough, I need to cut down and just get used to it.          I love Coffee Mate, and normally buy from the grocery store, but its handy not having that extra space taken up in the fridge!
