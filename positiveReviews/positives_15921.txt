I picked these up from my local pet shop for a bit cheaper than what they are on offer for from Amazon, so you might wish to shop around.          Over all I am quite satisfied with these "bones." They are much safer than raw hide chews given they are made from dried chicken, which means unlike raw hide you know these are actually digestible. This is the biggest reason I bought them. My vet recommended not giving my Sheltie raw hide as they aren't properly digestible. Whether this is true or not, I've heeded her advice.          Baird, my Sheltie, really seems to enjoy them. When he sees one coming out of the bag, his tail is wagging like crazy. He enjoys these as much as our old family Sheltie McGyver enjoyed raw hide. The only difference I see between these and raw hide is that raw hide lasted roughly 30 minutes longer in chew time than these. I'd say Baird can chew through one of these in about 30 or so minutes, while our old Sheltie could chew on a single raw hide for an hour, at which point we would throw away the little nub. There is nothing left of these bones after 30 minutes.          As far as the dental application goes, it does smell of mint, so I assume it should, if nothing else, help with doggy  eath, though to be fair Baird has never really had "doggy  eath." I also use some dog mouth foam so I don't know what really keeps his  eath "fresh" between the two.          If you aren't too sure about raw hide for your dog and want something you know can be digested, these are definitely worth it.          For those that try to keep track of where the things they give their dog come from, these are made in China. I've tried finding something similar not made in China, but it seems such a thing doesn't exist or I just can't find them.
