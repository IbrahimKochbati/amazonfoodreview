My wife switched our dogs to this food about 4 months ago and she has virtually gone from vacuuming daily to once a week.  The dogs hardly shed at all anymore. No more  ushing needed and their coats are very soft and shiny.  We have used other grain free foods previously and liked them but this one is definitely the best we have tried.  It's pricey but we are able to feed them 1 2 of what we were using on the other foods and still maintain the same weight.  This food is well worth the price and the dogs love it.
