I didn't read the ingredients carefully enough to see that these are gluten free. Wheat gluten adds a jerky like texture to vegetarian jerky, which is missing here.          The strips are wet    not moist    but wet. Additionally, the Hickory Smoked Soy flavor was waaaaay too sweet and reviewers have said that about other flavors as well.          I'll finish the box I purchased, but I probably won't buy more.
