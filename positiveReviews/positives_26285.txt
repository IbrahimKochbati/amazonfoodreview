These things are full of sugar with no "benefit" other than the fact that they taste good. I seem to have chronic dry mouth and sometimes it's nice to not chew gum or have a mint in my mouth. These are a nice alternative and now my hubby likes them too. They aren't overly sweet like a lifesaver, but they still aren't as tart as sour candy. They just have a nice, mellow, fruity flavor.
