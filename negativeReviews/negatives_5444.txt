Puroast Low Acid Coffee Low Acid Coffee French Roast, sounds delightful for those of us who need to reduce acid in our diets.  I made a pot this morning, very excited to try this new product but found it is a little on the bitter side, and has a slightly over roasted flavor.  I had to add extra cream to cut the bitterness, and don't think I could ever drink this black.  For those coffee drinkers who like a very dark roast, this may be just the coffee for you, but for myself, I believe I will pass on this one.  Puroast Low Acid Coffee is a really great concept, just not for this coffee drinker.
