I usually buy peanuts when we visit Virginia to  ing back to friends at home. With airline baggage rules like they are now, I looked to see what Amazon may have. It worked out great. The nuts got home the same day I did. Shipping was free with Prime. Best of all the nuts were excellent, as good or better than any I have bought in Virginia   Tasty, crisp and wonderful.
