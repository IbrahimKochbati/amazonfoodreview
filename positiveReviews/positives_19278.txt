I've tried several different  ands of low carb pasta including Dreamfields and Al Dente is the best. You can't tell that it's low carb. In fact, I used it in a soup that I made for a group and everyone went for seconds. I paid less getting it at Amazon than I would have at the Al Dente site. Got free shipping too so it only cost me $2.50 a bag.
