While one of my goldens has no time for this toy (she is a princess who doesn't like to work for her food), my male LOVES his tug a jug! He will work at it for an hour until all the kibble is dispensed. You can actually see the wheels turning as he figures it out, and he is pooped when he's done. Great for body and  ain. Only caveat: use this toy on carpet   it is really noisy on a bare floor!
