First had these Oloves as the result of a United flight. They were in a snack pack given to me for being moved from an aisle in EconomyPlus to a middle in the back of the plane, but I'd just eaten lunch. So I took them home.          They're delightful! I just ordered a 10 pack of the Lemony Lover. Good for a lunchbox, road trip, afternoon snack or anything you want a proteiny, low fat, low carb snack. And because they're dry packed in the European style instead of standing in  ine like olives at most U.S. grocery stores, you can eat them with your fingers.          I thoroughly enjoyed them.          My only complaint is that the're awfully pricey at $1.59 per packet. Behind a sandwich, it's the most expensive thing in my lunchbag.
