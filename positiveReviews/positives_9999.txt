ANOTHER GREAT WHOLE BEAN FROM COFFEE BEAN DIRECT. WE DRINK A LOT OF COFFEE, AND LIKE BOTH QUALITY AND QUANTITY. SO WE GO FOR COFFEE BEAN DIRECT, AND HAVEN'T TRIED ONE WE DIDN'T LIKE. THIS BREW IS HEARTY AND AROMATIC, NOT BITTER. A GREAT COFFEE. BUYING IT BY THE FIVE POUND BAG IS THE WAY TO GO, AND I THINK COFFEE DIRECT IS THE BEST DEAL OVERALL.
