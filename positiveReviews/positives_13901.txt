This product is an excellent addition to my morning protein shakes. I have used this product every morning for the last 45 days in my chocolate high protein shake to give it a Peanut Butter Chocolate Treat to it. Sometimes when I am craving a nighttime sweet dessert I use chocolate protein with the PB2 to create an amazing dessert to curb my cravings. This works great especially for those watching what you eat and trying to lose weight.
