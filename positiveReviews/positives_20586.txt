My little chi pap mix can hardly sit still without wiggling as I fill his food bowl. Perfect sized kibble for his tiny mouth. His coat looks great, shiny and fuller than on other foods. Slightly gross but the end product is better also, denser and less smelly. It just seems like his body processes this better than other foods.
