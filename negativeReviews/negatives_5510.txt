I'm a foodie, I'll admit, but sometimes convenience wins and I'm forced to settle. I've actually enjoyed most Healthy Choice meals that I have experienced in the past, but I knew there was something wrong with this product. If you look at the reviews for the line of Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers, this one in particular scores way lower than the rest. I doubt that I will be trying any of the other fresh mixers unless I get them for free, like I did with this one, but I just had to find a place on line to express how awful it tastes. I hate to throw away food, but this was simply inedible. My stomache and head were both hurting after just a few bites. My body was completey rejecting this garbage from the time I started eating it. I hope that Healthy Choice contacts me to offer me a job as a taste tester, because I would never let any food maker release this product with confidence. Stay away from this product.
