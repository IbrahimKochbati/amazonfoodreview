I have gastritis ... and the very first thing the doctor said after my diagnosis was   NO COFFEE   and no caffeine. Both are contributors to the problem. As a result, I have moved away from drinking coffee, especially that which has caffeine.          So, I was very hesitant to try this low acid coffee, just because it has caffeine.          It has a very roasted taste, a bit stronger than I am used to, but not bad. I would call it a medium to strong tasting coffee.          All around, very nice, and I did not suffer any consequences, although I did make sure I took my medication in advance of drinking it (no sense spending the morning sick).
