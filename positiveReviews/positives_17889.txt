Shake N Bake Pork, coating is a regular staple in our home. I personally really like the  eading and flavor, and it seals in the juice of the pork chop. It is also helpful for finicky eaters as it gives the perception of fried food when it really isn't.          Its very easy to use, and quite affordable too. I would recommend this for those who want to make a meal in a hurry, or don't have the time to make a sauce or  eaded coating for the meat themselves.
