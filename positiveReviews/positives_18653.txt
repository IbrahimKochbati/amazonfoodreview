I'm allergic to soy protein, and it  eaks me out terribly. I'm very glad to find a nut based bar w  a little chocolate that tastes (and is) natural. They are SO addictive. We have literally bought over fifty boxes of these in only four months! I never get tired of them. Fabulous post workout food. You get crunchy, chewy, salty, sweet in perfect balance, with nothing too strong, in this bar. The box of bars is very fresh. There's no chemical or artiffcial taste w  these. They aren't huge, but are bigger than modern day granola bars, and they're perfect as a snack or w  a light lunch. Carrying one in my purse as an emergency snack is something I'll do in all but the summer months. Way better, and far less dry, than all the granola bars I've eaten, too. Seriously, compare their ingredient list, protein content, sugar content & vitamin mineral content to other protein or granola bars out there. I've eaten a lot of those different bars over the years  Quaker, Nature Valley, Pure Protein, Balance Bars, Zone Bars & more. These are superior in every way possible. I highly recommend them.
