I just got this today and put one in the freezer so I could drink it ASAP.  OMG.............I was a little leary about it but it is WONDERFUL!!!  Some people don't like the little pieces in the drink but I love them.  I am amazed at the great taste.  There are a few too many calories (70) in it for me so I may just add a little to my vitamin water that I normally drink.  I am  enjoying a bottle now and it is very refreshing!!
