we love the powdered goat milk taking the place of regular formula! raw goat milk is one of the closest and most nurishing milk to give a baby other then  eastmilk, and when we cant get raw milk we go with powdered! it sits well in his belly and digest great! he loves loves loves it!!! i have used this milk for all 4 of my boys and it has proven to be the best formula EVER!!!! would highly recommend to anyone for their baby unless of course you can get the fresh stuff!!LOL
