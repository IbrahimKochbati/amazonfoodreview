This powder is actually very good and this would be a 4 star item if it wasn't for the product packaging. The 3 boxes arrived in a plastic bag and there was so much powder loose that I thought a box had  oken and the bag torn open. Not the case, the cocoa is just in the boxes and not in a bag in the box. The cardboard box is flimsy and the edges are not sealed. What a waste of good product! I couldn't figure out the best was to store it because every time I touched the box it would poof out and make a mess. I ended up having to buy a separate container to store it.
