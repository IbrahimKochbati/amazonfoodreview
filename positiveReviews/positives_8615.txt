Finding easy, high protein, low carb food is always a challenge. And usually   when you do find something   it doesn't taste so great. These are YUMMY. I love them. They're satisfying and for those of you who have done or are doing the Medifast diet these have almost the exact same nutritional info as the Medifast pretzels and are $9.00 for a pack of 12 while the Medifast pretzels are $16 for a box if seven. These will be a regular item in my pantry now. :)
