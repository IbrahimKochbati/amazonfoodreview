*****     These apple chips are sweet, very crispy, and yummy! They don't have the processed or chemically taste that some dried apples have. They also are not soggy at all  I like my apple chips very crispy! They are 100% certified organic, baked with no added sugar, no preservatives or chemicals, no pesticides or herbicides, gluten free, and made from Washington State apples with five apples in every bag. There are 6 servings in every 2.6 ounce bag, with 29 calories in each serving. These are a truly healthy and delicious snack.          These particular chips are very sweet and taste especially delicious because of the added organic cinnamon.          Highly recommended.     *****
