I HATE light mayo of any kind, and I've tried them all. I bought this today to make shrimp salad and it is amazing! I didn't even have to add anything else to it. Just the shrimp and the mayo. I'd forgotten how great mayo could be since I've cut back so much on it with the full calorie stuff. I agree it has a lot of cracked black pepper as others have mentioned, but that's what makes it so good. Can't wait to put it on a turkey sandwich!
