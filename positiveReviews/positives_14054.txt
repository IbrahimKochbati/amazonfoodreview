This stuff is amazing.  Simply comparing the nutrition facts with any regular peanut butter immediately shows you the extreme difference in fat.  I know, I know, fat from nuts is supposedly "good fat," but you still don't want too much of any type of fat in your diet.  PB2 essentially gets rid of the fat you don't need.  As I understand it, the peanuts are crushed down and the oil is soaked out of them.  Then, the remaining powdered peanuts are packaged up with a "seasoning" of salt and sugar (the ONLY other 2 ingredients in it) and you have PB2!          To reconstitute it, all you do is add 1 tablespoon of water to 2 tablespoons of the powdered PB2 and mix until you have peanut butter consistency.  It really does taste just like peanut butter.  Even my husband liked it, and he's not afraid to say something tastes nasty when it's trying to be healthy.  He loved the taste and was even happier afterwards when I showed him the back of the bottle compared to our regular peanut butter bottle.  This is especially great for any baking recipes that call for peanut butter b c we all know how difficult it can be to make those cookies and other sweet things "healthy."
