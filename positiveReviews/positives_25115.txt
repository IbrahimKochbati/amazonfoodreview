If you like me, are just now finding out the benefits of coconut and tried the plain and thought, this is not for me (actually disgusting), then you need to try this. My 4 year old drank a whole container of this last night (first time purchase)! It is good that it is a natural form of electrolytes instead of being full of corn syrups and chemicals. I will continue to buy these at Wal mart while i can, as they are only $1 each compared to almost $1.25, or so on here with S&S.
