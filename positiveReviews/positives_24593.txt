I'm one of the lucky ones who did not receive any damaged or crushed cans, though, I would not have cared at this point since I was desperate for pumpkin.  I needed the pumpkin for my dogs.  I do, however, notice that it does not work as well for them (their anal glands) the way the regular pumpkin does (Libby's) but I like the fact that they are getting organic.
