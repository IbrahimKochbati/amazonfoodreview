I am by no means a coffee expert, but you would have to have a string of mental conditions to prefer this "coffee" over mud in a cup.  The taste is terrible at best, no amount of sugar and cream added makes it more tolerable, and quite honestly, there is a reason why Via sells better.  IT TASTES BETTER.  For several reasons I might add.  You can get it in a variety of flavors, so finding one you truly enjoy isn't difficult at all (unlike Taster's Choice),     Starbuck's spent an incredible amount of time and effort perfecting the instant coffee while Nestle appears to have pulled theirs outta their lower back.          Long story short....if you like coffee, don't even try to settle for this.          If, however, you have no love for coffee, and are solely interested in a bit of caffeine, I guess this would suffice, but honestly there are less disgusting ways to get it (apples for example).
