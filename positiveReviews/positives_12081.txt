When I saw the add, I knew I wanted to try it.  I already have a mixed selection of the Bacon Salt.  Good flavor, what I expected...but don't overdue it and it is better. Great on fries and mix it with a little lite mayo or sour cream for a salad dressing or dip.  I will accept that it isn't as creamy as mayo, and it has a kinda lite,gritty texture almost,if you taste it by itself.  Try it with peanut butter on toast.  My problem is my  other, he uses mayo on everything and he loves it, so I hide a jar just for myself.  It does have a pretty strong smokey bacon flavor by itself.
