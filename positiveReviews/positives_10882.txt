I must admit that I don't have dogs that I would consider "pickY" but they did really loved these dog treats.  My dogs are small  a mini pin and a dachsund  and they both immediately jumped on them as soon as they were served...no hesitation that I sometimes see if they get a new food.  Yes, they're really hard and solid, unlike Milkbones, but I like that for my dogs.  I never feed them wet food or soft treats, and like them to have hard foods to clean their teeth.  These are a winner for my boys.
