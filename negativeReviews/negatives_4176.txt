Being a fan of La Preferida pickled Jalapenos I was quite shocked when I received this product.  It has many other ingredients such as:          Carrots (Big coins of them)     Onion     Garlic     Oregano     Soya Oil     Turmeric          I'm not sure who uses Jalapenos like this, but they were not what I was expecting at all.  There is no indication from the product listing that I can see that shows the ingredients to give you a heads up.  I'm very disappointed.
