For a quick carbohydrate side dish it's hard to beat these light weight dehydrated potatoes. They are not the equivalent of fresh mashed, but they come closer than most similar products. For me the seasoning is right, and they have good texture when prepared as instructed. Incidentally, I heat two cups of water in the microwave and pour it into the potatoes in a bowl, whip for a minute or so with a fork, and they're ready.
