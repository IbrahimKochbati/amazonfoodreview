I enjoy several varieties of the Erin Baker  eakfast cookies (Banana Nut, Pumpkin Spice), but this is my favorite.  Not too sweet for my taste, very satisfying and filling.  I heat in microwave for about 33 seconds and good to go.  Great with coffee or tea.  I keep them in the freezer as they recommend (you must do this as they can get mold otherwise) and they always taste fresh and fine to me. (They are wrapped packaged very nicely for the freezer.) Also good in the toaster (crispy crust).          These are one of my favorite quick  eakfasts on hurried mornings, and sometimes I even enjoy them on a relaxed Sunday morning. I buy these regularly and quality has remained consistently good.  I recommend these highly.
