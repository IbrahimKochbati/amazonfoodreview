I order Hip Action every month for my dogs, I think they like it better than thier food! I wasn't looking for a treat for my dogs as they are getting older my primary reason to purchase Hip Action was for the "medicinal" properties. I can't say I see a huge difference in the dogs agility because hopefully I caught the issue before the dogs had a major problem. A must try dogs love them.
