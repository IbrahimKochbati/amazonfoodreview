I really like these little noodles. I am on the Dukan diet and I really miss pasta, so I thought I'd give the tofu noodles a try. I followed the directions on the package to rinse thoroughly, drain, and then heat for a minute or so in the microwave to dry them out. I used a couple of very short sprays of oil and stir fried them with fresh garlic, canned chopped tomatoes, red pepper flakes, and then added some scallions and cilantro at the end. Very delicious and hit the spot for my pasta craving! I will definitely purchase again!
