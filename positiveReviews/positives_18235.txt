I am on a restricted diet, so these popchips was something I was eager to try.  I am always on the lookout for healthy alternatives to snacking   these were neither fried nor baked (although I will gladly eat a baked chip over a fried potato chip)   popped chips... they reminded me somewhat of Pringles, except the salt content was much lower and not that greasy either.  And, using sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes caught my eye as well.          I loved these popchips.  They are slightly sweet and definitely quenches my need for a snack in the middle of the day.  I've seen these at my local Sprouts (not just in sweet potato flavor but other choices as well) and recommend them.  I think it's wonderful to see different types of alternative ways to healthy snacking available to the consumer.
