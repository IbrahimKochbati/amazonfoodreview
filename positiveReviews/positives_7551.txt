When a friend of mine recommended I tried Chia Seeds I though she was crazy, I mean they're Chia Seeds... enough said. Anyway, I tried them because I'll try just about anything if someone tells me it's good for me and I'll like it, and as it turns out it is both of those things. These little seeds are about the size of sesame seeds, maybe a little smaller, and have a very mild nutty taste. They can be added to just about anything and are packed with omega fats, fiber and a little protein. They've got fat, but not the bad french fries and cheeseburger kind, the good kind that your body uses to keep your heart and everything else healthy. And by the way, these don't have to be ground or chewed up (like flax) in order for your body to get all the goodies from them, you can just eat them the way they are.
