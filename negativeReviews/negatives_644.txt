I've just prepared my first can of this soup.  It tasted incredibly bland, and didn't have much clam flavor.  So then I added more milk, butter, onions, salt and fresh ground pepper, plus white wine.  For 2.92 per 15 oz. can, all of those ingredients should have been adequately added in there already, except for the pepper. Bar Harbor  and certainly didn't stint on the other ingredients in order to increase the amount of clams, that's for sure.  There were larger pieces of clams than in Progresso's   but that's damning with faint praise.  Next time I'll buy the clams and make my own, for less, probably.  I'm just perplexed by these reviews;  I think I can safely say Progresso's tastes better.  And, of course, it's much less expensive.
