I first discovered this product through a discussion on Facebook and tried it blind based on this. Per the item description, this is powdered peanut butter... not just powdered peanuts. Like peanut butter, this also has salt and sugar, but is missing the oil. The strong peanut buttery flavor this provides is spot on and like other reviewers have said, is great to mix into other foods. I've tried to reconstitute it in order to spread on toast. You can do this but it's more trouble than it's worth impo.  This would probably be great in cookie recipes as the lack of oil wouldn't interfere with the consistency of the batter.          Overall this is a great product that delivers as promised.            P.S   Resist the urge to eat a spoonful of this stuff plain. You *will* choke...  so I hear ; )  &lt;&lt;
