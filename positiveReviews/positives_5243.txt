Like many others, I found The Switch Orange Tangerine to be a little hard to classify. It's not too sweet, and not too tart, with a lot of flavor. But it distinctly tastes "blended"   creating a "real" flavor by playing with others.          It doesn't really claim to be healthy, it just insinuates it in a number of ways. On the other hand, it's not too overly sweet like a typical soda and I found the carbonation was just about right.          Bottom line   it's fairly tasty, but the small size for the price is a downside.
