I have used this product consistently to make my mincemeat pies at Thanksgiving and at Christmas for more than 40 years. And I am not the only person who has despaired because of the inability to find this product. This product availability problem began at least 6 or 7 years ago. Then, a couple of years ago I found it on Amazon, only to be told that I would be notified when it was available; but it was never available until this year; that's why I took the opportunity to purchase two 6 packs while I had the opportunity. And by the way, in order to make a mincemeat pie with an appropriate amount of filling, I use two of the 9 ounce boxes. Also, most of us who are committed to this product do not find the ready made mincemeat in the glass jars to be an acceptable substitute.
