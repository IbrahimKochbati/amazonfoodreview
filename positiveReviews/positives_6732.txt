Is this $21.99 price for a single 2 ounce jar or for a 6 pack?  The description only indicates that the price is for 2 ounces, which, of course, is ridiculously expensive. But it's a good deal if it's for a 6 pack.  Previous buyers, can you please advise?  The coffee itself is excellent; I usually buy it in the store and was hoping to find a deal on Amazon.
