Ever since I attended nursing school, I have been wary of salt. I'm trying to cut salt from my diet now while I am young so it isn't difficult to make the shift when I get older. This is an AMAZING product, I can't believe it is salt free. I put it on everything! It would not be useful for baking as there are other added savory spices, but to give foods some zest this is some awesome stuff. Everyone I know is getting one in their stocking this year!
