My puppy loved this toy...but it lasted less than a month! The rope was easily chewed up in a matter of minutes when my back was turned   unlike most other rope toys we have that have lasted since we got her 6 months ago. Then, she was tossing it around with the remains of the rope, and the bottle hit the floor and the screw on end  oke. So, now we can't put treats or toys in the bottle   which is the whole point of the toy! If your dog isn't a rough player, then this is a great toy...once they figure it out. I was very disappointed that this seemingly tough product  oke so quickly.
