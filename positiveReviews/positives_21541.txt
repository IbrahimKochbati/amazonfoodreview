This is the original classic recipe which is already a family favorite (160 calories packet). We take it on trips for the convenience of having a quick, hot  eakfast. Mix it with hot milk for an extra creamy and filling oatmeal. I actually thought I was getting the reformulated version because I've been wanting to try the low sugar version just for a healthier option.
