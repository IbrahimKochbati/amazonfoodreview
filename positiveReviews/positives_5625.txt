First, I just found out it calls for HALF the Amount of Splenda Blend compared to regular  own sugar by reading these reviews.  In spite of that, I still give it an excellent score!          I've always used  own sugars of all kinds in my coffee.  When at the store a few weeks ago I was looking for a lower calorie sweetener for my coffee and happened to buy this Splenda  own sugar blend.  I've been using it in my coffee since and love it.  The only difference I could tell was it was so much sweeter than my usual coffee that when I got close to the bottom of the cup I would pour more coffee into it to stretch the sweetness.  Now I know why...it's twice as sweet as regular  own sugar!          Just ordered the 4 pack and this should tide me over for a while   adding it to teas and coffees...delicious! It's also cheaper on Amazon xoxox
