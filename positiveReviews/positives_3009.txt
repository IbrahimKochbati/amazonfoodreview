This is good stuff, and hard to find in the local pet stores here in ne pa. One store carries it at times but runs out and at times I send for it through Amazon.com. The price in the stores can be very expensive, and the price through amazon is up in the air as the price fluctuates in the store and the shipping at Amazon adds to the price. I won't discuss price except to say if your dog likes it and is not allergic to it then you have to pay what it cost . My dog has lots of allergies and is not allergic to this so I pay what I pay.
