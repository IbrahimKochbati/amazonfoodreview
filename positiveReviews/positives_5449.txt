I hate bugs, but I adore these Bug Bites chocolate squares!  The chocolate is smooth and sweet, and small enough to be a daily indulgence.  Plus, each square comes with a tiny insect flashcard with a photo and factoids for your favorite entomologist.          Pull the trigger on this one.  Your sweet tooth will thank you.
