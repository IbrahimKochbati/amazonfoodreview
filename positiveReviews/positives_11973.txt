These treats are 100% beef liver  nothing else. You can't ask for anything healthier than that! Just don't overfeed them. They're treats, not food. Remember that. Your dog would prefer you forget that distinction, because he will love them that much. If you have a small white dog you are probably familiar with the red eye stains. Most people don't know that adding liver to their diet every day will get rid of that ugly stain. Don't exceed the recommended amount. The stain that's already there won't go away, it will have to grow out and be trimmed away by your groomer. But in a few weeks you should notice that white hair is growing in at the base of the old stains.
