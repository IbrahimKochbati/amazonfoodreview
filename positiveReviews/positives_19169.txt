I really enjoy flavored coffees so when we opened the 12 pod sample pack that came with our new Keurig machine, I was excited to find a sample k cup of Van Houtte's French Vanilla. It ended up being one of the best flavors we had an opportunity to try!          Van Houtte's French Vanilla is not quite as good as some of the french vanilla coffees I've had fresh  ewed at local coffee shops, but it isn't too far off either. It's a very mild, but flavorful coffee with a smooth finish and no bitter aftertaste. I don't like extra dark coffees with lots of acidity, so of that's more your cup of tea, so to speak, this blend isn't for you.          I will definitely be picking up more of this blend and if you're in the market for a french vanilla flavored coffee k up for your Keurig  ewer, this one is an excellent choice.
