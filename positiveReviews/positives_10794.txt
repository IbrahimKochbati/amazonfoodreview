I have a greyhound (very weak jawed) and a lab mix. Both of them seem to love these treats and are very enthusiastic about them.  The treats are quite hard, which is a little difficult for the greyhound to manage so he makes a big mess of it.  But the lab cleans up after him.          Of course, my dogs also enjoy garbage and cat litter goodies, so I can't say that they have discriminating tastes.  However, I also appreciate that Newman's stuff is organic and wheat free.          BOTTOM LINE:  Good treats for any dog who can handle a crunchy biscuit, and for any owner who cares about buying organic.
