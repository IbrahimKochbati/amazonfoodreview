After you've made the customary, authentic English trifle with Bird's custard powder you might not want to go back to the usual grocery store pudding packages. I DID purchase a large quantity of Bird's custard power, the pack of six, but the packs have a longish shelf life, and I enjoyed sending a surprise pack container to a friend who is originally from England.          At Christmas, I will also include a container of Bird's custard powder to special relatives and friends so they can learn how easy it is to make excellent trifle with this product. For my non English family and friends, I will include laminated instructions based on my own successes with Bird's custard recipe for trifle.          English trifle is so easy to make with the following:  Bird's custard powder, store bought pound cake, thawed frozen fruit, some sherry wine (or slightly sweetened juice from the thawed frozen fruit) poured over the small slices of cake. For the final touch, add non dairy whipped "creme." Delicious and inexpensive! I highly recommend this product and am so pleased to be able to purchase it through Amazon. And the price for the six  containers is so very reasonable as to almost be unreal. Go for it!
