I found this tea when I explored a local grocery store on the north shore of Oahu on a trip to Hawaii last summer. Every now & then I like to add cream to my tea so the idea of a milk tea wasn't totally bizarre. (How you'd guess I'm American?) I enjoy white, black, flavored & herbal teas but am not a fan of most floral blends.          I didn't know what to expect when the package said the ingredients included black tea, non dairy creamer, rosehip extract & refined sugar. I've never considered putting non dairy creamer into tea. Would it be a mess I dumped into the mug & stirred to death? Instead, I found all the ingredients in an oversized traditional paper tea bag held in a foil like moisture proof package.          After steeping ~3mins, I was thrilled to discover a light flavored cup of tea, slightly fruity scented, with a soothing feel to it and no floral tones to the taste. And no stirring, no clump at the bottom of the cup.          A year later I found one of the packages in my luggage & found it just as tasty & easy to prepare as last year. I went online to buy some more & was thrilled to find that Amazon offered the same item & a couple of other flavors by the same company too!
