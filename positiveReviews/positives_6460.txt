I am not a huge morning coffee person as this seems to be the only time of day black coffee upsets my stomach. No idea why. My work got a Keurig recently and buy the Caribou regular and morning blends, which are ok but I can hardly drink them unless there's a creamer of some sort in them.          So on a recent trip to BB&B I perused their wall of K cups and this one caught my eye. I am generally a fan of flavored coffees and this sounded good, so I bought an 18 cup pack. I have to say it is delicious! The coconut flavor is light but definitely there, and doesn't leave a bitter aftertaste like most black coffees do. It smells so good my co workers have done a 180 walking by my desk to ask me what smells so good.          Obviously if you're a coffee connoisseur this won't be for you, but if not it is definitely worth a shot. And the best part for me, aside from the flavor, no stomach upset!
