I am a card carrying carnivore.  Having said that, I am also the Laziest Man This Side of a Lebowski.  Even chewing is too much work for me.  Given that, Primal Strips are heaven.  The texture is very close to meat, but is consistently chewable, with none of the gristle often associated with beef jerky.  Spam is too gooey.  Real beef jerky makes my jaw ache, and I end up spitting out gristle too frequently.  But this?  This is perfect.  If "they" replaced meat with this Soylent Brown type food, I'd happily leave the Real Thing behind.  I'm not sure of the health benefits.  I guess it's good for me.  I've seen people who are healthier than I eating it, so I figure it's nutritious.  Anyway, it tastes robust, has a perfect texture, and is a perfect snack.
