I'm not a coffee drinker, but when I need a pick me up this stuff just can't be beat.  It leaves a little silty material at the bottom, but let's face it  if that bothers you, why are you drinking tea?  I mix it with mostly water and a little milk, and this is the closest to authentic Indian chai I've found in the states.  It's simply delicious!  My husband and I were ordering this stuff from the local coffee shop almost daily until they made the mistake of letting us see the box...oops!
