I have to agree with the recent reviews, these are just so so as far as taste.  I bought them as a lightning deal special thinking these would be a little healthier and keep me away from the Kettle chips that I love...after eating a bag of these, I want the Kettle chips back.  They are ok but not as good as a fried chip.  Maybe eating these will discourage me from chips period.  Like some other people making comments, I'll probably finish the box and not buy again.  They remind me of Pringle chips just smaller and maybe a little puffier.
