This is my second Tug a jug, I purchased my first in December of 2008. When my it went to a new home with a foster dog, still in great shape, I knew I needed to purchase another for my Service Dog Toby, as he loves it too. This Tug a jug is larger than our last; it is the Medium Large size. Toby enjoys trying to get whatever I put into it and puts a lot of thought into it. He even prefers having his regular food out of it, even though he could simply go to his bowl to eat. The bottom easily screws off, I fill it with his food, a few treats of varying value and one extremely high value treat (EHVT) that really doesn't come out, but he has hope that some day it will. When I wash it, he gets the contents and thus the EHVT. He knows that I unscrew the bottom, but of course without opposable thumbs, alas he can not. Even so, he tries to figure out how to do that. Dogs can use a lot of energy thinking, chewing and exercising, so I like to give him a variety of each to keep him content. Our last Tug a jug being smaller, he would pick it up from the bottom to try to get the food out, this one being bigger, he can no longer do that, so he's had to change his tactics and I've enjoyed watching how his mind works.
