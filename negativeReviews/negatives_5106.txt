My one year old boxer is a big goofy, playful dog.  He adores chewing on water bottles, stuffed toys, milk bones, you name it.  I really thought this toy would be a terrific idea for him but he is absolutely terrified of it.  He growls and barks at it, won't even smell it.  Sounds terrific to me but I guess if you're considering this toy you should probably  ing your pup to a pet store to introduce him to it first.
