Excellent in cereal, or on top icecream sundae. I use them in my ramen noodle hot sour soup as well.  very very GOOD.  almost a lite peanut flavor.  not too much salt, very lightly seasoned. a must try for anyone wanting a low calorie addition of protien into diet.  even the dog loves them. thinks they are some special treat.
