We bought these hoping they would be treats that lasted long and be good for the dog's teeth. I have a golden retriever that has NEVER had any sort of stomach issue. Anway after the second time giving my dog this chew she developed bad diarrhea and had to be taken out multiple times during the night which was a first. We didn't know what was wrong so put her on boiled chicken, rice, and pumpkin diet. Things firmed up after a day so we thought everything was better. Fast forward a few days and since we felt her stomach was better we gave her another one. What do you know? Diarrhea all through the night again! We went back to the chicken and rice diet till things firmed up. A week later we decided to give her another one. We had not yet put 2 and 2 together, we thought maybe there was some lingering issue and that is why her diarrhea had come back the 2nd time. Well after a week of solid poo we gave her another and just like that, diarrhea through the night again. We finally figured out it was the chews and we will no longer be giving our dogs these. We will be requesting a refund from the company.
