Tried one bag to test out and liked them enough to order three more bags.  I make eskate (sp?) using chia, water, and lime juice and I also have been putting them into homemade peanutbutter and oatmeal energy bars.  Can't speak to this  and vs other  ands as this is the only  and I have tried.  I can say that I was pleased enough to stick with this  and for the re order.
