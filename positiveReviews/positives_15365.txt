Great taste in a medicinal candy.  I found some at Knott's Berry Farm.  I will reorder these from Amazon.  Some seem to dislike the taste, but I find it refreshing.  Read the claims for this herbal tea.  I have ordered seeds to grow my own horeshound herbs, which grow wild in abundance in America. I recommend you try this as something different and traditional.
