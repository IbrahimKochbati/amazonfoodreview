Two thing make a great meal, products and prep work !          Being an ex chef a great beef base can always be a fantastic 'Go To'     and in today's world not everyone has the time to make it from scratch     I know I don't !          I ALWAYS have a couple on hand as many of my friends want some after     they've tasted my entrees, soups and sauces and frankly I got tired     of running out. I'd also highly recommend the Chicken base.          When you take the time to prepare a meal for family & friends     the quality of the products you use will always be known when     all is quiet followed by a few burps.
