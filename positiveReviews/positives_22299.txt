This is the second flavor from Izze I have tried.  The first was the Clementine.  Tasty and not syrupy I really enjoyed the flavor.  I tried the Blackberry.  Unlike the Clementine flavor the name of the drink also makes up one of the juices used to make the beverage, blackberry.  Like the Clementine a cocktail of juices from concentrate are added like Apple Juice and Lemon Juice to give a balanced flavor.          This is not a drink to hydrate in quantity so much as a tasty pick me up.  The drink does not have caffeine or added sugars so I don't feel bad about drinking it.  It isn't overly sweet so it adds a bit of energy rather then making me tired.          90 calories for just over 8 ounces is starting to get up there for me.  That is enough calories that I at least have to think about when I drink the beverage.  A great drink, a good company and thumbs up in my book.  The only issue I had is the calories.
