I hesitated ordering this much tea, but the canisters are nicely sealed to preserve freshness, so it shouldn't be a problem.     This gunpowder tea does indeed have a hint of smokiness, but none of the vegetal notes of say a sencha green.     It is a very nice everyday tea, which I alternate with white tea.     The current sale of 15% off combined with the 15% auto ship discount makes this a real bargain too.
