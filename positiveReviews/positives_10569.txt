I like crunchy snacks.  I'm eating low carb because my doctor advises it, and this helps fill the "popcorn spot" in my life.          There are a lot of things to like about this product.  It's economical.  They cook up fresh whenever you want them, and they taste fresher than the ones you buy pre popped in a bag.  They don't have MSG like the Lawry's  and, and they don't come with a lot of extra packaging.          If you are a low carber looking for pork rinds to cook with, these aren't heavily seasoned, so they won't influence your recipe's flavor.  I like their clean flavor, but it's not hard to add seasoning if you want to experiment or you like more variety.  A little bit of oil or butter will serve as the "glue" to hold your Parmesan cheese, seasoned salt, etc.          There is a bit of a learning curve involved in terms of discovering how long they take in your microwave, but by now I know by feel what size handful to grab and how long to nuke them. It's worth the effort to get to know these.  Highly recommended!
