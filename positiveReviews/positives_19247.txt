My two dogs (father and son) just loved this toy.  They played with it for hours, back and forth.  They liked trying to get the ball out of the ball and did not seem to tire of it.  Fortunately, they are not chewers, as this might be dangerous for those whose dogs are. A unique idea that seems to work!  Great for small to medium size dogs.
