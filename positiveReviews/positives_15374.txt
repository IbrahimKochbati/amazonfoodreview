When I ordered a bouquet of pink roses to be delivered for my mother's birthday, I placed the order much later than I should have and I included in the order a special request to Spring in the Air to expedite delivery in a tight, actually unfair, time frame. I received a personal response from the company that they would make a particular effort to ship the roses in time    from Columbia, South America to Ohio, USA! They also contacted my mother to expect the package. They kept me notified by email of the progress of the shipment. Unfortunately, due to a FedEx delay, the roses were delivered the morning after the requested delivery date. That was not the fault of Spring in the Air, who updated me several times with the delivery information. I still would consider it a lightning speed delivery.            When the roses arrived, my mother was ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED! She told me there were enough roses for her to make two beautiful bouquets, and each rose was in the perfect stage of bloom and without any blemishes due to the EXQUISITE CARE the company took in packaging the flowers. She was amazed the stems on the roses were so long! They were absolutely PERFECT and FRESH cut flowers! She was so happy with them! Because they barely missed the requested delivery date, though through no fault of theirs, Spring in the Air credited the purchase price. I will certainly use this company again. I can't write a review glowing enough to express my satisfaction with my order and my pleasure in dealing with a seller that gives such terrific customer service!
