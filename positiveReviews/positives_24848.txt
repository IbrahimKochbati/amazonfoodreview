I just had to write in after reading a few negatives on the taste.  I've tried a couple yogi teas and wasn't impressed with the taste until I met this one.  I LOVE the taste of this tea.  It also really feels excellent on a sore throat.  I am not a fan of licorice and found that flavor in all the other yogi teas I've tried thus far.  This one does not have any licorice flavor.  It leaves a minty, menthol aftertaste, which I love.          Taste is so subjective...if what I've written entices you, I'd give it a try.          Only reason I give it 4 stars is because I haven't yet been able to attest to the immune boosting properties yet.
