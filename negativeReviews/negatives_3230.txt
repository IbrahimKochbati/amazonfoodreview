Although the description states that the salt free version of Cavender's contains no msg, BEWARE. I sprinkled a little of this on beef last night while cooking it, and my intestines are still talking back to me 12 hours later! 'Flavor base seasoning' and 'five other spices' are both mystery ingredients in this mixture, that probably contain msg. NOT FOR MSG SENSITIVE PEOPLE!
