I  ew it with hot water, then add milk and honey.  If it gets too sweet, it is almost like candy.  I have tried many different varieties of Chai and this is the best bagged tea for me.  I would recommend you buy a single box at Whole Foods or some other store before you buy 6 boxes here.  You will appreciate the price at Amazon more and not get 'stuck' with tea that isn't to your taste.  Sweet Thai Basil is also good, as is the green tea chai from Yogi.
