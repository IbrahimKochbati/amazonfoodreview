Definitely use the smallest amount of water and be sure to shake the cup before  ewing.  The kids got a kick out of making their own "kid coffee" but this was only after we tweaked it with less water and  ewed it with 3 marshmallows on top. (The hot cocoa hitting the marshmallows releases added sugar as well as turns the marshmallows nice and mushy :)          The rest of us don't care to waste our daily calories on something that was, in our opinion, chocolatey water.  Still, it was worth the price for the simple fact that the kiddos can come in from sledding and  ew their own hot cocoa without much mess.
