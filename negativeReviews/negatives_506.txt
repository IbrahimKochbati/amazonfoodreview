The can that is shown says D.O.P. certified but when my relative ordered them from Amazon.com, the cans that were shipped only indicate CERTIFIED. One can buy these non DOP at any Walmart. What do they mean by CERTIFIED? Certified as to what?          Unfortunately, the venders are making fools of Amazon.com. As a consequence, I am staying away from Cento products entirely. Fool me and Amazon once, shame on Cento; fool me and Amazon twice, shame on me and Amazon. There is no way I can make this review FUN!
