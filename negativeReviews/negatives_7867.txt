I'm not sure who's supplying these or where they're coming from. We've bought them several times on Amazon because it's convenient and cheaper than getting them at the vet. Our dog loves them. But I opened the lkast bag I got, and the dog would chew them but not with the same enthusiasm. Almost like someone getting a glass of milk that was going sour. I'd find half of one lying uneaten unchewed. Then she chewed of the corner of one, left the rest, and seemed lethargic. Later that day she vomitted. All that came out was yellow bile and a piece of the chew. We, of course, haven't given her any more. My wife called the company to report what happened, and when she told them where we bought them, they said we couldn't have bough them through Amazon because they're only sold through veterinarians. We're not buying any more of them on line.
