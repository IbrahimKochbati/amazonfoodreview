Good: Big, crisp, snowy white kernels with few duds. Pops quickly, 25% faster than name  and yellow corn in the same microwave and popper.  Decent price and package size   enough to last awhile; not so much as to go stale before it runs out.          Bad: Almost tasteless.  Butter and salt are not optional.          Orville Redenbacher still leads the pack, but this stuff is pretty good and costs a LOT less.  Four stars; would have been five if it were even a little less bland.
