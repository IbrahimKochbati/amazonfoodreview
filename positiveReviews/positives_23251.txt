This product is the BEST!!!! It is so flavorful, rich and moist when made following the directions for my  ead maker and it couldn't be easier to use.  I served it to company and They loved it so much I had to make another loaf to serve later. What a wonderful surprise and I have ordered it a second time.. I didn't have high hopes but thought why not try since I have a wheat allergy.. It was worth the purchase again and again.. Thank you Pamela.
