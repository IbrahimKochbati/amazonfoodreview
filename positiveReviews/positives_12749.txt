I used to buy small bottles of this sauce from the supermarket. I love it, but it is very pricey if you use it often. I got this for my  others birthday, and it is awesome   and half the price of buying in the smaller bottles. It is very good tasting chipotle sauce that I recommend for any hot sauce junkie like myself!
