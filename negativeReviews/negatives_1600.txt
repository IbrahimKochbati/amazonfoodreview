100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't is proudly emblazoned upon the can that contains Switch's Orange Tangerine carbonated juice. It certainly tasted all natural, as there wasn't too much taste really.          Don't get me wrong, it was all right, but I would say it tasted kind of like Sprite with a couple of orange flavored Alka Seltzers tossed in. Another note is that it is rather small at only just over 8 ounces. However, it still had enough orange taste I suppose, so if you want an all natural mild orange flavored carbonated juice drink, then you've just hit the jack pot!          If not, you may want to pass this up, mildly recommended.
