I ordered Ka me rice crunch crackers, plain. I received Ka me gluten free rice crackers, original, all natural.  Unfortunately, they have soy products in this cracker and therefore I can't eat it.  This looks different from the picture that came with the crackers I ordered.  Apparently I can't return the box of crackers.
