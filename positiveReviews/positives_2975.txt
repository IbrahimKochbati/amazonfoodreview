Ras el Hanout is a versatile Moroccan spice blend that can be used for marinading meats (with a little oil and vinegar, maybe some crushed garlic), making stews, or just mixed with olive oil (and maybe a little crushed garlic) for dipping  ead.  You can find many recipes that use it with a google term like "ras el hanout lamb recipe".  Note that it is sometimes spelled "ras el hanoud", so you can find even more using that.          I first found this at the famous (and expensive) spice market in Istanbul.  This blend from Angelina's is nearly as good.  Note that there is no one recipe for this spice blend, and there are many private recipes with a good deal of variation.
