The first time i had these I got them at "Jacks" In NYC for .99c a pack. I loved them. Have been dreaming of them. I got the  ight idea to look for them on Amazon. Glad I did. Payed slightly more with the auto ship but worth every penny since I live in PA and the gas to get to the city is more then the case price. I like to toast them in the toaster oven for a few minutes. The flavor is very good. Very few off flavored nuts. I have had better luck with these then with the fresh.
