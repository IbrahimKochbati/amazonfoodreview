We adopted an 8 year old Dalmatian earlier this year, and heard lots of cautionary tales about special diet. But we couldn't pass up trying a can of this dog food  sadly, just because of the name. Well, she loves it! So now it's her special occasion food. We mix half a can with a cup of dry, 2X day, with no nasty side effects. She also likes Wingaling and the Napa Valley offerings from this company. It's high in protein and works for us!
