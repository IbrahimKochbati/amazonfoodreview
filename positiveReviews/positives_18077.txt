Been buying store bought coffees and even starbucks.  I thought starbucks was it but boy I was wrong!  When Im using this coffee I don't have to put sugar in my coffee which I usually do.  Its so weird but there is no bitter taste.  The freshness of the coffee definitely lasts longer compared to starbucks!Try this and you will never settle for anything less.
