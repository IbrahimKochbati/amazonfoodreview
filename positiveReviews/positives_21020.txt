I don't even like vanilla flavoring.  I'm more of a chocolate shake kind of guy.  But I have to say this was quite delicious.  Almost like it shouldn't be good for you!          The last protein shake I had was grainy, but this Gatorade Shake was the complete opposite.  Extremely smooth and rich.  Filled me right up without any bloating or indigestion, as these kinds of shakes can do sometimes.          I'll have to drink a few more to know if there's any improvement in my health.          For now, a big thumbs up on this shake!
