I bought Blue Diamond Natural Chocolate almonds before & 100% Natural almonds it was good but this one made me feel sick i only eat 10 for the day & i dont know if it's the salt or something else with this but i have to throw this away. i cant even move to workout im hoping i can sleep this off. but i guess im the 1 in 1 million that this happens to.
