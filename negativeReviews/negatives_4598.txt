I love salt & vinegar kettle chips so I decided to try these after reading good reviews. When I received them, I noticed from the very first bag that over half of the chips were inedible due to rotten potatoes! I know how kettle chips should look, and I know what normal marks look like on chips. These were rotten. After waiting over a month for a response from the company, I finally found a phone number and called them, only to be told there was nothing they could do. The sad thing is, the chips that were edible were actually flavorful and tasty. Obviously they just don't care about consistent quality, so stay away from these chips!
