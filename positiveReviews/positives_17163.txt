These are hearty tasting pretzels made with Spelt flour.  They have just the right amount of salt.  Even my husband won't eat regular pretzels anymore when I have these in the house.  The bonus is that nutritionally speaking, these are a healthier choice than white flour pretzels.  The only drawback is that a 7 oz bag gets eaten pretty quickly in my home!
