Nescafe Dolce Gusto Caffe Lungo is not my morning choice for coffee. For mornings, I like a stronger coffee to really kick off the day, but when it comes to an afternoon pick me up, I prefer a medium coffee and the Nescafe Dolce Gusto Caffe Lungo fills that nicely. The instructions suggest you do a 4 oz. pull for a Lungo or a 6 oz. pull for an Americano. Somewhere in between works well for me.          The coffee has got a slight sharpness to it, but definitely not overwhelming. Like the espresso for the same machine, this blend has nutty hints in the coffee. Overall, it's a nice afternoon blend.
