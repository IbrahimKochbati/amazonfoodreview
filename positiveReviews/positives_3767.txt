I heard my kids talking about candy they remembered from childhood and they mentioned Toffifay,so I checked Amazon to see if it was still being sold. It was,and reasonably priced.I ordered a 24 pack,and divided it among their Christmas stockings.They were really surprised and happy to find it Christmas morning.I'm glad I thought of searching Amazon!
