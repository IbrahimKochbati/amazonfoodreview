I have a notoriously finicky Chihuahua who wouldn't eat a regular dog treat if you coated it the best tasting thing on earth, and she certainly wouldn't let me  ush her teeth. Ever since the first time I gave her a Greenie, my dog has gone nuts for these things. On our last trip to the vet they examined her teeth because I expressed concern that her overbite was preventing the Greenies from as effective as they should be. She can't really chew properly with the front teeth.          This vet wasn't our usual vet because we went on a different day, but he looked at her teeth and asked how old she was. I said, "Almost three." And he asked if I'd had her in to have her teeth cleaned before. "No, I didn't know dogs could have their teeth cleaned."          He went on to say that on a scale of one to four, one being the best and four being the worst, her teeth were a perfect one, which was surprising because Chihuahuas have teeth problems early on usually. I explained that I'd been using the Greenies since she was nine months old.          I give her one Greenie every morning because they are so cheap on Amazon. In the store I pay twenty five dollars for a bag of twenty. I pay twenty two dollars on Amazon for a box of ninety six! It's easy to give her one daily. She is still marginally underweight, so I can't say they make her gain weight. She has no digestive issues and doesn't seem to be suffering from having them. Her  eath is fresh, her teeth are white and tartar free, and she's a very happy dog.
