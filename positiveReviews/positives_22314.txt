As the first reviewer said, this soup disappeared from the markets I shop here in the east, so, per usual, I searched Amazon.  This soup is outstanding on its own, and for low carbers diabetics, it is a special treat. I use this mostly as a sauce for chicken, pork chops, veggies. I treat it like mushroom soup for a sauce, thinning with cream or  oth if needed, which normally I don't.  It has just a bit of spiciness to it, and for me it makes a big difference in ease of prep and added variety to what are sometimes bland dishes. There are few canned soups I like, but Progresso makes the ones I find palatable. The French Onion is especially delicious and good for saucing.
