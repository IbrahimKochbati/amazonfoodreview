I just bought this at Wal Mart today. I put it on some nice pork I had cooked in my crock pot looking for that "shredded pork with bbq sauce" effect. It is thinner than your typical sugary sauce but that's nice because a little goes a long way. The flavor is smokey with an unexpected but nice maple flavor. I think I am going to try to add a little hot sauce next time. It's not exactly like a thick gloppy sugar laden sauce, but it does help the craving. I plan to buy it again.
