These are a great alternative to traditional greasy potato chips.  Great for people that are dieting but still craving a salty, crunchy snack.  They are light and crunchy and they taste really good. I was afraid they were going to be like the rice cakes and soy chips but they really taste good.  The original flavor reminds me a lot of the Munchos chips.  The original flavor and salt vinegar are my favorite but they are all good.  My least favorite is the cheddar just because it is an overwhelming cheddar flavor (I don't like cheddar) but most people really like it. I have purchased these several times now and I will continue to do so.  I  highly recommend this product for anyone!
