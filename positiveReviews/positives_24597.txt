I bought this organic pumpkin online because it is impossible to find pumpkin locally. I feed my dogs this every day because it is wonderful for their digestion. Pumpkin was recommended by my vet.  All of the cans were in great condition. There were just a few minor dents on a few of the cans, not anything serious. The quality of the pumpkin was so good that I would serve it to my family, but we really do not eat pumpkin!  An added plus was free shipping.  I would buy this again.
