I have made homemade split pea soup for many years.  I recently resumed doing so after not for about a decade.  I bought organic split peas at my local market, they were tasteless.  Chicken  oth was used to make that soup, too.  But these split peas were much more flavorful.  They cooked up much better as well, meaning that the first  and's peas must have been old, bcs after an hour or more they were still tough.  So, that tells me these are fresh, and superior.
