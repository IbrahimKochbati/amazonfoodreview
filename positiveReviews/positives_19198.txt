I received a Kyjen Tennis Slider to review, and at first I was skeptical. It seemed flimsy and gimmicky. My two dogs changed my mind, and a friend's dog has also tried it and given her approval too! All three dogs thoroughly enjoyed learning to move the individual flaps of the puzzle toy to release one and then both tennis balls, and then moving the center piece to slide up or down, revealing treats! All of the dogs figured the puzzle out within minutes, and each has their own style. My Rott paws it open, bashing it with his giant paws. My Lab nosed it for a while, then picked it up and tossed it. My friend's Terrier mix nosed it open. This is a great way to keep the dogs thinking and to give an outlet for some mental energy. I thought it was flimsy, but so far even with the abuse dished out by close to 200 lbs of dog so far, it only has a few minor scratches, so I would say it is holding up nicely!          The bad: the dogs solve it too quickly, and there is no way to make it harder. Additionally, I am not sure how it will hold up in the long term, but I will let you know!
