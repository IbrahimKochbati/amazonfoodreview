I've got two dogs who will eat almost anything. I like to give them good, wholesome food and the increasing prices make it difficult. I purchased the Merrick Turducken as Merrick used to be a great company that made wonderful dog food that looked like human food. Not in this case! It looks, smells, and has the same appetizing effect on my dogs as if I'd thrown up in the bowl. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!! Neither of my dogs likes it and I'm stuck with an expensive case of food. My dogs both sniffed their bowls, then walked away. I'm feeding it to them as its bought and paid for, but I feel cruel doing so. They usually won't jump right into eating it, no matter how hungry they are. They do eat a little, but usually leave at least half in their bowl and that's so unlike them! Horrible dog food. Would never recommend to anyone. Looks disgusting and must taste the same the way my dogs are avoiding it.
