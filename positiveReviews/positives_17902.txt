I'm not sure if it was a nostalgia thing but it has been ages since I had Shake 'n Bake so when I saw this retro packaged item, I went for it.          As usual, the prep was simple. Shake and bake. Love that.          While it was baking, it made the house smell wonderful. I loved that too.          When it came to eating it, I enjoyed it. Crisp but not too crisp. Good flavor and not too salty.          My son wasn't quite as taken. I suppose it may be because he was thinking it would be more of a tonkatsu type of taste, but tonkatus is fried and this is baked. That is what I explained to him but he was still on the fence about it.          But too bad for him. I'll be getting this again. The ease of use and the taste and the fact that it is baked and not fried are reasons enough for me.
