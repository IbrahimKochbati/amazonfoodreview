I recently had a very difficult period of allergies with my 2 dachshunds.  My older dog is very picky about treats.  he will only eat soft treats, no hard biscuits whatsoever.  Now that he has been diagnosed with allergies to wheat, corn, chicken, and rice, I can't find ANY soft treats to give him.  He loves the fish treats and they are now his only treat, so I always have some variety on hand.
