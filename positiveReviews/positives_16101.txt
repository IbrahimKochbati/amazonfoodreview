I've enjoyed this tea for years. However, when I last bought some from my local Indian store I couldn't decipher the code on the box. I was looking for a "best before" date stamp and there was none. Sadly, I had to throw the tea out because it was old. I'd buy again, but only as long as I understand how fresh it is.
