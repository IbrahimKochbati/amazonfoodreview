I have this flavor shipped automatically now, along with several others.  This happens to be our favorite, and I have to remind my husband the two boxes need to last until the next shipment.  A slight coconut aroma and flavor is so amazingly delightful in the morning.  Not overly strong, and perfect for our taste buds.  Our favorite part of waking up in the morning!
