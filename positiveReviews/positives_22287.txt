If you are looking for non sweetened lightly flavored sparkling water you couldn't do better than TalkingRain.  It comes in several flavors, but my favorite is Berry.  I have always enjoyed carbonated drinks, but so many are too sweet.  Drink too many of those and you end up needing to diet.  With TalkingRain there is no such problem.  And if you don't particularly like plain water, this is the solution.  When my son in law tasted it I had to double my order.
