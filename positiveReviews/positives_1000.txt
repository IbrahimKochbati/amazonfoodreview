I DON'T MIND PAYING A LOT FOR A QUALITY TREAT FOR MY DOGS AS THESE ARE, BUT I HAVE A REAL PROBLEM IN COMPANIES WHO PRICE GOUGE ON SHIPPING CHARGES.

THERE IS NO WAY THAT IT COST THEM $10 TO SHIP A 5LB BAG OF TREATS TO ME.  $6 DOLLARS WOULD BE FAIR AND ACCURATE, THIS IS THE REASON I GAVE IT ONLY 4 STARS INSTEAD OF 5
