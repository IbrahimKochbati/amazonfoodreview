DeBoles Fettuccine turns out perfectly, pot after pot. The trick is  inging the water (with a little olive oil in it) to a rolling boil, before adding the pasta. Then boil for ten minutes, remove immediately, and drain. The pasta is al dente and never sticky, hard, or mushy. I will continue to buy this pasta. It is much better than NRG and other  ands.
