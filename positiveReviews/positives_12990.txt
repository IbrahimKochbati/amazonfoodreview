I Really like this Lemon Extract it is of premium quality with excellent results I do a lot of Baking and use many different Extracts and they are all made with a very high percentage of alcohol is the only way, Vanilla, Vanilla Nut, Orange, Coconut, Butter, Banana, Lemon, Anise, Extracts, I use them all, except for Almond extract, we don't use that one too much. I am always looking for different Brands and some are very good like this one. We make Pound Cakes of various flavors, among many other things, and the Lemon and Orange ones are some of my Favorites. Thank You
