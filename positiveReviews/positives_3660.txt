I believe that dog food should be what your dog likes to start with.          Next, I think that you should do research to make sure it is right for          your pooch!!! All human grade products go into the dog food, another          decision is the size, and for 14 lbs. a 7 pound bag is perfect!!! Buying          at Amazon is a great way to buy, because they have the 7 pounder!!!
