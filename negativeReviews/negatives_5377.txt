My husband gets heartburn frequently so I thought that we would. try this coffe for him.  The smell when you first opened it was not the wonderful smell of coffee that you normally get from opening coffee.  The smell of the  ewed coffee was not very pleasant and since smell affects the taste the taste was not as good as regular coffee.  It did help my husband with the heartburn but you must give up smell and flavor for it.
