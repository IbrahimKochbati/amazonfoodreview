A good friend gave us this wonderful Whole Spice Chili Chipotle Powder for Christmas, 2009 and it's almost gone as I write this in early May, 2010.          It's tantalizingly smoky and irresistable in the mysterious quality it lends to certain combinations. Yes, it's delighfully piquant and, if you have a heavy hand, just plain hot.  So, lighten up, use less and enjoy the deep flavor.          Try a light sprinkle of this Chipotle and Garlic Garni on sunnyside up eggs served on toast with a garnish of arugula or watercress.  Hmmmm...makes my mouth water just writing about it!
