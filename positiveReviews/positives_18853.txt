We have a 6 month old Shih Tzu and a 2 year old white fluffy mix.  They weight 8lbs and 15 lbs respectively.  Each eats about 1 scoop a day.  Each 11lb bag lasts us about 1.5 months.          Yes   it is not a lot of weight, but its also not full of filler.  A lot of dogs eat 3x + what they need to because their food is so lacking in nutrients.  This is pure meat (which as a vegetarian is odd to write).  Our dogs love apples, bananas, and oranges   but love their lamb.          Warning   we just moved and couldn't find Ziwipeak.  They wouldn't touch anything else we bought!  Seriously.  They are hooked. They love it.          So we are huge fans!
