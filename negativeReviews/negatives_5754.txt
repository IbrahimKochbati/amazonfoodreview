I've always enjoyed Bakery on Main gluten free cereals, and was excited to find this product because it is more like "real" granola and healthier than many of the alternatives.  However, my bag is largely over cooked and a bit burnt tasting.  I also don't find the granola to have much flavor more generally.  The berries taste, well, fake because they are freeze dried (at least the strawberries are, and those are the only berries I taste), rather than simply dried like the fruit they use in their other products.          Overall, if they put some work into this product I'd be happy to try it again, but if it remains this way, I'm unlikely to try another batch.
