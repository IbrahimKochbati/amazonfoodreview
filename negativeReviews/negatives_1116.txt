My dog LOVES this food.  I really like that it is organic, especially with all the recent problems with other dog foods.  I will continue to buy this  and in the store.  I would rate the product as a 5.          The problem I had was with subscribe and save.  I started out buying at a very decent price.  After only 2 months the subscription price had increased by almost 40%!!  No notice on the increase was sent to see if I still wanted it either.  I believe Amazon should send an alert and ask to confirm or cancel when there is an increase.  My other subscriptions have not had price increases like this one.  Subscription rating   1.
