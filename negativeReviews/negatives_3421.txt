I found this flavor of Primal Strips Spicy & (Hot Mushroom) to be one of the most salty foods I have ever tasted! It was an overwhelming salt taste and this flavor is just not for me. I could not eat more than one. This  and's Teriyaki flavor is better. The "jerky" is a bit soft, thin and oily. It has a strange texture that  eaks into pieces that are more mushy than chewy. It is not as satisfying as the other "mock meat" products I've tried,  (2 examples are listed below). I suggest finding a way to taste one piece of this before committing to buy an entire case.          For comparison, I would recommend "Stonewall's Jerquee" (soy, vegetarian, available on Amazon). Stonewalls has a better, chewer,"meatier" texture, soft enough to bite into, but drier and firm enough to chew for a short while. It comes in 7 flavors, none of which were unpleasant, like this Primal Strips flavor.          Another tasty soy meatless similar product is "Manna Soy Gourmet Meatless" (4 flavors, on Amazon). This comes in big, 4 pound, bags and 4 flavors. It starts out softer than jerky, but can be microwaved into dryer, chewy strips that are very satisfying. Very versatile for vegetarian vegan diets and a good value for price.
