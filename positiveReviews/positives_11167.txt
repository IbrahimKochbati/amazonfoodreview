Bought a Keurig machine several months ago (which I love BTW!) and started out buying different variety packs of coffee's so I could try all kinds of new flavors and blends.  Eventually I wanted to decide upon something that would be my everyday standard.  In the mornings like a nice solid bold roast that's rich and doesn't get watered down when making a full cup out of the Keurig machine.          Right away I knew the Emeril's was the best choice, the Easy Bold is perfect my morning Joe.  At night I go with a lighter blend (from Supermarket using the MyK Cup) but Emeril's Easy Bold is perfect for my mornings.
