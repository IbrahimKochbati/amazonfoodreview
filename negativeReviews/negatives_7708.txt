My wife is the coffee drinker in the house and we have tried many BOLD blends over the last couple of years. She found the Tullys Italian Roast to be far too weak even on the lowest Kureg setting. The only one we have found that meets her standards is Timothy's Parisian Nights. If you like a nice bold cup of Joe then she would recomend the Timothy's hands down. Amazon no longer sells the Timothy's by auto shipment so we had to go to the Green Mountain website and get the auto shipment there. Good luck
