I'm not the best cook, but I like to try new things to make my diet healthier.  I confess that I LOVE ramen noodles, and this product helps me cut the salt content.  The flavor packet that comes in Ramen noodles usually has between 600 900 grams of sodium per serving (2 servings in the packet...I eat the whole thing, so that's a LOT of salt.  This Miso contains 880 grams sodium per tablespoon.  I add a table spoon to my ramen, then just a light sprinkle of original flavor packet, cutting the salt almost in half, while still adding a nice savory flavor.  I also add a handful of frozen peas, but I like to keep it simple.  I'm sure there are many other recipes and uses to be found out there, so enjoy!
