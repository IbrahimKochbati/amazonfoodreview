So, the top inch or so of the can is sliced CARROTS, not jalape&ntilde;os as the labeling might somehow suggest (ok, seriously, it says "sliced jalape&ntilde;os").  There is a bunch of other junk mixed in, including bay leaves, onions, etc., which interfere with using these in anything you JUST wanted jalape&ntilde;os in!  So, lesson learned:  Pay for work, get sleep; pay for jalape&ntilde;os, get carrots...
