I love this syrup, it doesnt have all those added ingredients, its not like dark amber syrup thats extra sweet. A little bit goes a long way. When i pour it on my waffles i only need to pour it in the middle and thats enough for 1 whole waffle. So if you think this little bottle wont work for big families you would be mistaken, i use half as much as i would with the fructose added syrups.
