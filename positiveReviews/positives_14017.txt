If you are used to eating regular peanut butter (like JIF or Peter Pan), this will probably not be palatable to you. If you are used to eating natural PB, then you will likely appreciate this product a bit more. I bought this yesterday out of curiosity, and it is quite delicious. I LOVE PB, but try not to eat too much because it is so calorie dense. I like to get my healthy fats through nut butters, but some days you want to spend your calories on other foods. THis is GREAT to put into a protein shake or smoothie without adding 200 calories and I just had some on my lightened up french toast (low cal  ead, egg whites & sugar free syrup) and it was delicious!
