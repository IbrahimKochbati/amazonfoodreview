I bought these recently as a Friday special for a great price.  These came quickly and I have one bag open and the others hidden so I don't eat them all.  These are huge bags and the candy is nice and fresh.  Wish the peanut butter ones would come in bags like these and sold thru Amazon, not another seller who charges shipping.  Thanks for the good sale on these.
