As a pet enthusiast, I appreciate when a manufacturer cares about the animal and not just the profits.  First Mate has their own factory and sources their products from North America. They formulate their food to be holistic, basically, what the dog needs and nothing else.  Their food is balanced and not trendy like many of the high protein diets.  Best of all...my dogs eat it!  I cannot tell you how many times I have purchased high end foods that my dogs won't go near.
