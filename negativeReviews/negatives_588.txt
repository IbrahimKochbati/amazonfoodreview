I used to buy these as healthy snacks at my office cafeteria and consider it better than a bag of potato chips.  These taste very crunchy and tasty.          Given the kind of unethical food stories we read about China   we need to see some kind of assurance and facts on the processes that the manufacturer is following to make these.  You just cannot import food stuff and sell in the US as gourmet snack food   there needs to be data backing this.          Few example of Chinese food (yuk ...):          (1) Melamine(kind of platic) in baby food and milk (so wide spread that 80% of milk in China contained this plastic in 2008)          (2) Honey contaminated with ciprofloxacin (antibiotic)   because of which it was banned in the US          (3) Soy Sauce made from Human hair (not joking google it if you want)          (4) Spurious drugs exported to African countries.          Need some good facts and quality controls from the Manufacturers that the chinese producers are complying with some good quality controls.
