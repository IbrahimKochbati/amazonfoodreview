I loved this!  I am a vegetarian and a mom that loves to have something in her purse for weak moments!  This totally fits the bill.  I looked on the Primal Spirit website before ordering to see the differences in nutritional content between all of the flavors and I was surprised that there was quite a difference.  I ended up choosing the Texas Barbecue because it equaled 2 Weight Watchers points and was the lowest in calories.  They are definitely pricey but in my mind totally worth it.  A lot come in a box and they are a great snack to carry with you!
