I really wanted these to taste good, but there is something in there that is very bitter. I had to add too much sugar to make them even slightly palatable. No one would eat them. They LOOKED delicious after baking and they're healthy, but that's only if you manage to choke one down. I have tried their ginger ead, corn muffin mix, and jalapeno corn ead mix and those are all great.
