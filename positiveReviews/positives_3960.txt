My kids (4yrs and 1 1 2yrs) love these cookies, much to my surprise!  The mini ones are just right for them and I'm happy to give them 'cookies' for  eakfast!  There are 2 things I don't like:  1) The individual cookie packages are VERY hard to open...I always need scissors and 2) the cookies fall apart easily...I wouldn't recommend passing these out in the car!     Overall a great product and I purchased these in bulk so we are sure to always have them on hand.
