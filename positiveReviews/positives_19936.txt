The barbeque flavor of these chips is really perfect! Just spicy enough, a hint of sweetness, just a little smokey. The chips themselves are extra crunchy and just thick enough to be substantial, but not hard. This makes for a wonderful snack or a great accompaniment for burgers, hot dogs or  ats, chicken or just about any casual entree.
