I have received two separate shipments of this product    one in December, one in Janaury (2011) and not a single can was dented (some reviewers complained about dented cans so I'm assuming the issue has been resolved). The product is high quality. It is part of the diet I feed to my dogs (home prepared food only mostly raw meat) but I've eaten this pumpkin myself and it is a fine product.
