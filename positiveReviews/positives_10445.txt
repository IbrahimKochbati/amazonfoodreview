Boy our dogs go crazy for these treats, I buy the regular sized ones and cut them into thirds, they are easy to cut and our dogs are small Yorkies so the third portion is perfect for a treat. They are good for their teeth too. We have one 12 year old and her teeth are perfect. They are one of our dogs favorite treats that we buy. Your dog will love the flavor and they are made in the USA. Can't beat that, just wish they were a bit cheaper.
