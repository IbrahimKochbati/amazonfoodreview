its really no better than that crap jack links. a lot of the pieces are to tough to chew and i eat real jerky all the time. this is only slightly better than jacks link. the only pro is its cheap. ill take quality over this next time. half of it is just dog food because of its poor quality. its not real beef jerky, its very moist and tough. i like real dry jerky. i had to spit some pieces out because they were to tough on my teeth... first time that has happen with beef jerky.
