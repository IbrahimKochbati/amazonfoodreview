I was excited to buy these "chips" and try them out since they are supposed to be a healthier alternative. But these things are super super salty.  What it lacks in oil, it makes up for in salt.  I would not consider these things healthy at all.  I bought these for my toddler but I didn't know why he only ate 2 pieces before giving up until I tasted them myself. I even opened a 2nd and 3rd bag just to make sure the first bag wasn't just a fluke.  Don't waste your money on these.  Stick w  the baked chips!
