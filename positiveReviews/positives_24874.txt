I came across these treats months ago in Target when I was looking for things  to make my dogs first vet experience a more pleasant one.          They were the healthiest things in the store, believe you me!     My dog really liked these.          I did go on the site and everything looked kosher but I was eventually scared away from them b c of the whole 'Made in China' issue. She is eating other treats right now but...I'm willing to give Dogswell another try.     H*ll, look at all of the recalls occurring within OUR borders....and the bulk of us are still eating beef.
