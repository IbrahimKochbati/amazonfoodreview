Pamela's Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Whenever bar is what I would call a dessert bar, a healthier replacement for a candy bar.          It comes in a cardboard box containing five individually wrapped bars. The first one I opened had a smell aroma of coconut upon opening. I didn't notice the smell on subsequent openings.          Nutrition wise, the cardboard box touts 180mg Omega 3, 9g whole grains and 0g trans fats. The standard nutrition facts box says, per bar, you get 180 calories, 9g of fat (2.5g saturated), 15mg cholesterol (5%), 130mg sodium, 23gb carbs (2g fiber, 8gb sugars) and 2g protein. It has traces of iron and calcium.          Despite the oat y taste, I actually liked this one and would consider it as a reasonable healthier replacement for mass market candy bars.
