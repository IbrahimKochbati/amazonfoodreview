I sat the toy on the floor and he immediately opened one flap and used it to rotate the toy and get the treats in every chamber. It wasn't much of a puzzle and he finished before I could log in to write this review. Less than 2 minutes. I'm not sure I would buy too many more of these products. In theory the product is a good idea. I gave this two stars instead of one because he did enjoy himself in those two minutes.
