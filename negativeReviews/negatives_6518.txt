I was overall disappointed with this basket.  While the salami and cheese spread were good, much of the rest of the basket seemed to be fillers.  The box of chocolates actually contained wrapped candy (a mallo cup, a peanut butter cup and some of what was once called penny candy).  There were crackers and pretzels (a small bag contained two hard pretzels).  I realize with a purchase like this you are really paying a premium for the packaging and delivery but I thought this one was a little light on actual food.
