I orderd Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle K Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24 Count Boxes (Pack of 2)     Sold by: Amazon.com, LLC.  This item was listed under hot chocolate.  This is not hot chocolate this is a flavored coffee and I cannot return it because it is a food product.  I feel I this item was not represented correctly and I am paying for an item I will never use.  This was their error and not mine.          I cannot get any help from the seller.  I am stuck!!!!          NEVER will I order from here again.
