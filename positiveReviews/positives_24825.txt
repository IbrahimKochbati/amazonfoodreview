I bought these to try to get my girls to eat them instead of sugary junk food.  To set a good example I ate one first.  wow!  My girls never got a chance to try them.  I blew through them 2 day.  they are great the way the are, or add some parmesan after you cook them and they are even better!  I had to increase the cooking time to 1 minute to get them hot.  My new order is for 2 double sized and 2 single sized (still hoping my girls will try them)
