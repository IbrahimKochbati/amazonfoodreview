I showed this to my son's pediatrician and he was impressed with (and supported!) the list of items added to the cereal!          This was the first solids I added to my child's bottle when we started to transition away from milk only. The cereal is really finely milled and melts away easily into the liquid. At first I was worried that it would thicken up too much that it would clog the milk from flowing through, but happy to report it did not happen. I usually add one tablespoon of cereal to 6oz of milk. I noticed that once I started to do that, the bottle will sustain my son for longer periods of time especially at night. Now, I use this with every bottle of milk I make for him. Sometimes I also use this to thicken some of the fruits or veggie puree that are too watery. This makes the puree thicker and easier for baby to eat from the spoon. When the puree is too thin, it will dribble out of baby's mouth easily   after all they are just starting to get the hang of gumming,tasting and swallowing something this is not completely liquid.          Amazon prices are much cheaper ($19.29 for pack of 6 or $3.22 per canister) compared to what the local Whole Foods would charge(about $5 including tax for ONE). I hesitated for a moment since this is after all SIX canisters, but after looking at how much I use this on a daily basis, I am sure we will deplete this in no time!
