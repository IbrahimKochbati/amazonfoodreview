I see the small size has the rubber version of the "rope" as opposed to the rope that is really a rope.  Maybe the real rope would last longer, but even with our "rubber rope" chewed in half, this toy works great, I just leave the big end of the "rope" inside the jug, where it slows down the treats from pouring out the end.  I just put a handful of dry food in through the small end of the jug (easy to do, now that the rope isn't there, much easier than unscrewing the big end).  Since there is only a handful of treats in it, my dachsie has to stand it up vertically to get them out.  It keep him busy for 20 30 minutes.  I always give it to him when I'm going out of the house, and his tail never stops wagging as he works the food out. My downstairs neighbors haven't complained yet about the odd clunking sounds ...
