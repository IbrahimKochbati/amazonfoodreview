Honestly, I can't understand the complaints that people have about this product. Food pops out easily (I never have to run it under hot water) and it doesn't make your hands cold. I've never noticed a chemical smell either. I always freeze up portions of what we had for dinner then bag the portions in freezer bags, which leaves the Beaba container available for the next use. And it's always being used...I love it!!!
