My plan had been to order large bags to save a little money, but I'm so glad I ordered Weavers!  You'll notice when you open the bag how heavenly the strong, sweet aroma is.  It does fill the room and it'll waft into your bedroom all night if you grind and prepare it on a timer the night before. I know, you may think it a sin to grind early, but that convenience doesn't curtail your pleasure with Weaver's.  The taste! It's delightfully rich and full.  I can't YET speak for consistency.
