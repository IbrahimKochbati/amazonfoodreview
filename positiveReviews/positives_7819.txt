The more powerful your microwave the better they turn out. 90 seconds in ours and they are large (up to 3 inches) and fluffy mixed with a few crunchies. Our microwave at work is lame. They burn or don't pop completely.  I think I'm hooked!  I subscribe to them I always like having them around for when "I want something but I don't know what". Oh, and with a few drops of Franks X tra hot!!!!
