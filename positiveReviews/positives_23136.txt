I've tried a number of gluten free  eads and  ead mixes and they all tasted like sawdust...but this mix from Pamela's Products is the exception.  It is moist and heavy but is close in texture and taste to "regular"  ead when used for sandwiches and such. I slice mine real thin. I cannot get it to toast, but it's still good with jelly. It makes easily in the  ead maker.
