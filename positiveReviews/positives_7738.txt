THIS WAS MY SECOND ORDER OF THIS PRODUCT.  SOMETIMES ONE BAG CAN BE A LITTLE SALTY, BUT IN GENERAL, WE REALLY LIKE THEM.  I PUT THEM IN OUR MICROWAVE FOR 2 MINUTES AND PRESTO, YOU HAVE WARM PORK RINDS.  BE AWARE, THEY DO NOT MAKING A POPPING SOUND LIKE WHEN YOU MAKE MICROWAVE POPCORN, SO DON'T WORRY.  JUST MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTION AND SHAKE THE BAG WELL TO MOVE THEM AROUND.  YOU CAN'T SEEM TO FIND THEM IN THE STORE, SO IT'S GREAT THAT AMAZON CARRIES THEM ON THEIR SITE.  FOR LESS THAN A DOLLAR A BAG, YOU HAVE WARM FRESH PORK RINDS.
