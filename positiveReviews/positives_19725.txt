I ordered the hickory smoked soy jerky, and was very impressed. It had some type of sauce on it that surprised me (don't know if this is typical of all flavors), but was delicious. I have in the last few months purchased the Vegan Dreams variety pack...a drier, thinner and chewier product, but not necessarily less tasty. The sauciness on my Primal hickory smoked might lend itself to heating it up for different vegan meals, as it is more juicy. I look forward to trying the other varieties.     I just tried the Texas Bar b que, and I really like this flavor as well. This version seems to be a bit less "saucy", but just as moist and delicious. It does have a "stringy" texture to it that makes dental floss a must! In the search for a good veggie jerky, I am leaning towards the Primal line.
