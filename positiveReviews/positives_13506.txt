A friend, who grew up in El Salvador, made some hot chocolate one night.  We all wanted know what ingredients he'd used   we loved the drink!  This was not the Quik of childhood.     I pop a piece into a large mug of skim milk   into the microwave for a bit 'til heated through.  Mix w  a small egg whisk and enjoy.
