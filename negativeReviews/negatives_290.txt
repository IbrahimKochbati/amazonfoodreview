This was very pricey for what is essentially a small bag of hard crumbs.     Maybe my dog is just spoiled, but she treats these like third class treats  it is definitely on the bottom of the doggie treat hierarchy.  More often than not, she will simply walk away from these.  Glad other people like them, but I will not be buying them again.
