A friend introduced me to Lavazza a few years ago, and I have to say it's one of the nicest coffees I've had. I use it in my stove top espresso maker, and it  ews a perfect cup every time. I also use the decaf version, which is also really good for decaf. My only gripe would be that it's neither fair trade or organic.
