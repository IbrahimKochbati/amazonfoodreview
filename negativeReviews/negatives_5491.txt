We used to drink this all the time. It was a great coffee. But recently we noticed that the formula has changed. Something has changed, because both my wife and started noticing that the taste was different and it always tastes a little weak now. We've tried a few different  ands lately, and sure enough, something about that Kirkland coffee is different than before, and we just don't care for it. I wonder what changed?
