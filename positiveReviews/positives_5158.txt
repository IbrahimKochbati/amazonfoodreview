4 Stars is a compromise between my rating of 2 and my grandchildren's rating of 5 stars.  I thought the flavor was too heavy on the apple grape juice combo and light on the orange tangerine flavor.  Also, it left a mild, canned aftertaste.  But my 9 year old granddaughters loved it and consider it a treat equal to soda.  It is 100% juice concentrate which has been reconstituted with carbonated water, so it is much healthier for them than regular soda.  While it is true it still has sugar, natural sugars from the juices are healthier than processed sugars found in soft drinks. The can I was sent contained 8.3 ounces which is a better size for them than a regular 12 ounce can of soda.  For children, this is a tasty and healthy alternative.
