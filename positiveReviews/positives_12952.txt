The Switch Kiwi Berry is an excellent product that far exceeded my expectations.  I'm not a fan of the kiwi strawberry combo that when attempted with artificial flavors comes of as borderline toxic, but The Switch succeeds where others fail, and without the need for artificial flavors or unnecessary additives.     I  had my doubts about this product, primarily because there are so many new "craft" sodas on the market.  These "craft" sodas seem to be the  non alcoholic equivalent of the micro  ew craze that seems to be leveling off.     The fact that the product is actually fruit juice, gives me high hopes that the corn syrup and chemically dependant soda industry can innovate with solid and natural products.     The small size is also a benefit, in that it's adequate for this type of beverage.  We've become a society of excess, and sodas, colas and other soft drinks have not been immune,  The Switch  ings us back to the days of reasonable and healthy serving sizes and hopefully consumers will take note.     An all around excellent product that I will be looking for in stores.
