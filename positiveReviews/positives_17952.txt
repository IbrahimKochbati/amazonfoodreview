I always loved Shake and Bake for pork when I was a kid, but for some reason, I hadn't had it in many, many years. I'm not sure how today's formulation of it compares to it in the 1960's, but it's every bit as good as I remembered it. The instructions called for 1 2 inch chops that were to be cooked 15 minutes, which didn't seem long enough to me, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that they did get done all the way through and were still juicy and wonderful. I think most people over cook pork trying to be careful and end up ruining it. The coating was crunchy and perfectly seasoned. This will be a regular at our dinner table now that we've been reintroduced to it. The package said it was enough to coat 6 chops, but it's really only enough for 5 at the most.
