I love this popcorn, and with the subscription savings of 15% and free shipping that you get on subscription products, this stuff is a bargain.          I used to use th 4oz kits with my Whirley Pop and it made delicious popcorn every time.  I moved to the 8oz bags when my Matinee Movie 8oz popper arrived from Discount Tommy.  The 8oz bags have nearly twice the yield of the 4 oz kits and are less than 4 dollars a case more (Thats only .16 more a kit for double the batch)          My 8oz popper creates a little more old maids because the kettle is designed to spit out the corn on the bottom of the tray as it pops.          The 8oz kit is a bit big for home use unless you actually have a commercial style popper.  There are very few oil based poppers (electric or stove) that can handle the yield of these kits, and if you have a Whirly Pop or Stir Crazy then I would get the 4oz kits.          If you have a commercial style 8oz popper I would totally recommend these.          The funny thing is that the 4oz kits have instructions for hot air machines.  They say just don't use the oil.  Are you kidding me!?!?  It's the coconut oil and the butter salt that give this stuff it's "movie theatre" taste.          Buying this stuff for a hot air machine is just plain dumb.  Well, using a hot air machine for popcorn is just plain dumb, but that's just my opinion....  ; )
