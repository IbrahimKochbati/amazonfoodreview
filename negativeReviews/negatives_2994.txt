The other review is correct... artificial color has been added to a great product and ruined it. The genius behind this decision should be tarred and feathered and run out of town on rail... ok, then, just fire them. The Altoid customer base, I would imagine, prefer natural ingredients and don't want crap... this is crap. The marketing genius behind this decision canNOT be a regular user of Altoids... any regular user would have known better... don't destroy a winner to make it look "pretty". I'm eating them for pete's sake, not dating them.          Same with the Spearmint. Ruined by artificial color and ingredients.          Duh... I guess I am too stupid to know the difference... Duh.          I am still buying the Peppermint... for now. As far as I know, it is the only Altoid mint that still uses natural peppermint oil and no artificial colors... for now.          OOoh oooh... how about this, marketing geniuses at Altoid... artificially colored red stripes in the Peppermint. Brilliant! Seriously, anybody that sees this and think it's a good idea needs to be FIRED.
