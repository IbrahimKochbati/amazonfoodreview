Spearmint Lifesavers have been my favorite for many years, and I've been buying them in bulk from Amazon because they're so hard to find in stores. I just opened a new shipment today and ate one, and it tasted terrible!  I thought perhaps I had received a different flavor by mistake, but when I looked at the label, it said "spearomint."  Then I noticed "New & Improved Flavor." What a joke.  The old flavor was delicious, and this one tastes just awful. This isn't just a minor difference.  There's no spearmint flavor at all, just a chemical taste and even worse after taste.  The ingredients are the same (sugar, corn syrup, natural flavor, stearic acid), so it must be the "natural flavor" which doesn't taste like anything natural to me. I have one old roll left, and I guess I'll have to really savor the flavor I love for the last time.
