I was just a little wary ordering this because of the other reviews that said it was super salty and way too tough. But I gave it a shot anyway. I don't know if it was because I ordered a different flavor(Teriyaki) or if I just got lucky. Nonetheless, I think these jerky strips are some of the best I've ever had. I will admit to the fact that they are just a little salty, but nothing an ice cold cola or beer of your choice won't fix. As per being tough, I munched down five or six right out of the container as soon as I opened it. I just couldn't stop myself, they were that good. For all that chewing my jaw is none the worse for the wear. So for those of you out there that are real jerky fans, this is definitely worth trying.          **Update** I did a little research because I was curious as to why everyone thought this jerky was too salty. I looked up the nutrition facts on all 4 flavors. Both the Original & Peppered contain 650mg of sodium, the Wood Smoked had 570mg, and the Teriyaki has only 440mg of sodium. So if you thought the others were too salty, or are worried about this jerky being too salty, try the teriyaki. I highly recommend it. It's not too salty, just a hint of sweet from the teriyaki, but still nice pepper flavor as well.
