I'm not one to review anything on Amazon, and especially not food, but just like the others, I had to get my two cents in..don't buy this crap. To me, it wasn't flavorless at all. Infact, it was so flavorful that I had to lick my butt to get the taste out of my mouth. This garbage smells like dog food and with the way it taste it probably could pass as dog food too.
