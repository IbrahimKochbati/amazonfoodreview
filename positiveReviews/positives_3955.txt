I started eating these after reading Esselstyn's popular book on heart disease (heal through eating oatmeal).  There's no way I can choke down cooked oat meal; eating oatmeal cookies, on the other hand, is something I can swallow.  All of Erin Baker's cookies appear to be made with oatmeal, and the three that I've tried are palatable enough.  Nevertheless, the Fruit & Nut flavor was the one flavor of the three that I most looked forward to savoring each morning (I hope it wasn't because of lower oatmeal content than the other three).          In short, you don't have to be the Cookie Monster to like these. Nor do you  despite the "Fruit & Nut" flavor  have to be a little "fruity" (to quote Norman Bates' audible thoughts in Hitchcock's "Psycho") or a "health nut" to find these tasty and nutritious  maybe even therapeutic (Dr. Esselstyn would seem to think so). And the advantage of the "mini" size is that you might feel better  less guilty, at least  about knocking off two instead of just one cookie at a time.
