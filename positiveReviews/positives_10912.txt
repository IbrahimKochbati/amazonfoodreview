The amazon description page for this item says most everything you need to know, other than this: will your dog eat them?          Dog owners know that each dog is different, some will eat anything you put in front of their face, and some can be VERY finicky. So, I'm not sure how reliable a source I am, because our 15 pound mutt is a little closer to the former category: if it's not bigger than her head, then she'll try to eat it. So, yes, she loves the few of these we've given her so far. They are hard (Milk Bone kind of hard), smallish dry squares that take some effort to  eak in to small dog bite sized pieces, so they test our dog's jaws a little, but her tastebuds don't seem to complain either. Frankly, I like having a treat a dog can't consume in 2 seconds, it's good when she has to work at it a little, both to keep her occupied and to give their teeth and jaws a little workout. Having said that, smaller dogs, weaker jawed dogs (puppies or the elderly) might not be willing or able to make the effort unless you mash the treat with a hammer or soak it in water or  oth for a minute... and why waste your time, just buy a different treat, right?          As usual, there's some cute fanciful text on the packaging, and like all Newman's Own products, the net profits go to charity. What's not to like?
