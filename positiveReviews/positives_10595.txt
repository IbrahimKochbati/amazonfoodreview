Just purchased one on vacation and it works as I imagined with either block or crumbled blue cheese. Just stab the blue as it sits in the container several times until the barrel is full (thats what the slit in the side is for, to see when its full) then insert into your queen olive and press the plunger. Never have to touch the cheese and i just stuffed 15 olives in about a minute. Dont be stupid and hand stuff the barrel, just push into your tub of crumbles several quick jabs. With block its even easier. Simple disassembly makes cleaning a snap. Just go to Walgreens and get some pipe cleaners to run through the barrel while rinsing under water. The plunger just rinse and wipe. Couldn't be any easier or more effective. Just bought another one for my  other.
