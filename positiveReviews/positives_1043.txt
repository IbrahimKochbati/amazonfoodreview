This dressing became an instant favorite of mine.  It's fat free without losing the flavor.  Alot of other dresings lose alot of flavor in their fat free versions, and that only makes you have to use twice as much.  Wish Bone is now my only choice for Ranch dressing.  My husband doesn't usually go for fat free or diet anything, but I put this on our salads and he didnt even know!
