This would be a 5 star product, but it is incredibly expensive... About $15.00 a pound...  We are still looking for a reasonable priced whole bean decaf product.  If it came in a sealable really airtight container, maybe would be worth the money, but it's just a bag with tape...  For $30, throw in a canister at least.
