I liked this toy when I first got it and it kept my 1 1 2 year old corgi busy for a while. I put his food in it and a few other "interactive toys" to keep him busy, this toy is actually too easy for him and lately  he will only get about half the kibble out and then loose interest. The other thing I don't like is that I can't wash it without getting the rope all wet. It would be better if you could twist off the rope portion and throw it in the dishwasher.
