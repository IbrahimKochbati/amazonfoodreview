PRO:      my dogs (maltese and poodle mix) go crazy over these treats. they are very obedient once they know that i'm holding these treats in my hand      since they're freeze dried, i don't have to worry about these treats drying out      although it comes in big cubes, i'm able to cut the cubes into smaller pieces with a plastic knife in order to lengthen the usage out of my stash of these dog treats      my containers always came with very little crumbs powder at the container's bottom          CON:      not uniform sizes      not cheap          Conclusion: still a great product, but need some modifications     *Since every morsel appears to be so flavorful, all my dogs need is a pinkie nail size amount to reward them.     *It may SEEM like the crumbs powder is useless, but actually, it is still somewhat useful. I used the powder to coat bland chewy dog treats, dog food, toys, etc.
