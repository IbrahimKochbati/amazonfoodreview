Honestly and simply, this product was not a good one. Certainly not good based on my personal experience.          The beef jerky was so extremely tough and difficult to chew. (Many pieces were so tough that they were literally inedible.)  Additionally, I ordered the teriyaki jerky and it had a very weak or light flavor.
