I bought one of the oatmeal from wholefood and fed it to my baby right away. I was happy about it because she loved it. But after a couple of weeks, one day when my Mom fixed the cereal, she asked me why it has the bad smell. I smelled it, and it does(it's not very strong but does has the smell like when all the nuts or rice turn bad)! I smelled the "Earth's best" one I have and it smells pefectly normal. Then I remembered I got a Happy Bellies multi grain cereal before from [...]. It had not been opened and expires on March 2010. I opened it right away and it has a VERY strong bad smell. It makes me sick for several minutes and feel like there will be something fly out of it! I was really scared! You'd better be careful too since baby won't taste it and you may not find it before it's really bad! I feel so sorry for my baby since I know it's really bad to her health, much worse then giving her non organic cereal. I won't ever buy the product again no matter how my baby likes it. It makes me really upset and I want to give it negative 5 starts if I could.     BTW, I submitted this reviw to [...] but they didn't publish it. I just hope everyone smell the oat before you give it to your baby.
