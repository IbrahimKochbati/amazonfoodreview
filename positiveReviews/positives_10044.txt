I'm accustomed to grinding my own coffee beans and steeping them in a French press.  I've sort of become spoiled by the better flavor of having my morning  ew done this way.          When I received a bag of Melitta Cafe Collection, I was skeptical that I would get good enough flavor from a pre ground coffee.  But I was pleasantly surprised to find that it does really well in a French press.  The flavor is very good, definitely better than other pre ground coffees.  The grind is a bit finer than I usually do it for the French press, but it still works great.          The French press is a good test of coffee flavor.  If coffee tastes good under this more demanding method, it should definitely do very well in a coffee machine.          If you're looking for a pre ground coffee with good flavor, this one is a good choice.
