Ok i have been through several dog food  ands (all high end holistic fancy stuff)and have been through some ruff (lol) times finding just what works perfect for my  female Rhodesian Ridgeback. Now i wont bash any  ands as some seem to do because some food seems to work with one pup and not another so dont be a jerk and think some food is crap because it didn't work out for your dog, be a good owner and look for things they like and react well to : )..... now that being said i had a neurotic on edge dog with huge shedding issues and RR's don't shed. This food was like the miracle cure and after a year of my poor little girl trying different foods all she gets is complements on how great she looks from strangers as we walk the streets. if your used to high end prices this food is also a value seeing that you get 44#'s which does make a difference trust me. so as for us its a full five star no shedding, great coat, healthy mind and a value! don't be afraid try this if others arnt working out for your dog or even if you want your puppy to look even better.
