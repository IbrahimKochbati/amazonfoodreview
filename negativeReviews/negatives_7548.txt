We've been getting these for our Newfie for some time.  Over the last few orders, there's been a noticeable degradation of the quality of the chews   It's now rare to get long thick strips   usually we get 2 4 of those in a bag of 30, with the rest being an assortment of either too short or too thin  to provide much more than 2 minutes of chewing.  I believe I'll be finding a new source.
