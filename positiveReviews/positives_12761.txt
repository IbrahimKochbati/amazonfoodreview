I compared the ingredients of Heart to Heart with a generic  and in the same flavor.  The ingredients of this  and seem much more thoughtful and dedicated to quality.  I was worried my 6 year old son may notice a difference and reject it but he didn't even notice I'd switched on him.  I'll feel a lot better feeding him this every morning before school.
