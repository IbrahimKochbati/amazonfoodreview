Good pig ears for the price.  I think they pack the bags by weight   the bag seemed to be the appropriate weight, but some of the pig ears were more like the pig ear slivers.  I didn't actually count the number of pig ears, though, so they may have made up for it by increasing the quantity.  also, pig ears were really greasy   lots of grease in the bag.  For the price, a good  buy.
