We eat pumpkin on a regular basis and it gets hard this time of year when all of the stores are sold out.          I saw reviews here on Amazon saying the cans were dented, but saw that someone from the manufacturer had responded so I figured the problem had been addressed.          NOT SO.  I received a case of these cans and it was wrapped extremely well   bubble wrap all over the place.  However, the cans INSIDE the case were dented and damaged   I don't mean a little dented, I mean several of the cans had their entire sides caved in in such a way that I could not open one can and on another can I couldn't remove all the pumpkin because the can was smashed so badly.          Those most damaged cans were packaged in the middle of the case   seemingly intentionally disguising how badly damaged they were.  The cans on the outside were relatively OK, ALL of them were dented a little   every single can   but the ones on the outside were MUCH less damaged than the ones on the inside.          I don't see how this could have been accidental, although anything is possible.          The quality of the pumpkin itself was good, but I don't like using damaged cans in case the food inside has been compromised.
