This product is good. However, I feel the carbonation is a little more emphasised over the fruity flavor. Unless of course carbonation is really wanted. I didn't find the juice flavour as good as Juicy Juice. And the cost is ~50% more per ounce for Switch vs. Juicy Juice for my region.          I would say that for everyone who is interested in this product... let your taste buds be your guide.
