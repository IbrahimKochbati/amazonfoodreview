I received the package early, which was great. The candy packaging looked fine but I didn't discover the problem until I opened the bag. Half the bag of Peanut M&M's was cracked! I was really embarrassed to share them with anybody because the entire bagful was dusted with M&M de is. Not happy with this purchase at all.
