Don't know why people want to step in cold cat vomit on their to the bathroom in the middle of night, but this will get the job done. Vomit stains carpets, beds, shirts. You will find hard, old fossilized vomit under beds occasionally too.  Entire rooms of carpet will need replacing.          If you have all wood floors and love cat vomit, go for it.          However, it is a beautiful decorative grass when potted on it's own or mixed with herbs. Just keep out of cat's reach. Good air freshener if you grow enough indoors.          No idea why people want cat vomit indoors though.          3 stars because it is wheat grass which can be bought in bulk much cheaper for couple bucks more.
