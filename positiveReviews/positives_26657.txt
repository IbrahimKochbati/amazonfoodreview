These chips are bomb!!! You can feel the heat on the first chip. I love spicy food and I can eat a whole bag of Flaming Hot Cheetos no problem, but I need something to drink after about ten of these chips. Probably the hottest chips I have eaten so far. I paid $30 something bucks for 14 bags, no regrets! If there is anything hotter and better tasting, please let me know.
