I have 3 dogs with different needs and tastes and this is one of the few foods that meets them and basically one of the only ones I can afford.     My oldest (14) loves the lamb, my husky loves the glucosamine and the youngest farts less on this food which makes everyone happy.     I always try to find food with good ingredients and this meets that standard while staying one of the cheapest foods. I thoroughly recommend it!
