Being a huge fan of honey, I really like these lozenges. They tasted great and very quickly made my throat feel better. They last a lot longer in your mouth than cough drops, and there's lots of people who praise honey (particularly Manuka honey) and its medicinal properties. I figured it couldn't hurt.          One thing I do not like is the overall shape of the lozenges. They're like 2 small rectangles stuck together, and it's a very weird shape to have in your mouth. Just imagine a lego block in your mouth; that's these lozenges. The rough edges will relatively quickly become smooth in your mouth, but it's a general irritation that these aren't made in a more mouth friendly shape.
