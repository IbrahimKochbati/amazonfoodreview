Quaker's Maple and Brown Sugar Instant Oatmeal is adequate oatmeal and should appeal to you if you like your oatmeal sweeter than average.  For you   4 stars.  For everybody else   3.          I've been eating oatmeal almost every  eakfast for 11 years.  Over that time I've gradually used less and less sweetener.  So the sweetness of M&BS is a little much for me   however the maple flavor and smell is strong and pleasant and that goes a long way towards making up for it.          Preparation is easy enough.  Add water, nuke it for 90 seconds, done.  Regular oatmeal isn't much harder but these packets are handy if you're going to eat in the office or on the road.
