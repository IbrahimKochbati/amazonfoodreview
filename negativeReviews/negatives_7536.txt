I'll review strictly based on product design since others have commented on taste. After pouring the syrup, we always notice syrup running down the sides of the bottle. I'm many months removed from the mainstream packaged "syrup type" substances, but some type of spout would be beneficial. We have to wipe down the bottle after each use... *sigh*
