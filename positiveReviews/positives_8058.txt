I buy this coffee from a Japanese grocery store. (Though I would happily buy it from Amazon if the price were similar.) I prepare it by heating a mug of equal quantities of milk and water in the microwave, then adding a tablespoon of this coffee and some sugar. I imagine, like all instant coffee, it would taste pretty nasty without the milk, but with milk it actually is good. This is the fastest way to obtain a cup of tolerable coffee that I know of, short of buying it already made.
