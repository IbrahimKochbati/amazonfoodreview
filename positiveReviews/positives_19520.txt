after using Altoids for some time, i decided to try these, as the polar bear attracted me to the tin. they mints themselves look like little home made cylinder peanutbutter cookies. did not expect them to freshen my  eath. wrong. they freshen your  eath (as long as you did not just eat sushi, in that case you'd need at least 3) but they taste amazing and do freshen you up
