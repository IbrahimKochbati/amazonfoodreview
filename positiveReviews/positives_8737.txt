By far the best home taco kit you can get. I  tried all the other ones you can find in local stores and not only is this one better I don't like the other ones.  It is a combination of the mix & shells having a strange taste to them.  Most local grocery stores don't seem to be carrying this anymore so I have them delivered every 3 6 months automatically depending on how often we go through them.  Taco night is one of my 3 year old son's favorite nights as he gets to make his own taco!
