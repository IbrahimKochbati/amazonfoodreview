I have eaten a lot of Hormel Compleates over the past year.  I saw these on sale and combined with prime shipping, it was a no  ainer for me.  BIG MISTAKE!     Hormel Compleats Beef Steak & Peppers with Savory Sauce and Noodles variety of these is the worst thing I have ever eaten, and after serving in the army, that says a lot.  The noodles were goo, tons of mushrooms, but no meat to be found.  I forced myself to eat about half of it before deciding to offer it to my dog.  He sniffed it and walked away.  Stay AWAY!  The chicken vasrieties seem to be great, I've had them all.  Hope this helps others avoid my mistake.
