The DisposaKups are great because I can use my own  and coffee and adjust the strength of it. The only thing that needs to be improved on is that the edges of the filter need to be trimmed down to prevent leakage.  At first try it is a little difficult to get the tops on but after a few times of doing it, it becomes easier.  The price is a little steep for me but much less than buying the already filled K kups.  I feel sure that I will order this product again.             "
