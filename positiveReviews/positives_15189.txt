My baby loves this salmon combination a lot more than the popular chick chick (which is actually her least favorite). Yes, it does stink... its fish! I don't care for fish myself, smell or taste, but she digs this and its good for her. This  and has a much lower sodium content than plum and sprout and is cheaper on a different website. I make most all of her other foods but am not quite ready to tackle preparing meat so Happy Baby has been great for introducing chicken, fish, beef, and turkey.
