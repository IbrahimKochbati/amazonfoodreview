This is the seasoning we bought in Hawaii.  Now that I'm on the mainland, it's nice to know I can still get it!  Hawaiian style fried rice...yeah!  Just sprinkle over steamed rice, add bacon pieces, scrambled egg, peas, and green onions (sliced).  Every one of my kids' friends loves this, as well as my daycare kids.  A good buy, for sure!  One bag will flavor about 5 cups of rice.
