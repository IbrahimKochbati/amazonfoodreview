First, I'm not a big fan of dark chocolate. I'm not really a huge chocolate fan in general   but I've preferred milk chocolate over dark. This chocolate is does not taste anything like other dark chocolates. I find the flavor robust, but in a subdued way (a contradiction, I know). It is hard to describe, but this is one of the best chocolates I've tasted. It has a unique grainy texture that is fabulous. The price (currently $5.99 here at Amazon) is very high though. I pay about 4.59 at a local grocery store (and no shipping charges). I buy at least one per week to feed my addiction.
