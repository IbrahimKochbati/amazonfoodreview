I have several types of baby food molds and this is my favorite. It is soft and rubbery so I am able to push up from the bottom of the mold to remove the food. I don't like having to run hot water over the back, like I have to with my other molds, because I don't like tap water getting on the food. (I'm a little obsessive, compulsive) Just make sure not to fill the molds all the way to the top because the food expands and then you'll have food on the lid. Makes for easier cleaning if you don't get food on the lid.
