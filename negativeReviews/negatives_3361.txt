These crackers serve a purpose and have an okay taste although they are kind of bland.  I usually eat them with salami and cheese so the flavor from the other products helps.  These crackers are the best ones I've found on the market so will continue to buy them.  They also are closest to a Ritz cracker in size, shape, and crunch.  The other crackers I've tried leave an aftertaste and are paper thin.
