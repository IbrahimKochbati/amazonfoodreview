Saw this in the company office, but it was all gone till I went for a cup.  Bought it hoping I would like it and I am not disappointed.  I think the taste is pretty smooth, and isn't strong, although I do like bold flavored coffees.  All they buy at my work is Green Mountain; this is probably my favorite Green Mountain flavor, and I like it better than Timothy's Original Donut Blend.  I don't understand why the cost is so much; I guess I'll have to make this my "special" coffee for now.  Enjoy.
