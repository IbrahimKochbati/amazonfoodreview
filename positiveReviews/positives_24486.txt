I enjoy shopping in a local Fresh and Easy Market because they have so many and such unusual imported items. They're a British company and most of their imported stuff is from England. Take this Heinz Classic Cream of Tomato Soup. Supposedly it has been made and sold for over 100 years. Well, if figured there had to be something good about it to import it when there are so many similar  ands easily available. I was right. This stuff is really good. Yum! It might be more expensive, but man it's much better. Real rich savory taste. Low in fat and sodium. Tastes great with a lunch. Now I understand          Gary Peterson
