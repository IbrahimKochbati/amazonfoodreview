I found this coffee to be great at first, but as I started having it more and more I came to detest it. On the large setting the coffee is WAY too watery. Also, the flavor is very, very overpowering and kind of tastes like bananas.          It is a pretty good mid afternoon or evening desert coffee, but other than that it is kinda gross.
