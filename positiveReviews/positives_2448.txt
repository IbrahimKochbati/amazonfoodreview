Susie's thin cakes are a great snack if you are trying to lose weight or just eat healthy. I bought the one that is sodium, cholesterol, fat and sugar free. For three cakes it is only 54 calories, so you can add a toppin like taboule or your favorite topping without the guilt. They are very tasty. The only problem is the availability of the product. I am on a waiting list with Amazon for this product.
