I had been thinking for sometime to look for Graisse de Canard and where else to look but Amazon !!!!Was not dissapointed. This is a great product at a good price. I use it of course to saute all kinds of vegetables and in the near future will make my own Confit de Canard, I needed this rendered duck fat to started it.(Obviously I bought more than a 6 pack, at the time this was the better price) The Graisse de Canard Gold comes from a company that uses good products. They are very helpful if you contact them. Love my Graisse de Canard Gold......
