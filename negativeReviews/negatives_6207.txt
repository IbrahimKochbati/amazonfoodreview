I don't know how anybody can eat these. I can't taste anything but salt. I hope this is just a bad batch because nobody else in the reviews complained about this being too salty to eat. I gave it two stars because it is just the right tenderness I was looking for. But unfortunately I can not enjoy any of it. I would have returned it and maybe gave this company another chance, but Amazon has a policy that you can't return groceries.
