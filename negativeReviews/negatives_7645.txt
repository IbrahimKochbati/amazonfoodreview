I was disappointed in these cookies. They are expensive and I should not have looked at the nutrition label . I guess we tend to associate Quaker Oats with  good nutrition can't say that about these cookies!  One cookies is 1.48 ounces has 180 calories and  8 grams of fat . If I am going ot put that many calories in my  mouth it had better be worth it and these cookies are not worth it! The only good thing nutrition wise is they have 4 grams  of fiber. They do not have much of a flavor taste either! I would not buy them.
