I used to buy these delicious crackers at my health food market, but they stopped carrying them. I was happy to find them at Amazon, but when my order arrived, they were all  oken up, many in very small pieces. I asked for a replacement, and it came quickly, but again, many of the crackers were  oken up. It doesn't look like the packaging is going to improve any time soon, if ever, and it's a shame. When I bought them at my health food store, they were all in one piece, so obviously, it's possible.
