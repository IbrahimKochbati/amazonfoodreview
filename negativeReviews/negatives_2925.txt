In trying to cut down on sugar, I have tried several products that contain sugar alcohols and found that I do not tolerate them well. As in gut wrenching pain and embarassing gas attacks. I know that some people can consume these products with little effect but I am not one of them. I don't know what I was thinking except that maybe it has been a few years and perhaps they have made new strides in sugar alcohol technology.          Unfortunately for me, these are so tasty, I ate several in the first setting. In a car with two other people. On a long drive. Let's just say I won't be doing that again any time soon. For those who are not troubled by sugar alcohols, enjoy!
