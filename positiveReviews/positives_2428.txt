I bought this water for my 2 pet chinchillas, Tank and Tony. They love this water. I have never seen them drink so much in their lives! I bought this water because chinchillas cannot drink tap water, and Spring Water is the best for them.     I am mad though, because I purchased this item ~1 week ago and now it's $5 cheaper. Wtf?     Overall, I love this item. Great water.     I tasted it for myself, and it does taste great!
