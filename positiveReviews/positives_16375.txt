I have two Peek a Poo's and just say Greenies and they go crazy.  These are the reformulated Greenies are made with gelatin compared to the old ones that had harmed some dogs and were pulled from market.  These are easily digested as I started them out slow and made sure they chewed and not swallowed them, which could be harmful. I trust Amazon to sell me items that will not cause harm.  I personally thoroughly check for anything foreign which is due to the manufacturer and not Amazon.
