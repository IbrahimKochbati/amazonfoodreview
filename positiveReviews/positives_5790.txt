My 4 border collies expect one of these each night before bed.  I've learned how important it is to create regular routines to keep these active "wired" dogs calm, and there's no way I have time to  ush their teeth each nite, even if they'd let me.  But this can get very expensive.  When I found them here at this price, I ordered tons.  Then went back and ordered more, figuring the price would increase to that on other sites.  It had increased a bit, but still a great price. Entirely Pets delivered a bit late due to supply problems, but that was okay since I had just received enough to last a month!
