It's hard to find quality gf products, and pamela's doesn't dissapoint. I always recommend this. I go through a lot of this blend with a family of five. Amazon helps keep it more affordable. The pancakes are great and the waffles are really good. I haven't tried it with much else yet, but my sister in law does chocolate scones  frequently  with great raves. I use the  ead mix also all the time, and am very pleased with both.
