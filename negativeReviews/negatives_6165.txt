So I read another review before I bought these and saw that it turned things orange but was easy to get out.....not so for my light gray wool area rug.  I have used several carpet cleaners and there is still a slight stain on the rug   much smaller than what I started with, but it won't come out.  However, my German Shepherd puppy loved these things and eat them right up  however I won't be buying them again.
