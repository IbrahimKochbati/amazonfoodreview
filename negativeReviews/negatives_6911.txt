I have been using lots and lots of Bertolli Oil for long time. I use it only raw, so I can fully appreciate its flavor.     I was really pleased to see it here on Amazon, at a price that is slightly lower than in any local stores.          What a huge disappointment it was to see, upon delivery, that the bottle was cheap transparent plastic.          Decent quality extra virgin olive oil MUST be in glass bottles or at most cans (e.g. Carli oil has some big cans along with glass bottles), even better if dark glass, because light also deteriorates its quality. I am Italian, in Italy extra virgin olive oil is a staple and people use a lot of it. But I have never seen any extra virgin oil sold in plastic, in 24 years that I've lived in Italy.          I could not believe that they ruined the Bertolli oil storing it in cheap plastic, and the taste reflects this poor storage. It does not nearly have the same rich taste as the oil that is stored in glass. I believe this is because it has been stored for too long in that worthless bottle. It expires in 1 year so probably it was bottled about 10 months ago.          This oil as it is in the plastic is really not worth the price, for the taste it has, you can find some better oils for lower price (while to me the Bertolli oil in glass bottles is UNBEATABLE for its rich taste, and I have tried many many oils).     This is why I am canceling my subscription and I am going back buying again the same oil in a local store that sells it in respectable glass bottles.          You can google "extra virgin olive oil plastic" and you'll find many results that advice to stay away from plastic bottles as oils absorb PVCs a lot, even at room temperature. This is unhealthy and it also affects the taste of the oil. Some people think this is no big deal because they cannot notice any difference in taste. But it is a matter of fact that, even if you cannot taste anything different, the oil deteriorates in plastic. Many other foods are perfectly fine stored in plastic, I am not against plastic at all! But not oils, especially the less refined (extra virgin) ones.
