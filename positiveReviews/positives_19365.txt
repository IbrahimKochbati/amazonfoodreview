My 6 month old bichon frise puppy takes after his mommy in that he's a very picky eater. This is the only  and of dog food he's eaten without making a fussy face. I'm sold!          We had him on Royal Canin for about 2 months until we came across Bil Jac. Originally, it was a freebie from our pet supply store. I put it right next to his Royal Canin and the answer was obvious. He loved it. And why wouldn't he? It's made of real chicken and chicken organs, which provides a natural source of fat.          I went through the ingredient list and did my own research. Arginine plays an important role in cell division, the healing of wounds, removing ammonia from the body, immune function, and the release of hormones. I went a bit further and asked my vet. He told me that puppies less than 1 year old are unable to create arginine internally, and although it's not an essential amino acid, it's always a good idea to include it in a puppy's nutrition.          Bil Jac is slow cooked for over 40 minutes, and that ensures more nutrients are retained during the process. And the fact that there's no sprayed on fat, corn gluten meal, wheat gluten meal, or less expensive proteins sold me.          My vet approved. My budged approved. Most importantly, my puppy gave it the paws up. I'm sticking with Bil Jac all throughout his adult years!
