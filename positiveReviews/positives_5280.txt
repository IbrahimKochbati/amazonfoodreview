I really enjoyed this soda. I used to be a big fan of Orangina a few years ago but Switch Orange Tangerine is WAY better  especially if your looking for a true orangey taste. A cold one of these would be very refreshing on a hot summer day. Tastes sort of like real orange juice mixed with seltzer, which begs the question why not just mix it yourself? (if your at home that is). But I wouldn't hesitate buying one of these when out and about. Very tasty.
