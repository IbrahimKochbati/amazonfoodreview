My 2 cats loved this stuff! There are 2 kinds in the 24 pack, so you get 12 cans of each. Cans are small, 2.8 oz each, that is smaller than the fancy feast cans.     The food doesn't smell like cat food and looks like people food. The sesame chicken and chicken pot pie were equally liked by my cats. They ate every bite of it, and they never do that with canned food.
