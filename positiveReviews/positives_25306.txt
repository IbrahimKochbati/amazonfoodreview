This is a very tasty tea. Green tea with mint has always been my favorite tea and this is definitely my favorite. At first I was leery of licorice and anise in the tea, but they do add a nice touch. My only complaint is that it makes for a weak cup of tea, that is the reason for the 4 star rating.. I use 3 pods to make 2 Senseo cups of tea.  I usually tear the pods open and use my CoffeeDuck, available elsewhere on Amazon.com, to make the tea.
