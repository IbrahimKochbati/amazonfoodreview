Smooth full (almost nutty) flavor, never bitter, moderate roast.  Not too strong, but not wimpy either!  A really nice coffee that's a good compromise when families or office mates have different tastes in coffee.          I'm a heavy coffee drinker who has tried it all   the cheap stuff and expensive  ands.  I enjoyed this more than comparable Starbucks  and coffee.  Those who tend to prefer flavored coffees (hazelnut, cinnamon, other mild and rich flavors) will most likely find this a very pleasant unflavored alternative.          Well packaged with the typical vacuum pack and "fat wire" turn down close mechanism. Highly recommended.
