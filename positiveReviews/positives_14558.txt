This was bought to be used in our wedding and we couldn't be happier. We have a ton of tea left over and we have been enjoying it. The flavor is good and doesn't taste as though it has been sitting in the boxes for a long time. Twinings is a great company and we have often had their tea in the past and we will probably continue to get it in the future. The box of 6 is a great way to get the bulk you need without paying a ton.
