If you're looking for a healthy, natural tortilla chip for dipping, you should try these.  I bought these for the holidays and we enjoyed dipping them in a corn, black bean and red pepper salsa.  The shape is perfect for dipping.     They're all natural, low calorie chips that taste great.  You can eat 12 chips for 130 calories  the chips are big and can be  oken in half for more dipping.  One serving of 12 chips is only 10% of your allowed fat and there's no trans fat and little saturated fat.  Can't wait to try them with guacamole  great treat for parties.
