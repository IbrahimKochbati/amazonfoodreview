   class "tiny"  Length:: 2:01 Mins              This video shows Taxi (soft coated wheaten terrier) opening and playing with his Christmas 10th Birthday present... a Tug a Jug. He's played with it a few times now and he still doesn't get that he needs to pull the cord to get the treats to come out    although he really enjoys knocking it around until the treats accidentally fall out. I bought the large size after reading the reviews because of the cord. The large size had the plastic cord which is easier to clean. The smaller size has the rope cord. Taxi is not a big chewer, so I felt comfortable that this toy would durable   and it is. I filled it with stinky treats which he can smell through both ends... but those treats upset his tummy a bit, so I'm going to have to try something else. I couldn't find the ingredients of the treats that are sold with the Tug a Jug, so I didn't buy those.
