I was excited to buy a larger bag of organic Lavazza beans at a good price. While not a coffee   espresso snob, I do like coffee and have lived and imbibed in enough coffee centric countries to have some points of comparison. This is a good coffee, but not a flavorful or very distinctive coffee. I bought it to use in a stove top espresso maker   not a pulled shot   where it did well as the base for a nice cappuccino or latte...but not exceptional. As an Americano or in a Bodum, it didn't work for me. Just strong, a little bitter...someone here mentions a lemon overtone and while I don't normally go for the descriptive terms, I think the lemon overtone is a problem for me too. It's a strong coffee, a little bitter, not smooth, lemon acidic overtone, verging on dark roast, not too oily...serviceable, but not in anyway distinctive in its flavors. So I am moving on.
