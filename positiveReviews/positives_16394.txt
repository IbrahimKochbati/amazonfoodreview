[[ASIN:B000KBFKIQ Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Petite Pack, 45 Chews      are not only great for Dogs teeth ~ but they must taste great.. I have a great dog who knows exactly when it is 5:00PM and has a particular bark for her Greenie. She is spoiled, so she also knows when it is 7:30PM and time for her second treat and barks that same bark for her second one.          The vet did say that her teeth look great !!
