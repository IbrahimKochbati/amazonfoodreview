Have a chocolate lab who's suffered for 9 years with ear infections. Since determining she had food allergies, and using this product exclusively, she's gone several months without ear problems. Recently tried to add grain to her diet and she developed ear infection again. This is a grain free product and excellent for dogs with allergies.
