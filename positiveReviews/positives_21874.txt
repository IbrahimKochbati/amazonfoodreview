I'm usually a coffee drinker but I tried this tea and fell in love. The smell of the oranges can't be missed and is as enjoyable for me as the tea itself. It was a nice "comfort" beverage in the winter and I find it holds up just as well iced for the summer. And that it comes in K cups makes it just about perfect.
