I purchased the 2.5 bags for my  new Whirley Pop pan. I like the idea of the oil on one side and the popcorn on the other, very much like I remember the old TV Time popcorn from when I was a kid. I popped up the first bag, but I found there was way too much salt for me. The next batch, I clipped a small corner of the popcorn side off and removed most of the salt. Now, the popcorn is just the way I like it and I added just a bit of butter. Try it first and then see if the salt seasoning is too much for you   it was very easy to remove. I found that the 2.5 size was perfect for one, maybe two people, but truthfully, I can eat all of it by myself while watching a movie.
