The sweet & hot has an excellent balance of spice, if you want something moderately hot but not extreme.  The jerky is ok, not great; it has a higher proportion of fatty pieces than most  ands I've tried.  But it's an excellent value with good flavor, so I can't complain too much.  I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could.
