Wow!!!  One of the best gluten free  eads that I have tasted (and I have tasted a bunch).  My son loves this  ead and we use it for all his sandwiches AND I make him mini pizzas on this  ead too!!  Tastes great untoasted, which is rare for gluten free  ead.  I take it right from the fridge & make a peanut butter sandwich for my son to take to school.  He loves them.          Really can't say enough good things about this  ead!!!
