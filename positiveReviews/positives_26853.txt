I've tried other green tea  ands, such as Bigelow and so far I love STASH. Its taste is wonderful and very natural. I can actually taste the actual green tea. Other reviewer must has left the tea cold, and that's where it turns bitter. So drink it while it's warm &lt;  that's why they called it 'hot tea'.
