Yikes!  What was I thinking when I ordered 12 cans of this  stuff?  The food pantry may be getting some.          It tastes like.....well, I can't use the words I'd like to.     Let's just say that it has no character at all...no distinct taste....if yu blinded yourself and then drank the coffee, I don't know if you'd even know it was coffee!          I use just more than the amount suggessted;..;...doesn't help.
