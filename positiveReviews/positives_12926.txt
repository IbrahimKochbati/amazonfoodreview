This is a great tasting product, to be sure, and I if I were a soft drink person in general, I would likely choose this over any of the leading sodas on the market. However, while there is "no sugar added," it still tastes very much like candy. The black cherry version of "The Switch" is much less cloying in my opinion.     If you like sweet beverages, you'll love this, and the fact that it is all natural, is, of course, something to consider. This is a good choice for dessert, I suppose. There are apple, grape, kiwi, raspberry, strawberry and acerola juices in this drink, all of which combine for a nice flavor.
