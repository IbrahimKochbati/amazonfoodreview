I had to look for a new food for my 100 pound puppy.     She has a sensitive stomach and sheds extensively when in that phase. And as many of you know,  it is hard to find good food.     I have ordered 3 small bags of different food  ands, this one was the first on the list to try.          After 2 days, the coat of my dog got better and softer too. I would have not thought that it would work so fast.     Poop stayed solid (I didn't have a problem with that on the previous food, but its important) and it doesn't have a nasty smell anymore, as with the previous food. Great again!     She still sheds a little but the coat is getting much much nicer and I am confident that it is a matter of a few more days until it is in outstanding condition.          ***After 4 days, the shine of my dogs skin is definitely noticeable. This food is high quality and it shows on your dog. We also got rid of the nasty gas which is as well a great indicator of a good food. I recommend this food over Acana, Orijen or other foods with high protein levels, as it is grain free!!! (very important).          As for the price, Amazon is a fabulous website (& I do have Prime), however I was able to get 2 bags for $39.94 bag WITH shipping included on another website! And as I am typing this, I got additional on time 10% off .. so not even with Prime I would be able to get to that price.          Anyway, as far as the food goes, it is very very good. Just be careful with the high protein levels, not all dogs might do well with it. Get a small bag and see how it works and of course mix it in with current food. If it doesn't work (lot of gas and loose stool after a week or more), try a different  and with less protein. You might want to look at Precise Holistic, Fromm Gold or Canidea alternatives. Very good foods but the protein is lower. Get small bags, try one, mix in little by little, if it doesn't work, go back to the previous food and than start with the other bag.          In case of questions I will be happy to help.          ***UPDATE: So after about two weeks of use, the coat is shinier as EVER, its absolutely beautiful. The last time I remember her coat being so shiny was when she was a puppy. There is a little gas now and than, but nothing horrible (and I do feed my dog at night, so her stomach works during the night), stool is solid and still no smell. I also notice my dog shaking her head less because of ears, food CAN cause ear and eye infection, so that is satisfying too. As for the shedding, it has almost stopped. Its 80% better!!!          This is definitely the best food we have tried in 18 months. We have tried around 10 12 different  ands. That gives you an idea of how good it is. Also, it is ridiculously cheap, if you know, where to buy it. This food, under $40! is without a doubt, the best food money can buy. Well, at least for us it is.
