When I saw the mint iced tea powder on the website, I thought I would like it. But when  I received it and tried one, I was very disappointed. It was the green tea and not sweet at all. The flavor was nothing at all like an iced tea like I was expecting. I had to add sugar to it to get a flavor that I like to be similar to regular iced tea. I don't even know if I'll be using the others I had received. Sorry about this, but you did ask for my review on this.
