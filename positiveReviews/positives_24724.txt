I have been using this tea for quite some time. Do I believe that it help to detox the body...don't know. But, I do like the flavor. Just make sure you enjoy a mild licorice undertone. I do. But, my son does not like the flavor or the smell. If a very mild licorice flavor appeals to you, you should enjoy this tea.
