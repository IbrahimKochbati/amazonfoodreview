I like the fact that this drink has none of the additives that you typically find in supermarket junk drinks such as high fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors or flavor enhancers, magnesium sulphate, fake colors, etc. It tastes good. There is also an abundance of Vitamin C.          But for health watches note it still packs a modest wallop of calories (135 cal) from its 33g of sugars, albeit natural not bad, but if you are on a calorie restricted diet or in physical training, you will want to watch it. If you sit back and pop these all day you will still get fat. But this would be a great drink for active folks. Personally, I would drink this after a tough mountain bike ride or long distance run.          The level of carbonation is pretty high, so it has a fizzy texture.
