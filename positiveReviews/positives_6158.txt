Of course, it's a taste opinion.  I gave it four stars because it's easy and quite edible.  Probably three stars as just food.          Wrap a tortilla around some or eat it plain, it makes an interesting and fairly good, filling meal.  I have no idea why somebody would toss it; it just ain't that bad, folks.  Not the greatest din din in the world; but not at all bad, either.  But then, if you hate chewing a taco, then you may not like it.          Personally, I prefer the Stroganoff and love the chicken and biscuits.  I've ordered the Alfredo, so we'll see about that.  However, these are all easy meals for a decent price.  I'm a retired guy living along, so they're great for me.  Probably a nice idea for a college student or two.  For anyone, a nice package to have around for a busy day.  Feeds two hungry folks, three normal folks.  A bit skimpy for four; unless they're dieting.
