I had no reason to buy a gluten free bar, but the reviews won me over. These are incredible! They taste great    chocolatey with hints of coconut    and they actually stave off my hunger for more than twenty minutes, which no snack bar has ever done. Even shortly after eating something like a clif bar I'm ready to gnaw someone's arm off. I'll eat one of these before I go for a long run; it doesn't weigh me down, but I have something in me so I don't feel nauseous afterward. I bought these on sale, but I think I'm going to take the plunge and buy them at the non sale price. That in itself is an amazing review coming from me.
