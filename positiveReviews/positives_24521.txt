I bought this because of the pumpkin shortage (which is now over) to be sure I had canned pumpkin for the holidays.  Like other reviewers, I received a few dented cans, although only one was so badly dented that I hesitate to use it.  I have used the pumpkin in pie and pumpkin  ead. It is a bit less dense than the kind we are all accustomed to buying in the grocery store, but it is by no means watery.  I did add an extra egg yolk to the pie to make sure it set up.  The pie was somewhat wetter than my typical result, but it held its shape and tasted great.  This made excellent pumpkin  ead.  My family has devoured almost a whole loaf since last night.  If you are having difficulty finding pumpkin, don't hesitate to order this product.
