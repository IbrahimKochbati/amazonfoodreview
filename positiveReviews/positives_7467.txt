My senses were surprised by the aroma of the glistening beans as well as the satisfying flavor of the  ew.     I substituted this bean when Amazon dropped Starbucks Sumatra from their Subscribe & Save program.     Now I would never go back.     I use a ceramic cone drip filter into a Nissan Thermal Carafe for our  ew.     For an organic bean, this Breakfast Blend is top of the heap.     {{* *}}
