I asked the  eeder "why Canidae"? I never even heard of it. She told me that because German Shepards have sensitive stomachs and also prone to hip problems is why this product is so beneficial to their dogs. Ever since a puppy my dogs been on Canidae. I have tried others when I couldn't find Canadie, like now and noticed a differance in various ways. I am happy to see I can now buy the product online to get my dog back on tract.
