I ordered this for my  other's 30th Birthday cake and having never used anything like it before I was a bit clumsy with it.  There isn't much, but it goes a long way. It covered the chocolate genache great and it looked very cool as did my entire kithen for a week because it gets everywhere...proceed with caution in the kitchen.
