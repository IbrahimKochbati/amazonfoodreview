I am definitely a mom who wants to limit the amount of "junk" food in our home, including sodas, so I was intrigued by a new natural fruit drink with carbonation. We have had other natural carbonated beverages and enjoyed them, but the family would still choose plain old juice or Sunkist soda over any of these when given the choice.          The Kiwi Berry Switch has had the same reception. The family finds it to be okay, but nothing that will make them trade in their favorites. It is a fruit drink with light carbonation, more natural than most traditional soda, but still just as sugary, even if the sweetness is primarily from natural fruit sugars. Therefore, I find little reason to encourage them to Switch.          Its taste reminded me of the old Strawberry Crush from when I was a kid, but not quite a potent. It is pleasant enough, but as my son put it "I would drink it if it were all that we had in the fridge but I would not ask you to buy it again". Also, I am not necessarily sure it is  worth the cost of nearly $1 per can (a small can compared to traditional soda).          Bottom line: We have tried other natural sodas that we found better tasting and less expensive. It's not bad, so it might be worth a try to see which of the natural  ands your family likes best. Don't expect it to replace soft drinks for those in the family that really enjoy them, and don't expect it to be a great, healthy alternative since it is still high in carbs sugar.
