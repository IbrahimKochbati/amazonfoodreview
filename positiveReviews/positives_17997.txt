Note that this is a powder mix, not a liquid, as some other reviews currently seem to be implying...  Personally, I strongly prefer the powder mixes to the liquid mixes, since you just have to mix with hot water for the powders, as opposed to mixing with milk and heating for the liquids.  Among the powders, this is my favorite, but as it's all about taste, and taste can vary, that may not mean much to anyone else...  Add a little vanilla creamer, and this just can't be beat!
