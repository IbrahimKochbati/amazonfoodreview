These are hard biscuits, so likely good for the teeth.  My little Maltese loves these.  I feel good about giving them to him.  They are square treats, about 1 1 1 2 inches square.  They are often stuck together with another one and need to be snapped apart.  My only complaint is that they care nearly impossible to  eak into small pieces because they are so hard, so they're not good for training treats.  But if you want to give your little dog a good sized treat (or I guess a smallish treat for a larger dog), these work great!
