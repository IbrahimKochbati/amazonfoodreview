I just put this candy out two days ago and half the tub is already gone; in a small office!  The candy is very fresh and soft, but not too soft.  A mild lemon flavor, not overpowering at all.  Each piece is individually wrapped and arrived un oken and perfect.  I would recommend this for anyone.  And, best of all, made in the USA.
