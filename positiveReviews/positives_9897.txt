I have been getting these from Price Chopper in Paola, KS. However, I am afraid they will not be stocking them anymore.  They have reduced the price and I think I am the only one trying them!!I eat 7 crackers with a low calorie string cheese for  eakfast every AM. Total 150 calories. You can put your  eakfast in a baggie and go!
