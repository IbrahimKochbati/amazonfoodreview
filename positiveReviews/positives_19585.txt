I'm a cat lover, and spoil them very often. Recently we tried several local stores for catnip and none were very fragrant or very loved by my cats. The older Cosmic Catnip size was no longer for sale, and had lasted a while. After about a year of trying to get decent catnip locally, I came back to Amazon. Read the reviews, and came back to Cosmic catnip (now in a slightly larger size container).          This stuff is great, my cats respond to it well, and they love it. The biggest problem is they have really been using the cat scratcher we put the catnip on much more than usual and have had to order a refill kit.          If you want very good catnip at a very reasonable price, this may be a good choice.
