Got this with a recommendation from a friend.  Best buy ever!  My dog tends to eat fast, well this slows him down to a much more easy pace.  He loves carrying it around in his mouth he even  ings it to me when it time to eat.  He has tried beating it up, but so far it has withstood all that he's tried.  Will buy again when the time comes for a new one
