I have been an avid Canidae supporter for about a year and a half.  My  eeder recommended it and I was VERY impressed with how my dog responded.  However, a few months back they changed their formula, (they also lessened the bags from 40 to 35lbs AND raised the price!!!!) and it is terrible!!!!  I went through 2 bags and couldn't understand why my dog was consistently producing loose stools, when she never had before.  Randomly, I found 1 bag of the old formula left at my local dealer so I bought it.  Immediately her stools firmed up.  Now I am again on a bag of the new formula, and again my dog is sick.  I am done, I will no longer support Canidae.  Do not buy it!  Do your research, at this kind of money there are A LOT of better dog foods out there.
