Not much to say, other than the product solicitation is all hype! I carefully followed the directions on the packaging of the "mberry Miracle Fruit Tablets" and the results were about as miraculous as one of those potato chips baring the face of Mary Magdelene! Sorry "Believers of Miracles"... this is one that won't make "The Tonight Show"!
