Coffee is delicious but the k cups come loose in the box (i.e. no packaging except for the box you see).  After shipment, the k cups are all jumbled and thrown about in the box.  We previously got them in 2 25 packs that were easy to open and keep on the counter.  The first time we got this with the new packaging, I had to stop to count if there were really 50 there (seriously, does someone sit and count them as they go in?).  If you have a carousel or old packaging, it won't be an issue.  You will need some way to store them.
