I decided to purchase Kirkland Organic EVOO based on other reviews, and on a University of California study that lists Kirkland as the least likely to be adulterated with non EVOO oils. I was surprised and delighted with the flavor and adaptability of Kirkland Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil and will purchase it again. It's a great bargain compared to the other two or three certified oils, and the taste is wonderful. A general note: The plastic container Kirkland Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil is sold in is sturdy and solid, but I choose to re bottle the oil in glass when I receive it, as I do not to store cooking or salad oils in plastic bottles. I would gladly pay the extra dollar it might cost to purchase the item packaged in glass.
