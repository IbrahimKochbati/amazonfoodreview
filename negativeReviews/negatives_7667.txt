I'm really on the fence on this product.  On the one hand, I certainly appreciate the effort that went into making a truly healthy cookie.  Each cookie contains only 9 grams of sugar, zero Trans Fats and 16% of the recommended daily fiber intake.  This is a truly great cookie from a health standpoint.          However, 9 grams of sugar doesn't have much taste or sweetness.  I didn't know if I was eating a cookie or a bowl of dry oats.  Now dry outs may be very good for you, but they're not terribly tasty, and the flavor of Quaker's Soft Baked Oatmeal cookies was, on the whole, rather a disappointment.  It tasted nothing like what I expect an oatmeal cookie to taste like, and I don't mean that in a complimentary way.  And these were chocolate chip almond oatmeal cookies?  I really couldn't taste the chocolate chips or the almonds.          The box contained six cookies, individually wrapped.  But the size of each cookie was not terribly impressive, especially considering that there are only six cookies to a box.          In the end, I will give it five stars for wholesomeness, but detract two for flavor.  And when it comes to oatmeal cookies, I like flavor.
