GROSS. Tastes like salty menthol sugar or something. Might be passable if you're hiding it in something you're baking...but for coffee? NAH. If you don't own a dog, use Xylitol, because Xylitol will kill your dog. If you do own a dog, just be a man and either quit sweeteners all together, or enjoy sugar. Unless you have diabetes, the truth is that most of you will try this sweetener, that sweetener, and eventually end up back at sugar. Sugar CRUSHES Erythritol.
