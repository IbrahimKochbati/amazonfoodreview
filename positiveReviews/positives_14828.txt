As a math student who can't drink coffee, I need a lot of tea to keep me up during the day.  As a big fan of Earl Grey, one of my friends told me to try loose teas as opposed to the bagged kind     and so I bought this 3 pack of Earl Grey.  I thought I was going to burn through one can in a week, but it actually lasts quite long (and a little goes a long way).  I wound up donating one of the tins to my department so that I could make other people in my department try this tea.  It's wonderful.
