These grapefruit slices are delicious, but beware on two points:            5 pounds is a heck of a lot for one person (last time I ordered it lasted for months, even with me sporadically handing it out to others).       The candy hardens with time and loses a bit of its chewiness   gumminess.  (Still tastes good, though).          I'm going to experiment with using a more airtight container to see if they stay chewy for longer.
