I love this Bigelow flavor!  Plantation Mint is a rich basic black tea with a fairly strong spearmint flavor.  One of my favorite moments with this tea is taking a nice deep whiff of the aroma from the tea bag right after opening the foil pouch, before I've placed the bag into the water.  It would be a bit too much for me to have this as my normal flavor for every cup (I drink two or three cups of tea a day), but Plantation Mint is one of several Bigelow flavors that I drink perhaps 3 times or so a week each.  Every time I decide to reach for the  ight green Plantation Mint bag my mouth starts to water.  Wonderful stuff!          If you're wondering how this compares with other Bigelow Mint flavors, I would say the "mintiness" is similar to that of the Bigelow Green Tea with Mint, or perhaps this Plantation Mint is just a wee bit mintier.  Both are good   it just depends on whether you're in the mood for a cuppa black tea or green tea.          I always drink tea straight  no sugar, no honey, no lemon, no milk!  So my reviews are my opinions of the straight tea flavor, not how it interacts with another agent.  I drink Bigelow tea almost exclusively, because it's readily available, modestly priced, and has lots of varieties that are all of decent quality.  If I give a Bigelow flavor less stars, it reflects only my taste preference, and is not a statement of low product quality.
