Disappointing... while folks like to say tofu has no flavor, I can discern  a type of neutrality and this     one is the blankest of blank slates          Wet, watery, gelatinous, it is not a product i will buy again soon. I got it because shopping is     a challenge.          It's not awful, just disappointing. The benefits are the packaging and that is has shelf life.
