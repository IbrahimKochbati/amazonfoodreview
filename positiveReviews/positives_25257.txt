I purchased this because I was looking for an organic maple syrup in a larger size than what I find in my health food store.  I bought the grade B because I noticed it has iron in it (the grade A organic one I purchased prior to this didn't.) I'm vegan so I like to add any extra iron I can. This was delivered within two days (thank you Amazon Prime!) packaged well, and at a great price with the subscribe and save. It's really good, I love it. I also use it in place of sugar in a lot of recipes and to sweeten my husband's tea. My kids love it too, I have to stop them from way over pouring and drowning their pancakes. Haha!
