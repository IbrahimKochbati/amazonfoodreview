I have tried a couple of the Switch drinks now and as far as I'm concerned they have a great flavor. It is important to serve them ice cold. One of the cans I drank sat out of the fridge for a while before I cracked it open. It was still cool, but there was a distinct difference in the flavor from the ice cold version and not for the better. The carbonation is subtle and the sweetness is light and appropriate for the drink. I took off one star for the value of the drink. They are a little pricey for the size of the cans.
