these bars are delicious.  i love them. they are the perfect thing to eat when you are looking for a healthy, yet filling, snack.  they are good anytime.  my favorite flavor is the apple raspberry, but all of them are actually very good.  they are a little on the thick side, but that's ok because it makes you feel like you are eating more than you are and takes the edge of your hunger till you can eat a bigger meal.  i'm happy i found these and will continue to order them.  great product.
