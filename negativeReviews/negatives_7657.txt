I'd selected this without seeing that it had almonds in it (reading fail, I know) but I had a house full of critics to run this through.          My mother ripped into the box before I even had a chance to ask her if she wanted one. She was actually somewhat disappointed, as this was exactly the type of thing she likes. She said that they're good, but that they're sort of mediocre as far as cookies go. My grandparents liked the cookies and would eat them, but it was clear that it was only because they're there.          I do have an allergic reaction to tree nuts, but for the sake of the review I tried a tiny piece. (Don't worry, I took precautions and I felt I owed it to at least try the cookie myself..) It's pretty bland and while it smells really great and is very soft, those two things just didn't translate into a huge flavor situation.          The general consensus was that while these were decent enough to eat, they're really not something anyone is overwhelmed by. The box has sat in the kitchen pantry for almost a month now and there's still half a box left, if that says anything to you. This is just a mediocre cookie. If my family had liked these then I'd have gladly bought some for them again (I love feeding them), but their reaction was so ambivalent that I don't think I'd get these on my own.
