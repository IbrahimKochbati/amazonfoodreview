I'm floored by the negative reviews.  I started eating these about 6 months ago and am addicted. This item is a blend between crunch and a bit of sweet.  Yes, they are a bit gritty but I never opt back to regular stick pretzels so that isn't a real noticable issue for me.  I saw Dr. Oz introducing new foods to some people one day and he reminded them to taste and evaluate on the item, not as a comparision to what they were used too.  That may be why some folks do not like these.  I love these so much I'm buying in bulk.  But I have changed my eating habits 180 degrees so maybe that's why I love them.  I never go back to the old way I ate as comparision, and have no lingering desires for the junk food flavor.
