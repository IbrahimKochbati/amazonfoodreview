The first time I used this pumpkin, my pie was TERRIBLE (goupy, flavorless), and I figured I must have done something wrong. I made my next pie with Libby's, and it was perfect. So I decided to try the EXACT SAME RECIPE with the Farmer's Market Organic Pumpkin again tonight. AWFUL!! Watery, miserable. I let the pie bake longer, in the hopes that it might thicken up, but it's still goupy and doesn't taste pumpkin y at all.          The pumpkin itself was thin and lumpy as I mixed the ingredients, and while I think I managed to work out the lumps, it just wasn't very "pumpkin y" smelling or tasting.          I will NEVER buy this product again. I prefer "natural" and organic alternatives, and I know that they can sometimes require recipe adjustments, but this is just unacceptable.          "Certified Organic" apparently doesn't always mean a better product!
