We bought the "small" toy with the rubber rope for our 19 lb mutt who gets very whiny when he's bored. I must say it's the best treat dispensing toy we've given him. It's way less noisy than the Buster Cube and the same amount of treats kibble lasts longer. Other treat dispensing toys have gotten chewed up quickly and this one hasn't. Benji is an easy keeper and doesn't need much food. If we put his morning ration of 1 4 cup of kibble in the tug a jug it takes him about 40 minutes to get it all out and by that time he's panting with exertion.          I do *not* recommend this toy for use on bare floors if you are there to supervise as you probably should be. The jug itself is very hard plastic and Benji could care less about manipulating the "rope" to get the treats out: he simply throws the jug around until food comes out. If I were to give him this toy in our kitchen the noise would drive me crazy. On our carpeted living room floor the noise is tolerable.          The only distraction that works better is a bully stick which of course is silent but they are expensive and I don't like to use them every day. Alternating them with the tug a jug has given us some peace and quiet. Altogether a good investment in our situation.
