PERHAPS AMAZON SHOULD START A SCRATCH AND DENT SECTION AND SELL ITEMS LIKE THIS CORN THERE! ALL BUT ONE CAN OF THIS GREAT TASTING CORN WAS DENTED, SEVERELY! DONT GET ME WRONG, I WILL STILL BUY DENTED GOODS, BUT ONLY AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE. THE DAMAGE DID NOT OCCUR IN TRANSIT EITHER WHICH DISTURBS ME. IF THEY KNOW THEY ARE SELLING DENTED CANS, FINE, BUT START A SCRATCH AND DENT SECTION!!!!!!
