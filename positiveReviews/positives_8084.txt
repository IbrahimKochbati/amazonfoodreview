This is a great affordable way to get some healthy proteins and fats.          Amazon sent me very fresh product.  I subscribed n saved on July 22nd and it arrived via OnTrac on July 24th.  The Nutiva Hempseed package says it was packed on may 19, 2012 and is best before may 18, 2013.  Pretty fresh product and tastes fresh, too.          Sprinkle on top of your  cereal, omelets, yogurt, soups, salads, and veggies.          Hemp seeds require no advance soaking to derive optimal nutritional benefit.          Here is a great way to enjoy Hemp:     1cup hemp seeds     1 cup spring water     1Tbsp maple syrup, honey, stevia, or your favorite sweetneer     dash himalyan salt     optional flavoriing   cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, cardamom          Combine all in a blender and blend well until a creamy white milk forms.
