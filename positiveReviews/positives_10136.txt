Let me start by admitting that I am no fan of most food substitutes. Vegan cheese is the perhaps the most disgusting food on earth, sugar substitutes make me bitter, and tofu dogs are like some kind of rank joke to me. But my favorite food is spaghetti, and pasta is very limited on any healthy diet.          Enter these noodles! I rinsed them in hot water, mixed in with some hot tomato basil pasta sauce, a few ounces of ground turkey  east meat, and topped it with a couple tablespoons of parmesan cheese, and I had a perfectly acceptable bowl of spaghetti for under 300 calories. Add a nice veggie to the meal, and you are eating like a true health pro.          Next, I am going to try Miracle Noodles in an Asian stir fry. Hurray for shirataki noodles!
