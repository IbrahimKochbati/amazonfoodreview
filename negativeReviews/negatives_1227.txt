I agree with a previous reviewer   when it comes to the dinners (just about all of the Earth's Best choices) they are watery and SWEET.  Apples (or some other fruit) in just about everything, and the first ingredient is nearly always water.  I've decided to stay away from these as much as possible and purchase protein containing dinners from another jarred  and (or mixing my own).  I'd really rather not nurture a sweet tooth at such a young age!          The Earth's Best fruits and vegetables for the most part are great   just check the label to make sure water isn't the first ingredient listed (I just love how baby food will have water listed first but then some kind of flour added as well to thicken it up).
