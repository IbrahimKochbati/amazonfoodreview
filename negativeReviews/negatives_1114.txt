I have three dogs.  Two of the three would normally eat just about anything that you put in their bowls.  The third one (a Yorkie), has always been pickey. For the past couple years I had been buying those expensive  ands of food that promise "natural ingredients and better health". I decided to try Newman's Own.  None of my dogs seem to be crazy about this food (no disrespect to the late Mr. Newman).  If I mix Newman's Own with another  and, the dogs make an effort to pick out (eat) the "other" food and they will tend to leave Newman's Own in the bowl.  If they are hungry and nothing else is available, they will eat the Newman's Own. I am not here to "knock" Newman's Own.  I am simply telling you my experience. BTW: The food is not old. It does not smell stale or old.
