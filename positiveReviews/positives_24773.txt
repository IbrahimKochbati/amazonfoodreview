This one in the purple color was very nice. Pops up a very striking white color with purple undertones to it.          Great flavor to it, nice and light. Also for quite a large bag, I was shocked these never seemed to "go stale".          This was a great purchase to be coupled with the stir crazy popcorn popper!
