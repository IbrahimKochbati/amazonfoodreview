These didn't last long at our house, even though I had concerns that the kids wouldn't like the coconut. Pamela's Whenever Bars are light, delicious snacks that can easily be eaten on the move. The texture is chewy, slightly dry and accented by the moistness of the chocolate chips. I found these to be best with a cup of coffee and would recommend them as a healthier alternate other snacks.
