I have used Canidae products exclusively for my dogs for many years, with great results. They have healthy shiny coats, and are active and beautiful. However, my Sheltie Chow mix had recurring ear problems all her life. The vet couldn't identify the problem  her ears weren't infected  but they always looked red and irritated. We tried everything, but nothing really helped. One day, on a whim, I bought the new grain free Canidae, and to my surprise her ears cleared up almost immediately. All the time we had been looking for an elusive infection, but apparently she just had a wheat allergy. To test the theory, one day I fed her a piece of  ead (wheat) and the next day she was tugging at her ears. Back to the grain free Canidae! The dogs love it, and the Sheltie mix just passed her 15th birthday and is going strong.
