The Switch is a great alternative to the usual carbonated sodas.  It is all natural and 100% juice with all the vitamin C a body needs.  It tastes just about as sweet as soda but without the corn syrup sugar.  It is less carbonated than soda but I like that.  It also has a "lighter", crisper taste.  The Kiwi Berry flavor is good but my favorite is the Black Cherry flavor.  I recommend both but keep in mind that the can is only 8.3 ounces and costs more than soda.  I think it is worth it!
