Once I tasted Hazelnut coffee, I was hooked! Now it's the only coffee I drink. Maxwell House Hazelnut is my favorite  and, but it has been hard to find sometimes in stores. Until we can order it on Amazon, try either Don Francisco's Hazelnut or even Target's Market Pantry Hazelnut Brand   both are very good.
