I order a 6 pack of large dog chicken pill pockets every month.  The vendors vary; I buy from whichever vendor offers free shipping.  The last time I ordered, the pill pockets were all crumbly and torn inside the packages.  They weren't dried out; they were just torn up.  I had to mush our meds onto the pill pockets and mash shreds into a ball to get enough to cover the meds (my dog takes about 5 pills per meal, poor baby).  Anyway, every pouch was the same way.  I made sure to order from a different vendor this time even though it's hard to see how the vendor would be at fault for the product.  Regardless, I've never seen this before and I hope not to see it in my next shipment; if I do, back they go!
