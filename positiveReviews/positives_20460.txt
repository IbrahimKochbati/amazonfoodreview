Kay's French Vanilla Protein Cereal is a good tasting way to get gluten free cereal with lots of soy protein. I really like this flavor!          Here is the ingredient list:          Soy Protein Isolate, Yellow Corn Flour, Rice Flour, Tapioca Starch, Inulin, Pea Fiber, Natural Honey, Evaporated Cane Juice, Canola Oil, Cinnamon Powder, Vanilla Extract, Natural Flavoring, Baking Powder, Double Acting Leavening Agents, Salt.          (I would prefer if it had  own rice flour, though)          I appreciate the fact that it is very low in sugar; only three grams per half cup serving.
