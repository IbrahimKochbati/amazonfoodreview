I would've thrown the whole bag out if not for my convection oven. My first microwave batch turned out HORRIBLE. 1 2 cooked and no puffy fluffy pieces at all! I popped some onto my infrared NuWave oven and they puffed up after 8 mins. FINALLY  something edible and YUMMY!     Glad they are healthier than the MSG other additive types of rinds, but kinda high maintenance as far as how to properly prepare them. I think I will try to find easier to prep ones...bummer.
