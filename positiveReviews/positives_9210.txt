For starters, the tree came surprisingly fast and looked beautiful. It came in perfect condition. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that unfortunately, they did not send the ceramic pot. We live in Missouri and it was already 3:15 so we were not able to call. I will update when I call. I'm not saying it's a bad product, it's great! It's just that they made a tiny mistake. If you're looking for a good starter kit, this is it!
