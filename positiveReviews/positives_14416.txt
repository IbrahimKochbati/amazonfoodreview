My elderly lab suffers from arthritis.  Her pain is greatly diminished by taking glucosamine and chondroitin.  Unfortunately she is not a fan of the gravy, chewable tablets or pill forms.  Hip Action has been a fantastic find because she actually wants her meds.  You can set a clock by her these days at 8 pm she goes into the kitchen and stares at the cupboard where we store the Hip Action and waits for her two treats.
