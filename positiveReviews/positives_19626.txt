pros   high quality healthy product. good value for money. tastes good.     Good quantity, using 1 cup flour for 1 person, I get 4 5 pancakes. So from 1 packet, I think, you can get 5 6 cups of flour     for me works best with fat free milk or soy milk. I serve with maple syrup or sauteed veggies(spinach, baby corn, potato and chives, black pepper and garlic)     cons   since this is a very healthy product, it can get a little boring after a while, I tried adding pureed strawberries to the batter, didn't work too good, so don't try that, try to serve blueberry sauce on the side instead.
