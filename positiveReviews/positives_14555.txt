I enjoy black tea blends over any other. I don't drink coffee, so black teas takes the place of it. Many variety packs have a selection of herbals, blacks and green teas. Thankfully Twinings offers us this variety pack of wonderful black teas.          The Teas:          Irish Breakfast:     I love this blend. I have always been a fan of Irish Breakfast. If your new to the tea, don't let the name and green packaging give you the impression there's anything minty about it. It's a straight black tea (typically 100% Assam teas). No sweetness or flavoring of any kind. This is typically taken with sweetener or has milk added to it to taste (like straight black coffee). I personally enjoy it without anything added, and drink it black. Because of it's caffeine content, I prefer drinking Irish Breakfast in the mornings. It also goes great with meals since there are no strong flavors aromas to overpower the taste of ones food.          English Breakfast:     Much like the Irish Breakfast tea, it is also a blend of black teas without flavors added. However, there are usually several black teas blended together (most common Assam, Ceylon and Kenyan) to produce the flavor of English Breakfast. The information of the exact leaves blended is not offered as information from Twinings, saying only that it is a blend of black teas, but those are the usually ones. While not as bold as the Irish Breakfast, it is still a strong tea that is typically accompanied by milk or sugar.          Lady Grey:     A milder version of Earl grey, very subtle citrus flavors have been added to this blend. By no means is this a fruity tea, as it is just a tiny hint of flavor. Not nearly as aromatic as the Earl Grey blend, this Lady Grey has a much more delicate taste.          Earl Grey:     Bold, aromatic and memorable. Most tea drinkers can pick out a cup of Earl Grey no matter the  and, and Twinings blend is no different. An unmistakable presence of Bergamot can be found, but is not so strong to be off putting. Fans of Earl Grey will find this a medium strength blend, just enough to know what your drinking, but not the strongest on the market. A nice tea for afternoons and evenings.
