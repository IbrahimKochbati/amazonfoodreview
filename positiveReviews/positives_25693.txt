I have decided to write this review after reading about how disappointed some people are with this product. This is not a traditional South American mate (which is smoked). This tea is an unsmoked pure mate, which is actually healthier than smoked version and doesn't taste like the traditional mate. Just like with anything else, you have to get used to the taste. Well, it is bitter but that's how nature intended it! And I have to say, I feel the difference in my day when I drink it in the morning...nice, steady energy and positive mood. If you look up Yerba mate's nutritional values, it kind of clarifies why! It's like a multivitamin with more antioxidants than any other tea (even green tea) without the caffeine. I used to sweeten it with honey but have grown to appreciating it's own taste.     Enjoy it!
