I have tried quite a few K Cup products and this one left me longing for something else. It kind of has a burnt taste to it. I have tried Newman's coffee via a McDonald's and it did not taste like this. Overall I was disappointed and have moved on to the likes of Wolfgang Puck. These tend to be a little more smooth.
