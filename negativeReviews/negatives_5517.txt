This is the nastiest fresh mixer by Healthy Choice I have had. I still have the taste in my mouth and want to vomit. The water chestnuts add nothing but vegetable content, and the teriyaki sauce is disgusting. I didn't purchase it from amazon but from a regular grocery store. Do not buy! I recommended the sweet and sour chicken though :)
