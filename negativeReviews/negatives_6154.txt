We have tried the log, thick slice, and thin slice versions.  The thinner the slice, the faster to cook and overcook.  We never found the correct way to cook this without causing it to dry out.  We never steamed it.  We prefer the thicker slice version.          The high cost we assume is based on four factors; high density product, reduced fat, high spice content, and presumably using better cuts of meat.  When fat is reduced, the desired flavor profile requires more spices, but makes cooking more difficult.          The texture is closer to hard (than soft) salami.  The fat content appears much less than bologna or spam lite.  Spam does have hints of ham flavor after slow frying; not discerned in (this  and of) pork roll. Excepting any ham flavor, the flavor profile is stronger and better than (regular) bologna and distinct from spam, in our opinion.  The first time we tried it, everyone designated it as "Beverly Hills spam."  Unlike my former acquaintances from Jersey and Philly, we were not won over, but understood their longing for memorable home foods.          Our local Publix carries the thin sliced version and the one pound mini log ($8), whereas we previously ordered online or found it while traveling.  If you elect to try it, invite some friends over for a sharing experience...just ensure you have practiced cooking it to your satisfaction before offering it to a group.  We shared our log at a family gathering and also received the routine comment..."It reminds us of spam."
