I usually order Plum organic vegetable squeezable pouches for on the go but it comes one flavor per bulk.  So when I saw this variety pack, 8 count POUCHES I decided to order. I recieved it today and it is DRY PACKET food not POUCHES... False Description.  To make it worse I went online clicked on return i got a message states this item is not returnable.  I feel ripped off with the FALSE DESCRIPTION.... How can you describe DRY PACKET FOOD as POUCHES???
