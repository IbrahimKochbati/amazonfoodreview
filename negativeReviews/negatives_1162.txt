Looked like a good deal, so I ordered the ground fennel, as well as 4 other spices and seasonings from this company, but was disappointed with them all. Zero flavor, not even the fragrance of the right herbs or spices when loosely sealed containers were opened. The dill smelled like dried musty grass, and the onion even worse. Ended up throwing them all away...save your money, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
