I tried many times to find a replacement for Planters Cheeze Curls (now they discontinued it). And I think that is a perfect replacement. May be not only perfect but better than original from Planters. So, there is lot of cheeze powder on it and size is right and it's so delicious that when you'll put one curl in to you mouth you will involuntarily draw the next two.          I'll recommend it for everyone who loved old time Planters Cheeze Curls   it's good and probably better.          P.S.: I love them so much so I order them to Russia   total cost with delivery is about 75 dollars!
