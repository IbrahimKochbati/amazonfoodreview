This is the best tasting cereal I have ever had in my entire life!  We eat it nearly every day for  eakfast, usually adding a half a banana and some chopped up walnuts.  Some of my family even put blueberries on it!  I would never do that!  I occasionally buy it at Sam's or Costco (usually while traveling) but it ends up cheaper here at Amazon, especially with the wonderful Subscribe and Save option.  My shipments magically arrive!  One thing to note   you must keep your granola refrigerated to make it last   especially if you buy this 6 pack!  The oils will go rancid if you store it in a warm location.  This goes for nuts and seeds too!
