I bought this for my baby when he started solids.  I love that it is BROWN rice and ORGANIC.  The Choline, DHA and probioitics are great too.  My baby loved the cereal and I feel good that he is getting nutritional organic foods.  I mixed in some pear puree from the HappyBaby pouches and I feel it helped encourage the digestion of starting a new food.  Looking forward to trying the other varieties as well.
