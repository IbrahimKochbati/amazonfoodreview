Received package early by about 1 day, always a good thing!! everything was intact and delicious, the actual York Mint box had some scuffing on it, but I didn't buy it for display.  I have it on my desk at work and am able to share with my co workers.....if I feel generous.          5 stars overall, can't go wrong with 175 peppermint patties.!!!
