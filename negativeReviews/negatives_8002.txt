I have bought from this seller before and had no problems.  This last order I opened before I went on vacation for two weeks.  The texture of the beef jerky was different in this order than the ones that I had bought before.  After returning from vacation, when I opened the package, there was a very non pleasant odor.  Upon inspecting the jerky, I found that several pieces contained mold on them.  What I have now is over a half pound of very expensive dog treats. While I would be willing to try this product again, as I have bought it before and this is the first problem I have had, there is no easy way of contacting the seller. The product is also listed as non returnable, so while my dog is extremely happy   I am not.
