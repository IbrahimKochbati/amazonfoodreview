I don't eat sweets but I eat fudge and have had the pleasure of tasting many a fine recipe but none have been as tasty as Mo's   none.     I tried the standard chocolate and the vanila crunch and it was to die for.  I reluctantly shared it with four others who were really taken back about how good the fudge was so it's not just me   it was a hit all the way around :).     One thing to note is the fudge ( I bought 1 2lb of each) came in a lovely decorative box totally suitable for gift giving so you could purchase and have it sent directly as a gift knowing that it will be arrive wrapped nicely and professionally.     In my reviews I like to include the "cons" but there simply are none for Mo's Fudge   I will never buy any other fudge again and doubt you will either after you give theirs a try.
