No, it's not peanut butter. Yes, it's an all natural 45 calorie snack and it tastes AWESOME!     For everyone who's watching their calories, this is the answer. If, like me, you've been denying yourself peanut butter all this time or adhered strictly to the 2 tbs rule. Now you can eat, and then eat some more.     I  ought this to work and had my colleagues try it. One person said he didn't like that the consistency was different from PB, which it is. All others loved it.     Would I rather dip my spoon into a jar of Teddy's? Of course. But since I can't I will be buying PB2 by the boat load from now on!
