My wife is 76 years old and is missing a few important chewing molars and found that these walnuts were very light and tender making them very easy to chew and enjoy. I have no chewing problems and enjoy them as well on occasion. I would normally have a negative reaction in my mouth when eating more than one walnut directly out of the shell, but with your dry roasted formula I can eat a handful or two with no side affects. I recently changed my ordering times so we never run out of these delicious nuts; however, we received an extra 6 can shipment about a week after a double order of 12 cans. I would like to review my automated ordering cycle so the canisters do not pile up. In addition, it would be nice to know what the suggested shelf life is for this product in their sealed container? Since your company is in upstate California and we reside in the San Diego area, your shipments do get here quickly after they are ordered manually. This may be a better option for us if we can still get the generous price  eak you offered for subscribing.  Armen Tavy
