The hemp oil soft gels really help my sensitive digestion (along with the probiotic, enzyme and lactose pills).  Of course, I still have to watch what I eat and how fast I eat it (slowing down really helps bad digestion).  I suggest buying this product in bulk because the more you take the better it seems to help.
