This is great popcorn!!!  I just purchased a second batch.  I never had a problem w a ton of kernels left in my air popper or many hulls.  As long as this is being produced and sold I will be a buyer!          The only con I have is that the only seal on the canister is a small piece of tape on the lid canister.  I was surprised to not see some type of freshness seal like you would see on a ketchup bottle.  Surprisingly though I had no issues with humidity effecting the corn (maybe because I'm in a dryer climate?).
