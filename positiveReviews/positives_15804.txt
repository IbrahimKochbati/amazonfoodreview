Shipping was fast. Note that this isn't really a syrup consistency, it's more watery.     As far as flavors:     Chocolate: Very strong, only need a bit. Great in coffee!     Raspberry: Not my favorite, but my roommate liked it  it's a little too sweet for me.     Vanilla: Great in everything!     Irish cream: Good, only ok.     Caramel: Too sweet, but ok if only a little is used.     Hazelnut: By FAR my favorite, will order just this flavor again (maybe vanilla). Great in italian sodas and coffee.          Overall, I like this package, I think it was a great value. Planning on using up all of the bottles, although I will probably not re order this package again. But I think the  and is great!
