This is a great item! I love the silicon material. It is so easy to wash and dry! I don't have any problem with this item. What you see is what you get. I am planning to use to make some ice cubes after my kid graduate from eating baby foods :) Yes, it is expensive but the material is great and safe. I dont have any regret buying this item :)
