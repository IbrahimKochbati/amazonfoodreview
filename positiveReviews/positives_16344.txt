We bought these for our 65 lb golden retriever. He is not a powerful chewer since he has a retriever's mouth, but he is a diligent chewer. He'll chew and keep chewing once he gets going. The size of the large sized Greenies seems right for him.          Our dog's  eath was getting stinky and we were noticing some buildup of plaque, so we got the Greenies Dental Treats. He simply loves these. But he eats them a little to fast. They only last a few minutes. I wish he would chew more and swallow less!          But our dogs  eath does seem better. We don't use them every day, more like every other day to make them last, but they still seem to do some decent teeth cleaning. I would use these in combination with other teeth gum health products like the Nylabones and raw hides.
