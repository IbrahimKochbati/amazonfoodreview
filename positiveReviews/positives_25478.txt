My cat has been eating this for about 2 months. It seems every 3 5 months or so, she gets bored with whatever wet food I give her (even when I get different flavors of the same  and). This is  and 3. I was very skeptical that she would ignore the bits of veggie, but never fear   she cleans her bowl! The only thing I would say as a slight downside   I usually have to add a bit of water to the packet to get all the pieces and gravy out and into my impatient feline.
