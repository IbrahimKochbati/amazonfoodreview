Some time back I ran into an offer of free samples of Barista Prima Coffeehouse Coffee.  When the samples arrived, I fell in love with the  and.  It's rich and delicious.  Now, it's what I use on a regular basis.  Had I not had the samples, I would never have known that this  and I had never heard of would be a stand out.  It's just a great product for people who love a rich, full bodied coffee.
