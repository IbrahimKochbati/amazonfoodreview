I wanted to like this cookie, it's very moist & chewy, has plenty of raisins & walnuts, but something about the flavor just doesn't appeal to my palate.  I'll stick to the ginger & peanut butter.  Like Pamela's other gluten free cookies, the texture is wonderful & can't detect that they are gluten free.
