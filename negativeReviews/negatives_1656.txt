I think I liked a similar drink but this one is just there. It's bubbly. It's sort of orange flavored. It has a sharpness but there's nothing about it that excites me. It's a good old fashioned carbonated beverage and if it's inexpensive buy it. If it's significantly more expensive than most drinks, leave it. Buy coke instead.
