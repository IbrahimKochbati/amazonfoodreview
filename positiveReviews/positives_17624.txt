I normally stay away from anything labeled "dark roast", but I'm glad I took a chance on Puroast (low acid) Coffee. The lower acid sure does cut down on the bitterness usually associated with dark roasts. My stomach handled this dark french roast better than my off  and medium roast. My only complaint, is the price of this coffee. It averages about one dollar per ounce, which I think is a bit extreme, I liked it, but it didn't blow me away. So if you don't mind the price tag, I would recommend it. Good stuff.
