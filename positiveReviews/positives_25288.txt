I had purchased this item at Trader Joes with a slightly different name and with a Trader Joes label. Much to my dismay, they stopped carrying it.  The ingredients on both bottles are the same even though they were listed in a slightly different order. I'm sure there are many uses but my primary use is as a sauce for my salmon.  It makes a regular presentation instantly "gourmet".  Everyone who has tasted this absolutely loves it.
