This is the only pumpkin that will settle my dogs stomach. I used to be able to purchase it at walmart, but now they only carry a different  and. I found the Farmers Market  and online and was so excited. I almost didn't buy it because of the reviews about dented cans, but, I'm glad I did because all 12 cans arrived perfectly!
