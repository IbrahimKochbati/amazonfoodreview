I purchased this  and as I wasn't so satisfied with the Kernel Seasons cheddar cheese. The reviews convinced me that this was the best on the market. As it is the ingredients and nutritional value are EXACTLY the same, number for number, word for word.. They must be made by the same manufacturer and packaged differently. So to sum it up   I paid $10.81 for 6.14 ounces as compared to buying 6 of the Kernel Seasons which would have come to $13.57 for 17.10 ounces. Big difference, I paid almost 100% more for this product which of course isn't so great either. I feel ripped off but what can I do, you can't win em all. How would I have known if I didn't order the Paragon  and and compare.. This is just my consumer alert to others.          This is Aug 20 2012 and I just corrected my previous review. I said I paid almost 50% more and it is really 100% more. Sorry, I never excelled in math.
