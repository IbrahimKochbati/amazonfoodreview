If you enjoy the taste of Bacon, you may like these. If you're looking for the SW Ranch flavor indicated, expect Bacon flavor instead.  They have a nice crisp texture that's satisfying. I personally don't care for bacon flavored anything, so was disappointed to find South West Ranch flavor MIA. I tried & do like the plain sea salt flavor.
