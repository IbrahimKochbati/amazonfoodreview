My dog absolutely loves these and he is such a picky eater. I probably tried almost 6 different dog treats but I had to give them away to friends because he wouldn't touch them. These however he will chew up until they're gone. He also likes to hide them and save them for later. He doesn't however like the peanut butter ones.
