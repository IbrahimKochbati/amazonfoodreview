I've been using Krusteaz mix for a while which is OK but nothing special. This mix seems to have everything going for it   great flavor, texture and healthy ingredients. The honey makes them sweeter than other mixes so I use less syrup. One cup of mix makes two 10" pancakes which is enough for two people. Pancakes are not as good as scratch made buttermilk pancakes, but it's soooo easy to use and I don't have to figure out what to do with all that extra buttermilk.
