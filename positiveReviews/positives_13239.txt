I love the product, a plastic box of individual     Crystal Light drink mix packets in 4 flavors.     Each packet is good for one 500ml water bottle.     The only problem is I wish I could order a box of     single flavors instead of the mandatory mix ratio.     (I dont personally like the strawberry, too sweet).     This purchase is especially appreciated in areas     where sugar free products are not easily available.     Im also very happy that they ship to APO addresses.
