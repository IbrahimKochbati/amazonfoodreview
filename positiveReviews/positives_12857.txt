This product does not claim to be any kind of energy drink, despite the slim can and flashy design.  Instead, it says that it is carbonated fruit juice, and that is exactly what you are going to get!  It is labeled as containing 100% fruit juice by volume, which coincides with the ingredient list.  It is refreshing, new, and something I would consider drinking again.  I leave off the final fifth star, as it was not the most flavorful beverage of the group, but I believe that owes to the fact that there are multiple flavors competing for a spot on your palatte.  Sometimes, one does lose the parts in the whole that way.  Still, I liked it and will definitely drink it again!
