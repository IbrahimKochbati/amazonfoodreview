I am usually not a fan of flavored coffe or coconut for that matter and when I bought the sampler pack of Jamaica Me Crazy I honestly did not see that it was a flavored coffee.  The aroma that it gives off while  ewing transports me to a tropical island somewhere.  The flavor of the coffee is very subtle and leaves no after taste at all.  A great new addition to my coffee line up.
