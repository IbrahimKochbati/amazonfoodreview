I bought this item thinking it might be equivilent to Starbucks or Davinci Hazelnut syrup but it's not. At first it tastes like Hazelnut then you get the flavor of cheap pancake syrup followed by an aftertaste that can best be described as tasting stale. The price is only slightly better than what I can get the Davinci Brand at Sam's club but the quality is far lower in my opinion. For hazelnut fans I suggest avoiding this particular  and.
