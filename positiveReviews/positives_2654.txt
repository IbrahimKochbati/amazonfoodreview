Unlike the other hot chocolate(s), this one does not have that obnoxious after taste.  What a relief.  When I purchased my Keurig it came with a box of 16 hot chocolate K Cups (name not used to protect the guilty), that have the most indescribable, particularly unpleasant after taste, all due to the "fake" sugar that seems to comprise most if not all of the product.          This manufacturer does use some sucralose, but no where near the amount that "other" uses.  In fact, it actually tastes like hot chocolate during and after the sipping.  WhooHoo!!!!          Will be ordering more   Thank You for my Kuerig hot chocolate reaffirmation.
