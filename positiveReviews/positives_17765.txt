My cats love Weruva's Love Me Tender Pouch.  They are super picky and this one is a huge hit.  We also feed Pumpkin Lickin' Chicken and while they like it, they will leave bits of the chicken about.  The Love Me Tender is all gone, even if they aren't starving.  I've fed it to some foster cats who love it as well, but they seem to leave one particular bit on the plate consistently.          It is made in Thailand   which shouldn't be a problem.  I was hesitant at first, I generally only buy my cat food from American produced sources, but I did my research and found that Weruva did their research and Thailand has very good protections to make sure your animals will get safe food   possibly it has more protections than the U.S.  I won't link here but do your research if you are concerned.          Opening the packet is easy.  The food is kind of chunky with a lot of gravy, for those of you who have gravy loving cats.  I wish this was around when my cat with kidney failure needed food because I think it would have given me a nice way to get some calories and liquid down her.  Remember, if you are feeding only packets, they usually have fewer calories per ounce than a comparable pate style food.  I generally feed it as a "Please don't wake me up early asking for food" treat late at night so I'm happy with the lower calorie content.          The only reason I gave this review 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is difficult to get every last bit of product out of the packet.  The food itself is a 5.  The packets have those folds at the bottom so they can stand upright and the food and goo get stuck in there.  I use a spoon to get the last bits out but I feel like I always leave a little in there.  It isn't cheap so I want to get every bit of yumminess out. I also would be open to buying bigger packets.
