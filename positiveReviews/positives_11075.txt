As a person that had gastric bypass years ago, I constantly had problems with smelly gas. It didn't matter what I ate, I always had it. Recently I have had symptoms of IBS with extreme gas and bloating. I looked about 8 months pregnant by the end of the day. I went looking all over the internet to find some remedies. I bought this tea at a local store and I am utterly amazed. My gas and bloating issues, which were quite severe, are completely gone...and I mean COMPLETELY. I'm not super fond of the taste but it's not too bad and even if it was, I'd still be drinking it for the awesome results!
