Not cheese curls, the hard ones, cheese puffs, the soft fluffy ones. Imagine that but more like popcorn (popcorn with no hulls and a consistent texture)... except healthy and not the least bit greasy. Doesn't taste at all healthy though, and that is why it is so popular. A wonderful find. I hope the other flavours are this good.
