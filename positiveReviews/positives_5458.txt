This dog food is a keeper. I have to buy special dog food for my dog because he has allergies to chicken and  own rice.     My Vet prescribed an Iams  and food with kangaroo meat in it. My dog didn't really care for the taste but he ate it.     I wanted something more natural, so I looked up Flint River Ranch Fish & Chips. What frustrates me, is how you have to wean your dog off of the old food     to gradually get used to the new. He liked the flavor so much, he ate around the old dog food and only ate the Flint River Fish & Chips. Fortunately, his tummy handled     the new food really well. We have no problem getting him to eat and I like that he doesn't have to eat a larger serving to get the same nutrition. I will definitely order     Flint River Ranch Fish & Chips again, and soon. I recommend it highly.
