I like spicy food, most of the snacks labeled as spicy don't cut it, this snack has a good spice level, spicy but still edible     I tend to not like kettle cooked chips, the lays and capecod name and I don't like, the only ones I do like are the kettle cooked name  and spicy thai          That said, these chips are gross     They are thick and stale, the 2 things I hate about kettle cooked chips, the texture is way off     The spice level is perfect, but the taste? bleackh     The taste is what I imagine chewing on moldy cardboard is like     These chips are nasty gross          I wish I could get my money back, they were expensive     not worth it
