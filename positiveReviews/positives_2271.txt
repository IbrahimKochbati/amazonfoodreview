I have purchased these though a local source for four dollars for a pack of eight. If you are not sensitive to MSG then these are a delicious alternative to other salty snacks. The seasoning is tasty and the thin sheets of seaweed are lite and crispy! I eat them two or three packs at a time...25 calories per. Love them!
