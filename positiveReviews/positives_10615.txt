This is not the same old tomato based hot sauce. It is an imaginative take on a spice sauce that works well on just about anything from hamburgers and barbecue to beans and rice. It's not available at the grocer where I live   but it's coming soon! So, I have to order it online. The vendor was great. The product was shipped when promised and arrived in an earth friendly package.          Bottom line: I love this sauce and use it all the time.
