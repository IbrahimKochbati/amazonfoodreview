Someone I knew gave me a bag of this because they knew that I love mate unfortunately this is the worst mate I have ever had. The stuff is not even smoked which is weird because that has been part of the curing process ever since mate has been drank. The best way I could describe the taste of this mate is if you had a pile of really moist grass (like if you cut your lawn) and let it ferment in a dark warm room and then  ewed it. Not good.
