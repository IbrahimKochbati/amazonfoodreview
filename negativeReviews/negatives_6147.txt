Ugh, worst coffee ever.  I've been trying to find some good instant coffee that's cheap, but after this one I just gave up and gave in to buying the expensive Starbucks like everyone else.  If anyone has any other suggestions for cheap good tasting instant coffe, please comment below. There was nothing actually wrong with the shipment or product itself except for the terrible taste.  Definitely not my taster's choice though.
