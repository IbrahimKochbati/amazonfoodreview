My son has been eating the multi grain super greens with gusto from when he was 8 months old. He likes it cold or warm. Yes, it's quite plain tasting to our grown up palates but in my opinion great for the little ones. I started putting some cracked pepper and herbs on it more recently. Sometimes, I serve it as a snack, sometimes as a side dish to meatballs or chicken. Highly recommended.
