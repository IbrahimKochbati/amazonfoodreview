These are very versatile green beans that I would not normally roast and drink on their own, but rather blended to make a truly robust  ew. These beans definitely like a full city roast (although they stand up nicely to a french roast) to  ing out the caramel chocolatey notes that can take a more delicate bean to new heights. The beans are a bit larger than some of the other green bean products offered on Amazon, but roast nicely with my equipment.
