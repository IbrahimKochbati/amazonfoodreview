My wife and I usually try to give our two dogs the best food and the best treats which is why we generally feed them Wellness products or really anything from the Old Mother Hubbard family of products.  We have always given them the Wellness dog biscuits and they have been wonderful.  However the only pain of the Wellness biscuits is that we usually have to go to the pet store specifically to get them as they are not available in our regular grocery store.  I know, petty reason for not getting the biscuits, but when the pet store is an additional ten miles away from your grocer you begin to wish that the local shop had better options.          Luckily they have the Newman's Own Organics at our grocer.          Our dogs loved these biscuits.  Not only did my wife and I have the peace of mind giving our girls these treats due to the wonderful ingredient list but it turns out that the dogs adore these treats. They are also pretty good sized chucks that takes a while for dogs to crunch through which is good for their teeth.          I received this pack through the vine program but this is certainly something that I will be buying plenty of in the future.
