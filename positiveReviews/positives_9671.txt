Called "Frozen Tongue" this was the second flavored released by ALTOIDS in 1998.          ALTOIDS mints were first produced in England at the turn of the 19th century during the reign of King George III.          Ingredients: sugar, artificial flavor, gum Arabic, gelatin, corn syrup, natural flavor.          My first encounter with wintergreen was in a heat rub (I smelled it but did not eat it.) Then I found it in some circular candy with a hole in the middle. Now I keep a tin of ALTOIDS at work, home and in the car.
