Very tasty syrup & organic too. Grade B is less processed and should have more maple flavor than Grade A syrups. I'm knocking a star off because of the high price which reduces its value, but sometimes there are sales and coupons that make it a much better buy. If price were no object, then I'd give it 5 stars. Much better than pouring high fructose corn syrup with artificial flavors on your pancakes and waffles!
