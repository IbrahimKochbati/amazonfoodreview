I was so excited when I found this product in my local grocery store!  I had recently purchased a "Garden Chile Pepper" blend paste from the refrigerated produce section and was pleased with the product, so I was not hesitant to buy another product from a tube.          What a mistake.  I believe that the manufacturer made this pesto with dried basil.  It tased like dust and looked like it too.  I thought at least I could make some pesto butter to freeze if it wasn't good enough for sauces, but I ended up pitching the whole thing.          Don't waste your time, here.  There's just no substitute for the taste of the real  fresh  thing!
