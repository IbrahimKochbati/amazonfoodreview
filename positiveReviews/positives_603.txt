We've tried many Tassimo flavors.  This is by far our favorite.  Our normal cup of coffee is Starbuck's house blend out of a Cuisinart pot but one or two days a week we use our Tassimo.  This coffee is rich but not too stong.  I don't understand the current price over $20 for 14 disks and hope that it will be lowered on Amazon.  For now, we'll buy elsewhere.
