When I read the ingredients of these treats I thought for sure that my dogs would like these. I have 3 large  eed dogs which usually love to eat just about anything. I have Rocky, a black and tan coonhound, Buddy, a blue heeler and a very large pit bull named Hutch. Rocky and Buddy have turned up their noses in disdain to these treats everytime I have offered them. The pit bull Hutch will eat them very grudgingly and even then he'll leave half of the treat on the ground, this is odd because, he'll eat just about anything including tree  anches. So, I wouldn't pay the higher price for these treats, my dogs just don't like them.
