I accidentally left my lunch in my car when I went to work one day and it went bad.  Unfortunately I didn't have time to go out to pick up lunch, so I turned to the vending machine.  Luckily, a Hormel Beef Steak and Peppers was available!  It did its job, it filled me.  However, it was disgusting.  It was a globby, mushy,  own mess.  I did not taste like beef and peppers.  It was more like a beef gravy that was put over way overcooked noodles.  But, like an earlier poster said, it's GREAT for dieters!  I often eat Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers.  Usually they're pretty tasty, but they're very tiny.  The Hormel meal was only 210 calorie and significantly more filling than the Healthy Choice one.
