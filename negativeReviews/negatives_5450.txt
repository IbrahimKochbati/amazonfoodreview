I admit I am not a coffee expert by any means.  Basically, if it is  own, hot, and has cream and sugar I can drink it.  Usually.  That being said, the Puroast Low Acid Coffee French Roast was okay    the taste to me was very strong and I am thankful that I didn't use the entire packet for the pot of coffee I made.  I would have never been able to drink it it was so strong.  That's the part where I am unsure of    I am definitely not a fan of strong coffee.  The fact that it is titled as "low acid" didn't meant very much to me but I didn't have heartburn.  But I usually don't when drinking coffee.          The price of this coffee alone would deter me from impulse buying or even buying it to try.  It comes in a pack of ten for twenty four dollars and even if I only used half a packet, that would still only give me enough coffee for less than a month.  Similar tasting coffees are out in the market today that cost tons cheaper.          Natalie S.
