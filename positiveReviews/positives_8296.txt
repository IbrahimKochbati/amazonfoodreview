Okay, I didn't read the description very well.  I ordered "loose" tea on accident.  By "loose" tea, I just thought it still meant it would be in a tea bag.  I know, don't make fun of me.  I just didn't read it well, and I am not an expert on tea.  Being frugal like I am, I was forced to use the tea anyway.  (I would still like directions on how to make it without a fancy strainer.  It just went straight through my colander.  hee hee) I put the recommended amount in the coffee maker and  ewed it that way.  It was way too strong.  I was able to get three gallons of iced tea from the recommended amount for one.  Anyway, after a lot of trial and error, I now have drinkable tea.  Lipton has always been my favorite tea, and after I drink all of this that I purchased, I will probably stick with the loose tea.  Frugality wins always...
