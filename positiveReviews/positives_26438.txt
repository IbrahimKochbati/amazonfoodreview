I have a top notch Vet (UC Davis and UCLA trained, diplomate,exotic animal specialist, avian surgeon, treats dogs as well and uses a variety of tools including acupuncture and acupressure as well as natural health approach to her veterinary practice) and she suggested these for my 13 year old yellow lab.  Both he and our 7 month old lab puppy (who are both on a healthy diet that includes Nutro Ultra and Evo dog foods, a daily multivitamin, vitamin C and Joint Support from Trader Joe's) are given these to keep their teeth healthy.  They love them, the chips are large and easy to chew and digest and are completely non toxic unlike many other conventional products on the market that claim to function the same way.  Buying them online means I get them very economically and they are shipped immediately   I sometimes get them the very next day without paying any rush charge.  I would suggest asking your Vet before trying them, just to be sure they are safe for your particular companion animal.
