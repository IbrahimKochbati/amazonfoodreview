If you're making Liege Waffles then you're in the right place. They're exactly what you need to get that caramelized exterior but still have a few crunchy bits in the waffle. I have to give it 3 stars through because this stuff is WAY too expensive. Amazon is the only place I can find this stuff, and I even live in the Dallas metro area.
