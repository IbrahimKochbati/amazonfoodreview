These BBQ chips are crisp, well spiced, & satisfying.  I don't eat as many of these at 1 sitting as I do with regular (Lay's) BBQ chips.     We were buying these at Costco for a short while.  The problem with Costco is that when items become very popular, their bulk cost goes up & Costco moves on to carry something else.  Not even Central Market (TX) carries these!  Thanks goodness for Amazon.  I am signing up for the automatic re ordering program!
