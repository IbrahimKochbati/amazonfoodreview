I enjoyed this soup. Yes we would all like fresh Pho soup. If you are in the area that we live you will not find a Vietnamese restaurant for 100 miles. I made the soup and added fresh bean sprouts, fresh cilantro, fresh green onions and strips of cooked steak. This is a basic soup for you to add things to it....not to expect when you open it strips of steak are going to appear from the box. I recommend this soup as a starter to a great soup by adding fresh ingredients. Fresh things never let you down.
