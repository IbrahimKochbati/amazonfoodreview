I am in love with this product!!! Not only me, but also my 18 month old twin boys eat it almost everyday for  eakfast. My parents, my niece, my sister and her boyfriend all love it as well.  So, as you can probably tell by now, this is really a delicious cereal. Also, I know that I'm eating something that is good,healthy and organic for me.  Usually I'll eat it with soymilk and some fruit, and it keeps me full and satisfied for a very long time. My household will never run out of it!  I hope that you always keep this product in stock, cause we can't live without it.
