These are dog treats you can feel good about feeding your dogs. No fillers or artificial ingredients   just good stuff for your pet.  However, I would only recommend these for medium to large  eed dogs (over 40 lbs).  The treats are quite large and are very very hard. My two small dogs (dachshunds) really wanted to devour them, but gave up as they were simply too large for them.  Even when  oken into smaller pieces, the bits were very hard for the little guys to chew.  I gave the rest of the bag to our neighbors and their yellow lab simply loved 'em.  Great treats for bigger  eeds!
