PB2 is a GREAT product.  I love peanut butter but I don't love the fat so I never buy it.  PB2 is a powdered peanut butter to which you just add water.  You can add a little less or little more water depending on the consistency you want.  It tastes just like peanut butter but has only 45 calories for a 2 tablespoon serving.  What's not to like?
