I've been trying loads of snacks over the last year or more trying to find things my kids like in their school lunches and that are portable.  (older kids...)  Irritating that I have to read reviews (which I didn't do..) to find out these are not as advertised and my kids just can't throw them into their backpacks for a protein snack which is why I got them!  Now I have to buy lunch bags. :(  We also like regular jerky better, these tasted overly fatty with a sour after taste.  Not impressed and won't ever repurchase.  Amazon needs to not list unless they are listing exactly what they are selling.  3 stars off for misleading...          Edit:  I'd never looked up the fat content on these things and thought they were lower fat like many jerkys.  No.  About 9 grams of fat for one stick.  I'll stick with jerky and "individually wrapped" jerky at that...          Edit again:  As soon as you open this you have very little time before the entire bag turns moldy.  Be sure and refridgerate!  I'd only had these 2 big bags a short time before they were bad.  Never again.
