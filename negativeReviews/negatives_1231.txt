To be honest, my baby didn't really love all of these at first. He's pretty picky, so I had to mix fruit into some of these to get him interested in a few of them.  He took to the gourmet meals pack right away, but didn't love all of these.  But as he's gotten older, he's gotten less picky and seems to accept all of these flavors now without having to  ibe him by mixing in fruit.  The prices on Amazon are good, so I will continue to order these here.
