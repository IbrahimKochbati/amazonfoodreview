These cookies are our favorite summer treat   we keep them in the freezer so they get a cool soft crunch. They are sweet in that european way, so your teeth don't hurt when you eat them! I am a health conscious sugar addict (a tough combo!) and these fit the bill just right when I cannot bake my own desserts. We love the fresh lemony flavor after a meal, or as a mid afternoon snack.          If you like very sugary sweets, you probably won't like these. However,  if you want to wean yourself (or your kids!) off of a lot of white sugar intake, you might want to give these a try! A pack of 12 goes faster than you think...
