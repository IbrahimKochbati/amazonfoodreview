Icicle is a pretty good preamp for the price.          Very easy setup and a cool design, but definitely was not very rigid. It's very light and made of plastic.     But the one things that I didn't like was the noise. It had a fair amount of buzz along with it.          A cheap preamp for the price, but you get what you pay for.
