I was very pleased with my recent Vanilla Bean purchase from Spice world. When I opened the box, and not even unsealed the beans themselves, I could smell the fragrance of the bean, and see that they were in very good condition. The have been very moist,easy to work with, and taste wonderful. I can't recommend these people too much, and to say I was completely satisfied wouldn't do them justice. I like finding a place I can shop from that will meet my demands for taste and quality... I have a new home!
