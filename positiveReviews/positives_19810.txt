These Haribo Pink Grapefruit candies are yummy!  They smell     exactly like a real pink grapefruit and the taste is divine.     Unlike Haribo's traditional gummies, these are coated with     fine granulated sugar which does make them a little sweeter,     but they're a nice change. I also like the Haribo Peaches     which are made like these.  What better way to get your     daily servings of fruit?  Seriously, we all know that     moderation is key with most everything; definitely so     with these.
