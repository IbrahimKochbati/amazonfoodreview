We absolutely love this  ead here. I've made it as written, in my  ead machine and then I've also made it eggless (with homemade powdered egg replacer). Both times came out perfect! My 4yo who has severe acid reflux plus food allergies (both make him very selective about what he eats) could eat a whole loaf of this  ead by himself. He loves it toasted, with fresh homemade salted butter. It costs $5 per bag at the local Kroger where I live.
