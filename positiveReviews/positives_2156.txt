I am now on my third box of this delicious cereal. I try to eat only high fiber cereals, mainly for nutrition but also because they seem to be more filling. This is now my favorite! If you purchase the fiber plus bars, many times they have a $1 coupon on the back (off one box of cereal)  I buy mine from Wal Mart @$2.68 and use coupon...great deal. Usually lasts me a week...I eat a bowl everyday.  Also, many times you'll find a $1 coupon on cereal box for fiber bars. They are pretty good too, especially the chocolate almond.
