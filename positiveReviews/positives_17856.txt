I love these Pig ear alternatives... My dogs devour pig ears or these in short fashion! These don't have all of the chemicals and processing of many pig ears. These don't leave greasy mess at the place they ate them...          Amazon gives me a discount for subscribing to getting them in regular intervals, they have a great price anyway! Then they deliver them to my house for free and I don't have to add a couple of dollars for Texas sales tax!! Win WIn!!          Now all my furbabies are happy and I don't have to go to town to Petsmart or somewhere looking for them!!
