I've tried several  ands of chili powder, and this one is by far the tastiest and most interesting. I love that it has a bit of cinnamon and cloves to compliment the heat of the chile peppers, and it's not too hot for my taste. It's also great as a seasoning for stuffed winter squash, it gives oven fries a nice kick, and it's perfect on baked sweet potatoes. I will probably cry if this product is ever discontinued!
