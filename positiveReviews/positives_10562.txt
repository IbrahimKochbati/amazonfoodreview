The seller is great. I received them in a timely manner. They shipped when they said they would. I think these are great treats. They smell fresh. The are crunchy treats. There not too hard and not too soft. My dog (Lucy) likes them but it's not her favorite. She doesn't get too excited about them, but she does eat them. That's why I didn't give them 5 stars.
