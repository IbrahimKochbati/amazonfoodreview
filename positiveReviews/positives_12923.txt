We all liked the Switch Kiwi Berry.  The first sip was a bit too sweet for me, but the children loved it.  My son wanted more, but we only had the one can to try.  I love the fact, that it is sugar free and natural flavors. The children loved it straight up, I had to put some ice in mine to dilute it a bit.  This is definitely a great tasting substitute for children and adults, that like the sparkling flavored sodas.  It actually tastes like strawberries, could not taste the kiwi part. We'll have to try the other flavors.
