I am not one for "canned" juice drinks, but this one was exceptional in flavor. I am also not a big fan of orange flavored drinks but the tangerine is distinctive and nice.  It kind of reminded me of one of my favorite soft drinks in the world, Ting (from Jamaica) which is made from real grapefruit juice. Very nice, if you need more Vitamin C in your life I would consider buying it.
