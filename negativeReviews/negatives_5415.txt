Low acid or not, I'm sorry, I just couldn't get past the taste. I tried it black and w  additives   sugar, coffee mate, etc..I had to draw the line at artificial sweeteners; they make everything taste worse... The  ewing aroma was mild to nearly nothing     depending on the strength it was  ewed. Well, it looks like I'm stuck w  decaf during the work week until someone finds a low acid, great tasting coffee...
