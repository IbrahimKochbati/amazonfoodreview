So I bought this to use with my 750ml Torani syrup because the description states it's a universal fit for these bottles. However, the cap is too wide and the straw was too long. I ended up cutting the straw to fit and wrapping plastic around the top so the cap will fit. The price was cheap so I didn't feel like returning it.
