My cat is a bit finicky and it takes him time to adjust to new foods but I have gotten some good reactions from him from this variety pack. My cat is of course a big fan of seafood derived products and I will give you his response to the four flavors in this variety pack.          Red Snapper Entree: Absolutely fantastic, he eats it all with vigor and then looks for more. Very happy with this flavor. This is his favorite.          Yellow fin tuna entree: He eats it all but finishes it slowly, not as enthusiastic as with the snapper but he eats it all and seems to enjoy it.          Steamed Tuna & Sole Entree: Same as the snapper, he ate it all immediately and wanted more.          Steamed Tuna & Shrimp: He ate it all but slowly.          All in all this selection of cat food was a wild success with my cat because he can be very finicky and he will snub his nose at many different  ands and flavors.          Eery cat is different but I usually consider anything seafood based to be a pretty good bet and this selection was a big hit with my cat.     5 Stars          I couldn't tell you how many  ands and flavors I have gone through with my cat just to find things he will eat. SO I am very happy with this selection because he enjoyed and ate all four flavors with no problem.          Aout this style of cat food. This is the liquidy type, not the type that is firm. It is much like a thick soup with lots of  oth and fish. You can spoon it into the cats dish.  almost pour it.
