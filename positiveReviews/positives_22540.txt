My family and friends LOVE the taste of this popcorn and we don't have any issue with how many kernels are left over. Our issue is with the packaging. We have the 8oz Great Northern Machine, which we LOVE! But putting the oil, salt, and seeds in can be difficult because of the size of the heating element. I've found that if you carefully detatch the oil and pour that in, it gives you more room to put the rest in without getting burned. Other than that, I'm very happy with my purchase. I'm only considering trying the Gold's  and because they too have had great reviews (still on the fence). But I am very pleased and MY friends and family would HIGHLY recommend!!!
