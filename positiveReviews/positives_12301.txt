I LOVE this product in fact,it's become addictive for me. This time, however, I noticed some very hard pieces when chewing the nuts and after examining more closely, do think somehow shells got into the nuts as they were being shelled. It made me more careful (therefore, less enjoyment)because the bitterness distorts the otherwise wonderful flavor and I also don't want to crack or chip a tooth. Hope this is an isolated instance with this batch!
