Based on other Amazon reviews, I tried this product.  The first shipment was great; delicious.  Thought I'd found my new healthful snack. 2nd shipment was a concern and disappointment.  Even thought of calling the company; but i didn't.  Several different packages had incredibly hard pieces of ??  wasn't sure they were almonds.  Became concerned I'd chip a tooth, so I haven't ordered any more.
