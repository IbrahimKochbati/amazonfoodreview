My family really enjoys this syrup.  We have little kids and we make a lot of pancakes and waffles.  We were looking for something pure, we didn't feel like we needed added sugar or corn syrup to enjoy pancakes.  The taste is very different from commercial pancake syrup but once you try it, you'll never go back.  The taste is wonderful and complex.  We have this delivered every other month and that schedule fits our needs just fine.
