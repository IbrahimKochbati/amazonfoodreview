We first tasted this coffee in the hotel coffee shop in Costa Rica while on vacation.  We bought a few bags and  ought them back home with us.  Costa Rica grows arabica coffee beans, fantastic.  We enjoy good coffee and it is best in the morning. It's strong, flavorful, full bodied, and not bitter.  In our 12 cup drip coffee maker, we use two rounded scoops (about 5 tbs).  When we finished the last of the coffee, we looked on Amazon and found the exact  and we had purchased in Costa Rica.  We bought four bags and will be getting more.
