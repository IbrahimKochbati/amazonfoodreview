Don't just giggle at the can  open it and eat it!     There is nothing more wonderful than Spotted Dick with lashings of custard and a good cup of strong tea with friends. YUM! I keep it in the cupboard and am ready for friends and tea at a moment's notice. This is a rich sponge cake with currents and savory rich tones of  own sugar. The chocolate and sticky Toffee and Treacle are all good too   when you can get them.          I know the name seems a bit naughty  it just adds to the fun of offering some cultural engagement to our wonderful world. I do slip it into gifts and offer to  ing dessert to friends. BUT I also love this line of products for the QUALITY!
