my dog loves these small biscuits plain. she loves playing with them and then eating them. i tried the fancy flavored ones and she seemed to not really care for those. then i bought some more of the plain small biscuits and she was happy again. they help keep the teeth clean and to freshen the  eath. they have 12 minerals and vitamins. they add some variety to her diet. i am very happy with this product.
