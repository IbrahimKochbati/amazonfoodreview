I don't like BBQ sauce that much, but my husband loves it. Our diet doesn't allow us to have the caloric stuff anymore so I thought I'd try this one out. It does have a strong hickory smoked flavor and smell to me, but my husband said it was quite good and wants me to order it by the case. If he had written the review it would have gotten 5 stars.
