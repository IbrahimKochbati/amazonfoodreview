I was already a big fan of the Popchips Salt and Vinegar flavor, so when I saw that they were coming out with a Chili Lime flavor I was so excited to try it! The flavor does NOT disappoint   tangy, spicy, and a dash of sweet. This is my new favorite "chip"! Now, if you've never tried Popchips before, just be aware that the texture is different than regular potato chips, somewhere between a traditional chip and a rice cake. It can throw off die hard potato chip fans, but if you just want something crunchy and awesome tasting, without as many calories and fat, then this is going to be your new favorite snack!
