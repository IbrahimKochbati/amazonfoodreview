I'm not sure what the flavor people over at Healthy Choice are up to, but this one sure doesn't taste like teriyaki.  Really, it doesn't taste like anything at all.  Bland, bland, bland.  When you're dealing with rice as the main base of the dish, it helps to have some bold flavor to add some zing  not happening here.  The water chestnuts seem out of place and even though they provide some crunch (which I wasn't expecting, and isn't listed on the package), they add no flavor  actually it seems as though they're just bitter.          I couldn't recommend this dish any less.  I will not be buying this one again!
