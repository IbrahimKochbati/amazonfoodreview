The Switch is a 100% juice carbonated beverage in an 8oz can. So, it's not really a soda because its not in a 12oz can. It's not an energy drink, which is what you usually see in these small cans. It's all fruit juice which means it is all natural and better for you than those so called fruit drinks with tons of sugar and preservatives. It tastes good, but not great, and the carbonation definitely gives it a kick. At about a dollar a can, I don't know if its worth the price for me to buy any more, but it does taste good. Perhaps pick some up in a smaller size before buying 24 cans. My kids liked the taste at first, but soon tired of the carbonation.
