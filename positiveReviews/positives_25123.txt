O.N.E. is my favorite  and of coconut water.  Usually I prefer the plain natural variety, but the guava flavor is definitely the best of all the flavored coconut waters that O.N.E. has to offer. If you don't like plain coconut water, this is a great product to try, especially if you like guava.  My husband does not like plain coconut water, but he does like all of the flavored varieties.
