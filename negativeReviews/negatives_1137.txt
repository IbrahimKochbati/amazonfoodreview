All natural beef, but too soft for my taste   doesn't have the 'snap' and drier outer surface that some like.  This is a matter of personal taste   the product is good, just not for everyone.     I suggest trying this company's old fashioned cold smoked beef sticks.  Strong hickory flavor, a good bite of spice, and drier texture.     This company has superb customer service!
