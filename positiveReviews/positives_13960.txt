Yum Yum   this stuff is good!  Perfect for adding to protein shakes or greek yougart or just add water for a delicious dip for apples and celery. You can use it as a dry dip for banannas too!  Has made a wonderful addition to my meals and helps keep me on track with my reduced calorie diet.  I love peanut butter but don't miss (or the higher calories) with PB2.
