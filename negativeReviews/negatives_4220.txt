I too have had tons of gnats come out of the potting soil.  Didn't they sterilize soil in the past?  I bought it to make grow grass seeds for the cats to chew on.I would spray it with bug spray but for the fact that I don't want to poison the cats. I've had some of the soil in planter for 2 months and its still making gnats.  I didn't have that problem with the soil that came with the Chia novelty cat grass seeds and soil.  The Miracle potting mix has a lot of wood chips in it.  I would prefer 100% soil instead of 25% wood chips that cause the gnats.  I guess Potting Mix is different than Potting soil.  I used to sell New Era potting soil that was good dark earth with nothing else added to it. Live and learn.
