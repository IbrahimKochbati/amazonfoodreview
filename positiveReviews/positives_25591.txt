I purchased for my mom and she love it.  She places a few leaves in water and makes her tea.  It taste great and her blood pressure is under control.  She takes her medicine on a as need bases.  She is exercising, good diet and the tea.  It seeming to be working.  She her pressure has been normal for a while.  She loves the tea and is open to all.  She goes and have her pressure check daily by her doctor to she how she is doing and keeps a log.  She has it check to determine if she needs medicine. They are not checking for the tea.  The doctor just wants to monitor her for while.  She discovered this product and wanted to give it a try during this process.  Great choice. She love the product.
