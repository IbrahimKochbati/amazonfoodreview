I searched hard and as far as I know no one else makes a candy like this.  chocolate candy with real liquid expresso filling.  I first tasted this pocket coffee in Europe in 2005 and was very happy to have discovered it on line.  Almost gives the same lift as a shot of espresso and is a very tasty dessert.  Don't confuse it with the "Pocket Coffee To Go" from the same source.  Also tasty but that is a pure liquid in a plastic cup.  Appears like that is the summertime replacement when it is probably too hard to ship a liquid filled chocolate.
