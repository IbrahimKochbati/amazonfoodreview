I recently got a tassimo machine and really like it, but the initial coffees that I tried were not as good as what I used to make by the pot. This one finally blew everything else away. It's delicious. The dark house blend is now my preferred t disc when I want coffee. Since I'm not a coffee snob I don't like to get crazy with the adjectives, but this one has a very deep and pleasing coffee flavor. Full bodied is a good way to describe it, as opposed to a lesser bodied coffee that may smell good but tastes watered down when you drink it. This is definitely the best coffee I've ever tasted out of a home  ewing machine and even better than many cafes can muster. It has no aftertaste and it is not bitter. You can drink it black with no sweetener and enjoy it, or add some cream. Even if you go heavy on the creamer it doesn't lose is flavor. Buy it, and ignore the starbucks haters. Seriously, starbucks' coffees are not as good as everyone makes them out to be. Dunkin Donuts coffee has them beat in price and quality.
