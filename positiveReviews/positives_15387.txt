I have the enviable job of getting two pills into Cee Cee daily. I would mix them with her wet food ( and X). There were times she would NOT eat her foodies! There went the pills and my money. But I decided to buy ONE can of this food to see if she would eat it    wow    she scarfed up everythiing, pills included!! She LOOOVES her Friskies Selects Indoor Cat Food, Classic Chicken Entree with Brown Rice & Garden Greens. So now she has 20 cans, all for HER!! And I am so glad she is taking her pills now with no complaints!!
