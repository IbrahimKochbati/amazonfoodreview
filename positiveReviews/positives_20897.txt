I have to say that my case of chips arrived in perfect condition. I was a little concerned when I went to order them, but was pleasantly surprised on the care given. There was an outside box and the chips were in a separate chip case inside.  Then the entire thing was placed in a clear plastic bag.  The chips themselves are the best that I have ever had.  The sweet onion taste is great!!!! Only problem is that you can't find these particular chips anywhere in New York.  The other random flavors are there, but the Sweet Onion have mysteriously disappeared. Too bad.  I will have to keep ordering them via mail.
