I absolutely love the taste of this tea and so does everyone else I've encouraged to try some (even my coffee drinking daughter).  I drink a lot of herbal teas and this is definitely my favorite.  I can't tell if it's really detoxifying my liver and kidneys, but I do know that drinking a cup boosts my energy level and make me feel better.          Also, don't let the name of the tea make you think you can only drink it occasionally, the box states that it's mild enough to be used every day for up to 30 days.  My only disappointment at the moment is that the six pack on Amazon isn't currently available.
