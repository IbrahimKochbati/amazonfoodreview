The problem with this peanut butter is the use of "evaporated cane juice" which is a coy way of saying "raw sugar". Accent  on the SUGAR. The sugar is gritty and overpowers the peanut taste and the maple. It wasn't very maple y. It was gritty, sweet and pretty much not great. Maybe the "cane juice" crystallized to the low moisture content of peanut butter. Anyway, it was a loser.          I had heard much hype about this peanut butter, started by someone who has a peanut butter sandwich restaurant in New York. I happen to like PBJ and celery with pb  a tablespoon of peanut butter is a fairly good snack even if you are watching your food intake but this peanut butter is too sugary for my tastes. I gave it two stars  if you are making a confection or cookies, it could be very good, but as eat alone peanut butter, I found it way too sweet and gritty for my tastes.
