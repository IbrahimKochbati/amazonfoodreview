We saw this and had to get it. It's been far too long since we'd purchased anything but plain oatmeal in bulk. Growing up, mom used to buy the variety packs of Quaker Oatmeal, which always included Maple and Brown Sugar. The other night, our dinner plan went south and I needed something filling. I saw the box on the counter and grabbed. Couple packs in the bowl, some milk and about a minute in the microwave and I was set to go. It was all warm, a bit runny as I prefer it. With that maply and sugar sweet flavor that I miss from growing up.
