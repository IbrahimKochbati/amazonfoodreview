I love good coffee but I hate a strong taste. This is perfect! It has an excellent smooth flavor and a wonderful aroma. Just writing this makes me crave a cup. Unfortunately the packaging is ridiculous and I won't deal with it again. It was impossible to open the bag by pulling the seal apart. I had to resort to cutting it open with scissors, which created sharp edges in the heavy foil. with better packaging, I would definitely rate this 5 stars.
