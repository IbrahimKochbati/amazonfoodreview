Pill Pockets are in the category "Why didn't I think of that??!"          With two sizes of Pill Pockets to choose, Capsule or Tablet (be sure to notice the distinction),  most any size medication can be "hidden" within to make your dog's pill taking and easy job.  Chicken or Beef, both are very welcome by our dogs.  Just drop the medication into the little pocket, roll into a ball and watch your dog enjoy his new "treat".  We combine our dog's three small pills into one pocket with no problem, even into the small "tablet" size.  Again be sure to choose which size pocket you need    the Capsule size is unnecessarily large if not required.             "
