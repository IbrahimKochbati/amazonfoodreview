I love chips of all root vegetables beets, potatoes, parsnips, carrots etc.  I love potato popchips had never tried the sweet potato version. I wasn't sure if the texture of pop chips and the sweet potato flaver would work together.          I liked and enjoyed them but they aren't a flavor I would have as my 'go to' snack. I think for sweet potato I prefer real veggie slices.  These are light, crunchy, a little sweet and a little salty and perfect for times when you crave both sweet and salty. They are only 100 calories per bag and they came 24 bags in a nicely packed in a box. Great for lunches, or to keep in the car desk purse for a little pick me up snack.
