The product description says that it's "just juice, bubbles and vitamin C." Really, it's just the last two. It's not entirely flavorless, but I've tasted plenty of beverages that are much better than this one with a lot less carbonation.          And, honestly, this "healthy" drink is rather easily replaced by a multivitamin pill. It's not really good for you, it's just not directly bad for you. Sincerely, I'm fairly sure that sucking on my couch cushions would garner you more nutrition than a Mountain Dew, so it's not like "better than soda" is really setting the bar high.          Rather disappointing, particularly compared to the other Switch beverages.
