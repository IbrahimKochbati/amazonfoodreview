I fill up a dozen of these with DD dark and take them to work for my afternoon cup.  I use Eko (not solofil) at home for my  eakfast dose.  These do the job, are very economical, and I only have a problem with a bit of grinds run through if the *machine* is dirty   they need to be wiped down every do often, and don't let the needles plug up.
