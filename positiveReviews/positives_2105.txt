We've enjoyed this popcorn every bit as much if not more than the Movie Theater Popcorn.  It's light and fluffy   tender   and delicious.  I think we enjoy it a bit more because we know there is no "palm" oil or coconut oil in it   we can control what oils we add or leave out.  It works well with the popper   in fact just last night we had a popper full of this corn and followed it with the other because we had purchased so much of the other   we enjoyed this more.
