I love Primal Spirit Jerky.  I've tried several different flavors and some appealed more than others but, as a previous reviewer noted, that was more personal taste than because of any deficiency in product.  This is a very tasty snack that you can really sink your teeth into.  My sister used to buy me these at the end of a long day teaching middle schoolers and even on those days when I had skipped lunch (and  eakfast) these snacks were very satisfying and so delicious that I was always happy to eat them.  Some of them are made from soy and some are made from seitan which is somewhat more chewy and stringy a food.  My preference is for seitan but surprisingly the soy was also very chewy and certainly very good.  I'm really glad the hikers who founded Primal Spirit went ahead with developing this product and I agree with them wholeheartedly that the meat alternative foods outside the United States are generally much better and more varied and their product has benefited from that history of good vegetarian food in Asia.  Definitely going to order some of these now...Yum!
