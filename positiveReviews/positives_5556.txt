Decent every day loose leaf tea. The China Mist  and is good, the only downside is some of the tea is pulverized too fine, so there is sediment in the tea. I recommend letting the tea settle before serving. China Mist is not extremely high quality, just a nice every day tea that tastes fine. The sample pack gives you a chance to try some variety, and it lasts a while.
