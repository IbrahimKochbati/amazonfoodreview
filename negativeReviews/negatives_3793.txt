I would consider this strong coffee, but what is also strong is the smell and taste of cocoa.  I would even say that this is very similar to the flavored coffee ("cocoa or chocolate" flavored) I have tried in the past and not a regular blend coffee at all.  As such, I cannot recommend this coffee at all.
