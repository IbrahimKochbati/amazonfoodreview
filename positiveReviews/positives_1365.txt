I expected..idk..maybe tasteless cardboard...but these are really good..i have only tried the bbq so far..but it packs a lot of flavor and you get a lot of chips in a single serving bag!  I will update after my family beach trip because i am taking the 24 pack with us for some moderately healthy snacking..my only caveat is..these could prove to be addictive..i am looking to watch my weight..and these are definitely a temptation!  Very happy with this product:)
