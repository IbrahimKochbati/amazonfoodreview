I've found protein supplementing a necessity having a diet of pretty much only veggies and fruit [and candy]. I devastated when I found out that I needed to go gluten free because it pretty much cut out any protein bar I could stand eating every day.          Then I found these.          These taste great and have the protein I need. Their texture is a bit chewy, but still in the range of a yummy bar. I guess I just miss having a crunch in my diet [note: they're crunch bars are great, but they have a little too much fiber for my digestive system]. I've got to say, these certainly don't taste like white chocolate, but they are delicious. I think the  anding in this company just decided to call this bar white chocolate, because thinkthin has another chocolate flavor and this one has a more complex flavor symphony working for it that would deter from the title of simply chocolate.          I do wish they had a little more nutritional value in them, but I shouldn't ask for too much when flavor is more of my concern in a protein bar. They've got a little calcium and iron, so I'm happy. Especially when I compare their 230 calories to my old bar of 320 that had the same amount of protein [and a lot more nutritional content].          These are also quite affordable when you buy the case [compared to the other gluten free bars.]. I've been eating a least one a day and slowly over the past 10 months I've watched my lanky muscles grow into what they should be as a daily biker and intense artist who's apt to throw their whole body in their work.
