I adopted a dog in Oct. 2007, and started trying different foods... grocery  ands, Mighty dog, Iams, Eukanuba, and so forth, in various formulations. She will eat almost anything, whether or not it agrees with her intestinal system, but I wanted something healthy for her that would not have us running for the outdoor potty all day (or night) long.  She liked Iams, but ended up being constipated half the time, also unpleasant! I saw some trial sized bags in a pet store, and bought a couple. OMG, can I say my dog loves this food AND it agrees with her system? In addition to it being a great food (check out the ingredients), I can literally give her pieces of this as treats and rewards, she likes it that much.  So many people who saw her when I first got her, and see her now, are extremely impressed at how much better she looks too. Since no one food is perfect for every dog, I highly recommend trying a small bag first, and then see if your dog likes it as much as mine does.  As much as she likes it, I think she actually eats a bit less of it, because it's denser in calories, proteins and vitamins than most other foods, so it works out pricewise to be reasonable. I've also given it to my foster dogs, and their coats also improved on this food.
