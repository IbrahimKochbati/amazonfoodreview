After reading so many positive reviews, I have really high hope on this products. My 3 year old Shihtzu has been taking Greenies and since it costs significantly higher, I thought I can replace it with C.E.T. But sadly, he won't eat it at all. He simply sniffed at it and then walked away. I've tried in several occasions and I am now giving up and am giving it to neighbor's dog. I do have to note that my dog is a very picky eater. Hence my suggestion: If yours is also a picker on food, then try to get a sample or buy a smaller pack first before getting a large bag like I did.
