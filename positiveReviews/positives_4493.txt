My cats love freeze dried meats.     They absolutely love these treats.     They are the cheapest of all the treats I buy.     The quality is good, too many small pieces though.          Do not buy freeze dried beef liver as it is too hard on there tummies.          I only give them a couple of pieces a day but they know what time that is!
