Using this popcorn in my new popcorn machine that I ordered for the office... coworkers love it.  Comes in premeasured bags with the REAL DEAL theater ingredients like coconut oil and butter flavored salt.  Just cut it open and pour it in   probably works best with a theater style popcorn maker   plent of those available for less than $150.  If you have a home theater, get a popcorn maker (i have the paramount 8oz   works perfect), then get this popcorn.  I will be ordering again.  I accidentally bought the 4oz instead of 8oz, but i just use two packets.  8oz is a better deal it seems for about $7 more.
