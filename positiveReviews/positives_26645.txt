Let me say I am reviewing this product after a complete year of my dog being on it.  I feel that is a good amount of time to give a complete review.  With that being said, I could have reviewed this food after just one month of use and it would be the same.  I have a Dogo Argentino that weighs around 110 lbs.  She had itchy skin, hair loss, runny goober eyes, heat spots, severe and never ending ear infections and skin tumors (multiple surgeries to have them removed).  She was only a year and three quarters old when we started her on this food.  Our doggie dermatologist....yes, doggie dermatologist and our local vet suggested switching her to this food.  Boy did it change our dog's, and our, lives.  Within a month, without any other treatment...just by switching her to this food her heat spot went away, her hair started growing back, her eyes quit having discharge and we haven't had not one more ear infection or skin tumor!!!!  We could not be happier with this food.  She ONLY eats this food and she ONLY eats the treats of the same  and and make.  The price is steep especially when feeding it to a 110 lb dog, but the money we have saved in vet bills and with her being a happy dog it is soooo worth it.  The other option was Hills Science Diet from my vet with cost twice as much as this.  I am so glad this food has fixed my dog.  I used to buy it at pet co, but when I found it on Amazon I was thrilled.  No more driving an hour to the petstore and having to lug the big bag around.  Amazon is very price competitive and it is delivered right to my front door and no shipping fees.  Wonderful!
