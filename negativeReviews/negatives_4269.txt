The flavor of the tea is strong and smooth, and a flavor that you would expect in a good English Breakfast Tea.  My only complaint is that the tea is ground very finely, and the tea caddy doesn't keep tea particles from getting into the tea, and some are fine enough to even pass through a tight strainer.          The Assam of London loose tea that Amazon carries is much better.
