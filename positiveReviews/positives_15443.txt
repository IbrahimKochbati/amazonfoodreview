My family were addicted to the South Beach protein bars and were disappointed that they were discontinued.  I found these here and bought them thinking they looked in the picture like the South Beach bars and was very happy when I received them and they were the same bars as far as I could tell.  These are sweet and a little crunchy but not too crunchy and not near as crunchy as granola bars.  They keep me from getting hungry when I cannot eat a full meal.  They do not have that gritty taste that some protein bars have.  I find that the flavor is like a cross between a cinnamon bun and a pecan roll.  Very good and glad to have found them here!
