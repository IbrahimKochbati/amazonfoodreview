First I want to say my dog is a carnivore, he primarily eats raw meat. I do allow him many treats other than carrots but he will jump at the chance to eat anything I toss at my chickens.  For that reason I wanted to try Newman's own because it is organic and has all the good things a dog should have, and I felt he should be able to have something good for him other than meat.          When Amazon offered this to me to review for all of you. I jumped at the chance for my dog to give it a try. When this arrived it came in a large bag, I thought this would have been a tiny little bag of treats, it was not,  the treats inside were very large 2 1 4" long and about 2" wide and about 1 2' thick. It also had a nice crease in the middle to  ak it in half if  you choose to give a smaller treat. As most treats they smell awful but I guess a dog would like that.          I gave my dog, a constantly hungry Black Pug, a choice of his frozen treat in one hand and Newman's own in the other, he took a while but chose his treat.          I then gave him Newman's own treat and he took it but he sniffed at it for awhile.  Now he knows what it is. I then sat down at my laptop and he jumped up to be with me, he stared at the treat and I moved it toward him and nothing, I gave the OK command and he looked at it,  I had to pick it up and give it too him. Now it is a few minutes later, he is sitting here, the treat is on my leg and he is looking at it, oops just jumped off.     My dog, who will eat just about everything, just walked away from this treat.  He is not interested, I will not be buying this.  I will  ing it to the shelter for another dog.
