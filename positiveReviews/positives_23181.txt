Since my husband was diagnosed with Celiac, I've become quite the gluten free baker. I've collected all the ingredients to make great cakes from scratch, however baking  ead is a totally different thing. Anyway, the entire line of Pamela's gluten free, wheat free flours are fantastic. I love making pizza with this flour. It's gives a fluffier and slightly sweet crust. The trick with this pizza dough is to bake it 'til it's slightly  own before you put the toppings on. you'll get a very crispy crust. I also have fun with her suggestion of adding herbs to the flour while mixing. I also sprinkle herbs on with a little olive oil before the first bake.  I use this flour weekly for focaccia...Oh, and no eggs!
