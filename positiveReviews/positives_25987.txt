This is by far the best tasting "junk food" snack I've ever put in my mouth. I had heard a lot about this from my friends but hadn't tried it myself. Fortunately for me, I could lay my hands on a small packet and that was it. No other commercial snack (yep! homemade snacks by mom are the best in the world, this comes second) comes even close to the great taste of Pirate's Booty. It indeed felt like I got hold of some great booty when I tasted it. Get it, you won't be sorry.
