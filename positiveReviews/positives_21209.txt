Bought this along with the Yogourmet yogurt maker.  (In retrospect, I probably didn't need to buy it separately because there was a package deal that included it).  The starter makes amazing yogurt, but it seems like it takes a long time to get going when starting with the starter, rather than saving yogurt and using that as a starter.  So, I'd recommend using this to start the culture, but then using yogurt from then on.  The probiotic blend does take longer and you have to start at a lower temperature, but the flavor is great and the health benefits are even better.  Oh, yeah, it's important to note that for 2 quarts of yogurt, you have to use 2 packets  something that isn't really mentioned, but each packet is only 5 grams.
