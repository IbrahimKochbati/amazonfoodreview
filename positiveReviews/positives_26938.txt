This is really good jerky. The pieces are nice and thick and have just enough gristle in it to leave you with something to chew for a while. That's half the reason I like jerky. This actually helps the bag last longer since you don't rush right onto the next piece! It has a barbeque coating with a good flavor and a semi spicy after bite. The pieces are thick enough that they don't disintegrate in the bag so that the last half of the bag isn't smaller "crumbs". I'd buy this again and as a matter of fact I think I will right now!
