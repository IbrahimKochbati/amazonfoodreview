Purchased Pu Erh tea online, after watching Bryce Wilde on the Dr. Oz show. I am such a fan of this tea. I haven't had coffee in 2 months, nor do I miss coffee. There is no stomach upset, no bloating with this tea. I drink 2 large cups after  eakfast, and I find that I have no stomach distress at all.          It's wonderful hot, and it's excellent as an iced tea, with a shot of Stevia and lemon. It contains caffeine, though there are no "coffee" jitters to speak of. This tea is also known to reduce cholesterol. I am looking forward to my blood test results this November when I see my Dr.
