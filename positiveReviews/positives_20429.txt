I'm sick and tired of people reviewing the wrong product or company. You don't know how bad it affects their reputation when you rate the wrong product. Reread and make sure you are reviewing the correct item. If it wasn't for AvoDerm Vegetarian canned food, my dog wouldn't be eating right now and she'd be eating meat that makes her scratch like there's no tomorrow. I'm only giving 4 stars only because I'm afraid this product is starting to get obsolete and will discontinue which will make it extremely difficult finding something else for my dog to eat...
