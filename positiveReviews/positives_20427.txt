Bought this to use in a batch of mead, but of course I had to taste a little sample. Mild flavor with slight fruit notes and a wonderful aroma. Slightly darker amber color should work well as I am adding 2 bottles of black cherry juice concentrate for a batch of cherry mead....yummm....     Y'all can put it on toast, I'd rather drink my honey...  Huzzah..
