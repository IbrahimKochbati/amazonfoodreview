These B&W cookies are good. They arrived quickly as expected. The texture of the cookies is light and airy. The flavor is not too sweet with a hint of real lemon. The icings stayed perfectly in place and were made with delicious, quality ingredients.     We ordered these for our daughter. She was delighted.
