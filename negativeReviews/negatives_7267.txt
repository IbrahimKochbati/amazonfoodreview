My two cats are both over 10 yrs of age   and they are different in how they eat   but one thing is for sure   they don't and can't digest CORN!!!  My Russian Blue cat, Katie   got sick EVERY TIME she ate. They don't get outside   so they needed more protein in the diet   and even though it seems like a good food ( I was hook line and sinker too)   it is not worth it when my cats are constantly throwing up five minutes after eating it.  So   it was time for a change.  Read your labels carefully!!  They need MEAT   PROTEIN!   not corn!
