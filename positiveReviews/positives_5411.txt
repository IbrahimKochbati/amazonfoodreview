These cups are usable as stated.  They are exactly what I was looking for which was a less expensive method to have coffee.  They do leak slightly but not too bad. Not sure if it makes the hole's a little larger than the prepackaged cups.  But on the high side, I do get the have the coffee that I want, the way I want it. Which is great.
