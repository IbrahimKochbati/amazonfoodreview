I love the RiceSelect blends.  I have tried four of them including this Royal Blend and find each of them unique, adaptable and delicious.  I make them in my rice machine and they come out perfect every time.  I use them as side dishes and in casseroles and find they add zing to every meal.  I  ought a casserole with this blend to a potluck supper and every single grain and berry was gone at the end.  It was a big hit.  If you want to try something different from regular  own or white rice, give RiceSelect Royal Blend a whirl.  I'm betting you enjoy every morsel.
