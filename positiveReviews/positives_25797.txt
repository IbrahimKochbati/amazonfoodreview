I love Tully's coffees. I usually drink French, sometimes Kona, and recently I tried Italian. I thought at the time I had not tasted anything so good! It was my new favorite. It turns out that I need to switch things around. When I do that, they all seem to taste better. The Italian may not be as bold as the French or Kona, but it sure tastes good. I'll be keeping it on hand along with my other favorites.          UPDATE: I just had several cups of Tully's Italian Roast K Cups after being out of it for several months. I remember now why I never wanted to be without it. It's really good.
