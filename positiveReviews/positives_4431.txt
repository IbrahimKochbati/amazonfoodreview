I wanted to give homemade vanilla extract as gifts and was extremely satisfied with these beans. They made very high quality extract and were much cheaper than at local grocery or organic food stores. I was mildly concerned by the size; I only needed 24 beans, and ended up with closer to 50. However, my  other has used the remainder to make delicious vanilla ice cream, creme  ulee, tiramisu, custard, vanilla sugar, french toast, etc. I have recommended them to friends and family.
