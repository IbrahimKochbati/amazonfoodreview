I bought this rub at a food show in DC recently and have been absolutely hooked ever since. My girlfriend and I work long days and don't have much time to prep dinner, so it is nice to know I can come home, sprinkle some of this on a piece of meat, chicken, veggies or whatever, throw it in a pan and have a freaking amazing tasting dinner with little to no effort.  Needless to say, it didn't take long for me to burn through my first three cans and now I am back for more.  Thank you Rub Joe!!
