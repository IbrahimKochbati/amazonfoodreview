I am usually not big into ramen noodles, especially the one's with extra veggies or sides. I always get the chicken and nothing else. I decided to try this one because of the Chef's Best stamp. I tried this and i must say it wasn't bad at all. I didn't realize it would have real chicken bits in it, carrot, and other veggies. The taste was good, i did add a little tony's seasoning salt (that's just me i add it to almost everything). Overall i was surprised, but in a good way. It was quick, the directions simple and easy, was a huge serving, i couldn't finish it all, and was just as good as the ramen noodles chicken that i usually eat, if not better.
