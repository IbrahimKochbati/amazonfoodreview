I'm not a huge flavored coffee fan. Usually I prefer lattes with flavored syrups. A friend sent me a K Cup to try and the smell was mouth watering before it even finished  ewing. The flavor was strong enough to drink it only with milk; I added a little vanilla syrup when I reheated it. I am not a coconut fan but the flavor is barely there. It is just a unique taste for when you're in the mood for something different!
