My review is of the Strawberry Melon flavor only. I did not try the other flavors in the variety pack as I puchased mine individually.          I don't usually drink these types of beverages, nor do I drink much soda. I generally dislike overly sweet, artificial ingredient laden stuff. Quite by chance I tried a Strawberry Melon FUZE slenderize beverage and really liked it.          What I liked most was the pleasing flavor and the absence of sugar, although it does have sucralose as a sweetener (rather than aspartame). It was not overly sweetened and the blend of strawberry and melon flavor was for me perfectly balanced; I could clearly distinguish both flavors.  FUZE was really tasty, no strong aftertaste and no sugar "heaviness" in the mouth. It was honestly the first time I've had this type of beverage other than a Snapple Tea beverage that I would purchase again.          I'm a little skeptical of the benefits of the micro nutrients that are added to this beverage; L Carnitine, Super Citrimax and Chromium. Perhaps it's a bit more marketing hype rather than beneficial. Nonetheless, I found this beverage to be refreshing, tasty and something I would buy again.          It is a little bit pricey though. Compared to a 12 pack of store  and Diet Soda, which in my neck of the woods ia around $2.99 or a little over $.02 ounce, FUZE beverage is priced $24.99 for 15 18.5 ounce bottles, or a little over $.09 ounce. That makes it more than 4 times as expensive as the store  and diet sodas.          In spite of the price, I would buy this again and would justify the price by considering this more of a treat rather than a water substitute.          5 stars.
