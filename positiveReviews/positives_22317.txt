I use this soup as part of my daily effort to control my type 2 diabetes. It is tasty and filling and doesn't spike my blood sugar.  For a little extra treat, I add a little more grilled chicken and some crispy red or jalapeno peppers. Love it so much, I have 24 cans automatically shipped every month (and save money over supermarket prices!)
