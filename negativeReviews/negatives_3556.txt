I'm used to eating crispy and crunchy cereal snack bars, so the Whenever bars were a surprise.  I still prefer a crunchy snack, but these are good for those who like their snacks soft.  They're not too dry, and many of the ingredients are organic.  You can see the chocolate chunks, but the overwhelming taste is coconut.  One family member said that she could taste the chocolate, and that it was moist  not like the dry bars.  It's not pretty, but it seems to be healthy.
