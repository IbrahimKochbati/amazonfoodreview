I just received this tea and I'm trying to drink a couple of cups per day to see if it has any effect on my BP. So far so good.  To enhance the flavor of this rather sour tea, I've added some Teavana Orange Blossom Herbal Tea, or Peach Bloom Rooibos Tea.  These combinations make the hibuscus tea quite enjoyable to drink.  I'm sure there are many other teas that would complement the Davidson hibiscus.
