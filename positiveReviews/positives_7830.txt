my husband loves pork rinds, i however was freaked even thinking about "deep friend pork skin" but i am always willing to try new things so over the years i have choked down countless  ands of pork rinds to appease my husband.          one day i was at work (at a hotel) and i notice over on the snacks for sale shelf microwaveable pork rinds. i was like WTF you gotta be kidding me, so being the good wife i am i buy them (more as a joke than anything else) for my husband well he zapped them bad boys and started happily munching away, oohing and ahhhing over how good they were, so i tried one (i refused to tell him that it was pretty good)..over time i bought him more, even ordering them thru the hotel (ya employee discount!!) and he noticed that i would ever so casually walk by and snatch one from his bag. finally i gave up and just made myself a bag. i am now hopelessly addicted however no longer work for the hotel so i needed a new supplier....lol          our microwave has a popcorn button, on a whim i gave it a shot figuring it would be a microwave disaster, much to my surprise i got PERFECT bags of porky crunchy goodness EVERY TIME, and when i say perfect i mean not one single under done or burn piece. for the life of me i cant figure out HOW the microwave can use the same button to make popcorn and the pork rinds so perfectly. but i chalk it up to magic          be forewarned if you have dogs.....these are doggy crack, (yes i know...don't give the dogs people food...yadda yadda) i am convinced if you waved one of these little buggers in front of your dog and told him to speak, he wouldn't bark, he would recite Shakespeare. i have never seen my dogs go that crazy over ANYTHING else
