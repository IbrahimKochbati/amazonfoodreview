These are the same product as the Bite Size in the smaller blue bag except that they're longer links and vary in length.          The ingredient list is somewhat gross as it lists specific parts of the pig.  If you can get past that, the taste is unmatched!          The Slim Jim ingredient list was similarly disturbing to me as Slim Jim has, as separate ingredients "chicken" and "mechanically separated chicken."  I don't understand why one or the other doesn't cover both.
