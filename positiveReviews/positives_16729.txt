I hate to rave about this stuff because I think if everyone finds out how good it is for the price, especially Subscribe and Save price) they will want to buy it and someone will want a bigger profit and so up goes the price.  This order has two jugs of nector and one of them refills a wine bottle to the top with a little left over.  I put it in the wine bottle with a pour spout and keep it by the stove for easy access and with that and the honey there is no need for sugar in the kitchen.  This light Agave Nector is really delicious and way better than the two local Florida sugar growers who are now getting into the Agave business.  Highly recommend.
