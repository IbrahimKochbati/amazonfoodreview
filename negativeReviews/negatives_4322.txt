I'm trying to cut sugar out of my diet and more importantly, I'm getting rid of Aspartame.  That stuff is a neurotoxin and I'm suffering from some of the long term health effects of that poison.  I had high hopes for beverages using the new Stevia extract and tried the Other  and with the Stevia ingredient.  The other  and is a little pricey, so I thought I would try this one too. The other  and, outside of the price was a very pleasant experience.  Keeping in mind that this is the only flavor I tried of this  and,  I can't comment on the Blue Sky  and as a whole, but in this one instance, I have to say it sucks.  The initial taste in unpalatable and the after taste is even worse.  I tried six cans over the course of a week (hoping my taste would acclimate)  and ended up pouring the rest down the drain.  It doesn't taste like a beverage.  I'm not sure what the taste reminds me of, but I definitely cant drink it.  Sorry for the harsh review, but this stuff is awful.
