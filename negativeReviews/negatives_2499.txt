The coffee is overall OK.  I had to make it strong for it to taste good. When made weak it wasn't very good. My spouse didn't like it however I made it (personal taste). I used whole beans in a Breville YouBrew grinder coffee maker. I'm glad that I tried it as Kona blend is suppose to be very good. Three stars!
