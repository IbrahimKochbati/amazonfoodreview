I love Eclipse gum  it keeps my mouth fresh, and tastes great. However, packaging is everything. I find that the flat packs with foil wrap give a gum that has way more flavor and lasts longer than the plastic containers such as this. There is a very noticeable difference in taste between the two; however, this "economy pack" still tastes good, and usually saves you money. By the way, whatever happened to the cherry flavored version of Eclipse?
