Really delicious and sooooo chocolately! Just like the real thing. I adjust the ratios of milk and mix to my liking and ignore the instructions on the back. You can also get alot more than 1 drink per package if you drink a normal sized glass (I get 3 shakes per pack at about 16 oz. per shake). Really good! A must try at least once in your life!
