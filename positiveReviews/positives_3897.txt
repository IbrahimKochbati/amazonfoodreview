This is my favorite coconut water! Having traveled in Asia and being able to get someone to climb a tree to harvest a coconut and then open it with a machete, nothing I found in the store came close... until I found Taste Nirvana. The other  ands are mostly from Brazilian coconuts, whereas this  and uses Thailand coconuts and it makes a difference.  Truly happiness in a bottle. It's a little pricey, but I can't get enough!
