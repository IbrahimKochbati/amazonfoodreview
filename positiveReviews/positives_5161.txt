I was really looking forward to this beverage, as I love tangerine juice and the thought the combination of orange, tangerine and carbonated water would make for a great soda.          I have to say, it is different, but not what I expected. While it was different than a typical orange soda, I didn't find it THAT different, either in sweetness or taste. I probably prefer it to traditional orange sodas and I believe it to be vastly superior to many supposedly "natural" sodas, but I was surprised how similar it really is to artificially flavored drinks. A bit more (maybe a lot more) orange and tangerine juice would be good.
