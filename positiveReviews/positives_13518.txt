I was surprised to find grandmas chocolate online lol, especially because this delicious product originated from Mexico. My mother used to give it to my  others and me often enough, its part of our family you can say.  I have not found a chocolate that has a similar flavor whatsoever,this is the best chocolate, i highly recommend it, you'll  be surprised at the great lavor it has....salud!
