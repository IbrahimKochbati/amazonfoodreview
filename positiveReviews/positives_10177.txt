so happy that this worked! she loved it and wanted more. Now I will finally be able to know if her arthritis medicine actually works! I will probably be using half of one, to make it last longer. I used this for a pill not a capsule, so not sure if she would've swallowed a capsule.          UPDATE: Warning: do not allow your dog to see you put the pill inside. Once my dog saw me do this, she refused to eat it. They are smarter than we give them credit for.
