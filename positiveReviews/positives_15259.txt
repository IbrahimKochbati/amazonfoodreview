My kid loves this stuff.  Since it comes 16 packages at a time, I have several packages leftover and now that he's almost 2, I still give it to my kid as a big appetizer while we order and wait for the food to come at restaurants.  He still loves it (despite being able to eat all sorts of "regular" food).  Much better than just loading up on tortilla chips at Mexican restaurants!
