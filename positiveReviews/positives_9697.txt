My 12 year old golden has a new life with this food.  She had a lackluster appetite before Merrick came into our home.  I found it at a local organic pet store.  Their price was ridiculous   nearly $3 per can.  I bought a few to try    I was amazed at the results!  I haven't seen my 75 lb. dog jump vertical with glee in many years.  I mix it with her dry food.  One can will last 3 4 days.  The difference in her level of activity and enthusiasm is unbelievable!  I went to the local store to negotiate their price on buying bulk based on what I could get it on line and the best they could do was a 10% discount.  Needless to say, this seller has a customer for the life of my dog.  Kudos to improving our quality of life at a reasonable price.  This food is so great, I have been tempted to taste the spoon!
