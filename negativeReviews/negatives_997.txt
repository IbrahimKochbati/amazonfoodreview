I have been Gluten Free Since 2003 and this is I think the worst tasting GF mix I have come across. I have found all to have their own pros and cons but this one have very little to  ag about. I appreciate the effort anyone puts into a GF product but I couldn't buy this one again. It was like eating reconstituted potatoes that lookes like pancakes. No butter or gravy, just dehydrated spuds. The only real good thing to speak of was the texture. It was light and moist but I would have to seriously alter the recipe to add flavor.
