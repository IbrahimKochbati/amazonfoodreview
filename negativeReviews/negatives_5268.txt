Are your cats getting sick? Mine were vomiting and I finally traced it back to the salmon cat food.  But it's not the salmon, it's the dye they put in the salmon. Some cats simply can't tolerate it.  Three of my seven were that way.  If you see this happening, there's a pretty good chance that your cat has an intolerance to the dye as well.
