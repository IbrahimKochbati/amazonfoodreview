I have purchased this product for many years in local stores, and love it!  However, I can't seem to find it readily available locally any more, so I decided to purchase this online.  The product itself is great; makes the best guacamole I've ever had, but paying $6.00 for one package is outrageous... and just plain wrong!!!  I made the mistake of purchasing this item 'assuming' that they had just left off the point that this price should be for 12 packages, like what is provided for the Spicy version.  Unfortunately, I found out to my dismay that they did truly charge me $6.00 for just one package when you can buy this in a store for approximately $1.00 per package.  I usually purchase online in the hopes of always finding a 'better' deal, well this is definitely not one!!  Again, this product is great, but look elsewhere to purchase...!!
