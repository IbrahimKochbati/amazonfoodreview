I first had these on a flight and I thought they tasted great. I wanted to purchase them but couldn't find them at the grocery stores I normally shop at. I ordered them here but then I found them somewhere else at a fraction of the price. In this order you get six 5 oz bags. If I want healthy, Amazon is is my only option overseas.
