Not impressed at all.  I guess if you are vegan or hippie then you might enjoy these, but to be honest, they are almost bland tasting and I am stuck with 19 more.  1 gram of protein? I wasn't buying these for the protein content, but seriously, 1 gram and they are gonna  ag about it on the package?  Having lived in Thailand for a few years, I really miss good tasting coconut and not these impostor "healthy" coconut bars or overpriced coconut water drinks.  Not even sure why I'm giving them two stars, except maybe because of their box and hyped up packaging.          **Updated** After a few more bars, they seem to taste better.  The first one I had looked yellow and I noticed some small oily stains on the box in which they come in.  The rest have been white and have taste.  Therefore, I am assuming the first one I ate that sucked, the packaging was not sealed properly and air was allowed in and oil out.  I've decided to not be so harsh on the grade now after consuming a few more bars.
