The shipping was very fast, but so was the expiration date.... got it on Feb. 14, 2012 expiration is April 4, 2012 (only 6 weeks before it expires).  Who can eat so much seaweed in such a short time??????  I should have returned it, but who wants to go through all the trouble.  Well I stuffed it all in the freezer and hope it will be still eatable.  That's what you get when you order food online.  I will not order it again!!!!
