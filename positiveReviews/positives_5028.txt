My 8 year old son has numerous allergies plus autism and these cookie bars are a life saver!  They're made with fruit juice as opposed to cane sugar, so I don't feel bad about giving them to him.  We've tried many gluten free cookies, these are by far his favorites!  Unfortunately the local stores don't keep them well stocked, so I'm glad I found them here.  If you're not used to gluten free products, you probably won't like them.  The texture is very different than wheat, but if you haven't had wheat in quite a while, these are very tasty and not as crumbly as other gluten free products.  They are fabulous cookies and I'm so glad Nana's makes them...don't ever stop!
