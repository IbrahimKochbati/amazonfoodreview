I purchased this blend in a local market in Philadelphia for my foodie husband. He loves to grill and is an immensely talented cook. I often try to find him different spices and rubs to cook with and this has been a knockout win. He said it is the favorite gift he has received from me in that this is a delicious and unique salt rub. Keep in mind we have been together for 8 years and this is not the first time I have ever bought him something to cook with. He was amazed at the moistness (spelling?) of it and can use the rub for anything. Now, he is trying to order more and I just saw that Amazon sells it online. Score!
