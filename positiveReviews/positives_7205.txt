This is the third Senseo  and coffe pod I have tried and it is my absolute favorite. I have tried Vanilla flavored coffees from several major gourmet coffee dealers and to me this coffee has the best Vanilla taste of them all. It is great to use in a single serve type  ew system or in a small 4 5 cup  ewer [which is what I use]. The pod makes cleaning the  ew basket a  eeze and yet there is sufficient amount of grounds to give a good strength to the  ew. I don't like my coffee as strong as some, so if I want more coffee I leave the pod in and simply run a quick second  ew cycle. If you like your coffee "normal" strength you would likely use a new pod for each cup  ewed. Also, this coffee is available in a "Subscribe and Ship Option", which is a wonderful way of assuring yourself of plenty of coffee at hand when you want it; just choose the frequency of shipment and leave it to Amazon!
