Who would have thought that my dogs would enjoy something that helps take care of them? The CETs work reasonably well at removing plaque from their teeth   though if you are expecting heavy buildup to disappear you will be disappointed.  Good way to maintain good oral hygiene between cleanings though.          If only I could get them to chew them longer...
