Tried this for the first time last night and it was excellent. I added  owned ground chuck and it was yummy! Just enough spice to tell it is chili but not hot at all. We are chili eaters so we didn't skimp on the bowl size but there was still enough for another meal left over. Hey, and if you like it hotter just spice it up yourself!
