Plant came packaged well. Good moist wrap around the root base and plastic wrap around the bulk of the plant. There were no  oken stalks and no dead pieces. There was no evidence of fungus or pests. However, the picture has a plant with 10+ stalks; I received a plant with 5. The plant seems to be in good health and I think I can get over the size issue...after all it will grow....I live in a mountainous area and don't get all day sun. I am putting the plant outside in the morning and inside for the nights...At night I am using a Miracle LED Grow Bulb...fingers crossed...
