I was always a fan of Dave's, so I bought this at a local store to try Blair's and I'm glad I did.  The jalepeno sause is very mild (for me) but one of the most delicious condiments I've ever tasted.  The Afterdeath is a bit painful, but still very tasty on rice & beans, burritos, or any chicken dish I've tried it on.  The Sudden Death kicked my ass when I underestimated it, but now a few drops in a dish or pot are just right if I want heat without changing flavor much.
