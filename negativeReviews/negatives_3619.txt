Well this review is specifically for the Sea Salt flavor of these chips. I so wish I had tried another flavor, Dill or a couple others sound good but I will never know. I am not a fan of the flavor I had. Or better yet the lack of flavor. These tasted like health food more than I had hoped ( Like rice cakes ) and I wanted to write a 1 star review but felt it somewhat dishonest as the other flavor may be ok, others seem to like these but I will never try another and still have so many bags left. Grrrrr
