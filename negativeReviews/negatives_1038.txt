I have a pretty wide appreciation for acceptable coffee, but in my opinion, this stuff is mediocre coffee. I drink both regular and decaf on a daily basis and to me, this tasted like institutional cafeteria coffee. I am normally a fan of the "Swiss water decaffeination process" decaf coffees, and was disappointed by the quality of this "gourmet" coffee.          With that said, I did try this twice to give it a fair review. The first time I prepared it the same way I normally make my coffee (on the strong side), the second time I followed the directions exactly. Both times using filtered water and a quality coffee maker that uses the Melitta style (cone) filter. To my taste, it was stale and over ground (like the flavor was watered out of it and then over roasted and ground extra fine to try and put some flavor back into it), comparable in quality to low end bulk coffee. The  ands of decaf coffee I do like and  ew at home (Dunkin' and Newman's Own, to name only two) are in the same price range, and also purchased pre ground, but to me taste much smoother, and more full flavored. This coffee is not one I would make a point to purchase when there are better coffee choices for the same money  or cheaper coffee choices for the same quality.
