I am just passing along the 5 star rating from our three Miniature Schnauzers. This stuff is a big hit at our house. We give them each an easy to digest kibble that's good for them and put a tablespoon of Pot Pie on top. No more turned up noses now   they wolf it all down. Be sure to mix it up real good before serving.
