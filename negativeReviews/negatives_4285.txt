OK, I give up   what's the point of putting TWO servings in these cups?!     Doesn't that defeat the purpose of them? What are you supposed to do with the second helping   save it, or store it, or eat it, or throw it away?     Anyway, the taste is fine (thought still sweet)   but what's with the     "new bigger size"??! Who needs it?
