Very very good oatmeal. I bought this because I couldn't find the Apple cinnamon Kashi at my local store and thought maybe this would taste good even though it doesn't have anything in it (Amazon says it has raisins in the description, no it doesn't.). Anyways this oatmeal is very good, it's not overly sweet at all like Quakers oatmeal, but it's still sweet and not bland. I add my OWN raisins to this to get some extra texture in there and it works out great. It's way better than the apple cinnamon kind.
