About ten years ago my wife and I stayed at a small resort near Domenical, Costa Rica.  Lizano was on every table in the restaurant.  We were quickly hooked.  Lizano goes great with eggs, beans, rice, tortillas, pork, fish, etc.  It's really tasty and nothing taco sauce or steak sauce.  We're on our second case now.  Give it a try.
