There are things that I recall from my childhood that I would rather not   being stung by a bee, chicken pox, all the attempts to learn to ride a bike before I actually learned to ride it, and Tang.  Tang was that chalky, never quite dissolved in the water, powdered drink that schools and company picnics would try to pawn off on kids as Kool aid.  It wasn't Kool Aid by any stretch of the imagination   it was Tang.  I've never heard anyone ASK for Tang... it was just what was there.          So I get my can of Switch in the mail, eyeball the can... it's the same size and shape as an energy drink can... one of those "single shot" type cans.  Fearing that it was an energy drink I checked the label... says it's pretty much all juice, carbonation, and some natural flavors (including soy?!?) so I pop it open and take a swig.          Now it MAY be 100% natural juices with some natural flavoring   but I know Tang when I taste it.  This is carbonated Tang... I know it is.  Somewhere out there is a giant warehouse filled with cannisters of powdered Tang and someone thought to themselves   what do we do with all of this stuff?  I know, mix it with carbonated water and voila! Now it's not Tang, it's Switch!          In all honesty there are probably people out there who will love this drink   but for the price they are asking and the small size of the can   I would suggest whipping up your own Tang with fizzy water.          Pros  Pretty much all natural   Juices, natural flavors and no unnatural dyes (good for the ADHD kids).          Cons  I personally didn't care at all for the taste, a bit overpriced for what you are actually getting, can will trick many into believing they are buying an energy drink.
