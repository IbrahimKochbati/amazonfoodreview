Over the years, I have become an expert on chocolate covered raisins. For something so simple, it's surprising how difficult it is to find one that is truly exceptional. In some, the chocolate is too waxy and tasteless. In others, the raisins are too small or dried out. Kirkland chocolate covered raisins are just right. The raisins are large and moist, and the chocolate is high quality. I used to think that  ach's made a good one, until I had these.          If you or someone you know is a chocolate covered raisin fan, this is one you must try. The tub is huge and the price is less than boutique chocolatiers want for a small bag of theirs. It is an outstanding value and I doubt you will be disappointed.          I have no affiliation with Kirkland or anyone else. I'm just a chocolate raisin fan who knows when he has a great raisin...and these are truly wonderful.
