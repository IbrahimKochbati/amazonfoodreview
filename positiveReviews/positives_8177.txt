I use this low sodium seasoning blend all of the time. I just add it to a dish at the end of preparation for a punch of flavor. The roasted garlic is milder than fresh, so you don't have to worry about the usual raw garlic flavor, which makes it perfect to sprinkle over soups, salads, baked potatoes, dips, etc. It has it onion, red and green peppers, and additional ingredients in it.          5 6 12 Still an excellent product, but not worth the new price. I will not be reordering.
