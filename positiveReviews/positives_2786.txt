Great value and much superior to what you find in stores. Makes a great snack or after dinner treat, but for those who are health conscious remember to keep it to a few pieces since they are covered in thin sugar. Try to keep the bag tightly sealed once you open them since the slowly begin to dry up. Will be ordering more soon :)
