Many years ago I tried my first Chai at Border's book store, they had their own  and and they even sold a tin of the powder, I loved it.  Then they quit making it.  I tried chai at all different kinds of coffee shops and cafes and did not like it.  I don't drink coffee or tea but I love a good, creamy chai.  I came across this chai and decided to try it.  It tastes almost exactly like the chai I used to love.  Now this is my favorite kind and I have it on autoship so I never run out.  I usually drink one mug a day.  I put almost 2 scoops, add a little almond milk...just enough to cover the powder, stir it up then add hot water.  It's my comfort drink.  I'm trying to wean off it because of all the sugar but it's so yummy it's hard to give up!  Maybe in the summer when it's hot I won't want it everyday.
