   class "tiny"  Length:: 1:01 Mins              Tucker was nervous about this toy at first (as you'll see in the video) but really warmed up to it quickly and has enjoyed gnawing on it.  However, this has not worked very well for us as a treat dispenser.  I consider Tucker to be quite a clever puppy, but after fiddling with the tug a jug for a couple days, he just began  inging the thing to me and dropping it at my feet for me to dispense the treats for him.  (I suppose that may be evidence of just how clever he is!)
