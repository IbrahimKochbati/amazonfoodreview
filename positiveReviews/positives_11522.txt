I like this version of the crystal light lemonades the best. It has more of an authentic taste to it. The only problem is that when I compare the flavor of the canister pack product to the on the go packets, the canister seems a little weaker and more acidic. Maybe it's just my imagination, or it could be the concentration although I follow the directions for both products. I would recommend this product for lemonade lovers above any others though. It is tangy, not syrupy sweet. Yum.
