Compared to pho I've had at restaurants, Annie Chun's doesn't hold up. I'm not even going to bother. But compared to other instant noodle soups, Annie Chun's is light years ahead.          The noodles are soft and moist in the package   not fried and dried. The sauce is liquid and just oily enough. And there is a healthy packet of dehydrated veggies. The instructions do involve giving the noodles a soak and then draining. This can be a hassle where the best you can manage at work is to heat a mug of water in the microwave. I'm going to have to drain the noodles in the bathroom. Yech... But the extra step will be worth it. And unlike other instant cups of soup, I actually feel satiated after eating   not just buzzed from the sodium!          I'll definitely be getting more of these!
