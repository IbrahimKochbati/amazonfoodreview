Our cat practically raced over to the food dish to sample this, and ate with intent devotion. This cat food is definitely a taste winner. I also like the fact that this package doesn't have tuna    which cats like but to which it's said they can become addicted.          Not sure what else to say. The Petite Cuisine website is quite convincing about the nutritional value and careful screening of ingredients. The small cans mean the food, once opened, says fresh enough under refrigeration to appeal to the cat the next day. If you can afford it, this is a great cat food.
