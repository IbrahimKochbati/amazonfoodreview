In fact, I did not like the artificial taste in this orange drink. The degree of carbonation is alright and it does have an "orangey" taste to it. But I cannot ignore the artificial taste that accompanies this beverage. For now, I would stick with plain orange juice or other orange sodas like "Crush".
