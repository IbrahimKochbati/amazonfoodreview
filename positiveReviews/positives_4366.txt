As a person who has metabolic syndrome (and my roommate has insulin resistance), we both always have to watch our carb intake.  Giving up foods such as pasta, potatoes and most  eads has been a very difficult, but also a very necessary part of my life over the past several years.  I've tried lots of other low carb crackers (including other Wasa crackers), but they've just been so so.  About six months ago, I picked up a Wasa Crisp 'n Light cracker for the first time and WOW, what a taste!  Spread a little bit of Earth Balance on it, or some low fat cheese and it's absolutely melt in your mouth delicious!  I'm so glad that I can get a case every three months through my Amazon subscription.
