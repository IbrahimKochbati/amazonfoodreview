Pirate's Booty is sooo delicious. I could eat it all day long. Whenever I  ing a bag into work, everyone asks for some. It tastes like white cheddar rice cakes, is the consistency of light, fluffy cheese puffs and actually looks a little bit like packing peanuts. My boyfriend loves it too even though he normally won't eat anything that's too healthy (he can't stand granola bars), so I just don't mention to him that it's gluten and cholesterol free and made with all natural ingredients.
