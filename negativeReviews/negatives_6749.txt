I purchased because I could no longer find the Target Archer Farms kettle corn flavor in my local store or online. This was not bad and much better than the stuff I'd purchased in my local grocery store, but not quite as good as the Archer Farms.  The only thing that was a bit of an annoyance was that it is very fine powder so it makes a mess when shaking onto your popcorn. Also the sodium is a little bit high per serving (75 milligrams per 1 4 tsp).  I wish that information had been in the description before I ordered it.  If you can tolerate the sodium this a great find and I would rate this 4 stars.  If you are watching your sodium then this may not be the product for you.  The 1 4 tsp serving size is not enough for 3 cups of popcorn.  For the sodium content & annoying messiness, I rate this 3 stars.
