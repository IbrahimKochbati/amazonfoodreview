This dog toy puzzle comes assembled (which I completely appreciated) and was easy and straight forward to set up for our two dogs. It truly put our Rottweiler's problem solving skills to the test and proved to be quite interactive and entertaining for our German Shepard. Colorful and easy to store, the Star Spinner has been a good addition to our household.          This is a social writeup!
