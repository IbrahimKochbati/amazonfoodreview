My dog are so uninterested in this that it might as well be invisible.  I even put liver treats in it and tried to show them how to play with it.  Neither dog would bother with it at all. (One is Female 4 yr old greyhound lab shephard mix, other is female 4 month old lab border collie mix   both are very playful & love treats)     Very disappointed.
