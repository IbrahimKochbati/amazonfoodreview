Tulsi is an Indian herb also known as Holy Basil (The Queen of Herbs). It is a different form of Basil than we use in the West.     In addition to having excellent vitamin and mineral content, Tulsi is an adoptogen.(An adoptogen helps the body adopt to stress  physical or mental.)     Organic India, a company who is helping and encouraging farmers in India to produce very excellent , organic products, has a line of Tulsi Teas out.Some are with green tea, some with black, some herbal only.All are wonderful.     IMO Chai Masala is the absolute best!     I was going through a very stressful downsizing move.And I absolutely CRAVED 3 mugs of this tea every day! I know it helped me sail through that move, even though I'm no longer young.          I buy my Tulsi Tea through Amazon because the price is better than at Organic India website, or the health food store.I buy Chai Masala by the case (6 boxes), and this further decreases the price.     I strongly recommend this tea nto anyone who'd like a very calming, centering, yet invigorating tea.
