I have a beagle and we have never bought a doggy puzzle for him before, so I was looking for something easy and also something that would make him use his great sense of smell. This puzzle is perfect! Although he figured it out in about 10 seconds, it is something that can be reused over and over again due to the 4 treat chambers. He never knows exactly where the treat went and sometimes I sneak one in while he's not looking, so later he will catch scent of it and retrieve it. It's very entertaining for both of us and I will definitely buy more dog puzzles in the future.
