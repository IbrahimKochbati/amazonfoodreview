I love coconut and chocolate, so to me, they tasted like Girl Scout Samoa cookies, sort of, and I liked them and would buy them to eat if I were just judging on taste.  Opinion was split among the rest of my family, with mostly the toddler and 5 year old thinking they were great, but the three older children and my husband all agreeing that they prefer other flavors of bars.  The basic sentiment was that they are not good enough to count as a candy bar, and not healthy enough to count as a health bar.
