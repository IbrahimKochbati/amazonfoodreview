These are DELICIOUS! My co worker was  inging these into work daily and I found myself stealing several pieces throughout the day from her stash. I finally decided to buy my own bag and have her steal from me for a change. They are so yummy and addictive. Nutritious too, but ONLY if you eat them in moderation but you are forewarned  once you pop, the fun don't stop! ;)
