The title says it all   if you want a cracker that doesn't interfere with the flavor of what you're topping it with, but also adds a delicate crunch, this is your cracker.          Recently at a friends house we were having some various crackers with a little butter and when I asked what the first cracker was, I was presented with a box of Kavli Crispy Thin crackers. The only way I've tried them so far is plain, buttered or with homemade cranberry jam and they're hard to put down.          I was a little surprised to see the other reviews  inging up the healthful aspects of these crackers as the two main reasons I love them so much have nothing to do with anything other than what I want out of a cracker   light, crispy texture and delicious flavor!
