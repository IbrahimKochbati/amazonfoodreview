These are excellent. They taste great and are just the right size.  Two can make an on the go  eakfast that is tasty and good for you.  The larger size  eakfast cookies are just too big. 2 of these are perfect.  My husband had gotten out of the habit of eating  eakfast  too much trouble  but since I bought these he is good about grabbing one or two on the way out the door.
