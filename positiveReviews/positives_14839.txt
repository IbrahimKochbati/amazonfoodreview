I was never much of a tea person.  My experiences with tea have been limited to Lipton, Community, some Bigelow, Celestial Seasonings and whatever  and that happens to be in use at the restuarants I visit.  With Rishi's Earl Grey, I ventured into my first loose leaf tea experience.          Culled from 1300 year old trees of the Yunnan mountain villages, this Earl Grey is strong, almost sweetened coffee like in taste.  If there's no coffee around, this tea would be my next choice.  It contains bergamot oil as well.  It has a stout aroma that hits you before you even open the inner lid of the container.          I highly recommend this tea to fans of dark teas in general, as well as folks like myself who are more familiar with coffee and biscuits than tea and crumpets.
