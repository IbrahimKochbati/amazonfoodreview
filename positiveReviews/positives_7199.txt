Just read the reviews that said it had a chemical taste   I totally disagree. I think it tastes wonderful! I guess its all a matter of personal preference. I love it so much, I cant go back to the regular unflavored coffee. The only thing that's too bad is that it's artificially flavored. I care not because of the taste, but because artificial flavors are probably not too good for me. But I love the taste anyway! Senseo could easily use natural vanilla flavoring, it is probably more expensive, but they should do it anyway to give their customers a better product. Unfortunately too many companies today use non natural ingredients in the quest for larger profits, which is a sad commentary. Senseo, you need to start using natural vanilla flavor instead of artificial for the health of your customers.          But I still love the taste and cant drink any other coffee! The Senseo coffee in general is so wonderful. I've gone through two machines already. The frothiness of Senseo coffee is so delightful...its like cappacino froth only better. I use Silk Vanilla creamer too which gives it an even better taste (their product DOES have the natural vanilla flavor so maybe that is helping with the taste.) Then I always top off my coffee with cinnamon sprinkles which makes it even more wonderful!          All in all, a great coffee and coffee system, just please start using natural flavor Senseo, for the health of your customers! You would probably have even more customers if you did. :)
