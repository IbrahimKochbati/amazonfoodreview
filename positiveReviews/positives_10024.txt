This is a good coffee for people who don't like their  ew all that strong.  A friend who likes the lighter roasts loved this  and, and went ahead and bought his own 3 pack.          Personally, I need more flavor and body in my morning cuppa coffee.          This grind did work well in DSY "pods" such as Keurig.
