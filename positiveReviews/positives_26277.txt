Very expensive, fun and easy to make,candy, my children had a lot of fun doing it, the candy tasted very good (I had to wrestled a piece away). I wish they will sell it locally. The item came on time. The instructions are in Japanese but just follow the pictures and the water levels are mark in the mold.
