It's really hard to believe how good this tastes for just 45 calories. To put that into perspective, 3 Tbsp of normal peanut butter is ~ 280 calories. The 5 grams of protein in it is just a bonus. I put it in protein shakes with a lot of other ingredients [...], and the taste still shines through and really improves the overall taste of the shake.          The only downside to it, if there is one, is that it is pretty expensive. Even if you buy the 12 pack at $70 with prime, that still works out to almost $0.40 per serving, which is pretty steep for peanut butter. However, if you are on a diet, this is a very calorically efficient way to get some solid flavor and a few grams of decent quality protein.
