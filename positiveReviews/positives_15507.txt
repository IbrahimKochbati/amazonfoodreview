I'm a novice when it comes to Bonsai. I have purchased an elm and juniper and both arrived well packaged and healthy. Actually, the packaging was a little tough because they were tightly wrapped with some kind of plastic wrap. And although I'm not an expert it's hard for me to testify that the juniper is actually 4 years old. To my amateur eyes it looks to be much younger.          The elm has lost a few leaves yellowing and falling but after a few Internet searches I learned why this is happening. The pots were as I expected and I believe them to be of nice quality. The box also had a green bottle of fertilizer which I wasn't expecting but it was nice and I appreciate it.          I think it would have been better if the seller would have included a complementary  ochure for Bonsai related products such as humidity trays. The reason I say this is because I am a novice and upon initially ordering I had no clue that such things were needed to help Bonsai thrive. At least with a complementary  ochure I could have looked through it and say "Hmm, what is a humidity tray for?" and would have gotten around to getting a few sooner.          I have had both Bonsai for almost two weeks and neither appear to be dying or on the fringes of dying. And considering this is Winter it's supposed to be the dormant season so I don't expect much activity until Spring.          I would buy again from this seller.
