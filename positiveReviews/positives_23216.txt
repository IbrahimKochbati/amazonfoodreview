When I was diagnosed with celiac disease I stopped eating  ead because it tasted so bad.  My friend Lois shared the  ead with me and it tasted like real  ead and it was soft.  At first they were out of pamelas and I tried a different  and but it wasnt so good.  I started getting it every 2 months but Iate it so quickly I get it every month.  I am anxiously waiting for the shipment to come because I am out of the  ead.
