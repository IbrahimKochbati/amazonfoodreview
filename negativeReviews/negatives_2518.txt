This is for the Health Valley Tomato Soup No Salt Added, 15 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12).  I purchased this specifically for a person with heart problems.  One of the problems with canned foods is too much sodium, so the No Salt Added is a good feature.  Another problem is cholesterol content.  The ad for this product states 0 mg cholesterol, which is a false statement.  Apparently the supplier did not update the ad when Health Valley changed their recipe for their No Salt Tomato soup and is now adding cholesterol.  The cans I received have a "NEW" on the label, which the can shown in the ad does not.  This is an honest mistake on the seller's part, but he should correct it, and he should list the true contents.
