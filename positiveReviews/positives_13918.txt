I've been buying this product for the last 4 years and have never waned in my love for it. Not only is it much more convenient than jarred peanut butter (MUCH easier to spread prepare and bake with especially) but it also tastes better to me; much more "peanut" flavor, not too sweet but always sweet enough, and with the option of sweetening it extra if you like. Plus you can't beat the nutritional stats on this baby. I'll never go back to regular peanut butter again!
