Saw these on Oprah and ordered them for Christmas gifts.  The packages are really ugly and cheap looking which didn't help when giving as gifts.  Saved 2 packages for our family Christmas Eve treats. I can't say they are horrible but it tasted like any old chocolate shake.  It has a very strong chocolate taste so I added more milk to tame the taste.  These are pretty exprensive so we expected better.
