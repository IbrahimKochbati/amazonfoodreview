PB is a major source of calories, so this is a pretty great idea. However, it's honestly just too expensive to purchase as a regular replacement for peanut butter. The taste is just OK: when mixed with water, it tastes vaguely like peanut butter, but it's tough to get a very similar texture. Mixed in protein shakes, though, it's absolutely great. I would buy it exclusively for that purpose if the price were a bit more reasonable.
