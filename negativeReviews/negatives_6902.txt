It's hard to describe the taste of this version of MiO (Green Thunder, originally 'Thunder Punch'). It tastes close to green apple, green Kool Aid, or a non carbonated green Monster energy drink. However, it's definitely better than its current counterpart Black Cherry in my humble opinion. While both have a syrup like texture, Green Thunder is much more enjoyable. Try small amounts in clear colored drinks such as Water, Sprite, or Sierra Mist.          Note, I had to dig on the internet to find the nutrient caffeine numbers since the nutrition facts per servings are based on percentages. However, besides having zero (0) of most common facts which MiO is  anded for (calories, sugar, carbs, etc.) and only 10mg of sodium, here's what I came up with for the caffeine and B complex:          Caffeine: 60mg (20mg less than Red Bull, and quite a few premium coffees)     B3 (Niacin)   10% daily value   1.8mg     B6 (Pyridoxine)   10% daily value   0.2mg     B12 (Cobalamine)   10% daily value   0.6Âµg (0.0006mg)     &lt;2% mixture of Taurine, Guarana Extract, and Ginseng Extract (Panax)     *Side Note: B vitamin consumption and overdose is really a non issue with over the counter mixtures. Over abundance in your system will usually be urinated out, and quite a few other energy supplements have 6000% to 8000% of daily value B vitamins (5 hour).          While it doesn't come too close to the effects of main stream energy supplements and drinks, it has about the same effect as a light homemade cup of coffee with B vitamins. It also doesn't add to you calorie count if you're mixing it with water during your morning and afternoon shifts at work. And furthermore, being in a convenient container, you can almost take it with you anywhere. Make sure you start out with small amounts if you're sensitive to caffeine.          Bottom line: Despite the price, I recommend trying this. Buy this flavor first (if you like the aforementioned described flavors).
