I have been searching and searching for a high end dog treat that one my dog would sniff and eat and two would eliminate or at least make bearable my dog's  eath.  I am happy to say I found it in Old Mother Hubbard's Gimme A Kiss dog biscuits. He loves these biscuits and I now love his  eath.  I noticed a change after the first biscuit. And as an added bonus the biscuits are made of all natural products.  I like knowing that my dogs diet is just as healthy as mine.
