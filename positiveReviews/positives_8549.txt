I have Celiac Disease and have tried several  ands of gluten free "bought" cookies as I call them.  I have always been disappointed and resorted to baking my own.  Although baking my own is fine, sometimes I would like the convenience of being able to have cookies on hand when the urge strikes, or to grab when I'm on the go.  I ordered a "case" each of the oatmeal and the sugar cookies and was very pleased with both of them, although I slightly favored the oatmeal.  I purposely tried to detect the usual "off taste" that I've found in other cookies   there is no "off taste" to either of these flavors.  Both cookies are crisp, just the way I like them....I have just one word for them "yummy"!
