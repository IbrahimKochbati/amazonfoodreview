I like oatmeal cookies but I prefer them to be more substantial than these.  That is, I prefer the type that are crunchy chewy that don't crumble as one takes a bite.          These were too dry for the moist cake type oatmeal cookies so they really do not fit into either category and the texture was odd.  The flavor was marginal, mostly just sweet with none of the toasty flavor I associate with oatmeal cookies.          I also do not like the long list of preservatives and unpronounceable ingredients.
