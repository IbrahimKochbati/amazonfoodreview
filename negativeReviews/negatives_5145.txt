I was very disappointed when this toy  oke in less than a week. It was advertised as being durable plastic, but it couldn't stand up to our beagle dropping it repeatedly to get the treats out. The plastic lid on the bottom cracked and  oke off less than a week after our dog began playing with the toy. The  oken plastic pieces are very sharp and would have been dangerous if our dog had not been supervised.
