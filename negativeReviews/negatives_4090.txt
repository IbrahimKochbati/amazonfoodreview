Pepperidge Farm Bordeaux cookies has my vote for the best cookies on the plannet.          Problem was in the shipping packaging, since in the 4 packs I've opened, I can count on 2 hands the number of whole (un oken) cookies I've gotten. Most of the cookies are in pieces as big as or smaller than a quarter.          I'd think twice about ordering cookies via the net.
