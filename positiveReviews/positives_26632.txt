This variety of Natural Balance LID Dog Food has completely solved our problems with diarrhea & ear infections for our 8 month old la ador retriever, & at about half the cost of similar variety of Hill's Prescription Diet. I would highly recommend it for dogs with similar problems related to food allergies.
