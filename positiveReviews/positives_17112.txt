I'm an older mother with my first child and I make all of my baby's food at home to avoid any unwanted ingredients and to make sure that my child has the freshest and best tasting food possible.  All his food EXCEPT for the NurturMe products that is!  I found their peas and apples while I was on vacation and was completely shocked at how fresh,  ight, and tasty they are.  I refused to feed my child that grey stuff that passes for canned baby peas even from supposed "organic" or healthy  ands because it isn't anything I would personally want to eat due to the processed taste and color.  As the other reviewer stated, I've honestly never tasted peas that were so fresh and sweet.  I would never have thought that dried baby foods would produce such a fresh looking and tasting end result, but they look and taste so much better than anything that is canned or in the plastic pouches.  I tried buying fresh or frozen organic peas myself and making my own pea puree but it never came out as nice as these.  When I used fresh or frozen peas my baby wouldn't eat them because I was never able to get the pea skins pureed fine enough and he kept choking and coughing while he ate them.  I make my own sweet potato, squash, blueberry, etc. but these are really the only green vegetables that he seems to love.  My only complaint is that they can be hard to find in supermarkets or big box stores.  Thanks Amazon for keeping them in stock.  And, yes, they are super handy for mixing into other foods or taking them on the go, but for me the main selling point of these is the fresh sweet taste which makes my baby scarf them down!
