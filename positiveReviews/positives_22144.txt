This item is great but when I saw that it was over $5 for one I assumed that it wouldn't only be 1 packet.  I couldn't imagine someone asking more than $5 for one packet!  I thought that it may be 6 packets or so.  I was wrong. I just received my order and boy do I feel like I got ripped off.  I paid $5 for one packet!
