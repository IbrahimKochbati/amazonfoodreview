We have used this for a few years. we do rescue dogs and get bite a few times, this stuff is the BEST, works better then anything else we have tried, faster healing, less or no scaring then anything else there is... Works on other wounds just as well. We now use nothing else but this. Great for a bug out bag, or a get home bag kit in your car. Heat don't bother this like other med's of this style.
