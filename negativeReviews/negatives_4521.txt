Our 15mo old daughter has really liked most of the other Happy Baby foods (she LOVES the Gobble Gobble & Mango Spinach Pear).  However, this one makes her throw up EVERY time!  She is not allergic to anything in the ingredients   I can only guess that the high tomato content is just too acidic for her tummy.
