My 4 1 2 month old 3.7lb yorkshire terrier LOVE!LOVE!LOVE Nature's Variety Medallions. So far he has tried the chicken and beef. He was a picky eater to begin with and was starting to get alarmingly thin because he won't eat his kibble. I tried topping it with different things like plain yogurt and nothing. He still won't eat his kibble. I decided to try the raw medallions and he eats with so much gusto! Also he has gained some weight (a great thing) and looks so much healthier now. His coat is looking better and better everyday. Also his poop is so much smaller. I noticed that the goop from his eyes is slowly disappearing. It is pricier than kibble, but for a tiny dog, it really is not that much. It is way worth the price. Will recommend to anyone who will listen.
