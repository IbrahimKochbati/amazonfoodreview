Just love this. I have been using it for several years. After having a very hard time finding this in any local supermarket, and then finding the price well over $5.00 per tube, this deal on Amazon was just great.          Amore Sun Dried Tomato Paste has a lot of that deep sun dried tomato flavor in a paste form. Very concentrated. You really only need a small amount to add to pastas, sauces, pizza. Great if you add to cream cheese with a little garlic powder, touch of salt for a lovely cheese spread. I make squash and use this as a base to add just that perfect amount of extra flavor to my dish!          The 6 tube deal including shipping is a great one!! I am going to see how long it takes me to go through these 6 tubes and then possibly add myself on to the auto ship list. That drives down the price even further. Thank you Amazon for adding this to your list of available items!!
