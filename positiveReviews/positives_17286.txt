I ordered this in spite of a negative experience I'd had with the Kung Pao Bowl. I'm glad I did. The texture of these noodles is much better, lighter and yet hearty enough to quench my appetite.          When you open this up, you unpack the soft noodles, pour hot water over them, and let them soften a wee bit in that hot water. Then you drain the water, add new hot water and the contents of both seasoning topping packets, then nuke the bowl for a couple of minutes.          What you end up with is a nice bowl of soup, chockablock with noodles, sliced scallions and bok choy, and a light beefy flavor with just a hint of sweetness. I'd like it to be spicier, but that's just me. I'm big on spice and ginger and would have made this nose clearingly intense if it were up to me! : )          Anyway, this one is a keeper. I will try other Annie Chun soups, since I now know I love her steamed rice and her pho soup.
