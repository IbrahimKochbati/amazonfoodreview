First, let me say, I do not consider myself to be a coffee connoisseur or snob. I do not have a refined pallet. But, I do enjoy a good strong cup of coffee. The Emerils bold is exactly what I was looking for. I know there are always those out there that say, "nowhere close to my custom grind and French press." But, I use the keurig for the convenience and variety. The emerils bold is perfect for what I want   a good strong cup of coffee to start off my work day.     ***********     Update 7 26 12     I've tried a couple other "bold" coffee's, just to compare. (Brooklyn Beanery Fugettaboutit and Jet Fuel)  Not all bolds are the same. The other bolds seemed more bitter. (Some people think that bitter   strong coffee. Not true, strong coffee   good coffee, bitter coffee   bad coffee.) I'm done experimenting with different  ands. For a good, strong cup of coffee, Emeril's Big Easy Bold will be my go to coffee from now on.          Also, I just want to make one more comment on defective K Cups. I see alot of reviews for both Emeril's and other K Cups saying saying that they are horrible because 1 in every 3 explode in their Keurig machine. My wife and I go through 60   70 K Cups per month, since December 2011. We've never had a problem with any of them. (when I say 60   70, they're not all Emeril's bold   we would be bouncing off the walls. We also use Caribou  eakfast blend, decaf, green tea, heral tea, and hot cocoa.)
