I have tried numerous dry cat foods, but the one my cats like best is the Goodlife Recipe! Not sure if it's the yummy aroma, or just the sound of it being poured into their bowls, but they sure come running!  I feed our cats canned food, but always have a bowl of dry food available. Some of our cats prefer dry food, and this recipe is a winner! I like the fact that it's high in protein and has fiber and veggies too.     Try it  you won't be disappointed!!     Pricing on Amazon is great, the automatic delivery is a godsend  and free delivery is a winner!
