The 21 ounce Pro Treat Beef Liver Treats are a great value and my dog loves them.  I just need to reach for the tub and she will sit and put up her paw.  I even cut them into tiny pieces sometimes and sprinkle them onto her food.  She gobbles up her food when I do that.  This size will last a while.
