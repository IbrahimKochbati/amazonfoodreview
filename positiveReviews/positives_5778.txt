One problem with fun sized bagged candies is that they are lots of small products in individual wrapping, that means that you have that many more changes of something getting squished or ruined. I've always wondered when they're cheaper than in regular stores or warehouses, if the quality is a little lower.          In this case I handed out a lot of the candies and while everything was eaten, there were some major problems with both of my bags of peanut M&Ms. Almost all of them were crushed and there were peanuts with a little bit of M&M stuck to them and then a lot of M&M dust. The snickers were not squished and the twix sticks were all intact, so not sure what happened.          That being said, these deals that Amazon are fantastic and they pack them very well. Definitely worth it if you need to buy it in bulk. Just, with all bagged candies, be forewarned that all the pieces may not come in totally intact.
