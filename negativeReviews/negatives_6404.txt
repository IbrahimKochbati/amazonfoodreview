My puppy loves these but after a couple of weeks he developed a bald spot on his chest.  I'm not sure if its the chews are not. I will have to discontinue them until we find out what is wrong. He really likes them though.  He is also on the castor and Pollux puppy food, but had not developed the skin problem til after I gave him the rawhide.
