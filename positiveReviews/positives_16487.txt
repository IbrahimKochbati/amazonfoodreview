When I first picked up my puppy, he didn't like any treats.  I was worried and asked  a co worker about what treats his dog likes.  He mentioned how much his dog liked the greenies.  I went to the store, picked up a bag and I have been giving my puppy a greenie ever since.  He LOVES them and his  eathe is much more fresh now.  His favorite treat.
