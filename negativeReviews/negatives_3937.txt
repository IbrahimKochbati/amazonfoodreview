This 8.3 Fl oz can packs a walloping 135 calories.  Switch's can claims that it contains no added sugar or corn syrup and provides 100% of one's daily Vitamin C; it is made with 100% juice plus carbonation and is all natural.          This drink cloyingly sweet and tastes like a kiddie drink (think dissolved lollipops). I prefer getting my Vitamin C from orange or grapefruit juice.  Lots of fruit juices are available that are natural, e.g., cranberry, apple, etc.
