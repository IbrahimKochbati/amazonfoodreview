I got this for my 60lb boxer mix as a replacement for smaller one he had managed to  eak by dropping it. It was great for a couple days, but after that he seemed to get frustrated & in a mere 24 hours, he had chewed through the much thicker rope on the new one, which he had never thought of doing on the old one.  Another new toy, doomed to failure.  &lt;sigh   oh well, at least I tried.
