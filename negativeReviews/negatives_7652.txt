The good thing about these cookies?  They have a lot of fiber.  The bad thing?  They have a lot of fiber.  As I chewed, all of that fiber made me think that I was eating sawdust.  The first ingredient on the list is whole grain oat flour.  Good.  However, the ingredient list is rather extensive and includes many different types of sugar in the form of sugar: fructose, invert sugar syrup, sugar, honey, corn syrup and  own sugar molasses.  Quite a variety of sugars there!  Which is interesting, since the cookie itself isn't very sweet.  Actually, the sweetness level is just right, in my opinion.          The total carbohydrate count for one cookie is 26 grams.  Total fat   8 grams.  Sugars   9 grams.  I'm not so sure that this is the healthiest option for a snack.  Probably a better choice than a candy bar since it has fiber, but not something you'd want to snack on if you're on a diet.          Bottom line?  The texture is very gritty and the taste is okay (not too sweet).  However, it is not a low calorie, low sugar snack.  If you're dieting, these probably wouldn't be a good choice.
