Im learning that Latin American and South American coffees have this distinct "coffee" caramelish finish.  As a Peets Coffee fanatics we learned that Weavers roaster was the roaster for Peet's and we are hooked !  I already reviewd the French and Organic blend, but I must say this coffee here is a perfect afternoon drink.     Met the weavers team at the Warner Brothers party and they gave me a half a pound of french roast.  Since them we are fans.     You wont be dissapointed !
