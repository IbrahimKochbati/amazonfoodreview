It's absolutely delicious.  This is the best cheesecake I have ever eaten.  I highly recommend it.  So, what are you waiting for?  Order it!          You can thaw out the slices the way I did if you like.  At 30% power, heat 4 slices in a regular microwave for about 55 seconds.  Don't cover them while you are doing this.  Plus, there are slips of paper between each slice, so you need not cut anything or worry about adhesions.
