While taste is OK it's simply using too many artificial colors (blue1, red 40, yellow 5, yellow 6   approved by FDA doesn't mean it's healthy) and other chemicals (BHT etc) to be used by children.     If you're going to eat it yourself   take your chances. But since there are many good and healthy alternatives   why bother?
