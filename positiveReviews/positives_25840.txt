The arrival of a K cup coffee maker in our home has been somewhat controversial because we didn't  ew a truly great cup of coffee for several weeks after we got it. We kept working through samples of different flavors, and finally found this.  To be honest, I still don't think it's truly great    not as good as what we were able to make before w a conventional drip coffee maker or French Press    but it's pretty darn good.  But measured against the rest of the field, it's the best we've tried, thus the high rating.
