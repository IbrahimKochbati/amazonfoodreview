I bought this for my 4 month old Frenchie and he just seems absolutely disinterested in it lol. The way the bottle is shaped along with the rope it's almost "by accident" that the treats come out. He plays with it for about 5 minutes but then goes back to his IQ TREAT BALL that I also bought on Amazon. I feel like you have to basically flip this bottle upside down and mess with the rope for it to come out and I don't see Jackson being able to do that. If the bottle is laying flat as in the picture, how does the treat come up the neck and out the hole? He does grab the rope and run around with the bottle but I can tell this is not his most favorite toy.
