On my third trip to work on Hawai'i (the island), Summer of 2010, I was determined to seek out the best Kona coffee. The $20 lb Morning Thunder at Costco was OK, but really not as good as the Guatemalan or Mexican coffees so common and inexpensive in my area, and certainly nothing to compare to Ethiopian Moka Sanani, which I felt to be the best when properly roasted.     I tried a lot of roasts from small farms, recommended by friends, purchased in small stores, studied on line...     I was getting closer, but the best of it was still a nice light little cup, like Tanzanian peaberry.     One day I was visiting some friends of a friend, sort of a community. It was lunchtime, and one of the guys asked if I would like a cup of coffee. I've been disappointed pretty regularly, but something in his eyes told me to say "yes". They poured it out of a big 5# bag and  ewed it in a big drip maker.     I had no particular expectations, but when I took the first sip I was immediately enchanted.     This is very good! I exclaimed. What is it?     "This is what we grow here, the B grade", he said...     I have been drinking a cup every morning since then, no matter what the distance, no matter what the price.     This is my new "best coffee in the world". There is even more complexity to the art of what they do growing and hand processing (and aging) these beans than you will ever find online. (And they only sell the "A grade")
