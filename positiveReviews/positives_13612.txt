Pricey, if you didn't read the side of the tin. These sachets are to be  ewed with TWO cups of water, not one. Therefore, you are getting 40 cups of tea with this tin. Hands down the best tea I've ever tasted. I like mine with a pinch of sugar or honey and cream. Just wish it was cheaper on Amazon, I get it at Woodman's Market for $5, every time, no price fluctuation like Amazon. I have a real sweet tooth and this replaces my late night urge to binge on chocolate. You will not be disappointed with this tea what so ever!
