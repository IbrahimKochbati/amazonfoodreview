Saw these chips about 9 months ago and bought the BBQ  at a Giant store in their organic section.     These chips are light but tasty and have a good BBQ flavor.     Of course they aren't  Herr's or Lays but a good for you substitute. These chips are popped like pop corn. The package explains the process.     Trader's Joe's, sells their version for $1.99 a dollar less than Giant but I swear they are the same chips with different names.     Try them.
