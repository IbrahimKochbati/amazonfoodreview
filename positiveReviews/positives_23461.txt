If you're looking for chai like you get from real tea stores this product is a great alternative to buying the expensive  ands.  If you're looking for the "chai" sold at gas stations, this is not it.  Be sue to add cream and sweetener for an autheic chai flavor.  To make this vanilla chai, just add vanilla creamer.  Tastes awesome.
