I usually do not like rice, and I have a husband who does. He has tried to feed me several types in the 7 years we have been together, to no avail. I do not like rice, I never have.          That is, until he came home with THIS rice... I LOVE it, I need it, I want it every day... And, whatever sticks to the pot a little, or what is left over, we feed to the dog, and he is used to good stuff too.     The dog eats it with as much gusto as I do.     Our 10 year old son who would eat white pasta with ketchup if he were allowed loves this rice too.          We won't buy any other anymore.          It has tons of flavor, it has a bite, it is wholesome and nutritious. BUY it!
