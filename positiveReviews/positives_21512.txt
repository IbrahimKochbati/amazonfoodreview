As far as instant products go, Quaker Instant Oatmela Maple Brown Sugar flavor is pretty tasty.  It's also pretty instant and fills you up, even if you need to eat two packets at a time to actually feel full.  However, it's not something you have to feel guilty about eating since it's oatmeal and the fat calories in a serving aren't going to crash your diet.  Unlike all the complainers, I'm not addicted to the "original" flavor and honestly couldn't tell you there was a difference between this and the "old" version.  Basically, if you don't eat it five days a week, you probably won't notice the difference.          Overall I like the texture of this as well.  I tend to make mine straight from the packet and with boiling water from an electric kettle and sometimes I've had products that don't mix well that way and I'm stuck eating crunchy oats instead of, well, the proper gooey kind.  This one does exactly what I want with the texture most of the time and I absolutely love it!  Hard to feel guilty about something that's good for you and tastes pretty darn good too, definitely still solid product from Quaker.
