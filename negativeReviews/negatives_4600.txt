I ordered these because I had purchased a bag of Sweet maui Onion chips from the supermarket. They were so good that I had to get another.          The order came and I popped open a bag. They are very crunchy, so if you're into that, these are the chips for you. However, they do tend to get really salty. I found myself having quite a few sips of beer when eating these
