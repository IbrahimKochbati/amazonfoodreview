After buying bags one at a time (at a hefty markup) at nearby stores, I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon. I was very pleased with the price and the products.          These jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy; they have a slow building spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag, which I'm embarrassed to say I did quite a few times.          The chips arrived well packed and fresh. They had nearly a year of time before they expired, which is pretty impressive for chips.          Most importantly, the price per bag was much, MUCH better than any local store could do, although I live near an expensive city, so that may play a role in the price difference.          I wouldn't hesitate to order another box of these once I run out.
