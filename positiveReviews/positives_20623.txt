I used to buy this from the store when it was still called 'Damn good chili'. Someone must have complained about the name, but its one of the best.     Just to make it last longer, I add ground beef, onion, tomatoes, beans, cheese and some extra seasoning (chili powder, cumin) and its amazing.     Although by itself its still pretty 'darn good'
