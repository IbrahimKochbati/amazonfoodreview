My Westie liked this at first, but it didn't really hold his interest.  Plus, you have to fill the bottle about half full.  He gets bored after removing a few items, and then you either have to waste the food by replacing it with smellier food, or just leave it sitting around.  I think I just need to try with food he enjoys more, but I wanted the point to be that he would eat his regular food from this toy.
