I've been buying Great River organic flour for over a year now.  The multi grain  ead flour and the whole wheat  ead flour come in cases of 5 pound bags.  This all purpose flour is one large 25 pound bag.  I have Tupperware containers to store it but you should be aware of that.          I've been very pleased with all the Great River organic flours.  I am particularly happy with the price that Amazon has.  I have shopped around, including some great local stores that normally have good prices for organic products but nobody beats Amazon's price.  I always make sure to order enough to qualify for free shipping.  The only product I couldn't get free shipping on (see review for Spectrum baking spray with flour) was still  cheaper even with the shipping costs.
