My cats love this cat food.  It is the only cat food that I have ever used that they seem to digest well. There is seldom any "throw up" with this cat food.  Anyone who owns a cat knows what I mean about this.  I used to call my cats the "throw up queens" but since I've been using this cat food it very seldom happens.  They have been eating this cat food for over 2 years so I think this is a good test.  I highly recommend.
