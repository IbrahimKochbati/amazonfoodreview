I love the taste of the Viva Coco with Pineapple. If I was likening it to a common drink, it's a melted virgin Pina Colada.     The 17 oz boxes are better for me than the other sizes, because they contain the resealable lids in case you don't drink it all at once.     As with all coconut waters, the taste can vary slightly, but the pineapple seems to keep it pretty consistant.
