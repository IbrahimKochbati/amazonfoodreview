To be honest, like the other reviewers, I had not read the label as carefully as I should have before purchasing this product. It is based on apple cider vinegar, not the usual plain white vinegar that most mustards are based on. As a result, it has a sweeter apple hinted flavor to it. I turned out to really like that flavor, but others may not.
