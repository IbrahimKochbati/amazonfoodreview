I found this tea 5 years ago, while staying at a Spa Resort in Washington.          I absolutely love it! It's herbal, and helps me to relax with its very flavorful taste and color. Great for colds, as well as clearing the sinus. Soothing, beautiful, and delicious!          I have ordered this tea every year, from Amazon.com, because the price is amazing, and well worth it. Likewise, I've given it to others as a gift, when I can afford to.          This tea is wonderful with honey, sugar, sweetener, or just by itself! A must purchase for every household. Also great for on the road, for tea drinkers.
