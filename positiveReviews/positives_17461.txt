Avoderm oven baked lamb and  own rice has proven to be the best food for Trevor (greyhound).  It's easy for him to digest, has improved his coat (thicker and glossy) and lessened intestinal gas.  He eats it with apparent enjoyment.  It's not easy to find this product everywhere.  Amazon has had it and at the best price.
