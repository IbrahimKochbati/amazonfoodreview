Well, it's finally happened...we couldn't make my husband's and our son's favorite holiday cookies this year! We were unable to find Borden None Such CONDENSED Mincemeat (in the box) ANYWHERE! NOTHING matches the flavor of this product which produces the best holiday cookies EVER!!! We really wish it were READILY AVAILABLE in stores; even online would be okay! But it wouldn't be okay to see it disappear completely. That would be very bad!
