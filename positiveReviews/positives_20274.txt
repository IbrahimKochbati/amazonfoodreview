This is our second order from this company and our family loves the Huckleberry Jam. The jam is so delicious and has real huckleberries (of course) in the jam. It is very high quality and my Mom's new favorite jam over anything else. I highly recommend purchasing from this company and if you are looking for a great jam to try, don't hesitate. It is truly yummy.
