The coffee, when made in accordance to the directions, is bold and flavorful.  If you like your coffee to taste like coffee   this is a good blend for you.  Best left unadulturated   so no creamer or sweetener.  The second batch we made, we made it a little weaker than the directions, and thoroughly enjoyed that as well.  It is a premium coffee, and priced that way   but if you appreciate a fine cup of joe this will fit the bill.
