I always buy the chicken flavor that walmart sells for around $6, so when I saw this BREATH one for about the same price, I was very happy (both of our large dogs love to get up close and personal!). However when it came, it was pepperoni flavor instead of fresh  eath  the exact opposite!! : O  However, the dogs still enjoyed it, although I won't order it online again since its a little bit cheaper at walmart  and I can be sure to get the right flavor!          However, overall this Kong filler is awesome to keep our 2 large dogs entertained for a little while during the day  and they love it!
