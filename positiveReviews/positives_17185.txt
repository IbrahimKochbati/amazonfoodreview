A pretzel is a pretzel right?  Wrong.  I was amazed at how these really taste better than any I have had before.  I think these are the best tasting pretzel rods you can get in a supermarket or here on amazon.          The malt really makes a difference in the flavor.          The diameter is perfect for dipping in mustard or eating plain, not too thin and not too thick.          They have an even and sufficient coating of salt.          They arrived undamaged and very fresh with high crunch factor, not at all stale.          Mine were not burned like others have experienced with their orders.          I have 12 bags and am happy to keep a supply in the pantry to put out for guests when they drop by; it makes it very easy to serve good food at a good price by buying in bulk on amazon.
