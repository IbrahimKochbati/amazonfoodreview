This is the worst low carb product I have ever purchased.  When using it to make pizza crust, I could not even cover half the pizza pan, and the taste was horrible.  I used it to make biscuits, and they were incredibly dry and had no flavor.  I tried again, adding some margarine, and they still tasted awful.  I tried to make pancakes, and the batter was as thick as cement.  I tried adding more liquid, but they were horrible.  I cannot imagine how this product is still on the market. Krusteaz used to make WONDERFUL low carb baking products, so I know it can be done.  This stuff, however, is awful.
