We tried this product, a bunch of us. And we are all vegetarian. We also do not like onion or garlic; one of the friends esp. is sensitive to this. Well, even calling the company, they are not forthcoming, because we could taste garlic in it, and compared to "tasty eats" soy jerky, this does not even compare.            So first, the ingredient "vegetarian spices" includes granulated garlic powder, possibly onion. In ayurvedic terms, this is not Sathwic for one's body.            We totally recommend the soy jerky by tasty eats. We ordered six cases of the ginger. They use no onion or garlic in any of their products. Most companies do list "spices" but they will almost always label garlic or onion powder separately. This company who makes the primal strips does not. After all the comparisons, we found tasty eats soy jerky to be the best taste, quality and texture.            In fact, they are out of Teriyaki, their best selling jerky, the original flavor, peppered and hot n' spicy. But we will order cases of them when they become available.  They provide a first class jerky that is healthy and proper for everyone; esp. vegans and vegetarians.
