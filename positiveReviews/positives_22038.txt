I am always amazed at how well the coffees taste with the K cups.  I am always afraid they will taste instant but do not.  With the tea it was the same.  I was hesitant to try them out for fear they would taste "different", but this is a delicious smooth tea.  I also have the caffeinated and enjoy that just as much.
