Sardines used to gross me out but these aren't mushy or too stinky like some sardines you can get. I like how neatly packed they are in their little can. I just throw some hotsauce on em and chow down. These are my favorite by far and told my grandfather about them.          The other reviews say more about the reviewers than the product.
