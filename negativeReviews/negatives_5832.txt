I must have gotten a bad batch, Both the roast and the cup quality were poor.     2 10 cups so far have failed and dumped grounds into my cup.  The roast does smell great though. I like all the other varieties I have tried and I enjoy various flavored coffees, this box though, the flavor came out quite burnt tasting.  I bought it based on the overwhelmingly great reviews.  I will drink it but no one else in the house will touch it.     I am not impressed with this  and as there are much better ones listed right h  ere on Amazon.
