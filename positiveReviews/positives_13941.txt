I bought this mostly to add into protein smoothies for some extra PB flavor without all the fat and calories. It works perfect for that! 2 tablespoons of this added to some protein powder in a smoothie tastes just like I've added regular peanut butter.  I've also tried mixing one tablespoon of PB2 with one tablespoon of water and it also tastes pretty good (though not quite as rich as regular pb). The consistency comes out just like peanut butter and you can use it for sandwiches or dipping.
