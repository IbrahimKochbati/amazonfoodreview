We just got our first order a few days ago, and my 10 month old daughter loves them! They're just like the Gerber mini veggies, but much cheaper. Although they still cost a good bit, having a nutrient filled, easy to take anywhere travel snack is well worth it. My daughter doesn't have any teeth yet, and she hasn't had any problems eating them. They're light and fluffy, yet full of flavor.
