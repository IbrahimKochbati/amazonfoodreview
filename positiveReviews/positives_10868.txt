when I first received these doggie treats I was a little concern since they appeared to be TOO hard. My pup is 16 years old and missing a couple of teeth.  I gave her one, and she chowed down on it...and gave me the look...the look that says...more please...LOL...I lay out some milk bones and one of these treats..and she goes for Newman's first every time I tried it..
