Quaker Instant Oatmeal isn't new by a long shot, but for those who pass by it in the  eakfast food aisle, you might wish to reconsider. Oatmeal is the ultimate in comfort food, and maple conjures up the same type of coziness. Combine both, nuke for two minutes in the microwave, and you have an amazingly quick  eakfast or snack.  It isn't the heartiest oatmeal, but the addition of a banana and or raisins bulks it up considerably, and makes it a more complete balanced meal or snack. I actually like to mush up my banana and heated in the microwave as well, then mix it into the oatmeal; the result is terrific.
