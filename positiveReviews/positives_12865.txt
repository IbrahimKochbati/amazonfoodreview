This is marketed as healthy all natural all juice.  From the full nutrition label, Switch lives up to that claim.  The ingredients are juice concentrates and added vitamin C.  No added sugar.  Just like juice, you get fruit sugar and fruit nutrients, but none of the fiber.  That's to be expected from a juice, although it seems some other reviewers were alarmed to discover that fruit is sweet due to sugar rather than naturally growing aspartame or sucrose.  Healthwise, this seems fine to me.          As to taste: This was close to what I was expecting, but surprisingly sweet.  I could taste the kiwi and berry.  The carbonation was light, and added a bit of texture.          I tasted this flavor as well as the "black cherry" flavor.  I didn't like black cherry, but I liked this and would have it again.  If the concept of carbonated fruit juice appeals to you, then     this is a good flavor to start with.
