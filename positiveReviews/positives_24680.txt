It took me a few tries to get used to the flavor of Organic pumpkin vs. Libby's. However, I now love it and Libby's just tastes terrible to me now.  Both list Pumpkin as the only ingredient. It's hard to believe Organic Pumpkin can have a different taste, but it does.  And the Organic Pumpkin is more available than Libby's so I love that.
