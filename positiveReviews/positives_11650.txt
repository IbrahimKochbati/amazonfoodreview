I had been feeding them Pro Plan for years, but when they were both diagnosed with dental fissures a couple of months ago, I started researching  ands that would be easier for them to eat.  This kibble is made smaller and  eaks apart easier than the other  and, and they both love it!  I had tried high end  ands like Wellness, Core, and a few others in the past, but they wouldn't go near them.  I do feed them canned also.  I think that a combination is best for them.  The vet couldn't believe that they're 15 years old, so I must be doing something right!
