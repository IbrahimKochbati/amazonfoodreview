I wait for this cereal to go on sale before I buy it and the sale price is usually $1.99 per 12 ounce box.  The regular price is about $4.          $28.88 for 70 small boxes of less than one ounce each is 41 cents per box nearly per ounce. The sale price is 17 cents per ounce.  The regular price is 33 cents per ounce.          On the other hand, this should make two rice krispie treats with one box.  Starbucks sells rice krispie treats for $2 as one of their lowest priced snacks.
