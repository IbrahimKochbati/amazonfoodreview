About 8 months ago I ordered a bag of English Breakfast from Davidson's and it was quite good.  Not the best but very good for the price.  After I ran out I decided to order two more bags of the English Breakfast and Assam Banaspaty.  To my great dissapointment, both are old and flavorless.  It seems like Davidson's did not store them properly.  They become bitter quickly if I  ew them long enough to get any flavor out of them and I've resorted to mixing it with other tea just so it isn't a total waste.  The reality, is that I wasted $32 on tea that is only really good for making water  own.  : (          The quality control issue and randomness of getting a good batch from Davidson's make it not a good value.  I'd rather pay more to know I'm getting consistent quality and not something that might be a total waste.          I was really excited when I first discovered Davidson's because I drink a lot of tea and they have attractive pricing but my second order was such a huge let down that they've lost me as a customer.
