Since being gluten free I've tried all types of GF  eads and they are all very expensive. Who knew that the  azilians had the  ead game on lock with this inexpensive tapioca version of cheese  ead! It's custom which is probably why they are all so skinny! lol But I loved it and will be ordering a whole lot more!
