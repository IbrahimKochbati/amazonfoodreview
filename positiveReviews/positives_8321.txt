As I said, loose Tea is cheaper than Tea Bags, and the taste is much better, and this "Country Boy" sure loves his Southern "Sweet Iced Tea", packed well, received quickly and rapidly made a pitcher in my Mr. Co**ee Iced Tea Maker, I keep my Tea Leaves in an airtight bag in the fridge and use one 25cc scoop of Tea to make 3 Quarts of Tea (you convert it, I'm tired!!!)
