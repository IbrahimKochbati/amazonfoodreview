They pack a protein punch mid morning to stave off those cravings and temptations (the chocolate drizzle is SUCH a plus!!) I keep a couple in my bag at work and eat one when someone  ings in cake! Satisfying as a  eakfast on the go with an OJ. Love that you can get them in packs of 8 here. Sometimes you can find them for $2.50 box on sale but if you go with Subscribe and Save they are about $2.30 a box delivered right to your door!
