I had these chips once on a flight and have been hooked on them ever since. Unfortunately they were not sold at any store near me so i found them on here and jumped on them. They speedy shipping surprised me but im pretty sure that was the companies way of assuring freshness. I bought two boxes to last me the rest of my school semester and so far they taste great. Couldnt be happier : ) 5star service for sure
