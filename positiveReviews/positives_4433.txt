I'm constantly trying to find vanilla beans at a reasonable price. Often, when I do, they are hard as rocks, dry, and practically unusable.  I was so frustrated at Safeway where one bean was $13(!), dry and hard as a rock. The best I've found was at Trader Joe's, where I could get three beans for $10. They were decent...          This price was SO reasonable, that I worried they were not going to be fresh good etc. I was wrong. The beans were incredibly fresh and supple. I'm using them to make vanilla extract and they have worked perfectly. They keep well in the fridge, so I'm using them in everything!          The price is great, but there might be too many to use  if that's the case, then split them with a friend. Then it becomes one of the best culinary deals ever.          Absolutely wonderful. I will buy these again and again.
