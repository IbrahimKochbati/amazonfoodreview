If you like popcorn and are tired of the microwave stuff this is the best you can get. It's very simple and easy to make, just pour in the the kernels into a stove pot and mix in the supplied seasoning and butter mix, put a lid on top and in minutes you'll hear popping. Each bag makes a lot of popcorn which is nice and if you do it just right none of it burns.
