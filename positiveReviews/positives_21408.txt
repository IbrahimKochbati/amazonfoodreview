Hey, every culture has their ideal preference in cocoa. Look at the humble Nestle Milo or even Ovaltine   every nation has variations. Made in Singapore or anywhere in Asia is sweeter than their Latino counterpart. Mexicans or Colombians like that strong cocoa taste.          Ive also tried Neuhaus, Chirardelli and other store  ands, but I prefer Bellagio because there's no need to mix in milk for that smooth Belgian taste.          Belgium or European chocolates are different from America's Hersheys  and. Their chocolate mix is not overpowering.          Bellagio Chocolate Truffle reminds me of Starbuck's Signature chocolate drink with less calories (thhe company phased out this  and because of high caloric content    700 calories for the venti)          So if you're on the go or a busy mom like me, Bellagio choco is the best comfort drink this cold season.
