I ordered out of curiosity, but nurturme quickly became my favorite baby food. Now I'm on my third order. I've spent so much time staring at the baby food shelves and doing research online. I've tried Earths Best, Sprout, and Happy Baby, but I'm going to stick with Nutureme. First of all, my baby loves the taste. I love the small packaging, portability, and (most important for me) high nutritional value. I also like that it has more calories than other  ands when you compare serving size. That tells me that other  ands are watered down. My baby is small for his size, so I want him to have more calories per feeding. I'll feed my baby nuturme on its own or mixed with oatmeal cereal. Either way, it's super easy to use. My favorites are the apple, squash, and peas which seem exactly like their fresh counterparts. Unlike the other varieties, the dried sweet potatoes aren't as appealing as fresh. Sweet potatoes are so easy to make into baby food that I'd rather just make my own anyway. I probably wouldn't order the sweet potato version on its own, but I use it anyway as it's part of the variety pack.
