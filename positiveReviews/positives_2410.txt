I just got my Bread Machine for Christmas, so being a novice I thought I would try to Keep It Simple :)  The Hodgson Mill Products are wonderful.  Everything is included even the yeast.  The Bread came out delicious, it was easy to slice.  It is like eating a country white  ead not soft n mushy like traditional white  ead.  My family enjoyed this it makes great toast as well. If you try this I think you will be happy with it
