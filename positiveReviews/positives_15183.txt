One of the things I just love about HAPPYBABY organic baby food is the unique combination of ingredients they offer.  I mean, how many companies utilize quinoa as the primary grain in their baby food?  I love that HAPPYBABY thinks outside the box to come up with an innovative mix of super healthy foods for our babies.  The bananas, black beans and rice work well together, both in taste and texture, and I know this is one meal my baby will gobble down every time.  Did I mention how much I love the portability of these pouches?!  I only wish they had been around when my older daughter was a baby!
