While working as a busboy in a high end resturant in the 1960's the resturant ran low on coffee. The manager sent me out to purchase YUBAN and only YUBAN saying it was the BEST! I have been drinking YUBAN for nearly 50 years and have always found it to be an exceptionally rich, smoothe Columbian coffee. There can only be one! YUBAN!
