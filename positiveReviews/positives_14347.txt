Twinings English Breakfast tea is a good, basic black tea (as is its stronger cousin, Irish Breakfast tea). But I find this loose tea to be a bit of a challenge. It is cut quite finely and no matter how fine the mesh on the infuser or strainer some of this always comes through. I drink a lot of tea and am fine with drinking some tea dust or even a few leaves, but I am talking about a lot of tea here...a teaspoon full or more in each cup.          It is true that this tastes better than the bagged variety of Twinings English Breakfast tea. It is smoother and never bitter, as the bagged tea sometimes is. I have compromised and used the loose tea but I strain it through a coffee filter. The tins the tea comes in keep it quite fresh and though straining it is a hassle, it is worth it for me.          This is moderately strong (I drink it black) and if you are sensitive to caffeine you might not want to drink it near bedtime. I use Amazon's Subscribe and Save program for this tea; it is a good bargain and I like the convenience of having it delivered. It is also hard to find the loose tea in supermarkets.
