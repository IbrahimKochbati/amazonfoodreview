I love these cookies, they taste exactly like Oreos. But unfortunately, every time I eat them (2 cookies at a time)I get horrible headaches and migraines (which I don't get from real Oreos) Its obviously caused by some of the 'nutritious' ingredients. Another thumbs down   they include vitamin K which should not be eaten by anyone on blood thinners, or for anyone middle aged or older who overindulges in these cookies be warned   vitamin K can cause blood clots.     HEADACHE & MIGRAINE SUFFERERS BEWARE of these cookies!
