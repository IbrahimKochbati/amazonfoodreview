You never know with mixes of any kind, particularly ones that you don't see in grocery stores, at least not much in Tennessee.  This makes excellent pancakes.  Made waffles once, and it did not do quite as well.  Generally, waffles take more oil than pancakes so that could explain it.  Also,it was first use of waffle iron and that may have contributed to mediocre results.  But pancakes are great.  Great ingredients, great taste, and ease of preparation.
