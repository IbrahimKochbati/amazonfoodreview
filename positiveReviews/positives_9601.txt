Nut oils are good for you. So is olive oil. But I don't much like olive oil. So I mix them on my salad. I bought La Tourangelle (how do you pronounce Tourangelle?) pistachio along with hazelnut and a couple of other nut oils. I now like the zing of my salad much more. My only complaint is that the bottle is a flimsy metal, and it bent in the shipping. However, it is still fresh and useable.
