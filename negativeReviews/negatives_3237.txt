I purchased this nylabone for my 4 month old teething puppy. I figured she'd enjoy a tasty chew toy. She's quite the chewer so I was thinking the bone would last a day or two at best. However that was wishful thinking! In less than 20 minutes, she had consumed all of it but the bulky end (which we threw away). We couldn't believe how quickly she chewed it up! Definitely not worth the $8.
