   class "tiny"  Length:: 0:15 Mins              After reading previous reviews on this product, I was hesitant to order it, but I did and I am happy!     The popcorn arrived in one day on 5 7 day free shipping!     It is fresh, most of the kernels popped and it tastes just like the movie theater.     I have the 4 oz. Elite EPM 450 that I purchased a couple of years ago from Costco Wholesale.     I can only guess that the people that are complaining about this product do not have the correct equipment or are not letting the popcorn maker preheat?     The popcorn is a little salty, but so is the movie theater type.  So if you don't want it salty, just don't cut open the seasoning portion of the three part package.
