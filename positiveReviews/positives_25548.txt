Tastes good. Smells good. Great color. No coffeine. Natural   no additives at all.     The best tea ever. The only tea I ever need.     At least, that's how I feel after I've been using the tea for a few weeks.     Love it! What else can I say?     Also, I like the packaging. It is pure and simple   no colors, no fancy designs, no long description(s) of how good the tea is. It simply is.     I like that the tea is in bulk. I can put as much (or as little) of it as I want  into my cup.     Thanks to Davidson for having such a good product on the market!
