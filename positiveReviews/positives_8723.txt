I was not able to find these mushrooms in any nearby stores, so I decided to order on line through Amazon.  The product came very quickly and although 4 oz doesn't seem like much, my recipe called for only 1 2 oz, so this pack will go a long way.  Once reconstituted, and added to my pot roast they were delicious. They made the sauce really tasty and earthy.  My family loved them.  I will use them in stews and soups in the future.  Well worth ordering at Amazon.  Great service, great product.
