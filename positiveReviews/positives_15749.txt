i do not like the smell of cat food.  this says it is people food for cats, and it looks just like ground up fish with alot of juice.  the cans are the little cans, same size as the fancy feast cans.  the real testament is from my cat.  she is oh so particular, even turning down many types of fancy feast and other things.  this petite cuisine however, she is madly in love with it.  she starts as soon as we get up, about 6am. she prances all around the kitchen meowing for her petite cuisine.  once she has eaten, we don't see her for the rest of the day, she goes off to sleep.  this is the first food in her life that she has felt compelled to make a fuss for.  i think it has to be a winner!
