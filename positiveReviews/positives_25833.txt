I bought a Keurig  ewer last Christmas and have been sampling all the different varieties. I enjoy being able to have a variety of good fresh coffee on hand. I like the darker roasts like French and the 'Jet Fuel'  and which is a good roast. This Italian Roast is my absolute favorite, strong and full of flavor. :) I am ordering another box of 50 today.
