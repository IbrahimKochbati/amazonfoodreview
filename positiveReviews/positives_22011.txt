I had nearly given up on my dogs learning how to use this machine.  I had seen so many dogs on youtube and people saying they figured it out in 5 minutes...I was thinking that my dogs were NEVER going to figure it out! They would scratch and scratch on it and just could not seem to reach up and hit the lever.  I would get so frustrated watching them that I would end up pressing the lever for them.  I think they had me trained! Finally, after 4 months, they figured it out! They are so cute working the lever.  This is a great toy and I would highly recommend it.  It is very durable and well made.  I think I enjoy it as much as my puppies do.
