If you struggled for years using store bought green split peas and have never been satisfied with your soup, struggle no more.  For years I tried different recipes and was never satisfied with the end result because of the inferior product I was using.  My green split pea soup has never been better now that I started using this company's product.  Palouse Brand's product is hardy, tender, flavorful, creamy and smooth when cooked.  There is no dissapointment here. This farming family knows how to delivery fresh!
