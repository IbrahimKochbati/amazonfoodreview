Pre maid pudding seems to come in a couple of varieties.  The really good kind that makes you glad the cups are small, and the not so good kind that makes you long for the kind your mother used to make.  This pudding falls in the second category.  This pudding is okay on an occasional basis, but the chocolate flavor seems a little off.  It is difficult to describe what I mean, but the flavor just does not quite have the power of home made chocolate pudding.          I have tasted a number of other pre made puddings, and several of them are very good.  The vanilla and the tapioca are generally very good to excellent.  The lemon is also very good.  However, the chocolate seems to fall short in tast quality, and while I will eat it occasionally, if you have a choice between home made and this one, choose the home made.
