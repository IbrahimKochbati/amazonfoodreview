I purchased Farmer's Market Organic canned pumpkin because I could not find Libby's anywhere. The shipping was first rate. Product is somewhat different than Libby's in that it is more liquid, not as solid, but pie was very good except sweeter than we are accustomed to. So will just reduce amount of sugar, which is a good thing anyhow, and enjoy the rest of the cans of pumpkin. I am glad to have enough for the upcoming holidays even tho Libby's is now back on grocers shelves. Thank you Amazon.
