My cat enjoyed this food very much. He is an older cat and can be finicky. He *really* showed great interest in this  and, and liked the amount of juice in the food.  He preferred the chunky chicken in the pot pie flavor rather than the shredded chicken in the sesame entree, but hey he ate both with gusto!          So if you have a picky eater, who likes a fair bit of gravy, this could be a winner for you!
