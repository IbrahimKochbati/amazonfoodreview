Just to keep it simple...more of a comparison than a total review.  I love jalapeno chips   look mostly for the level of spice, then pepper flavor, good crunch, and not loaded down with salt.          With that said, these Deep River Snacks chips (jalapeno flavor) are:     1. Better than the Lays Jalapeno.  (Deep RIver have the same spice level, which is lacking.  Neither have a lot of pepper flavor.)     2. About the same as the jalapeno chips that the "World Market"  anded chips.  (World Market has a little more spice, but also a lot more salt.)     3. Not nearly as good as Tim's Cascade Jalapeno chips.  (Tims has more pepper flavor, more spice, a little bit better crunch...but also have MSG.)          It's not to say these chips are bad, but just what the 3 stars says "It's OK."  There are better, there are worse...to me, these are right in the middle of the pack.
