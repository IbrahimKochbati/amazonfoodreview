I have a cup of this with me right now and am pleased to report that this coffee is quite good   smooth, mellow and surprisingly rich. The low acid blend removes the bite and aftertaste w o sacrificing the full flavor. It has an almost smoky undertone that I wasn't expecting. I would certainly recommend this not only to those who need a low acid blend, but to anyone looking for a full bodied, but mellow coffee. I suspect this would be great with pastry or danish and as an after dinner drink. I made it using an ordinary, decent drip machine and it came out wonderfully. I like this coffee a lot.
