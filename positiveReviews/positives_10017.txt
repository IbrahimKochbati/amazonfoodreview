I am honestly, pleasantly surprised by Melitta's Classique Supreme blend.  I was expecting a grocery store quality coffee, but it far surpasses anything I've purchased at my local supermarket and, interestingly enough, I like it better than most beans I've purchased at specialty coffee shops.  Here's why:          It's got a bold flavor akin to Kenyan beans but has a rich, full, smooth (almost chocolatey) texture like Sumatra.  As if combining the best bits of my favorite coffee regions wasn't enough, it's a very low acidity coffee, almost completely lacking that bitter   burnt aftertaste that plagues so many dark blends.  It's not a " ight" coffee like those grown in Latin America.  I believe this blend of coffee would be absolutely PERFECT FOR DESSERT SERVICE, but shouldn't necessarily be limited there.          I've  ewed a few pots at work to rave reviews.  Even the barely colored water that she calls coffee gal shrugged and said it was good.  I'm not inclined to drink my coffee black, but this blend is smooth enough to be palatable, even for me.  In fact, I surprised myself by enjoying my first 10oz cup with no creams or sweetener.  Pretty remarkable stuff.          At its current price point, it'll end up being a bit more expensive but of far better overall quality than your average grocery store, but may be comparable (or even cheaper) than your local coffee shop.  If you like a smooth, flavorful coffee, Melitta's Classique Supreme blend is a safe bet for a very enjoyable cup o' joe.
