I like coffee and my favorite kind is hazelnut but, upon trying this coffee i change my mind. Its really strong and for people that like strong coffee try it. for people who say it has a bitter taste well you have to add some sugar and you are good to go. i first tried it plain then added the sugar and half and half and it's got great flavor.
