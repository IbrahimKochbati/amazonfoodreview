Sparkling juices aren't anything new and the Switch simply gives us more of the same. Whether you are drinking Welche's Sparking juice or an Izze, it comes down to flavor, nutrients and cost.          Izze flavors are Apple, Pomegranate, Black Cherry, Grapefruit and Clementine.     Switch offers Orange, Watermelon, Kiwi Berry (the flavor I tried), Black Cherry and Fruit punch.          Also Izze gives you 10% of your daily allowance of Vitamin C, B6 and Niacin.     Switch gives you 100% of your daily vitamin C.          Izze currently is $21.62 for 24 cans at 8.4 oz.     Switch is currently advertised at about a buck more for 24 cans at only 8.3oz cans.          OVERALL:     With Switch, you pay a similar cost to get more vitamin C and different flavors than offered by the main competitor.          Could a vitamin supplement give you more of what you really need? Sure. But it's not nearly as fun as drinking any of these sparking juices.          So if you need a more healthy alternative to soda, determine if cost, nutrients and or flavor is your thing then try a Switch or an Izze.
