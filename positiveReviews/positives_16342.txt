I like to buy Greenies for my dog but they are very expensive even in multi packs. If you purchase at online pet stores they are somewhat less expensive but not like the boxes offered on Amazon.  Dogs need clean teeth and healthy gums and Greenies will take care of both.  Easily digestible for my 13 year old Shi Tzu.
