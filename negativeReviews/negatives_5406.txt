I love a good cup of coffee in the morning.  I also have an occasional upset stomach in the morning that does not go well with my aforementioned desire for a morning  ew.  Thus I thought this might be a great match.  So I tried the Puroast Low Acid Coffee French Roast one morning (on a morning without any tummy issues so I wouldn't skew the result) and sat down for what I hoped would be a new coffee find.  It wasn't.          Unlike most dark roasts that have a rich aroma and flavor, this had a flat bitter taste that was more like coffee that had been left in the pot too long.  It wasn't horrible ... I've actually had much worse ... but it wasn't very good and combined with the price point should give even those with terrible acid reflux second thoughts.          I really wanted to like this product but, while not terrible, it is just a very mediocre cup of coffee.  Given the choice, I'll just deal with the acid until something more palatable comes along.
