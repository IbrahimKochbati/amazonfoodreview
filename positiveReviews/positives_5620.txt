I use this in all my recipes calling for  own sugar.  As per the INSTRUCTIONS ON THE PACKAGE, use ONE HALF the amount called for in the recipe. If the recipe states ONE CUP of  own sugar, you use ONLY ONE HALF cup of Splenda Brown Sugar Blend. I am not a diabetic but I do have many family members who are and this is a great substitute for "real"  own sugar, even though it does contain part Splenda and part "real"  own sugar.
