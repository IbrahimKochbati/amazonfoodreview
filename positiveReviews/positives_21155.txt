I love ginger & I love honey, so it seemed like a good fit. The manager of my local pharmacy had  ought some in for her folks with colds to try because it's good for sinuses as well as digestion.  Also, it tastes GREAT.  I have a few cups a day.  My only regret is that they don't offer the option to auto ship.
