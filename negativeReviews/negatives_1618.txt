When I first glanced at this item, my first thought was a Nehi orange type soft drink.  However, it is made of 100% fruit juice with carbonation added.  It tastes way too sweet for my taste buds, much more than regular OJ.  In fact, it left an aftertaste in my mouth and I had to  ush my teeth right after taste testing it.          I ended up mixing the rest with a shot of vodka and it made a great screwdriver with a kick of carbonation.
