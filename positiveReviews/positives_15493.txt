Well, this ink was used for squid ink spaghetti (tomato sauce spaghetti with squid cuttlefish ink mixed in), and it's a mild and unique flavor. It does not taste fishy at all. If I didn't know what it was before hand, I would never have guessed it was seafood. One packet seems to work well for one pound of spaghetti. Very glad I bought this, because I got to try something new and delicious!
