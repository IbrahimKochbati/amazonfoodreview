I purchase the Organic canned pumpkin for my dogs. Sounds funny but pumpkin is wonderful for dogs digestion. I have been feeding my dogs pumpkin for years. In the past 6 months it has been very hard to find 100% pumpkin in the stores so I started ordering it.          It's also good for humans    pumpkin pie is very healthy and low fat, if made in that fashion.
