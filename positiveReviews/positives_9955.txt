These cookies are so good. I love them. I first had them on our round trip flight to Hawaii last fall. I asked for extra. I recently discovered them at a national chain drugstore and here they are on amazon, too! They are so delicious but it's hard to stop eating them once you start...or so I hear...haha. Enjoy!
