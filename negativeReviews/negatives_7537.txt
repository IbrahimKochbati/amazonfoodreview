I purchased the six pack of 12 ounce bottles.  Amazon was amazing as always, and delivered my order in a very timely fashion.  However, the caps were loose on all the bottles.  I didn't think much of it until I realized every single time I served it (as dip, with salmon, with chicken), it ran straight through my family.  I hate to waste so I really tried to see if it was just a coincidence.  Nope.  It does taste great, just like the Trader Joes product, but I wouldn't suggest using it to cook a romantic dinner for two.  lol
