Just got the baby back ribs and the strips of jerky out of the smoker, wow this seasoning really added a lot of flavor, what was surprising was the fact that I knew I had added to much seasoning but it didn't turn out over powering. I would recommend this to anyone who is cooking any kind of meat, the jerky is great, but the ribs are outstanding, and for 27$ including shipping for 12lbs, awesome deal.
