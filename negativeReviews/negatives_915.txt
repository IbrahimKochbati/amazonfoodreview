...however, for the price and additional shipping cost (if not receiving that free), I would not say this is a such a good value. Not sure what makes the tuna more pricey than something like the freeze dried salmon. If these were the only treats available to the cats, they likely would not last even one week in this small amount. In the future, I'd be more apt to open up a 69 cent can of tuna, which they are just as fine with.
