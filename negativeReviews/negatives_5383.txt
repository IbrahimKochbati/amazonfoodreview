The hubby likes his coffee, colas and chili's. Unfortunately his stomach does not agree. So, in the past year he has made the switch from colas to tea and has cut back (or so he tells me) on the hot sauce. What he will not do is give up the black  ew. When I saw this low acid coffee I thought we had found a solution.  Unfortunately I was wrong.          On the upside, he liked the mild taste of the  ew and even enjoyed the smooth after taste. On the downside, he didn't enjoy it enough to make the switch from his usual store  and which is considerably less expensive. Guess it proves that suffering has a price   about $4.00 a pound!          Recommended for those who are willing to pay for a low acid mild  ew.
