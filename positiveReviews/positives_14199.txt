Maldon is my go to salt for finishing at the table. Perfectly delicate and crunchy, it's an elegant addition to any table. Do't worry too much about the price, because this will last you a good long time. You only use it for finishing at the table, not for cooking (cheaper kosher is the this for that), so you only use a pinch at a time.          I get it locally from Whole Foods which, ironically, has a really good price; for folks who don't live near a store that carries Maldon, this is a good deal! Enjoy!
