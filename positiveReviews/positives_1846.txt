This morning, for the first time in my life, I tried Mahogani Caribou Coffee only because I had run out of my usual type of coffee, which I would usually  ew and drink. In short, I should not even categorize Mahogany Caribou as coffee!!!! You know why? It has far more anti depressant and uplifting effect on me than I had previously anticipated. From now on, I will only drink Mahogany Caribou.
