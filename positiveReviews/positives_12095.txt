A year ago, my dad received a Keurig for Christmas, and with it the K Cup variety pack. I tried a couple coffee  ands without milk and sugar, and this was the one that really caught my taste buds' attention. It's very mild, borderline light bodied, with a subtle flavor and not too bitter. It doesn't taste like you're chewing on beans, but it's not watered down like some sub standard  ands you find in stores (I'm looking at you Folgers 10lbs jug of "ground").          A few months later, a co worker  ought a Keurig to work and offered access to it. I purchased packs of Green Mountain Nantucket Blend the same day and enjoyed 48 cups of it, dreaming of the day I may have a Keurig at home. That has happened now, and I've got this on subscription.          Strongly recommend if you are a fan of light bodied coffee. One of the best K Cups you'll find in that category.
