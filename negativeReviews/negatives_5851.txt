I have bought k cups from amazon before and this was the first time that I bought the Van Houtte and am disappointed , not so much in the taste but that many of the cups in this order where defective and would drain all of the coffee grounds into my cup or just soak up the water and not drain at all. I would suggest that people do not buy these.
