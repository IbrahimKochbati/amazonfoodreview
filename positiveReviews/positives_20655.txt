This is an awesome product. For those who can't digest cows milk, this is an awesome replacement. It has all the nutrients you need and is low in calories and the taste is superb. I use it in baking and cooking with the added flavors of vanilla and coconut, it's a real treat. Really adds flavor to protein drinks, too.  The aseptic packs are great for camping and taking on the road if you have no refrigeration available.
