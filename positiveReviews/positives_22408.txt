Great popcorn.  My family and I love watching movies and eating popcorn.  We consume more popcorn during the fall and winter months.  We received this popcorn and quickly made our first batch.  Wow.......It was great.  We made the mistake of not mixing everything together (oil, popcorn, and buttery salt).  That was our fault because we didn't read the instructions due to excitement.  But our first batch was still very good (a little salty because we added the salt mix last).  We made another batch two days later and it was awesome.  This is as close to theater popcorn made in our house ever.  It was really, really good.  Every kernell popped and it was a perfect balance.  We will NEVER, and I mean NEVER buy microwave or store popcorn again....We will be placing another order very soon.  I almost forgot to mention that we bought the 8oz bags.  That was enough for a large bowl which will feed 2 3 of us.  Can't wait to order another batch.....Enjoy
