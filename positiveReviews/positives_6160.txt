This is one of two licorice mints that I would recommend.  They are indeed difficult to find and at this time (6 2011) Amazon does not carry my other favorite, St. Claire's.  Nonetheless, Meltzer's has beneficial herbs and a mild but definite licorice flavor.  Not one of the "licorice flavored" gummy candies.  Two or three of these little hard pastilles, and you're done.  No black tongue either!  Treat yourself, and indulge in these little gems.
