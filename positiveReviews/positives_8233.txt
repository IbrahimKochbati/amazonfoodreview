This oatmeal is extremely filling and has a hearty consistency, impressive for an instant oatmeal, I know.          The flavor is somewhat bland, which allows one to be creative with add ins! (I prefer to add raisins, dried cranberries, and or cinnamon to mine).          The nutritional information is great, especially the plant derived Omega and added whole flax seeds, but I wish there was less added sugar in it though.          All in all, I am happy this is my  eakfast every morning, as I get myself off to a healthy start each day!
