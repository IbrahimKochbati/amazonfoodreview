So far I've tried all of the flavors and while there are some I'm not over the hill about, I've had pretty good experiences with them.          This is one of the flavors I'd purchase again. I'm a big fan of anything lemon or lime flavored, so I had to give this a try. I'll admit up front that I haven't had a key lime pie for years, so I don't remember the flavor like it was yesterday and this probably worked in my flavor. (I remember it in general, though.)          This tastes awesome. I can definitely taste the lime and it tastes like what I remember a key lime pie to be. The lime flavor is there, but it's backed up by a nice creamy taste that almost made me want to grab a few extra slices of gum. (Hey, it's 15 calories a slice so I can splurge on this while I wouldn't want to splurge with the actual pie.) Unfortunately it falls prey to the same problem that the equally yummy apple pie flavor had: the flavor doesn't last nearly long enough.          I'll absolutely buy this again, despite the flavor only lasting 1 2 minutes.
