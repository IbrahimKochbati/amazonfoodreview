I got a bag with 25 oinkies, pig skin with sweet potato in the middle.  But my dogs like them despite the wrong item being received.  It's still made by hartz.  The description of this product didn't say anything about sweet potato in the center.  So unless they update the description & package image I got the wrong product.  I'm only happy because my doggies are. :P
