I love the flavor and consistancy  and they are real Potatoes.          These packets are perfect for a large appetite or a small family. They taste great with my meals. I usually put half in the fridge overnight and they still taste yummy the next day.          I like mashed potatoes with just about anything  but these Betty Crocker reds , real mashed potatoes are the best.
