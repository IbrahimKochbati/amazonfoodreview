This was good for pre ground coffee. Being French roast it did have that characteristic stronger flavor. I'm not the biggest fan of that roast to start with, so take that into consideration. If you like it, chances are you'll like this product. My biggest attraction was the low acid. I couldn't tell for sure as it only made a couple of cups but I didn't have any excess acid reaction to the coffee. Not that I usually do, but occasionally I can experience some symptoms. None in this case. Not really a scientific study, but it is what it is. Very conveniently packaged. Try it.
