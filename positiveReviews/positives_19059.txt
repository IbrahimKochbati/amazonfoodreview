This makes much better pizza than the ready made whole wheat pizza crusts that you buy in the stores. First of all, Carbquik takes about 15 minutes to cook, so the vegetables and cheese have enough time to cook and blend together. And knowing that it has 90 percent less carbohydrates doesn't make me feel guilty when I have a pizza craving. I don't feel bloated and sick like I do after I engorge myself on a fast food pizza. Carbquik is the base of a healthy pizza that makes me feel good after eating it. We have reordered many times and always have several boxes in reserve.
