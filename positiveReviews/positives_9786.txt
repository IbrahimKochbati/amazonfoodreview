Great tasty way to start your day yet shrinking your fat cells. I don't think I would need any other tea after this one. I have tried other Pu Erh teas, but this is the best tasting one. Again I am not a coffee drinker, but always started my day with black tea, may be being raised in Europe had its effect on my taste. After knowing about Pu Erh tea in Dr. Oz show for fat shrinking quality, I tried different  ands and found out this one is the best.
