Bigelow vanilla caramel tea is delicious!!  More wonderful than I expected from a tea. A touch of cream or milk in the tea will enrich the flavor of the vanilla and caramel in the tea,to it's perfection. I haven't had a cup of coffee since I received this tea. I recommend this tea to everyone, especially to my fellow gluten intolerant individuals.
