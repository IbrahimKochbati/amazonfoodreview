My half Siamese half Himalayan cat goes crazy with this stuff! I put some on her back, and on the floor around her and she laid and rolled in this stuff for like 10 hours! Although she is an older cat, she really does love this catnip. It helps their digestive system as well!          Very good buy. There's so much of it   It will last for many months.
