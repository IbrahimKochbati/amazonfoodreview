I had been unable to find any canned pumpkin at any of the grocery stores in our area for months and found the Farmer's Market Foods canned pumpkin by searching online.  I order a lot of products through Amazon and have been very satisfied with everything I have ordered.  Like many of the other reviewers, I need the pumpkin for my dogs    and it works very well!  The product arrived in good shape, and the quality is excellent.  It is more expensive than it was in the stores, but as long as it is not available there, I will continue to buy it through Amazon.
