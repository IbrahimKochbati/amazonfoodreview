Our son loves this cereal! I've compared and tried many  ands, but I think this one gives us the most bang for our buck nutrition wise. We started with the HappyBellies Rice about a year ago, and then graduated to the Multigrain as soon as the munchkin was eating more solid foods. Now, at 16 months, he's eating a thicker version mixed with fruits, veggies, yogurt, or even a protein; he likes it so much that I can basically get him to try anything that's mixed into his cereal.          The easy on the system nature and probiotics have been especially helpful when our son's been ill and had diarrhea due to a nasty virus and teething.          Because this formula is more "concentrated" nutritionally than many other organic cereals, I think it's a good value, and it's certainly easier to take smaller servings (e.g. 3 Tablespoons vs. 5 for other  ands) on the road. The cans pack and travel well, too.          Overall, I'm sticking with this cereal because it seems to fill my hungry kid up, provide very good nutrition and is super easy to mix with stuff, even though he could technically eat adult oatmeal or whatever.
