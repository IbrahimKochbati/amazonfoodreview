First thing you notice when you stir up the cup of cereal with the requisite water is that there are whole raspberries in there, not just raspberry flavoring or bits. Real fruit. Nice.          I cooked it a bit longer (10 seconds) than the suggested time (1 minute, 45 seconds), and I let it sit three minutes. It came out fine. The texture is nice  you have real chewability here. Not mush. Real bite. And the sweetness is great for adults  not cloying, unlike cereals would appeal more to kids.          The size is quite generous. In fact, I wish it was a bit smaller size, honestly. It's 300 calories for the whole cup (8 grams of fiber total). I find that I eat 2 3 of it and am fine. Besides, I like a variety type  eakfast (ie, eggs with toast and juice, oatmeal and an egg white scramble with veggies, etc). I don't just like ONE thing (ie, oatmeal or just toast or just eggs). So, I eat part of this, save the rest to use as a dessert after dinner: I add canned peaches (or frozen) over it, sprinkle with cinnamon and add some honey, nuke it  my own little superfast peach cobbler. :)          If you want a convenience hot cereal, this is a good choice if you like oats, barley and some subtle real fruit flavor and sweetness.          This does have soy, though, in case you're sensitive. No dairy, though.          Mir
