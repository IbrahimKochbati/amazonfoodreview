This is a wonderful product...but it comes in a paper bag  which is easy to puncture and when you ship it in a box with no bubble wrap it slides around a lot and you start to get leakage of the product....powder everywhere.  I would order it again if I was sure it would be packaged right so it wouldn't be sliding around in the box.
