I usually buy loose leaf Taylors Darjeeling tea.  However I can no longer find Taylors loose leaf Darjeeling tea and was told hat Taylors no longer sells it.  I have searched all over and this seems to be the case so when i saw taylors darjeeling in the tea bag form i bought it since i will not be able to buy it in the future.  This is the same tea as loose only in bag form.  i hope this remains available in the future. I have not found a darjeeling tea in loose leaf that compares to the darjeeling tea that taylors sold in the past.
