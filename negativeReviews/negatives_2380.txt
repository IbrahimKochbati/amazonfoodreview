I was surprised by the number of 5 star reviews of this product. Its a tiny gritty seed that gets stuck in every corner of your mouth and the taste is like nothing. Kind of like poppy seeds but with out the taste. I finally ask myself why am I eating this annoying seed and put it out back in the bird feeder unfortunately they don't seem to like it much either.
