I've tried most of the McDougall LIGHT SODIUM instant soups and have them several times each week for lunch.  White Bean and Pasta is my second favorite LIGHT SODIUM soup behind the Split Pea (really like that one).          It does, however, require more time than the other soups to "steep" and develop its flavors.  It also requires more time to take the crunch out of the pasta and vegetables.  Let it sit longer than directed and you may want to put it back in the microwave to heat up.          Small price to pay for an inexpensive and relatively healthy lunch.  Try it.
