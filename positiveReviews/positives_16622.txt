I adopted my dog because her previous owner had passed away.  My dog had been eating canned food and her teeth looked terrible.  I tried a couple of teeth whitening treats and toys, but Bailey would have nothing to do with them.  Then I found Greenies and she loves them.  Once she left a couple puddles of saliva on the floor as I was getting out a greenie for her, she was salivating so much.  Her teeth look so much better now and her  eath is great.
