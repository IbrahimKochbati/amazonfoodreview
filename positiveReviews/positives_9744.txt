I'm not the biggest fan of hotsauces but I was interested in trying this one because the singer of The Offspring is the man that created the sauce and sells it.  I was pleasantly surprised with how good the sauce tastes, it's got some kick but not too much kick, I really really love this stuff.          I would especially recommend it on Papa Murphy's Herb Chicken Mediterranean pizza, amazing.          I'm glad to have found it on Amazon because I've ordered it on their site directly from them for a long time and this is a few dollars cheaper and it's still directly from the same company.          Do yourself a favor and grab a bottle.
