If you enjoy Chai at the coffee shop, just buy some of this mix and make it yourself at home for a fraction of the price.  Most coffee shops I have visited actually use Oregon Chai, so you will be getting the exact same thing.  However, the liquid concentrate version is much better than the powdered form (coffee shops use the liquid version) so unless you need portable packets for work, get the liquid.          One other thing   not too long ago I ran into a box of packets that wouldn't dissolve correctly.  I sent an email to Oregon Chai and within the SAME DAY they shipped me a whole new box!  Outstanding service from an outstanding company.  These guys really care about making you happy and they will go to any length to do so.  After that experience they have a loyal customer for life.
