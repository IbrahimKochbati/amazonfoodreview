These are amazing. I bought them after having the stomach flu all day, and they tasted like the best thing I've ever eaten  not only because my body was starving, but also because they are absolutely DELICIOUSS!!!!!!!!!!! I bought some more crackers when I didn't have the stomach flu and they were just as awesome the second time. They should call these "crackers of magic" they look plain and tasteless, but they are anything but that. WOO! love em.
