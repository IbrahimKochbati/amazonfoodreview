'On July 26, 2012 I ordered Lowrey's Hot and Spicy Pork Rinds. I received the Orginal Pork Rinds. I am not happy with this product. I will keep them as they will be to expensive to send them back. I feel you should have checked my previous orders I had ordered, or at least contacted me about my order. Thank you, Colleen Avey
