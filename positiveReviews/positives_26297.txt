I originally bought the smaller size, but went for this huge set of four 2 lb cans this time.     They are the european version, manufactured in Holland, so I guess EU laws apply     ie slightly more humanely treated cows, and no rBGH etc.  Much tastier than the nonfat organic     dry milk available, and dissolves much easier than the Organic Valley organic milk.  Also did     not really want nonfat for babies.
