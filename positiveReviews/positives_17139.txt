This is a very tasty product and was well worth trying.  As with many fresh meat and produce purchases it is pretty expensive compared to buying locally, but at the same time for someone living alone like I do, to have something like a corned beef roast pre cooked and sliced into 12 ounce trays is a time saver.  This to me tastes as good as cooking a  isket at home, and I don't end up with a large amount of meat that I probably don't end up eating even as left overs.  When I am in the mood for corned beef, either as part of my main meal or since this is sliced for sandwiches, I can just microwave this.  12 ounces is more then enough for one person at a time.
