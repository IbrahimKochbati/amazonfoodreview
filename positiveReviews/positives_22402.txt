Purchased this to use with a popcorn machine and while the machine had to be returned the popcorn itself is good. My kids loved it and thought the house smelled like the local movie theatre. Its easy to prepare and the taste is great. No extra butter or salt was needed it was perfect for our family. We just have to find a decent machine to use it with...until then we'll just use the stove.
