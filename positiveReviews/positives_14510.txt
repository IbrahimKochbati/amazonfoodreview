I'm an aficionado of avocado oil for over ten years. If you like a neutral tasting avocado oil (i.e. Spectrum), then this isn't for you. Still great for everything, including mayo.          If you receive a dented can, you can call Amazon and they will ship a replacement. Don't try the web site as you'll get some dismaying answers... It's not La Tourangelle's fault that someone at the Amazon fulfillment center didn't do their job right so please don't give a negative review on the product for that reason.
