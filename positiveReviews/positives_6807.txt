Cobblestone Kitchen's Irish Creme Hot Cocoa mix has got to be the most luxurious tasting cocoa on the market.  We originally bought this cocoa to use as a base for Frappuccinnos but quickly decided it was way to good to waste in a mix.  The flavor is rich and smooth.  We have made it a part of our winding down for bed time procedure   a couple of cups together and just relax.          Cobblestone Kitchen refers to the cocoas as "Delicious and Decadent"  and they are being extremely modest.
