While Switch Orange is VERY orangey, it also tastes of something else interesting. It's fizzy (but not, in my opinion, excessively so) and tasty, and I'd consider buying it. I seldom buy or drink soft drinks or sodas; I just don't care for all the fizz burning my nose. Switch didn't do that. Hurray!!!
