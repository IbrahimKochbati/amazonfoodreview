My sister told me about these great treats for the dogs to help keep them occupied when we will be away from home for extended periods of time.     The treat may not be everlasting, but with my two German Shepard's it lasts for several hours, unlike the knuckle bones that many pet stores sell. The kongs that are designed to hold these treats are excellent as well, giving a challenge for the dog.          I am very pleased and plan to order more in the future. Quick shipments and no problems with payment or delivery.
