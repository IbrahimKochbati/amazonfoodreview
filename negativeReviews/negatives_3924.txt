First off, ordered 2 different types of these Switch drinks and they all literally have the same ingredients, albeit 1 or 2 slight differences. They both begin with : 'Filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates'... What? Not to mention, the first 2 main ingredients are apple and grape both not the 'flavour' I ordered. Anyway, I rarely read labels to begin with, but for something supposedly 100% juice, I was curious...          Ok, now for the taste, or lack thereof. It was slightly fizzy, nothing like full blown soda, but jeez was it sweet. Like, nasty mediciny sweet. I could not finish the can. I couldn't even taste what flavour it was suppose to be. That's all there is to it. I am giving it 2 stars because it supposedly has 100% Vitamin C, which is a pretty much the only redeaming quality to this not juice but not soda type drink.
