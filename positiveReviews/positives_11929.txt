These liver treats are great for training. We adopted a German Shepherd puppy and have been using these to teach her basic commands. She goes bananas for these and learned very quickly even though she's a VERY stubborn pup. Since she's still small I cut the large cubes into thirds or quarters(she doesn't know and doesn't mind)to make our training sessions go further since it's recommended that you give only a few treats a day to avoid digestion problems. Also, compared to other liver treats on the market, this  and only uses 100% beef liver, no preservatives, fillers, or other stuff your dog doesn't need. The treats also keep indefinitely in the container if kept in a cool, dry place. The 21 oz. bucket is the most economical buy. We've had our pup 2+ months and the bucket is still mostly full. (Psst!   KV Pet Supply has the best online price  $24.99 for a 21oz. container) Highly recommended!
