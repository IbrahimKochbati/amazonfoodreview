I fell in love with this coffee in a fine SF restaurant and have felt spoiled ever since!  This is THE BEST Decaf coffee you can find anywhere and it does not taste like a decaf at all.  This is full bodied, fresh, delicious, deep, dark coffee and the only one you'll ever drink.  No matter which coffee you try, you'll always come back to this one  only illy!
