Are you sick of the regular flavors? Plain, apples and cinnamon,  own sugar....          Yeah me too. This really changes oatmeal up. At least for me it did. I have been eating oatmeal for some time and saw these flavors and figured how could I lose. These new flavors are fantastic and I can't recommend them enough. If you think their too strong you could always mix two packets like me and use a plain with one of these. I don't generally do that but I like to use up the plain packets I usually have left over from the other assortments I get.
