I had tried this bar before so I knew I liked it. Honestly White Chocolate is the best flavor. I received a fresh shipment from amazon and there was no doubt whether they were good quality or not. This bar is a chocolate nougat with a white chocolate coating. I personally don't find a chemical after taste but I usually eat sugar free products or usually eat food sans sugar, so be forewarned. If you prefer a sugar free taste then you are in for a treat because they are the closest you can get to a candy bar with zero sugar and 20g of protein.
