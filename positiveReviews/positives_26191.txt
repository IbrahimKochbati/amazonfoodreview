I got this tea because it is supposed to help with PMS and supposedly helps "prepare" the uterus for conception. I figured it can't hurt, so why not? I think this tea is very light flavored. I usually put some honey in it and it goes down great.          As for the rest, I've only been using it (3 times a day) for the past 7 days and haven't gone a full cycle yet, so I don't know if it really does work for PMS yet or not.
