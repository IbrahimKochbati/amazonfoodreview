As any chef or foodie worth his Fleur de Sel de Guerande Sea Salt knows, fresh truffles are the only real way to go as far as the whole product. Sure, Urbani oils and some truffle butters are a good substitute if you want that infusion, but as for whole truffles, if you want that real quality   A) you're going to pay for it and B) get it from a company that has a high quality of fresh goods that you know and trust (since fresh truffles will cost you a bundle...white more than black. Also seasonality plays into the truffles (black   harvested usually in autumn and winter and white around October and November). Buying "fresh" truffles in May is not usually advised. Local chefs of gourmet restaurants can sometimes tip you off to the good purveyors (if they are worth anything). If nothing else, write to some famous chef you admire and they can give you a source for the goods if you're lucky ;)          The bottom line of this product (or any bottled not fresh truffle) is this   you get what you pay for...which is to say something substandard for a big price tag. You want good? Empty out your bank account and buy fresh.
