These cookies are very tasty. Mildly sweet & satisfying. However, they arrived shrink wrapped to one flat piece of cardboard & a lot of the cookies were  oken & basically all of them were damaged around the edges. These cookies have a scalloped edge & by the time they arrived at our door all of the scallops were in crumbles. We've discovered that the crumbles make an excellent crunchy topping for ice cream sundaes, but we're disappointed that these cookies didn't arrive in good enough condition to serve to guests.
