Based on our experience I would give this product 1 star, but I concede that our dog's reaction may not be typical.          We gave our dog one of these early in the evening.  He's a mid sized dog at about 35 lbs, but he's also a strong chewer.  Based on what I could tell from the package, though, I had no reason to believe I should buy the larger size.  We were in the room and casually observed him as he chewed on it.  Our dog had the whole thing eaten within an hour.          He seemed fine and the next morning his bathroom routine was completely normal.  However, when we got home from work, it was clear that the poor guy had been struggling not to have an accident.  When we got him outside, he had multiple explosive bowel movements.  A little further examination showed us that, despite his best efforts, his butt had been leaking during the day.  He had also given himself a hemorrhoid.  The poor guy.          We double checked the package and found no directions, advice, or warnings that would have helped us foresee this issue.  I never want my dog to go through that again and thus we will never buy these again (and the extras have gone in the trash).
