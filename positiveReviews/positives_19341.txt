These belts are so good! I am eating one as I write this review. They are soft and extremely sour (but not too sour). I also like that they come individually wrapped in high quality plastic. This product comes with 150 pieces and weighs 3lbs 4.90z, so as far as I can tell, we are only paying a slight premium for the individual wrappers.
