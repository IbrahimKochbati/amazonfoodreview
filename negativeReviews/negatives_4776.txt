It was pretty good the customer service was just bad, 3 of the 5 packs were  oken and i got cut by the  oken glass sent with it *nothing major* took 3 weeks and 130 cellphone minutes for them to tell me i will get free shipping on my next order. I tried the mix after that because they wouldint refund me anything and i am not allergic to chocolate but after drinking this product maybe 5 minutes after i started vomiting horridly. I let a friend try the other pack*he is also not allergic* He  oke out so bad and started swellewing we had to  ing him to the hospital. After 15 minutes on hold (at first the lady forgot to hit hold apparently they were very confused) i spoke with a manager and the only thing they could say was a simple sorry and they would send me another half off. I figured hey maybe it was just bad luck so i ordered another and this time instead of  oken packets it was missing 3 packets and both spoons. I am really never ordering from this company again.
