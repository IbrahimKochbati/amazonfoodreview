This has the same consistency as natural peanut butter, however, i found this very hard to swallow. It's very very chalky, takes time to get used to this. It had a lot of little specks, i assume this would have been A LOT better if the almonds were blanched..smoother and easier to swallow. So buyers beware, this is grinded up roasted almonds not blanched roasted almonds.
