I don't like to write a poor review. The seller was prompt in responding. There was some miscommunication in the beginning about mailing address, which was quickly resolved. However, I was told two weeks ago, a new product had been mailed.... it never came, as patiently as I waited and even commuicated with the seller. When I finally received it, today the post mark date was exactly one week ago to today's date, meaning they did not mail it when they said they did. The post mark date was nearly a week after the date they told me they sent a new product.          The plant was ok   I was really disappointed   expecting something somewhat bigger and prettier.
