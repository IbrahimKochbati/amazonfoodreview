I've had Amy and Brians coconut water   yum!, Vico's plain in the tetra pack   great! (the ones in the plastic bottle and some in the larger tetra packs are from concentrate   blah and yuck  don't get those!) , and the ones in the glass bottles  green cover  can't remember the name, but pure coconut water  great too.          This, one with pineapple  no good.  The added cane juice is superfluous to the natural sweetness of coconut water and pineapple juice.  It makes the water taste 'thicker' and not so healthy.          I wish these  ands can just stick to the name of the drinks in their ingredients! (i.e. coconut water and pineapple juice!   no more!)
