Folgers classic roast has been my trusted  and for coffee most of my life.  I have tried other cheap coffees, but this one is by far better for it's rich aroma and taste.  More recently I started buying the smaller 22.6 ounce container whenever the grocery store has it marked at least a dollar lower.  The reason for this is the larger container can last me about two months.  Toward the last couple weeks, the rich flavor is noticeably reduced.  With this smaller size, I don't have to worry about finishing it before that happens.          I would recommend buying this at the local  store if it is available in your area as it is a bit cheaper that way.  I can usually pick it up for about $6 each  at Homeland.          Edited to Add  Due to rising prices.  The average for this size of coffee is now $7.99 at my local store which can make Amazon the better deal.
