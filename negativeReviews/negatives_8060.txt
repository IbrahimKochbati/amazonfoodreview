Absolutely horrible beef jerkey. It is really almost inedible. I threw most of this away. The taste is really off. The texture was way too soft. Almost fell apart in your mouth. I noticed that the "beef" did not come from USA per the package. Makes me wonder what kind of "beef" they are shipping in to dry. Is it old and rotten? Is it even beef? Sure doesn't tast like any beef jerkey I'm used to. Yuck.
