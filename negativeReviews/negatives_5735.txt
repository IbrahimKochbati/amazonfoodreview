I was overjoyed to find an organic black tea at a low price, and I assumed since it had the "Newman's Own"  and name on it, that it would be a great tea. I was disappointed. It was mild and rather tasteless. I understand that organic teas tend to be less  isk than non organic, but I've ordered a favorite organic Assam from another well known tea purveyor, and it was heads above this Newman blend. I got what I paid for with the Newman, but at least I'm not out a whole lot of money.
