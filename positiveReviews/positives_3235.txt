I use this to quickly make gluten egg dairy free pancakes.  I use rice milk and EngerG egg replacer to make pancakes. They taste pretty good and are a good snack to make for later and store in the fridge.  They're especially good w either apple butter or peanut butter on them besides the usual maple syrup!
