After a lot of trial and error (with just water!) I figured out how to make these handy self fill coffee pods NOT leak all over the place. The secret is to shove the filter all the way into the pod and NOT snap the lid over the edge of the filter. Make sure the filter is ALL INSIDE. It's rigid enough and stays upright and fine when you  ew. You really need to create a seal with the lid. Leaving the filter hanging out  eaks the seal and allows liquid to seep out.
