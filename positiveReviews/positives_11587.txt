I rarely get excited enough about food products to write reviews, but this maple syrup deserves it!          I've been buying real maple syrup for years. At the supermarket, Whole Foods, Costco, what have you. I've NEVER been satisfied with the artificial stuff. All these years I thought I had tasted good maple syrup. Well, I hadn't. I've never been a stickler for the "Grades" or locations, but I guess I've been mostly buying Grade A mediums and darks from Canada.          At first glance, the maple syrup is really dark. A bit watery, but I think good for pancakes and such (what I bought it for). However, as soon as you taste it, WOW! Flavors of maple trees with the cool wind in your face come to life. And it's not as sweet as the competition, which is good for me, since I want more of that mapley taste!          I will be buying this syrup as my go to  and for a while to come.
