These are magical. Put them in the microwave and they literally pop into a fresh hot crackly bag of pork rinds. They're a little on the salty side but no more so than most of the pork rinds you buy in the store. Each bag fills up a large cereal bowl. Good for a little snack when you need it and you don't want popcorn.
