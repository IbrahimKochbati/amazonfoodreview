If you like me wear and drink black, then this tea is for you. I for the most part keep cautions of fruity teas, I like my tea solid and strong. However this tea had this boldness with a twist of Apricot, which I enjoyed. It is great to  eak up a routine of always just black and have some additional flavor to it, and this tea is the one.
