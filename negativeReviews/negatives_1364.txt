Not really sure what I expected, but since I like Ghirardelli chocolate, and I like hot chocolate and hot mochas from coffee shops, I thought I'd like this product.          Unfortunately, despite following the directions and making this in milk, it's not as rich and satifying as I hoped.  I hate to say it, but I think Swiss Miss mixed Instant coffee tastes better than this.          That's unfortunate, because this is a four pack of cannisters and I'm only half way through the first one!
