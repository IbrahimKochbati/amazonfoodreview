One of the problems with flavored baked tortilla chips is since there is no surface fat from frying, the flavor powder has nothing to stick to and the chips end up tasting bland. The Guiltless Gourmet line of flavored chips avoids this problem somehow. I've tried both the "Mucho Nacho" and The "Chipotle" both were light and crisp with a good amount of the seasoning powder on board. The have great flavor and are considerably lower in calories than a comparable number of fried chips.
