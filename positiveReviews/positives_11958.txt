I buy a big tub of these for my dog about every 3 4 months. He loves them. I do mix them in with other treats, so he does not get a steady diet of them. They are given out as the "special" treat, being one notch above a standard, wheat free dog cookie.          While these are great treats, they are not as "hypnotic" as real meat is. And, given the price, and how inexpensive some good quality meat is at the grocery store, if you truly want to mesmerize your dog, go with real meat. Its pretty funny that so many of us are paying $7 9 for little bags of dog treats when we could be buying real beef for about $4 5 a pound.          However, most of us don't want slimy hands all day, so we use treats. I use these out when walking my dog, and carry them when we go out backpacking or on long day hikes. I like them because they are feather light, but just don't get them wet or they turn to mush. My dog's interest in them after they get wet goes down a lot.          I do wish the pieces were more uniformly sized, but they aren't too hard to  eak apart.
