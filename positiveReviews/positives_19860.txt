It's always disappointing when a great little item is not handled with care.  I agree with prior reviewers that sometimes there are more  oken bits than crackers.  But, they really are good. Nice bite size snack.          These have a rich tasty cracker goodness; the cheesy flavor & texture comes through very strongly. No doubt about it, these are white cheddar cheese crackers and there is a generous amount of cheese baked in. Exceptionally good. Repeat buyer & will be again.
