Nutiva Hemp Shake blends the best out of any other shake I've tried, and I am a big fan. That being said, I just wanted to give people a heads up about the chocolate flavor: it has a very strong mocha after taste. If you're like me and don't like coffee, this is a surprise. Luckily, I first bought the sample package off the Nutiva website so I wasn't stuck with a whole canister. I much prefer the berry pomegranate or amazon acai flavors. This is a fantastic product as long as you have the right flavor :)
