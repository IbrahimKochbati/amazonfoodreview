I bought this seasoning at a local store and now I can't find it... Lawry's told me it's a new product and I would have to buy it off of the Amazon.com site.  I'll have to be patient I guess because it's not available here either it looks like!  This seasoning is fabulous!!  My husband is not fond of chicken and he really likes it!!  I like chicken and am on a low carb diet and this fits the bill!! If you're in an area where you can buy it, try it!!!  They (Lawry's) have out done themselves on this one!!!
