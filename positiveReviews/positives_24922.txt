my german shepherd loves these.  he's very picky about both his food and treats so it was a relief to find something he likes.  the package recommends giving him 4 6 day but that seems excessive  usually two or three throughout the day makes him happy.  they are in small strips, much like jerky  much less disgusting than some of his other treats, such as pigs feet ears.  i will definitely continue to purchase.
