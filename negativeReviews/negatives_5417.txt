Since I love French Roast, I was happy to get a sample of this particular roast. I opened the sealed bag and smelled the contents, which were not as robust smelling as the French Roast I have been used to. I  ewed a cup, and tasted it:          1) Black no sugar    rubbery after taste     2) Black, with sugar    mitigated the rubbery after taste which was still there     3) Cream and sugar    removed the rubbery after taste, was pleasant and smooth but not as rich and aromatic as the French Roast I am used to.          After four cups (not in the same day) my stomach WAS happier than when on "normal" coffee   I determined that the rubbery after taste was there to stay. However, the coffee WAS smooth and definitely not acidic. But, it's a sad trade off: low acid, rubbery taste (unless you mask it with cream soy and sugar honey). Hopefully something can be done to "tweak" those "settings".
