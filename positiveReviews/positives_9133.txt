So far have tried two flavors, this and oat & raisins and prefer the other better. This flavor tastes a little bland compared to the other for some reason even though it has more ingredients. But it's not inedible or anything, just a little bland.          As for whether it helps you feel full.... I'd say it doesn't for me cause it's just a 3oz size afterall and I'm used to eating a lot more. But I always skip  eakfast so eating this is better than nothing considering studies show  eakfast is the most important meal of the day. Eating  eakfast also helps you lose weight and raise metabolism.          I'd give the taste 3 stars but bought it for amazing $2 (17 cents each cookie) so price gets 5 stars which avg out to 4 stars.
