Let me first say that I don't eat cereal as a general rule.  I just don't like it.  I don't drink milk EVER, so eating dry cereal isn't always a treat.  I purchased a box of this for my husband.  I ended up trying some because it just looked so pretty in the bowl....and I was HOOKED!  This cereal is tasty and healthy and I eat it everyday now with my yogurt.  I can't give it enough stars!
