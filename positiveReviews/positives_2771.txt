Chocolate with coconut!  How can you lose?          I love Ross Chocolates.  You can really tell that they are made of top quality chocolate.  It is creamy and flavorful.          I enjoy these (and I buy several flavors...all have the same great quality and taste) especially because I try to keep my sugar intake to a minimum.  I keep a supply of them in my refrigerator in airtight containers at all times.  They keep very nicely.
