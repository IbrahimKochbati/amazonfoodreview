I'm all for healthier, crunchy snacks. Popchips works for me in this category. Popchips Sweet Potato is gluten free too! These chips have a very, slight sweet flavor with a hint of salt. They don't have a strong sweet potato flavor.          These chips aren't fried or baked, but are cooked using heat & pressure until they pop. They are all natural with no preservatives, no artificial flavors or colors, no cholesterol, no saturated fat & no trans fat. They are vegan & gluten free. 28gr of Popchips Sweet Potato have 50+% less fat per serving when compared to 28 grams of regular fried potato chips. (28g of Sweet Potato Popchips has 4g of fat; 28g of regular fried potato chips has 10g of fat) Keep in mind that this bag of Sweet Potato Popchips is 23 grams with 3g of total fat.

I give it 4 stars. Since I'm writing this review, I'm sticking with the 4 star rating.
