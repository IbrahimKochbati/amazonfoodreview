I tried this coffee, even though it was significantly more expensive than the Green Mountain (organic, free trade) Sumatra that I have been using for some time. Wolfgang Puck has the name and the rep.          If this were the only Sumatra dark roast on the market, I'd be really happy with it. This is good coffee.          It is not outstanding coffee. Compared to Folgers, this product is awesome. Unfortunately for Mr. Puck, I am comparing it to Green Mountain Sumatra.          The organic and free trade Sumatra from Green Mountain is better to my taste, and it is cheaper. Mornings are good.
