A friend  ought a bag of this tea back from a trip to Taiwan, and shared it with his coworkers. I was amazed when I drank my first cup. The best word to describe the mouth feel is buttery. It's a wonderful, clear and elegant tasting tea. I've never had anything like it, and can't wait for it to become available. Everyone he shared it with wants to buy some. A Japanese friend who has been drinking green tea all her life said it was a special experience to taste this tea. Please offer it soon!
