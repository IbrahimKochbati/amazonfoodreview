We had candied chestnuts that came in a box in France many years ago and have since looked for them in the states.  This year I searched the internet and wa la there were some products to try.  There were some products more expensive and because the product would be shipped we did not want to be spending a lot for something not that good.  These came in a can with syrup which was different than the ones we had had in France but they are excellent.
