the pre measured bags are quick and convenient, but the popcorn is too salty for my taste buds. I made several batches for my daughter's slumber party. Some kids liked the popcorn, and some kids thought it was too salty and didn't eat it. Unless you like very salty popcorn, I would look for another  and. Lastly, it wasn't as fresh tasting like at our local movie theatre, which uses Orville Redenbacher. I'm going to google and see what Orville Redenbacher makes for kettle popcorn makers.
