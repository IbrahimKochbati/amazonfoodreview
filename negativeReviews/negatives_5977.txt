Bought one of these from a pet store for my dog. I always try to give her natural minimally processed chews and treats, she goes through a lot of bully sticks, pig ears, & himalayan chews.  The label didn't say what this was made of & I thought it was a bully stick or other bit of dried bull anatomy like a large tendon. Nice that it's odor free but the texture seemed unusual, it's sort of soft & chewy like a heavy dried dough, not tough & durable like a normal bully stick.  My 20lb bicha poo ate the whole 12" stick in about a half an hour. After looking it up online I discovered that it's not natural meat at all but a man made "fake" bully stick.  Ingredients: Potato starch, meat by product, corn starch, sorbitol, liver, cellulose, water, egg, lecithin, calcium stearate, titanium dioxide, caramel color, sorbic acid.  I won't be buying these again: Full of weird ingredients, not natural, and it does not last.
