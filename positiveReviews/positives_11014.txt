My pug loves these chews. When I accidentally leave the door open where I keep them, she has her nose in there looking for them. They are her final treat of the day and she can hardly wait for them. After eating her food she jumps up on the chair and stares at me or if I don't see her she barks at me until she gets my attention so I can look and see she ate her food. Then she runs over to the closet waiting for me to give her one. I wish I could be so  easily placated and satisfied.
