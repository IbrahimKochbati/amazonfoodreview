This coffee is a medium roast and it tastes like a medium roast.  It has some of the good qualities of true Kona, mild and tasty.  I can't afford true 100% Kona anymore, but this is an economical replacement.  So I use this coffee everyday since discovering it about 5 pounds (of coffee) ago.  as long as the price stays reasonable, I'll be drinking this coffee.  Occasionally I will drink a light or dark  ey, but for Kona, a medium roast gives me the taste I like.  I drink about 6 cups of coffee a day because 6 cups a day is magic and a healthy part of my diet.....
