This is the best sandwich topping ever!  I grew up eating Branston Pickle on my cheddar cheese and ham sandwiches, so it holds lots of good memories for me.  It has a deliciously sweet and tangy taste   some say (e.g., my wife) it is an acquired one   and nice crunchiness from the pickled vegetables.  I cannot say enough good things about it!
