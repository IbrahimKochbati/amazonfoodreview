This coffee (er, koffee) is superb!  I am lucky enough to live where this is roasted.  I can get my Kinetic fix at the local grocery stores.  You can taste the care put into this flavorful espresso.  Living in a small town, I happen to know the roasters.  You would be hard pressed to find better people.  They are active participants of the "Great Arcata to Ferndale World Championship Cross Country Kinetic Sculpture" race.  If you haven't heard of it, look it up.  We are a strange people, here in Arcata.
