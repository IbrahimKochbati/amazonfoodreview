I bought bottles of this stuff because of its purity.  I have a VPI record washing machine to get the gunk out of the grooves in my record collection.  You basically scrub the records and vacuum the glop off using a mix of water and detergent.  This water is so pure it ever sinks deeper in the grooves and is a visably better penetrating fluid compared to distilled water much less tap (OH NO!) water with all its impurities.  You wouldn't believe how great my records play once they are deep cleaned.  My wife can always tell when I am playing vinyl instead of a CD "It just sounds more alive"   she says.  This water is highly recommended for this purpose.  I may even drink some of it sometime to see what all the fuss is about.
