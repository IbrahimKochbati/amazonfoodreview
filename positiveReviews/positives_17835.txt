My dogs love these treats.  My little dogs "ask" for them at least once a day.  My big dogs (outdoor) love these too!  When I give them one I have to watch for my fingers!!!  This is the only treat they get so excited over.  They are always whole ears and I love the resealable bags.  If you haven't tried these for your dogs...I say "go for it!"
