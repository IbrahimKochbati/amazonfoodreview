Not quite an ounce...100 calories...great taste and texture...huge fan of BBQ chips but this stands in quite nicely.  Trick will be to stop at one bag. Highly recommend them...as well as Pirates Booty and Vita Tops...trifecta of snacks that go great with my mission to eat healthy.  Now if they could only make a great substitute for peanut M & M's.  Maybe it's better that they don't.
