Little lesson on TRUFFLES...     Truffles graded "Extra" are larger than most, the second highest in truffle quality. Best when used at the conclusion of the cooking process, to release all their aroma and perfume. Chefs suggest to slice or shave thinly over pastas, risottos and omelets. Whole  entire truffles  are marked " ushed" (which means they have been cleaned of any soil or dirt), preserved in  ine or truffle juice  which can be discarded or use to flavor sauced or  oths  and are ready to use.          Preserved truffles are a nice, budget friendly way to add VISUAL truffle appeal to dishes. However, if you are looking to add the pungent aroma and taste of truffles to your dish, chefs recommend that you explore fresh truffle selections. Jarred or canned truffles, sold by vendors, are mere shadows of their fresh truffle selves and will not, by themselves, deliver the aroma or flavor of fresh truffles. They are great to use with truffle oil   the oil will add the flavor, the preserved truffles the truffle "look", but preserved truffles should be used only to garnish a dish, or in conjunction to truffle butter and oil during those times when fresh truffles are out of season or when the budget doesn't allow for the real thing.     NOTE: Preserved truffles out of the jar or can have almost NO FLAVOR or odor. If you are looking for the true flavor of a fresh truffle, then please go to seek fresh truffle pages online and purchase a fresh truffle. If you're looking to add a truffle LOOK only to your dish, then this is the product for you.          Better to buy real truffle oil & experiment, for example "JR Mushrooms & Specialties" on Amazon, is a good start  about 10 dollars is low commitment that is in line with a superior bottle of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).
