Serendipity 3 Frrrozen Hot Chcolate Mix Gift Package and several packs of the hot chocolate mix.       In October, 2007 I purchased the gift set along with several packs of the hot chocolate mix to be used as stocking stuffers at Christmas.  Sometime in late November or early December I read a very short article in our local paper that read:     "Health inspectors close restaurant"       "While serendipity may be the art of finding pleasant things by chance, what health inspectors found at cele ated eatery Serendipity 3 was not very agreeable."       "Officials closed the restaurant Wednesday night after it failed its second inspection in a month.  An inspector spotted a live mouse and mouse droppings, fruit flies, house flies and more than 100 live cockroaches."       "Both inspections revealed rodent and fly infestation and conditions conducive to pest infestation, including stagnant water in the basement, the department said."       Needless to say, approximately $60 of hot chocolate mix was thrown away.  I would never purchase any products from Serendipity 3 again, even if it was a "must have" by Oprah. If there were a half star or less, it would be rated for this product.
