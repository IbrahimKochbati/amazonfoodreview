we tried some other organic baby foods lately and she loved them but unfortunately she hates HATES HATES this food.  She's never had such a reaction to any food before but actually cried and screamed at the first taste of this.  I guess it's just not for her.  We've given her other foods from happy baby and she's loved them but this one she will not eat.  Too bad I bought a huge package!
