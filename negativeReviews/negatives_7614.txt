I purchased 10 of these because they are so hard to find in our local stores.  The tablets are just as I've used before, but the plastic dispensers (2 so far) don't work correctly.  In fact, I'm beginning to wonder if they're factory "rejects".  So, if you can deal with the fact that you may get a bunch of powder from the tablets before one even comes out of the dispenser, than this product should be OK for you.  Hopefully I'll have better luck with the remaining 8 dispensers.
