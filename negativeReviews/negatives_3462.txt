Not bad but I found it has more of a "carob" flavor than the rich chocolate taste of the Gluten Free Pantry Chocolate Truffle Brownie mix.  I am a chocolate lover and this product was a disappointment to my taste buds.  I tried it because I love Pamela's baking mix.  I went back to the Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix   far superior taste and texture.
