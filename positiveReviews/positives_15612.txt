This is an edit so I was unable to change my star rating.  At first I was happy with this canned cat food until the trouble began.  It has caused severe diarrhea in both of my cats who were eating it.  Now I'm in the process of trying to get things back on track.  As anyone who has been in this situation knows, the negative impacts of the situation affect the entire household, not just the poor cats who are suffering from it.
