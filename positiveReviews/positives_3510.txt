When it comes down to Melitta, they definitely have known for all this time, what it takes to really made a great cup of coffee. With their Cafe Collection, they definitelly  ing out the best in flavors for all kinds of coffee lovers, and that is really a strong aroma. With their Rivera Sunset, they definitely  ing out a decaffinated taste that feels like it is full of pep at the beginning of the morning. I really love it. The taste is strong and the intimate aroma is just delightful. All in all, I absolutely recommend this as a great treat in the morning to wake up and enjoy.
