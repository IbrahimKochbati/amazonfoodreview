Review is for the apple cinnamon variety, but I am sure that many ingredients are the same            I bought this oatmeal to eat at work, thinking it would be healthier than the typical Quakers oatmeal.  I immediately noticed that it wasn't as sweet, but then I noticed that it was giving me headaches and making me jittery too.  I thought   well, it's probably because my body is expecting sugar, and isn't getting enough from this  and.          Today I took a few spoonfuls and it was so awful again   I decided to read the ingredients list.  I get a bad reaction to sweeteners, but I thought   the box said all natural, there can't be artificial sweeteners in this ... Little did I know there are two decaffeinated teas in the ingredients (decaf has 30% of the caffeine of regular tea) that's what was probably causing my jittery feelings, and there is plenty of garbage artifical ingredients in here including guar gum and "Activin grape seed extract"   what???  I am guessing that some of the sweeters that I am quasi allergic to are in here as well.          Basically this product is misleading, tastes gross, and can probably cause bad reactions in many people that don't react well to the loads of caffeine and lots of other artificial ingredients listed in the ingredients list.  I can't believe that so many people rated it well   maybe they are related to the owners of the  and.
