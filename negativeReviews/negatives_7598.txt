don't know where this tea comes from but found two dehydrated human? hairs in the bag already. they areb't my own so... its kinda disgusting.          i feel bad writing this because the tea is good but the company really should look closer at how this tea is being processed. finding black long curly hair dried up and stuck to the leaves of the tea is not my idea of wonderful.
