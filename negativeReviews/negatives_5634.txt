After sampling a bag of Pop Chips, I was excited about buying a large box from Amazon and stocking up on these healthy but tasty snacks. The chips themselves are a bit airy and they kind of dissolve in your mouth after you crunch into them, and they pack a lot of flavor! However, after the first couple of bags, I found the flavor was overwhelming and that the aftertaste was a bit too salty for my taste. The product itself is good, but the quantity was just too much for our household! Be sure you can eat 12 bags of these chips before they go stale, or just stick to buying one bag at a time at your local grocery store.
