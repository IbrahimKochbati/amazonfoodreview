My 2 year old inteligent Red Heeler had this treat out of the puzzle ball and devoured in about 25 minutes.  However, my 12 year old "not that smart" Chow mix couldn't get the treat out of the puzzle and licked the treat for hours, until the Red Heeler got a hold of it.  So, if you have a "not so smart" dog this is a good product.  But if your dog is smart it's not worth the price.
