i have this strong flavorful mahogany coffee by caribou in my Keurig.  I love the taste.  I do like strong coffee and this seems to be the right blend of strong to medium.  I use a vanilla diet supplement in the coffee every morning with a splash of torani sugar free syrup and there is  eakfast on the move.   "
