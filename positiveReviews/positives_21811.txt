lots of uses for this green tea...          I generally like most tea (though not the over ally flowery blends)...          Being on more of a health kick in recent years, I have added a lot more GREEN tea to my diet in one form or another...     from straight  ewed tea &lt;  hot or iced...          To adding the powder to things like salad dressings, smoothies, baked goods, etc.          I am not new to green tea....as I first started drinking it when living in Japan some 30+ years ago....     in the ground form known as matcha.     A quality product. Dissolves well.          I like both the unsweetened and the lightly sweetened.
