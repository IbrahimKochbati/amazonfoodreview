Hi. I bought this chorizo cantimpalo,  because in Chicago, there is no where to be found and it is part of some of my most regular recipes. The quality of the texture of this chorizo is really good and so is the flavor. The service from the company that actually sell it, was outstanding. All in all, it is a great product and one that I had kept going back to buy, along with the serrano ham.
