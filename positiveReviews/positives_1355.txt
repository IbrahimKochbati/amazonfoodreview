These are by far one of the most tasty chips available in the market. It's not greasy, doesn't leave a strong after taste as compared to other chips available in the market.  First time time tasting it was during the Natural Product Expo West 2009 in Anaheim, fell in love with it almost right away.          The only thing I can complain about this product was probably the price, which is higher compared to chips of other  ands.  In addition, the barbeque flavor and the original flavor are slightly salty compare to the rest of the flavor in the variety pack.          Amazon's pricce on this item, along with the subscription discount made me pull the trigger almost instantaneously.  if you have a costco nearby, you can also purchase this item at a very discounted price, slightly higher than what Amazon offers though.
