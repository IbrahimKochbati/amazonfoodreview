I didn't know what to expect when I purchased this and was surprised to find a bag of fresh, oily, and fragrant beans.  Since this is one of the more affordable Costco coffees, I really wasn't expecting this to trump my favourite  ands!     I'm getting a much richer and smoother coffee than I was with pre ground, vacuum sealed grounds, and beans from any other  and I've tried.     Now I can make equal, if not better coffee than I can drink at coffeehouses!  Unlike some other reviewers I am having no trouble producing a strong, rich espresso from these beans.
