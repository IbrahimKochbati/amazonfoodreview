I store my mugs, creamer, splenda packets and napkins on top of this  and just love it. My coffee maker is next to it (it's like my little coffee station : )) I didn't buy it here though because it's CHEAPER at Bed Bath & Beyond (24.99 + 5.99 shipping   30.98) Here it's 47.95. I am gonna get a 2nd one to stack on top of my first and then put the same stuff i had on it back on top. I recommend this stackable drawer type unit.          [....]
