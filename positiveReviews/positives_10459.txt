First, I have to say my cat loves the Fussie Cat foods. She has a malabsorption problem and switching to Fussie Cat has really helped with the throwing up and loose stools. We've tried almost every variety and am impressed with the quality; hence the 4 star rating. Being able to get this  and with subscribe and save rocks and it saves me a lot of money.          My one complaint is that the Tuna with Shrimp case just came and was full of dented, slightly damaged cans. None of the cans have  oken open or been punctured, but the dents aren't minor and since these are sold as 'new' I shouldn't be receiving dented cans. Hopefully this is just a one off occurrence.
