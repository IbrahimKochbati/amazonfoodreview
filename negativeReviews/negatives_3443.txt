Big Easy used to be one of the best bold blends out there.  NOT ANY MORE. The box of 50 I received about a week ago is one of the most disgusting blends I have ever tasted. Very BITTER, no distinguishable aroma, no flavor complexity, nothing going for it. If I was Emeril I would not want my name associated with it anymore. Maybe this will get straightened out, but while they are playing with the coffee chemistry set this blend is best avoided.
