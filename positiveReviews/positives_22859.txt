I've used these drinks since I discovered them many years ago... started with Red Bulls, but sometimes I just didn't want all that much to drink... so I found the 5 hour energy shots.  Used them almost daily until I couldn't afford them anymore... went to the "Rock On" shot from Walgreens because they were much cheaper and I could the 6 packs 2 for 1... Been using them for over a year and I just saw these so I bought a bunch... at $1 a piece, they are the cheapest and were basically the same as the rest...  They work just as well as the rest.          Ingredients are all similar, some minor differences:  this has an "enzyme blend"...  this also has slightly more of the "energy blend" than others (the energy blend is a combination of Taurine, Malic Acid, Caffeine, among other things).  It has 0 calories, some other products do have a few calories.  This also has a bit of Niacin which can give some a slight tingly feeling in their skin for a few minutes... I've taken Niacin before and gotten that tingly feeling, but don't get that with this drink.  This also has a small bit of Sodium.          The taste is the same as all the other energy drinks.  They all have a slight aftertaste.  I actually like Grape and Berry the best.  The Orange has always been my worst flavor in all the drinks.  Again, they are all similar.  There is no real difference in taste or in aftertaste.          The effect of all these drinks is profound.  Not in a bad way, they make me much more productive at work.  I sit behind a desk most of the day and 1 of these in the morning keeps me alert and more focused throughout the day.  When not at work, I will usually be very lazy around the house, but take one of these, and I'm cleaning the attic in a few minutes, and planning my next activity while doing that!  I don't notice any crash, none at all.  Just don't take it too late in the day.  Anything after 5:00 or so and I won't sleep until well into the morning.  : )          I'm glad these are around.  My wife used to take B12 shots for energy back in the day.  She'd get it from a registered nurse in a gym... until people would walk in on them and think they were doing steroids.  : (  So a shot of this is much more acceptable in public.  : )          Enjoy!
