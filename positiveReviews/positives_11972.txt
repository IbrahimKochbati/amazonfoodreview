We have a miniature Dachshund named Buck. We used this product to house and obedience train him. Now we use this as his daily treat, and he loves it! My Vet. told me this is a nearly prefect low fat treat. As a result of using Pro Treat, we hardly ever have to use a leash while walking Buck. If it were not for local leash laws, we would not own a leash. The only problem I see with this product is the inconsistent size of the peices. It ranges from powder to 1 inch square, and every thing in between. I have done lots of research and Amazon is the best place to buy this stuff
