Just tried the Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers Chicken Teriyaki for lunch today. It's easy to prepare. The rice was fine. However, the "sauce", a  own mixture of mushy, small cubes of chicken, and small tidbits of pineapple, was bland, soft, unappealing and fairly flavorless. I wouldn't buy it again. It wasn't bad; it just wasn't tasty, either. At least it's only about 400 calories.
