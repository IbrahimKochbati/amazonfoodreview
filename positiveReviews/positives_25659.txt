I got this coffee for my god father.  He drinks it by the gallon.  When he saw how much I got, his eyes almost popped out of his head.  It's expiration is about 4 6 months from the day I got it, so I would make sure you can get through it all if you are considering the purchase.  Overall, the coffee smelled great, I didn't drink it, but I haven't heard any complaints from him!          Please remember that this is GROUND, not whole bean. The value is much greater this way because the amount of coffee you are receiving, but some people rather crush it themselves.  It is up to you, but the box smelled like they just ground it at Starbucks the day before!
