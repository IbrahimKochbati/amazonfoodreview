I had read the reviews about coconut water and was unsure whether to try this. It seems the taste either works for some or it doesn't. Some say it is an acquired taste. I do like the taste of guava, so I thought this would be a good way to sample some coconut water. I let it chill fully. Okay, actually I put it in the freezer and forgot about it. Thank goodness the aseptic pack did not burst. Once it was liquid again I gave it a taste and I was very pleased. The "splash" of guava was not overwhelming to me, as pure nectar can tend to be. It complemented (masked?) the flavor of the coconut water and was quite refreshing. Pure coconut water is not sweetened, as this one is, so that is a consideration for some. I think I am ready to try some of the pure coconut water now. There are other flavors of this type, too. I really liked this product.
