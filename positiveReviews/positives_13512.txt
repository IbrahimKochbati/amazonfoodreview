I love this hot chocolate  !  this is just a great drink    the first couple times I made it I didn't do it correctly and it didn't so good     You have to nuke the bar of chocolate for 30 seconds in microwave    and you have to put in blender    so all ingredients blend     if you don't you will have a chalky and that would be sad      what I have learned is  put chocolate in microwave     put your milk in sauce pan and warm it up     add chocolate and stir      when the chocolate melts put into a blender or I use immersion blender to get all spices blended      yeah and then you have the best hot chocolate in the world     how can you go wrong with big beautiful piece of chocolate ?  all other hot chocolate drinks are kind of boring compared to this
