While this coffee is lower acid than a normal French roast, the flavor isn't quite as deep and rich as you'd expect from a French roast. French roast is typically my favorite type of roast. The aroma is nice after  ewing, but smelling this coffee right out of the pack it smells plastic like. Also, I found that this coffee had a quite strong bitter taste.          Though, I did notice that this coffee did seem to be easier on my stomach. I'm sure this might work well for someone who loves coffee, but, has a sensitive stomach.          Overall, a basic French roast nothing too spectacular. Might be good for someone who wants a low acid coffee who is willing to sacrifice the typical French roast depth of flavor. Though in my opinion this coffee is way overpriced as the flavor is lacking and it still manages to be bitter.
