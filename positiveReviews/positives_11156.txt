I ran across this coffee when looking for a dark and 'bold' coffee.  I've always called that "a good strong cup of coffee".     This coffee meets my criteria for that.  It is not bitter and doesn't leave a bad coffee taste in your mouth.          I'm a tightwad so the $.55 Kcup appealed to me also.  Sometimes I add a teaspoon of my favorite instant and rotate the Kcup 180 deg. and run it through again.  This gives me a second good cup of coffee at reduced prices.:)          I will buy more of the Big Easy Bold.
