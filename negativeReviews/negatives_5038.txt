I was all excited to find a toy that my smart, chew happy dog could play with. What I did not keep in mind, is that she is scared of anything that relates to people, even if it has food in it (she is a shelter rescue). She likes me getting food out for her, but never got into bouncing it around to figure out how to get food out herself. Two weeks later it is lying in a corner, ignored, full of yummy treats. I still think this toy has great potential, but I don't recommend it for a timid dog, that gets spooked easily. My dog loves her Kong chew toys. I was hoping to find something that will take longer to get the treats out.
