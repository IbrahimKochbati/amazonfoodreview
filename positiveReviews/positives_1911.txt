I started drinking coconut water when it was suggested to me by a friend.  I never really loved the taste of it, but I spend a great deal of time in the desert and I just can't seem to suck down enough water without getting waterlogged, so I was excited when I found flavors.  I know that recently it's become trendy and much harder for me to find, but my friends have been drinking it for years, as has my yoga instructor, and they highly recommend it for drinking not only for sports, but also to keep hydrated.  Plus, it's done wonders for my always dry skin.          If nothing else it's a great avoid a hangover cure if drunk before going to bed, and if your partied too much to avoid being sick it seems to work much better than Pedialyte to get your electrolytes back in balance.
