I too have been "bugged" by black flying insects in my Miracle Gro potting soil. I've thrown out bug contaminated soil, and sprayed with insect killer.  I went online to see if others were having the same problem with Miracle Gro soil, and they have.  I also wrote an email to Scott's, the company that manufactures Miracle Gro, and am hoping to get a response (probably not, but you never know!)  In the meanwhile, I'm going to see if I can find a cleaner soil to pot my plants in.
