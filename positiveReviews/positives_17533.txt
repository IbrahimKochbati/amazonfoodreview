The jerky GODS sat high atop Mt. Olympus and pondered how they could make a delicious jerky that combines both beast and foul.  The solution was OSTRIM and the result is amazing!  This high protein, low fat tasty stick of goodness is the perfect snack on the go.  I pack this in my kids lunch boxes, in my workout bag and in my bedside drawer for a late night snack (kidding  but I totally could!)!  If you havent tried this yet  do it!
