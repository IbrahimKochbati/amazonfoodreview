This may not be the best truffle oil out there but for the price, it's very good, especially for an avid home cook. This oil is very aromatic and the flavor stands up well in soups and other foods. I use it a lot in soups. The best part for me is that this is affordable enough to try on all sorts of dishes I make at home. I've had truffle oil infused dishes at fine restaurants and I think the biggest difference, for my palate, is that the more expensive oils are slightly smoother in after taste. My husband can't tell the difference. But that is mostly due to the type of olive oil used from what I've been told, which makes sense since olive oil taste varies from  and to  and (and quality!). Nonetheless, I think the Urbani White Truffle Oil is a great way to add that extra dazzle to meals at home without sacrificing taste or money.
