Okay, I don't ever buy instant oatmeal like this, we buy bulk organic quick oats and add  own sugar. I have always found instant oatmeal in the little packs to not have good flavor despite all the additives and I always want to add more sugar to make it taste better.  For the most part this oatmeal lived up to my expectations.  I will admit that compared to other maple flavored  ands I've tried this one was better, but still, I would not buy this again, and one of my daughters said she didn't like it and won't eat it again, glad I only got one box.  We use genuine maple syrup in our household, and even keep maple sugar for sprinkling on toast, so we are big maple fans, and I guess with genuine maple fans artificial flavor just doesn't cut it.  I even felt like it wasn't quite sweet enough even though it had more sugar in it than the Cinnamon and Spice flavor oatmeal.  Because it has better flavor than other  ands of maple flavored oatmeal I've tried, I gave it a 3 stars, saying it was OK is about right.
