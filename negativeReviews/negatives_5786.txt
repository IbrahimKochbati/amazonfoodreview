These bones are just gross.  First of all, they are not wrapped tight enough to keep them fresh.  When you open them up, they just smell old.  They are dry and  ittle and  eak just by touching them.  I gave one to my 2 year old lab and within seconds it was splintering.  I threw the entire pack away, along with the pack of smokehouse knuckles I bought at the same time.  GROSS. I would not recommend these.  Ask the meat man has way better quality products. Real bones for Real dogs, not this fake crap.  Don't buy!
