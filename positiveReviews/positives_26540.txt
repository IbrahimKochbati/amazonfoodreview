I just received my order from 1 Quick cup of this coffee today and was never so anxious to try a Kcup due to all the raving reviews. I  ewed it in my B40 @ the 9.25 mug size and added cream and a sugar substitute. This is a wonderfully blend; not harsh not weak and it doesn't try to be something it is not. I know that sounded a bit odd but that was my first impression. This is my third cup this afternoon so I would like to try another cup without the nuances of the other kcups on my palate          Not to be redundant from what the other reviewers have written; it's very mellow yet rich and doesn't bite back and leaves no harsh after taste. Can't wait to try it later @ the 7.25 mug size.          UPDATE: Well I just had my Caribou @ the 7.25 mug size and it was as delicious as the larger mug size. A bit more after taste but again not offensive. Though I read that this coffee is a medium roast, to me, it tastes more like a light roast which I seem to gravitate to. I will  ew it @ the larger mug size just so I can enjoy it longer. Caribou differently hit the nail on the head with this one. So it wins a spot on my top ten favorite Kcups list.
