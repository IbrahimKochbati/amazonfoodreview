After purchasing the Kyjen 6 squeaker snake from PetsMart and realizing that it was a great toy I quickly looked up Kyjen online and found purchased several other toys.  One of which was this treat wheel.  I have an American Bulldog Chow mix who I think is pretty smart but I was still worried that she wouldn't be able to figure out the puzzle.  She figured out how to lift off the yellow cups fairly quickly but it took her a few tries to figure out how to spin the wheel.  She's got it down to an art now and loves playing with this puzzle.  I am also amazed at the fact that she has not destroyed chewed any part of this puzzle as she has destroyed almost all of her other toys.  I would definitely recommend this product to others who want to challenge their dog.
