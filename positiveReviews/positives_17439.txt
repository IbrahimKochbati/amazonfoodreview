I first got acquainted with Walkers Short ead during my first travels to England about 40 years ago.  They were addictive then and even better now.  Unfortunately, they are really too good and the temptation to eat more than one is a battle I have to fight every day.  If you have never had the chance to eat Walkers Short ead, now is the time to start.
