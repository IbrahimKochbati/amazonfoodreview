This is not a deeply roasted or rich tasting coffee at all.  It's very light, with unevenly sized beans    clearly a blend.  Some beans are normal size and some are tiny.  The hazelnut aroma and flavor is good, but this coffee is not strong at all    even using twice as many grounds, I could not get enough coffee flavor from these beans.          People who like very weak coffee will probably love this.  People who like Starbucks will not like this one bit.
