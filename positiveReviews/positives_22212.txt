My son has several allergies.  We were looking for anything that we could use that would pass as  ead for his school lunches.  We were just hoping that it would be good enough, but we were surprised with Chebe.  It is actually very good.  We all liked it.  With the second batch we tried to make, the dough came out very sticky.  We called Chebe customer service and they helped us figure out the problem.  Very fast and friendly.  They even replaced the goofed up batch.  It is perfect for sandwiches at lunch and with jelly on it for  eakfast.
