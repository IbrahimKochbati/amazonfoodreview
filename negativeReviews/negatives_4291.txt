Sure it tasted ok, but I drank it and about an hour later I had the worst reaction to this drink. My skin started flushing horrible and I began to itch. I felt like I was on COCAINE, and it gave me a panic attack! I am not kidding, I was extremely paranoid and had a hard time talking. It gave me a sore stomach all day and I completely lost my appetite. I went outside and the sun was intolerable, so weird. I puked twice from it. I have NO IDEA what they put in here, but it is not FDA approved and I would stay away from this. It's a non approved dietary suppliment, look at what happened to people with metabolife! It killed people! It made me sick all day and I had to go to my friends house so they could watch me, because I live alone.
