I found it delicious, and found it shocking that I was able to drink at all, since I have not been able to drink much coffee at all for the past few years because of a really bad case of GERD.  I think Puroast so far is the best  and of coffee that I've tried in quite a while without resorting to the Toddy maker.  However, I still had some heartburn with this coffee, despite the fact that I'm also on Nexium.          Everyone is different when it comes to toleration of acid, so I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying this coffee.  But I did want to warn those who suffer from bad cases of GERD, that you may not be able to drink Puroast either.
