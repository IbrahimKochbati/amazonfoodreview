Yes, I did purchase 12 6 Ounce packets of Claey's Root Beer Drops. The reasons I think they are just okay are my own.  Late night computer shopping sometimes makes me order haphazardly.  I like the candies fine.  They have an intense anise flavor, which borders on strong licorice.  They are not individually wrapped, which is stated right on the order page, but I overlooked.  They are coated with dried sugars, much like a lemon drop.  The candies get softer as you consume them, which plays hard ball with my dental work.  They taste delicious, but I find them harder to carry around with me everywhere I go.
