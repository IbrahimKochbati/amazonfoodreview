I searched for unsweetened cranberries on the Amazon website. These come up. The bag is folded a bit in your picture so the "sweetened with apple concentrate" is not clear. This food is loaded with sugar. I'll give them away, since I can't return them. You need to fix the search on this product so it does not come up as "unsweetened cranberries."
