My Australian Shepherd and Border Collie love this bone. I just wish it lasted longer. The icky white bones lasted a little while, but this did not. It lasted a few hours, but that was fine because they would not let it out of their sight! A good distraction when you need one lol! They never stopped chewing this bone. Wait yes they did, they stopped when the other would attempt to get a taste! They had to defend there bone of course.
