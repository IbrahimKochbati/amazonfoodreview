We have been using this product for our dogs since one had to have his teeth done by the vet and had oral surgery and needed to be put to sleep (temporary sleep that is) until done. Since then,  ushing a few times a week and this product has been good. Went to vet two days ago and he said to keep doing what we are doing. The other dog never had this procedure done and vet says teeth are good. You MUST  ush teeth, but we use this item approximately every other day and it is working. Spend the money!
