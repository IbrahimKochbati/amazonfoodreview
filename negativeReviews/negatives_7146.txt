Holy barf bag, the jalapeno Popchips are FOUL. I love the original Popchips and I really love Jalapeno, but for some reason the Popchips people just couldn't get the flavor right. I tried one, gagged, and handed the bag off to my dad to try. He was munching cautiously when I mentioned I thought they tasted a bit like garbage. He paused, considered, and said, "That's it. That's the taste. There's something gym socky about it." Save your money!
