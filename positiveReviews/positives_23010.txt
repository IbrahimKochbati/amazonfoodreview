Love the cereal!  But a word to the wise regarding purchasing the 6 pack via the Subscribe and Save program...  the price on this item seems to fluctuate significantly.          When I first ordered it in Jan. 2011 (and signed on to periodically reorder at a 90 day interval via Subscribe and Save) the price was $9.62.  When my next shipment arrived, it cost $11.87 (approx. 25% higher than before).          The current price on this item is $17.57, including the 15% Subscribe and Save discount (an 85% increase in the price of the item since I originally started the Subscribe and Save program for this item.          While I suspect this phenomenon could happen with any Subscribe and Save item, I was surprised by the variability in price and wanted to offer a "heads up" to my fellow Subscribe and Savers as well as prospective purchasers.
