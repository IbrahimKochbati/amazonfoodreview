Our two beagles seemed to prefer Newman's over MilkBone.          With each dog, we conducted two separate sniff taste tests between Newman's Own Lamb and Barley Dog treat and the small size MilkBone Essentials Plus Optimal Health Biscuits. We figured the MilkBone product was more like the Newman's than the fake dog jerky a.k.a. dog crack  we also had on the shelf. The tests took place after they had eaten meals.          The test subjects were     1.  Maggie   the almost 9 year old vacuum cleaner beagle who will eat anything, especially if it comes out of a plastic bag (have to warn visitors who  ing their toiletries in zip bags because she will take the bags outside).     2. Lucy   the 8 year old rescue beagle we took in, who is pickier about her chow, but can sniff out anything food related from 4 feet away (she could have a career sniffing out illegal food in luggage, seriously).          The test method was to hold 1 2 of a Newman's treat in one hand and a Milkbone in the other. First we let them smell our hands with the treats inside our fists. Then we did the switcheroo behind our back and put them out in open palms.          Both dogs preferred the smell of Newman's after  eakfast and went for the little square as soon as we opened our hands.          The sniff part of the after dinner tests were a little inconclusive. Maggie went for the Newman's completely. But Lucy was a little confused at first. She kept sniffing the Milkbone hand initially    but we believe there was contamination problem with the test because I had just eaten a Cheez It. After the old switcheroo, she went for the Newman's instantly.          So, the dogs preferred to eat the Newman's, but Lucy initially preferred the faint smell of Cheez Its contaminant in one sniff test session.          From a cookie giver's perspective, Newman's did not have an overwhelming gross smell to it. The bag it comes in has a zip top, so they may keep their scent longer than the average Milkbone turning stale inside a cardboard box.          Note: I did think the obviously Photoshopped Paul Newman graphic on the packaging was a little creepy. I'm sure he hadn't had arms that looked like that since "Cool Hand Luke." It might be time to just let his image rest in peace.
