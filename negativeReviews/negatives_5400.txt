It smelled good, I thought this could be good as I  ewed my first pot of this Coffee. I wanted it to be good, but after the first few sips I got bitter after taste. The idea of it is good, French Roast is usually sweet and tasty. This has this bitter undertone, not sure if that has something to do with the removeal of acidic properties. Also it's pretty expensive for it not to taste like a fine  ewed coffee. Overall I don't think I could pay for this, even though I like the idea of a less acidic Coffee. Maybe if they could lose the bitter taste, but after two pots of it that taste is prominent. So a no go for me.
