You can't make a better cup of regular coffee flavored coffee than Green Mountain Nantucket Blend at home. I had been trying in every way imaginable for nearly forty years to accomplish this. However sometimes I feel like something a tad bit lighter for that first cup in the morning. Enter Green Mountain Breakfast Blend. It's exactly what that first cup calls fall. A slightly lighter version of Nantucket Blend, yet it still has the subtle punch you're looking for.
