My 17 yr old son loves these.  He eats the entire box of bars in two weeks.  Literally.  I like them too, but they rarely last long enough in the house for me to get one.  Chewy, just sweet enough, yum.  Kiddo is gluten free and refined sugar free and these are among his favorite snacks.  I love that they give Mr. 5% Body Fat with the metabolism of, well, a 17 year old boy, enough carbs to get through his school day (33g) in a form that is convenient enough for him to eat between classes.  Lunch alone is not enough, he has to eat between classes.  Yes, I know, if I could get some more protein into his snacks that would stick with him longer, but I also have to send what he will eat, and he eats these, whereas the other bars came back home.  Also, buying in bulk like this is a significantly better price than buying from the co op.
