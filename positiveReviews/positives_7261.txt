Patak's Chilli Pickle     This is a seriously good pickle from Patak's, with lots of salty heat and endless chunky chilli pieces. I bought it to dip popadoms in, but finished the pot as an accompaniment to slow cooked pork sausages, and it worked beautifully   certainly as well as a full bodied English mustard.          If you like a bit of heat, as well as plenty of flavour, you'll enjoy it.
