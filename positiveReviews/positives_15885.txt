I have an older Newfie and he has had skin problems most of his life.  Unfortunately, he is also a very picky eater, so finding a balance between what he will eat and what is good for him has been tricky.  He really likes this food!  Finally, my worried mom's heart can rest.  His skin issues are clearing and he doesn't scratch like he wants to peel off his skin.  I highly recommend if your dog shares these issues... get this food, mix it with some sensitive skin wet food or even salmon... your dog with thank you!
