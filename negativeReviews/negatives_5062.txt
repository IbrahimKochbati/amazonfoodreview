I bought the largest size available which was described as "medium large" for my 25lb dog.  The toy was delivered and was too big.  The old versions had a rope but now the 'rope' is made out of that purple rubbery stuff that's much more durable and will last longer.  My dog was fine with playing with it on the carpet, but on linoleum or hardwood floors it's way too loud.  And who wants to use it on carpet when food leaves crumbs and stains?  The plastic bangs on the floor and my dog is timid to begin with and can't deal with the noise even with high reward treats.  I also don't want to teach him that making loud noises is okay. I returned this.  They should line the bottom and top sides of the bottle with the rubbery stuff so it isn't so noisy.
