the reason for the poor evaluation is not because of the item.  The lollipops are wonderful BUT, a 1 lb 5 oz box which costs $16.20 has a shipping cost of $15.25!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Almost the same as the cost of the item.          If you go to the website (www.sees.com) in the shipping section you will see that there are a variety of shipping costs depending upon when you want the item.  I just paid $7.25 rather than $15.25 and I'll have to wait a week which is probably as long as I'd have to wait if I had ordered the box from Amazon since there is a disclaimer that says "Processing takes an additional 2 to 3 days for orders from this seller"          Don't get cheated!
