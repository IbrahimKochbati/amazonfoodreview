I've ordered this tea about 3 times before and will order it again.  I first had this tea at a Chinese restaurant and can only find it online.  I don't like black tea and not a fan of green tea so this oolong tea is just right.  I don't make it really strong so I steep it for about 3 1 2 minutes and it's good to drink.
