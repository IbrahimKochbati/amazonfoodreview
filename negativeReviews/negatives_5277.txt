I bought this tea based on Amazon's reviews and because sencha tea supposed to help lowering your cholesterol.  Drinking this first cup, I'm very sure I don't like it.  It has a very strong grassy smell and taste like grass too (more like medicine to better describe the taste).  I will need to mix this tea with some jasmine tea or something to mask the smell and honey to better the taste.  Overall, I think this tea is too expensive at $12 for 2oz.  I'll stick to my two leaves and a bud organic orange sencha from now on.
