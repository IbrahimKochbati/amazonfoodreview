My dog managed to chew threw the rubber tug in less than 30 seconds.  That being said, I can't say that the toy is a total loss.  I turned the leftover part upside down in the jug and it is fairly effective at slowing down the dispensation of the food treats that are inside.  Keeps mine amused for as long as the food is in there
