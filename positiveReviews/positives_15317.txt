I've had my Keurig for about 8 months now.  I've loved having it every day.  My husband gave up coffee, so coffee for one in a traditional coffee maker made for a lot of waste.  OR, I would drink way too much of it!  I love how the coffee turns out, I have variety in the house and can choose which flavor fits my mood.  Mine has never needed to be  descaled, but I try and put filtered water in the reservoir so I don't have to descale it.  It says it needs 4 minutes of priming before  ewing, but I've found it's much quicker.  In less than 4 minutes I've got a piping hot cup of coffee, and all I needed to do was push two buttons and insert the coffee pack.  Easy peasy!  I would recommend this Keurig to everyone!  It's durable and efficient!
