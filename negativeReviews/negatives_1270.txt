So as soon as the delivery guy gave me the package I opened it ready to eat some gummy bears and all I got was a big goo of gummy bears. Due to the heat of the delivery truck it all melted into gel. Of course it is not refundable so now all i have is a bag a liquid multicolored goo. thanks for making me throw away 15 dollars. Good game amazon. So think about if its summer or kinda warm, stop and wait till december.
