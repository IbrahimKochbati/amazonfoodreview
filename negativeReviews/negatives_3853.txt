I'm a bit perplexed wondering what void in the beverage market this is intended to fill.  Imagine a super sweet slightly carbonated juice drink with an almost syrupy consistency and you have The Switch.  I had to drink a tall glass of water after drinking a can of this carbonated candy in a can because it's anything but refreshing.
