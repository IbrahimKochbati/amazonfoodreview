This is a good idea in theory, especially for those like me that prefer healthy salty snacks. Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like these, they didn't taste like food   hard to describe, but the 'primal'  anding doesn't help as I did feel like I was eating something I wasn't supposed to.          While the first one I tried was novel, I easily tired of them and then plain got grossed out by them. I won't be getting these again.
