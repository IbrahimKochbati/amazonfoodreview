The Switch Orange Tangerine is a nice beverage that is lightly carbonated and is made with real fruit juice.  Unlike most sodas, The Switch products are made with real ingredients (none of the High fructose corn Syrup) and it tastes great.  The cans come in a convenient 8.5 ounce can and they're great for lunch or an mid afternoon treat,  If you want a light beverage that's made with the "good stuff" then you'll want to grab a can of The Switch.  Do yourself a favor throw out the HFCS sodas and make "The Switch".
