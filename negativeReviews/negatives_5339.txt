The taste of this  ew is somewhere in between low end Folgers and a high end gourmet  ew with great flavor.  It's not as bad as cheap, commercial coffee but still has a slight hint of that 7 11 gas station Folgers like taste.  I noticed a difference in the acid level, it tastes almost lighter, or cleaner which is a big bonus, especially for people with stomach issues (and everyone eating a western diet tends to have high acidity).  But I would not purchase this product again due to the taste.  It wasn't "high end" tasting enough for me, however I am used to drinking organic gourmet coffee.  If you drink commercial, cheaper coffee I think you would be satisfied with this taste and pleased with the low acid element.
