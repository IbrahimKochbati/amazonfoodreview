As we try to eliminate white sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and artificial sweeteners from our diet, organic maple syrup is a wonderful natural sweetener. Have tried other  ands, grades, and nonorganic. Highland Sugarworks is by far the favorite. We always go back to this one. Perfect on pancakes and waffles, oatmeal, add to a smoothie, drizzle on ice cream. With Amazon's autoship, the price is reasonable. It's delicious. (The kids still prefer the yucky table syrup with artificial everything. Oh, well. We are no longer buying that junk so they'll eventually appreciate the good stuff. Tip: never start with the yucky stuff.)
