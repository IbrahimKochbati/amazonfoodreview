Got this for my husband for Christmas and he LOVES it! Im finding myself sneaking some and we both look forward to trying the next bag since I signed him up for monthly shippings! Altho I havent figured out how to change the flavors, Im sure its with Amazon and not the Wild Ride company. Wouldnt bother either of us to get the same but would love to try all the flavors. Got a great deal and very happy with the quality and amount! Very tender, great flavor and filling as a snack! Husband is looking forward to baseball season to finally have some great jerky to snack on during the games! Recommend to all and makes a great gift that keeps giving!
