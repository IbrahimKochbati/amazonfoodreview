I have suffered from heartburn for years and never thought that it might be due to the coffee I drink so I was very excited to give this a try.  I loved the taste of the coffee and my heartburn might have been a tad bit better, but it wasn't significant.  I guess it is possible that my heartburn is due to something other than the coffee I drink.  I would still recommend this product though because it is very good coffee.
