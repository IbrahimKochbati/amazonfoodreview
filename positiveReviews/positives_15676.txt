Meow.          Typing with my paws is difficult, so please forgive any spelling errors.          I like this food a lot.          Wait, I have to chase a flying insect...          Where was I?  Oh yes, it's tasty, healthy, and reasonably well priced for this quality, especially when you consider that it's eligible for free shipping.          Meow.          The truth is that I like nearly anything that tastes like fish, but I do feel that this this food is especially tasty and I enjoy the variety of flavors.  Of course, I also enjoy the flavor of my own privates, but that is not a proper story for this review.  If you sign up for subscribe and save, the deal is even better.          Meow.
