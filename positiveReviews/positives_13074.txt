Kudos have been around for a long time, but the recent reformulation to make them 100 calorie bars was  illiant! Now, I am back to enjoying Kudos just about any time that I want them.          This is the variety pack that has Snickers bars, M&M bars, and chocolate chip flavored bars   all of which are great! They're made of soft and sweet granola, with the flavor pieces mixed in, chocolate on the bottom, and chocolate drizzled on top. They're very tasty, and surprisingly satisfying for 100 calorie snacks. I am always on the lookout for good 100 calorie snacks, and these babies definitely fill the bill!
