It's hard to review a dog treat past whether or not your dogs ate the one you gave them and then wanted more!  Mind did.  They were happy to have the treat and even happier when they got another one later.  Of course, my dogs are good eaters and one of them, which I rescued from the street when she was about 6 months old and was malnourished, is loathe to ever turn down some food.  (I guess they never forget what it was like to be hungry...)          What more can you say?  They were a hit!
