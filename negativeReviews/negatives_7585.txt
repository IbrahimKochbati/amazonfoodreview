These are NOT true Cross Pack sardines, and they are Scottish, not Norwegian.     These are very large sardines with the front 1 3 cut off, so they'd fit in the tin cross wise.     I have eaten hundreds of 2 layer tins from Season and King Oscar, and these are clearly inferior.     Cross Pack is supposed to be the finest, rarest grade   these aren't that.     If you see these in a store, read the back label carefully!     Season used to be a good  and   what a shame.
