What's create about this pancake mix, besides the pancakes tasting great, is how easy it is to use.  The only thing you add is water, which makes it perfect for kids to make or to cart off on a backpacking trip.  The consistency of the cooked pancakes is just like the gluten filled type so it can be enjoyed by families with both the gluten sensitive and glutenous members.
