Quaker Instant Oatmeal Maple Brown Sugar is an old favorite, and lately it's a new favorite. I like making it in the microwave, but it does tend to boil over, but now I use the Keurig type coffee maker to make two packets at once. Works like a charm. Maple and  own sugar are definitely on my list of favorites, and when I really want a treat, I put in a dab of butter. Oatmeal is one of my comfort foods, and instant is a lot less work. Of course, if you like the texture of steel cut oats, this may not be worth it, but it is for me.
