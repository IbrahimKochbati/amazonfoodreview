Using a modified recipe for a wonderfully sweet and mildly hot mustard (Brown sugar, maple, additional mustard seeds) I prepare and jar, in decorated wire jars, mustards every year for 30 50 very tasty gifts for all my friends and family 'from the kitchen'. You've never tasted a mustard like it, can be used to croil or bar b que, or to salad dressings and sandwiches. The only mustard that works for me for the flavors I want and in the quantities I need is Colmans Mustard powder.
