I want to give my cats as much variety as possible. They are family and they matter. Variety makes them happy. And their health & wellbeing are important. Giving them good, healthy food and treats are apart of showing them how loved they are. Unfortunately, I have to go online to find some treats as the stores don't carry the variety any more.
