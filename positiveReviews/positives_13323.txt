This  ownie mix is super easy to make.  You only add 2 ingredients to it, and it only takes a couple minutes from mix to oven.  It has real chocolate chuncks in the mix, which melts to make it a very yummy tasting  ownie.  Even our friends who don't eat gluten free prefer these to regular mixes.  I always keep a case of this in the closet.
