As my husband enjoys the large crunchy Virginia peanuts I ordered Royal Oak salted peanuts and peanuts from the Peanut Shop of Williamsburg for him.  Hands down, Royal Oak Peanuts in the blue tin are the best choice.  They are very large, crunchy and fresh tasting with just the right amount of salt. The Peanut Shop of Williamsburg peanuts we found to be smaller and they appeared to have an oily film over them.  Not nearly as fresh tasting as Royal Oak Blue label Virginia peanuts. These Royal Oak Peanuts are expensive but worth the treat.  We used to get the Costco  and(Kirkland) of large Virginia peanuts but they have stopped supplying them as of about nine months ago.  I would definitely recommend Royal Oak Peanuts.
