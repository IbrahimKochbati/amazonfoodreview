Bought this at a local market, on sale thankfully, and am fully disappointed. It's bitter and doesn't have great olive flavor, though it is quite a beautiful green color. If you're looking for a mid premium olive oil I'd recommend Alessi or Lucini way over this product and both are in the same price range.
