I'm a big fan of Dunkin Donuts vanilla chai so I was spending a fortune getting at least one a day. This chai mix is a very nice substitute once you fiddle with the directions a bit to make it to your individual taste (e.g. made with 1 2 water and 1 2 milk).I also find it especially appealing when it's made in a hot cocoa machine...comes out hot and frothy.
