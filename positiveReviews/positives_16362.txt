My Italian greyhound LOVES these treats, and I've yet to notice any problems as described by so many other reviewers. My Bella (her name) gets one of these treats about every other day since she's very difficult when it comes to me actually  ushing her teeth. They definitely do the job.          Some people have stated that their dog has choked on these treats or a piece got caught in their intestinal track. Well, I'm not sure how fast your dog tends to eat treats, or how big of a chunk they try to bite off, but that DOES matter when it comes to digestion of anything. My pup eats these treats pretty slowly (as I think she realizes it lasts longer that way), and I make sure I'm in the room while she's eating it. She'll chew off small pieces to eat, not large ones so I'm not sure if that makes a difference but I assume it would.          I also make sure she gets plenty of water afterwards, to wash it down. The person at Petsmart told me these are like crack for dogs. While I can believe that, my iggy has several different types of treats and only gets this one every other day. If I gave her this for everything, I could see it becoming an issue.          Overall, I think these are great, they help to keep my dogs mouth clean so that I'm not having to  ush her teeth quite as much.
