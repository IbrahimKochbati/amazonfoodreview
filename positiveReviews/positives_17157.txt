Much food that is utterly worthless can be, given some diligence, reinvented in a usable form. This is a good example. A normal pretzel has no nutritive value. This has protein and fiber. Some people would argue 'I am just snacking on these, I get my nutrition from my meals.' This would be a weak argument: every time you put stuff in yer body, you want to have some mix of fat protein carbs. Carb only, no fiber food, is not good.          As to spelt, not sure what that cat is talking about, these have pea flour and whole wheat flour?
