I was introduced to Runa guayusa about 6 months ago and I have been drinking it pretty consistently since then. It is a great alternative to coffee, which tends to make me nervous. The taste is mild and almost a little sweet, also it doesn't get bitter like green tea or yerba mate when steeped for too long.          Also Runa's business model makes me feel good about drinking this tea, they are a certified B Corp and they do great work with the farmers in the Amazon.          I highly recommend you try it!
