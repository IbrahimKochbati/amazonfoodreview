I am a devoted fan of the Buffalo Bills jerky products and the new Chipotle Habanero Country Cut is a great addition to the group. Moist, chewy chunks of real beef with the delicious flavor and heat of chipotles and habaneros. If you like your jerky hot and tasty, this is THE one to buy. It is definitely moving to the top of my "must order again" list.   "
