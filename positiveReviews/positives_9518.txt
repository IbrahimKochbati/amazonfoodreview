I absolutley LOVE Gevalia coffee and was SOOOOO happy to see that it is available on Amazon for a reasonable price!  It's cheaper than in any local store. I am definitely a coffee connoisseur and find Gevalia to be the best coffee on the market. French roast has a very deep, bold taste so if you like a more mild flavor, try the Traditional roast... you won't be disappointed!
