Took my dog all of three minutes to figure out there's food inside, and tricks for getting it out! It keeps her busy for hours, it's definitely not easy for her to get to all the food. Her favorite trick: She holds the rope down with one paw, and smarks the bottle with the other paw so that some kibble tumble out! So far, it's holding up well, and she's not exactly gentle with it! Had it for a week, and usually she destroys toys within a day or two...She's 25 pounds. I ordered the small, and it's still big enough that she can't get her whole mouth around the rubber stopper. It also has an actual purple white rope, not a rubber rope like the picture shows. Love it! Will definitely get another one when this one does finally die. Best $10 investment I've made in a very long time.
