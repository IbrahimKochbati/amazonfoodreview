I've purchased the cheese and meat ravioli previously  the cheese is very bland  the meat was a little bland_ but this italian sausage variety is VERY TASTY  and it really does taste like italian sausage  there are even little bits of sausage in the sauce  it's even a little spicy like italian sausage should be. At $1 or less per can with a long shelf life  the ones i ordered in OCT 2011 have a 'use by' date of May 2013  that's more than a 1 1 2 years to eat them  so order lots when the price is low. Would will buy again.                                                     added june 14, 2012_in regards to the person who said these are factory rejects and all dented cans i have to say WRONG    i've ordered 3 cases of this italian sausage ravioli and not a single can was dented. i've ordered a couple cases of the mini beef ravioli and they weren't dented either_ so out of 60 cans  not a single one was dented.
