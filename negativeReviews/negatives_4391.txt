Unfortunately I am highly disappointed with this product. It is devoid of flavor. They pride themselves on the history of the product. I could've done better at my grocery store in the candy aisle. I would've actually preferred a Heath bar. I tried it on three different days thinking possibly it was me. Then I had a couple friends try a couple pieces and my assessment was proved to be correct.     I threw away the majority of the two pound container one hour before the trash collectors arrived so the Raccoons (which often find their way into the garbage no matter what precautions you take) wouldn't have to suffer eating it.     What a waste of my hard earned money. You'll notice if you search Google how dominant this company is.     Believe me, I nor will anyone I know ever waste a penny on this product again. Yes, this review seems harsh; but I rarely take the time to do this. The only reason I have, is so you don't waste your money.     Regards to all:     Ron
