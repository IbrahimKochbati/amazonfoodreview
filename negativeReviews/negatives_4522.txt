While this is packaged well and convenient to open and pour out, it doesn't matter how easy it is     or how healthy if you can't get the baby to eat it! This is extremely blah, bland mush. I certainly     expected much better from this  and. In addition, since it's a stage 3 food, I expected there to be     pieces of meat and vegetables, however there's just a bunch of lightish  own mush my baby wont eat     even why I try to force it down her. Definitely wouldn't recommend to anyone despite it's health rating.
