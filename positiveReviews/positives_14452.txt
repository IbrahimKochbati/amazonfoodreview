I read the other reviews before buying.  But this cup really has whole berries in it and large chunks of peach.  I was amazed!  Great flavor and texture.  Very easy to prepare and my selective 4 1 2 yr old ate it all up!  I just wish it had less sugar.  Given that any person who makes this cup will eat it all most likely and thus has 2 servings or 18grams of sugar!  Way too much, I wish this was available in a lite sugar version.  I will have this for the kids once in a while since it is very flavorful and they eat it.  But I try not to serve that much sugar.  Whole grains are important to our bodies health, but having too much sugar is as bad as not having the whole grain.  Be sure to add an extra 20 minutes to your run time each day and you can enjoy these cups without worry!
