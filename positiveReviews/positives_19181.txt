I like strong coffee and found that some of the other K Cups were too light tasting.  This is the best one yet.  This is all i drink now.  I like mochas and sweet coffee drinks from Starbucks and Coffee Bean, so that should give you an idea of how my taste is skewed.  I mix this coffee with International Delight "White Chocolate Mocha" creamer and it is the bomb!  Perfect hint of raspberry with the chocolate truffle flavor.  You will not be disappointed.
