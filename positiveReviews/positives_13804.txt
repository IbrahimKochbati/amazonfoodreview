I am a peanut butter lover, but not a fan of the high calories and fat. As an extreme health junkie, I understand the notion behind moderation, but I admit that it's a bit hard to obey when it comes to peanut butter. Because of this, I haven't eaten peanut butter in a long time (about 3 years!)          About 2 months ago, PB2 entered my life and I could NOT have been any happier with this product. It's so amazingly yummy and perfect! I use it in powder form for my smoothies or I add water and some cinnamon and use it as a spread for crackers. I also use it for other foods like my baked tofu or sauteed shrimp. I love that you can adjust the consistency depending on the amount of water you add. Sometimes I can make it really thick by adding a little bit of water or more smooth with more water. I love that flexibility. I will be using this product for the rest of my life, as long as its still in production!
