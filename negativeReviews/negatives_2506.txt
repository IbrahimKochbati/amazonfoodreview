I really like this granola   their hemp granola is my favorite. REALLY good stuff. However   it's just too sweet for my taste. Most granola is dreadfully sugar laden, and other than the healthy ingredients, I feel like I'm chomping on some commercial grade grocery store sugar cereal...  ___           That said, the texture is very satisfying and it is tasty. Just a bit sweet. You've been warned.. ;)
