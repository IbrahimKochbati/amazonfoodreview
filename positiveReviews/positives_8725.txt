The nuts arrived very quickly (with reg. $5 shipping). They came adequately packaged in 5lb thick, clear double plastic bags. There's no oily residue left on my fingers after handling these nuts, thus I say they're dry roasted or well toasted, actually too well for my taste, as some have pronounced "burned" taste to them. Since there're very similar cashew offerings here on Amazon that state "roasted", I was naively wishing for these to be UN roasted. Still, these are much less expensive & less burned than those in grocery stores & not covered in sugar, salt, oil etc...
