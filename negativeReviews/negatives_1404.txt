I'm recently widowed so have to learn to fix for a single person. I hoped this microwaveable bowl of "Beefaroni" would provide a tasty lunch. To my surprise, I found that it was nearly all macaroni, with some tomato sauce and a very small amount of beef. The taste was OK if you like macaroni and a rather strong tomato sauce, but I expected more beef. Also, as with so many canned food these days, be prepared for a high dose of sodium    salt, that is    31% of average daily requirement in one small serving. Overall, no so good.
