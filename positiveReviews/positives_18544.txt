I really liked these.  Great snack for someone watching their fat and or calorie intake.  Light, crunchy and full of flavor.  They don't taste like a traditional chip they seem infused with air or something.  The biggest problem for me would be if I bought the large bag I would be too tempted to eat way more than a serving.  So these single sized bags are ideal.          Also should mention that the sweet potato variety that I tried do not contain any dairy which is a necessity for me and I'm sure others have similar issues.
