I love the Yogi  and of Chai tea...whether it's the Redbush or Green tea.  It has so much more flavor than other  ands of Chai tea and I have tried a ton of varieties.  I like to make the tea strong and then add some soy milk to it to make it creamy.  It becomes a Chai Latte without all of the sugar you get from the Chai syrups used in coffee shops.  It's also good cold.
