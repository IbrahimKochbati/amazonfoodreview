Great way to use your own coffee rather than buying k cups.  They are great because you don't have to change out the holding tray and there is no mess, u just toss them like you would a k kup, no washing out of the filter every time.  It would be nice if there were not 3 parts to the process (filter already in cup).  I just load up 10 at a time and am set for the week.
