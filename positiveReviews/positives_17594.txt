I received this product as part of the Amazon Vine Program.          I tried this coffee early in the morning. I got my water ready for one cup     and used very little coffee to just see how strong it was. To my surprise is     quiet strong and don't need to use a whole lot. The taste is a little different     than you regular french roast coffee.          As far as the acid taste goes, I did not felt that it was too acid but no to sweet     either. If you have ever tried Papua New Ginea Coffee this is a bit more acid.          All in all a good cup of coffee.
