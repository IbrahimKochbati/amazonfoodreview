This is my favorite K Cup!  I keep trying others but I always come back to this one. I'm not a coffee snob and I really don't know much about coffee but I know this tastes great! It smells amazing and isn't bitter.  This is a little harder to find in stores but amazon's prices beat the stores anyway.
