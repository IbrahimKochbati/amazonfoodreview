I'm really surprised by the number of people who think this makes a great tasting drink.  I'm also surprised by the number of people who think this resembles anything close to chocolate milk.  Yuck!  That being said, I think it's a GREAT product (assuming that it does contain the nutrients it claims to).  I have a 6 year old son and a 3 year old daughter.  They aren't fans of drinking this stuff in milk straight up (I've tried to drink it and can't do it) so I use that milk with their cereal.  They call it their 'vegetable milk' and have become accustomed to it in their cereal.  It does start to separate after a few minutes so the milk has a grainy, green texture to it.  But, again, they get used to it and, for kids who aren't begging to eat their veggies every day, this is a great way to get more nutrients in to their growing bodies.
