There is no doubt that this tea does it's job, but the smell of it is awful. I normally don't have any problems eating or drinking mildly offensive things, but I have such an aversion to the smell of this tea. It has a top note of moldy, dank earth with a base note of acrid peppers gone bad. The box says that it contains "delicious sasparilla". I don't taste anything like sasparilla or rootbeer in it at all. If you can bear the smell and aftertaste then go for it.
