French Roast coffee is naturally lower acid as a function of the roasting process. This coffee is lower acid still.  Unfortunately, the taste was well beyond atrocious.  I made the sad mistake of musing this in a French press the way I make my normal cup of coffee and the resulting cup was completely unpalatable.  Maybe in a drip, with sugar and cream it could be drinkable, but with all those additions what's the point of low acid?
