I was a bit hesitant on buying Folgers coffee since I associate the name with the cheap Folgers coffee that my parents drink. I was surprised how good this coffee tastes and is comparable to Starbucks. I purchases this once a month on Amazon's subscribe and save and no longer buy the gourmet coffee at the store. I gave it a 5 star based on taste and value.
