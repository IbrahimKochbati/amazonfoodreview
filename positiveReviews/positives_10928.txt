My dog loved these treats...and I like the fact that they contain all healthy ingredients.  The only drawback, and I didn't notice this when I ordered, that they have to be refrigerated after opening.  That didn't work well for me as I wanted to keep them in my car or my "to go" bag that I take to the sitter. Other than that, they're excellent!!
