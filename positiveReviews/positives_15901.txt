Of course this isn't pure Kona coffee, but it is a magnificent, medium bodied Kona "blend."  Tully's has great coffee, period. When I lived in Seattle, I'd go out of my way to find Tully's shops, as they were my favorite in our nation's coffee capital.          I'm so glad to find that Tully's makes K Cups:  wonderful coffee that evokes great memories of the Emerald City and what a great coffee shop should smell like and its coffee should taste like!
