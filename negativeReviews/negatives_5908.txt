Hello, I don't plan on using this particular item. In viewing this item at the time of purchase it didn't appear that any of the yellow plastic caps came loose.The picture made it appear all the caps stayed in the cups and twirled around. Then the instructions warn not to leave your dog alone with this toy. My whole purpose was to leave my dog alone and I wouldn't have to worry about any of the plastic caps coming loose. Actually, I'm sorry I bought it. However, I bought two of the squirrels in the tree trunk toys, one for me and one for a friend, and we're very happy with them.
