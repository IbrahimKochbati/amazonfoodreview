This product is not ready to use.  If you're willing to mix it up each time, it's a decent product.  The peanut butter taste is solid   it's just missing the fat. My 15 year old son doesn't notice the difference at all when it's in a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and he doesn't seem to miss the fat.  He eats a peanut butter and jelly sandwich every day for lunch and switched to PB2 at the suggestion of a nutritionist.  He lost half a pound a week since he switched, obviously combined with an overall healthy diet.  I recommend it for kids, not sure if adults will be fooled.
