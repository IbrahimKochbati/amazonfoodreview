These are wonderful and the previous reviewer put it perfectly.     These are a delicate, tender, buttery flavor olive. The one     grocer in our area just quit carrying these with no hope in     sight of ever ordering them again.     Then found out we can not even get them in our state!          Bummer that Amazon doesn't carry them.
