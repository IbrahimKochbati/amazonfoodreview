I agree with the other reviewers that the chocolate can be a tad crumbly, but this only occurred with my first order, and the taste of these bars is still absolutely AMAZING!!          These bars are gluten free, have three basic ingredients (coconut, rice syrup, dark chocolate), and are a wonderful treat that I don't feel terrible after eating.  Try a box and you'll soon find out how incredibly delicious they are.
