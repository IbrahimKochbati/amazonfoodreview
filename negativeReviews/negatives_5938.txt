I bought this coffee because I have acid reflux GERD.  It says it is coffee and it is low acid.  I made three pots in a very good coffeemaker and nothing I did improved the flat nothing taste of this coffee.  It also was no better for stomach irritation that other coffees I have tried.  I took a chance when I bought this coffee because it is non returnable.  I have spent less money for much better tasting coffee.  Amazon seldoms disappoints me with the quality of their products.  Healthwise Gourmet Coffee, is something I would have been better to do without.
