When it does come down to my mornings, I always do enjoy a good cup of coffee to start my days off right. But, I have chosen to drink more ground coffee than instant these days. But it has also been much harder finding the right kind of great tasting cup, and that does definitely come well with Maxwell House and the simple Original Roast Blend. The taste is definitely simple and not too string for most new coffee drinkers, but elequent enough to get your mornings off to a great start with each and every savory cup. While there aren't many great  ands of coffee that've shown that test of time, Maxwell House has been one that hasn't lost its shine. I absolutely recommend this  and each and every time.          Price: B+          Taste: B+          Overall: B+
