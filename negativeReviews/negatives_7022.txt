I am quite the chocolate snob, and while this isn't the best chocolate bar I've ever tasted, its certainly NOT the worst! In fact, I was quite impressed with it, considering my husband only paid $1.00 for it! To start with, its a little sweeter than the 65 70% cacoa chocolate I'm used to, but the sweetness is not overpowering. It has more of a rich, dark milky flavor, much like a cup of dark chocolate cocoa. I didn't notice any grainy texture or taste, in fact, it was quite smooth and silky like. While not the ideal chocolate to compliment a glass of Cabernet, I think it would make an excellent baking chocolate for classic desserts such as chocolate pie or homemade  ownies. And for those who think it taste like wax, perhaps it would make a perfect dipping chocolate for strawberries or apples? I'm giving it 3 stars, and if it came with nuts, I'd give it 4!
