As I said in a recent review for the larger Cele ate with a Crowd offering from ig4U, you start with a deep and attractive basket, then fill it (above a buffer) with a variety of tasty and unusual treats ranging from hard pretzels, to delicate truffles, imported sandwich cookies, unusual grain mustard, and number of other welcome surprises, and you have this well stocked gift basket.  "Cele ate with a Friends" is a good size for a small(ish) family or modest group of friends.          The contents are attractively arranged, in many cases they've got their own printed boxes as a presentation organizational layer with the original wrapping underneath (which is to say that you may open a box that indicates pretzels to find a bag of pretzels within).  The basket is no Longaberger, but the one I received was of a relatively high quality construction level and was genuinely handsome.  The whole package is wrapped in plastic and then a rich  own ribbon with a card    all in all you're left with a gift that is likely to give the impression that you spent more than you may have.          I was pleased with the basket, delighted to discover some new treats with which I was previously unfamiliar, and in general found myself very happy with what I received.  It's worth noting that some of the exceptionally poor reviews below are entirely accurate and not at odds with my own experience    indeed, even the harshest echo my own feelings about the product as it was represented in prototype in late October.  Without speaking for the company, my understanding is that many of us received prototype packages that saw the aforementioned original packaging represented by things like empty individual serving cereal boxes wrapped in inkjet printer paper.  The end result was, as one reviewer put it, sort of creepy.  The company replaced these prototypes with their final version, and I have gone from seeing this as a 1 star product worth (as others have) warning prospective buyers away, to feeling like they really represent a fine value.  I would have no problem whatsoever buying one of these as a gift for a group of friends.  So my review is based on the 'final' version of the product as it was received in late Nov early Dec 2011, and not upon the late Oct prototype received.  I only make this distinction for the sake of  owsers being able to consider the totality of the currently available reviews, putting the product change timeline into perspective.
