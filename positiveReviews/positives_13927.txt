Not sure what I expected, but certainly not something that tastes darn near as good as peanut butter.  Seriously, other than the "work" of having to add some water and measure it out, it mixes remarkably easy and tastes fantastic.  Love this stuff.  I'm ordering the chocolate now too to see how it is.
