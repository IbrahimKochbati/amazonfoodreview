This stuff is sunflower oil   which has a higher burn point, better fat profile, better health effects, and great taste   compared with Corn or Soybean. It's priced like corn or soybean   and because it's European Union stuff   it has to meet the more stringent EU food safety regulations. Sunflower isn't something that's GMO at this point.          Honestly   there is reason not to be using this   at this awesome price   and with this great quality. Will definitely buy more.
