Butterscotch is not my favorite flavor, because I associate it mainly with cheap candies. I was really hoping this matcha would be more like the fresh butterscotch syrup you put on ice cream sundaes, and I was right! The flavor is so smooth and perfectly butterscotch y. And not at all like cheap candy. No, this is rich decadent creamy sweet gooey butterscotch. The matcha base keeps it from being too heavy and sickly sweet, it's the perfect balance of health and decadence.
