I looked all over town and could't find any decaf expresso.  Fortunately, Amazon provided me with the Lavazza alternative, and it was a tasty and welcome experience.  The can is pop top, so no cut fingers.  The product is tasty.  It's a win win situation.  I highly recommend Lavazza Decaffeinated ground coffee.
