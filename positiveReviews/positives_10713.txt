I ordered the new Zealand Ranch Style Dog treats because they looked intriguing and I can always use treats for my dogs. I have to Papillion  iels.  Unfortunately, after the package arrived, it disappeared. I was frantic and looked everywhere. Later in the evening, my family had found the package. It appears that the smaller dog had managed to climb up on the chest where the package had been set and carried it off. She had spent the entire afternoon gnawing at the mailer, until she'd managed to free the treat bag. Unfortunately for her, the re sealable zip lock bag the treats came in was impervious to her small teeth, so she ended up simply `nesting' with the package which is what she does with items she likes.          So, I opened the package. They are about domino sized and a bit large for my small dog, but they come with a dent in the middle so the treat can be  oken.  We gave her one, and she eagerly ate the treat. She then stalked me watching me pleading for more until my sister came and took her away.  I can see the treats are going to be something she really goes for.          The verdict: My dog really likes these. Enough to steal the mailer and try to open the package they came in  something she never does.  I like them, because I like Newman's Own because they contain organic ingredients, and I trust the  and. I like the fact that the package is re sealable, and also that the treats do not smell unpleasant. This is a good item, and one I would recommend without reservation.
