I received these the other day and 2 cans were severely damaged, I had to throw them out, and 5 other cans came with minor dents. They were packed together so it didn't look like the damage took place during shipping.          Edited note:     Today is May 30, 2009 and I just wanted to post that Amazon wrote to me and told me this problem has been rectified. I'm happy about that because I need to get these for my dog and at times they are hard to find. Plus it's a great product.
