Love these little cookies! They are crunchy with the almonds, chewy with the little raisins and are not too sweet. I enjoy them with coffee and tea. I discovered them at the local Wal mart a few weeks ago. They sold out last week (maybe I bought them all!) and have not restocked so I went looking on the internet for them. Voila! Amazon has them plus a few more flavors from the same company!  I ordered these and the the Ginger. These are still my favorite.          The packaging was good   maybe too good   the box was twice as big as the volume of the cookies and had those air filled plastic "bubbles" filling up the void. I am pleased my cookies arrived in good shape but not sure all that packaging was needed.
