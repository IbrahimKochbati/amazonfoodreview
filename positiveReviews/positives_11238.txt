Several decadent ones. And all the recipes are on each bag. Rave reviews from all my non celiac friends. Excellent case price from Amazon versus any store (Whole Foods Sprouts Market Street Central Market) where I can purchase in North Central Texas. An also outstanding alternative (if you want less decadent, more cake like, but also like the "real thing") is the Namaste Chocolate or Namaste Blonde Brownie mixes, both available by the case at a great price from Amazon. Everything Pamela's and everything Namaste I have tried have been excellent, this coming from someone who used to bake from scratch.
