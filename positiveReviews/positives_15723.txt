When I first purchased this product I wasn't sure my cats would like it.  However, I quickly discovered that they do.  It's a pity that they can't do the review.  I've tried a number of different  ands of cat food and, though, they still don't eat a lot; this seems to be their favorite.  It smells so good, I feel like I could eat it myself but it's just too expensive.
