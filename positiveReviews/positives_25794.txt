With the italian roast, the flavor is neither too strong or nor too light. Perfect for the mornings. I use cream and with Half n Half it tastes best. If you find Starbucks coffee little bit strong, italian roast is worth trying.     And if you love the "filter coffee" taste (folks from India should know it) then you would love this. Just about every guest who tried italian roast at my house agree!
