Oatmeal has become a daily staple of my diet. Most days I just start from the plain oatmeal and add  own sugar and raisins.  But every once in awhile I like to splurge on the pre packaged oatmeal like I used to eat as a kid.  Sure the sugar is a little higher but nutritionally it's a much better option than other snacks. Only 160 calories per packet. Quaker instant oatmeal packets are just as good as you remember them. If there were any way to improve this product it would be to make the oatmeal a little thicker.  More like rolled oats.  Other than that,  Quaker Maple and Brown Sugar oatmeal is awesome.          26JUL12 REVISED RATING: My kids tell me this oatmeal is really bland compared to what they are used too.  Tasted fine to me but the kids didn't like it at all.
