I have been looking for dry roasted walnuts for YEARS, as that is my favorite type of nuts AND favorite preparation of nuts.  When I first found these at Rouse's, I was ecstatic!  I especially enjoyed the addition of a slight flavor of onion and garlic in them.  It was wonderful finding them for an even cheaper bundle price here at Amazon.  Thanks!!  ; )
