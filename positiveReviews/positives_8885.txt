The pepperoni is fantastic, as usual.  Amazon was not. While I cancelled the order on my end (it was a duplicate of my son's), they didn't acknowledge it although I got an e mail confirming the cancellation.  Because it was "food" there are no returns.  Looks like 2 bags every 3 months instead of one.
