This one tasted pretty good.  Very tangy, but in a 'real fruit' kind of way.  I think they got this one right.  I still can't ever see myself buying a bunch of this.  Maybe if amazon sent me more than a single can to try, I would have build a habbit of drinking them (cough..hint..cough).          I don't really understand any drink this size.  If I were thirsty at all, I would want way more, at least 12 oz.  The only other drinks this size are those crazy energy drinks, and those are obviously more of a 'means to an end' kind of drink.  I guess it is supposed to be more of a gourmet soda juice.  I guess there is a market for that, I'm just not part of it.          Nice little carbonated juice, but still not really worth the effort money for me.
