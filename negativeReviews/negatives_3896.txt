This is a sweet, mild flavored and lightly carbonated juice mix which is dominated by the flavor of apple juice and white grape juice. These probably  make up at least 80 to 90% of this juice by volume. The juice is a pleasant mild red or pink blush color. The mild kiwi and berry flavor appears almost as a pleasant aftertaste rather than the dominant flavor note.          If you enjoy a juice which is sweet without much tartness and with a low level of carbonation this has a pleasant but not outstanding flavor. I personally prefer stronger flavors and more carbonation.  Sparking juices are expensive and this one is no exception so overall I have no intent to get it again.          While the marketing suggestion ("No Sugar Added" and "No Preservatives") is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely "natural" sugar in this or most any juice. The healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit. Fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins, minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you.
