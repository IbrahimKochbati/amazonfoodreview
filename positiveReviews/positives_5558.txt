I purchased this product mainly to try out the different flavors of tea. When I find the flavor I like I will probably buy a case of it. China mist tea taste great. As for those who have problems with tea leaves getting in the tea don't worry. I went to the local supermarket (HEB in Texas) and found empty tea bags in a box for about $5.They work great. Fill with tea and fold top and staple.
