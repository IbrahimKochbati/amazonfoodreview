My cats love this food. I have been buying the 3 pound bag, but with 3 cats, I will be switching to the larger bag. I am glad that Halo is available on Amazon, which makes it very convenient to order, but I also wish that more stores would start to carry this  and as well. I am always looking for the best for my babies and as far as I can tell, this is it.
