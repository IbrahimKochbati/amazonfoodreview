Milhouse will be 14 this year, and I have purchased treats once in a while, and he liked them but never loved them, so many treats fell by the wayside.  I pick these up at a store, thinking why not try them and he LOVED them.  He does not get them every day, but I will leave a few out once or twice a week, and he gets really excited to "find" his treat and crunch down on them.  So, I picked up the 5 pack from Amazon, and I have a very happy cat. He still likes them and looks forward to the discovery.
