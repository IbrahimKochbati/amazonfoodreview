I'm no maple syrup expert but I've been using maple syrup grade B for a number of years and I absolutely love the Coombs Family Farms one. It's thick, rich and complex. I like it with yogurt, pancakes, fruit, lemonade, in cooking, and even by the shot. However, after reading about maple country and maple syrup culture, I toyed with the romantic idea of buying directly from maple syrup makers. I recently was able to do that. I ordered a gallon of maple syrup grade B from Bear Mountain Vermont Maple (that's the place I chose after some research). Their sugar bush is in a remote mountain that borders Quebec and has never been farmed. Although the syrup is not certified organic, no pesticides or insecticides are used anywhere in the area. These are really nice, honest people and it was a great experience ordering from them. The syrup is great. And the price is good too: 1 gallon is $60 (including shipping) and is shipped in two half gallon BPA free containers that have an oxygen barrier coating on the outside to help the syrup stay fresh longer. The service was fast too. I got the shipment just 4 days after I placed my order (I live in Northern California). So yes, I'm really satisfied. I am not ready to say that I prefer this syrup to Coombs Family Farms'. They're both really good in my opinion. But ordering from Bear Mountain was more like getting my produce from a farmer's market kind of experience for me.
