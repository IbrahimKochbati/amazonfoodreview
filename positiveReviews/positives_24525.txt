I bought this pumpkin because there is none available in our markets due to the great pumpkin crisis of 2009 or something equally drastic.  Its primary use is to prevent hairballs in my cat and it works.  I usually mix it with some canned cat food, but when I ran out one night, I gave it to him straight and he scarfed it down as if it were candy.  It lasts a long time (he only gets about 2 tablespoons a night), smells wonderful and I plan to use it in some muffins as soon as I get the time to make them.  I like being able to give him something organic, as he's an older gentleman, and I like having organic for my own cooking.
