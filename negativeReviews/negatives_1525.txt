In proportion this drink is about equal to a regular soda in calories and sugar content, but I would prefer a regular soda than this stuff. There is a slight citrus taste, but mainly from acidity and a horrible after taste of metal and sickly sweetness that lingers for several minutes after wards.          Soda water with natural juice should be a refreshing, pleasant, and nice refreshment, but none of these traits are in this drink.          I would be embarrassed to serve this beverage to anyone I liked for any occasion, but would consider giving it to people I really didn't care for to see their reaction.          Avoid this one. Orange Crush or a different orange soda diluted with soda water would taste far better or soda water and regular orange juice would also be a treat that puts this nasty stuff to shame.
