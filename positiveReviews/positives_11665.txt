Why am I a little disappointed you ask?  Well, this grain is not as clean as other quinoa I have purchased.  When I rinse the grain I get little floaties that look to be chaff. For this reason, I hesitate to use it in my toothed impeller mill.  I wouldn't want to damage it, and if there is chaff, there could be other things.  Of course, the quinoa is delicious as always.
