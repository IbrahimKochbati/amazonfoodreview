This syrup is used for my Key Lime Pie martini, which is awesome!  The product is very sweet and sugars up if saved for a long time after it is opened. I wish Monin would make a sugar free version of this flavor, but no luck yet. This particular product is so good you can taste a bit of graham cracker just like the pie.  Highly recommend this product, and if you like, add equal parts vanilla vodka and pineapple juice for an amazing cocktail.
