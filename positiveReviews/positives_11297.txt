We started our son on baby food a little after his 6 month birthday.  (he is almost 8 months now)  After introducing avocado and quinoa cereal, we tried NuturMe's squash, and it was a huge hit.  Same with the sweet potatoes, then the peas, then the apples.  I love that they are organic, they really do taste fresh and I much prefer to make it for him than give him jarred food.  I will often use a different spoon to mix it so I can lick some of it off, it tastes so good!  (the peas might be my favorite!)  Another reviewer was right, the peas end up being a bit grainy in texture; at first we just mixed it with a bit more water to make it smoother more soupy, but now he eats it just fine at the 3 tbsp. of water mixture.  I just ordered some more as our stash was running out   a very sad thing!  I also want to try the "froggy pasta" recipe I saw on their blog.  I keep thinking of ways I want to use NurturMe after he's out of the puree stage.  I can't wait for them to introduce new flavors!
