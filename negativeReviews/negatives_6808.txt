We have purchased this popcorn twice. It's just the right amount for our popcorn popper as we have a 4 oz kettle on the stand up machine. About 95% of the corn pops so expect to lose a little but this is normal with an automatic paper as occasionally a popped grain of corn will take an unpopped grain of corn with it as it leaves the kettle. The oil in the packages in the first batch stayed firm however the oil in the second order is completely melted. We have not yet figured out the reasons as storage condition for each were exactly the same. This is a good product however you are paying a lot more than bulk ingredients when it comes prepackaged like this.
