I bought my first Primal Strips seitan jerky at the gym after a workout one day and since then I've been hooked. The mesquite lime is my favorite flavor. Super yummy and only 74 calories. It's a great non soy protein filled meatless snack. Plus it's totally portable so you can keep one in your desk drawer or your handbag for when you're stuck for a snack.
