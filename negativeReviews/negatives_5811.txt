I strongly suspect this caviar, which is widely available in US supermarkets is a reason for fear of caviar in 90% of American population. This product only resembles real caviar in shape and color (artificial). It would not qualify for caviar in Europe. It's from the wrong fish, it has totally wrong taste, and it also has whole periodic table on the label. It's like dying chicken  east into red color, marinating it in steak souse, and selling it as New York Strip Steak...          Real caviar doesn't come from lumpfish, and real caviar only have two ingredients   caviar and salt. Try Red Pearl Salmon Caviar if you want to try caviar. You can easily find it on Amazon and other places online.
