After reading how good Agave Nectar is for you and a number of excellent reviews, I decided to take the plunge and order Madhava's Agave Nectar Light in the 46 oz. bottles, pack of two.  Not having a clue as to how good or bad this product was going to taste, I was very nervous and wondered if I had made a wise decision or big mistake.  I couldn't wait to try it and was delightfully surprised.  In tea, it tastes sweeter than sugar.  In smoothies, it's sensational.  Even a spoonful is wonderful.  My husband loves it in his oatmeal and I like to mix it with dehydrated coconut and raw cacao nibs for a real treat.  I could not be more pleased with my discovery!
