I'm no coffee snob so take this with a grain of salt.  Our cappucinos taste great!  We grind it super fine and pack semi tightly into the portafilter (apparently, this is the steel basket w  handle) and the result is a strong, flavorful espresso.  Little bit of steamed milk mixed in and I'm favoring this over spending [...] at a coffee shop.
