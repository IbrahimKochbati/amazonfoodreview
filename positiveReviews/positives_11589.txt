In the interim between ordering this, and it's arrival, I purchased an organic syrup at the local store. So my expectations were low.  This Highland Sugarworks product truly is a marvel.  Every drop is beyond comprehension.  The thick rich delicious maple blends with something deeper, and richer almost smokey.  Wow   what a super incredible treat.  I actually wake up quicker knowing that a little Highland Sugarworks is soon to follow.  I can't believe it's organic.  An incredible home run!  This is one of the finest products (organic or otherwise) that I have ever eaten in any category.  Thank You.
