Delicious on anything you want spicier. Great garlicky flavor but not overpowering with vinegar like a tabasco. Somewhat like a Sriracha but not sweet. Makes dull tomato soup all crazy awesome. Eggs, potatoes, stir frys, vegetables, steaks, chicken. Triggers a Pavlovian response like you wouldn't believe. I am officially starving now. Dammit!
