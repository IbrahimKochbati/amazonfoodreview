Switch does not taste like carbonated juice.  It tastes like overly sweet orange soda, which may or may not be a positive for you.  The 8.3 ounce can contains 34 grams of sugar.  I did not like the taste, my husband thought it was okay.          The reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 2 is because it does not have any preservatives, added sugars, or high fructose corn syrup.  It does however contain soy, so if you are allergic or concerned about GMO soy, then you may want to avoid this drink.          If you are looking for a natural, sweet, carbonated beverage, I would recommend OOBA Hibiscus drink over this.
