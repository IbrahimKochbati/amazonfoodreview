I have been GF for 2years.  I used this product for biscuits and liked them but were a little dry.  As for the pancakes, I prefer another product.  The pricing is outrageous.  I am single but cannot imagine trying to justify this cost when making pancakes for a family.  I love the Betty Crocker GF cake mixes and  ownies though.  I still make my biscuits and oven baked chicken using this product.  It is getting more difficult to find on store shelves so most times I order here.  I have several BC cookbooks and have used the GF version Bisquick  as substitute for the regular Bisquick..  Some come out Ok while others are not too good.  I am learning to vary ingredients to achieve better results.  My best experiment with this product was my scratch corn ead.  I use GF corn meal and this mix to make a delicious  ead.  thank you BC for this product.  Work on the pricing.  I would use it more often if I could afford it.  Tired of manufacturers holding GF people hostage because it seems to be the latest "diet craze".  GF people have to have these products to live.          Going GF saved my life and BC now makes products so I can enjoy baked goods again.  I make my own  eads using other products and now biscuits, cakes, cookies with this and other BC GF products.  I also use this product when recipes call for small amounts of regular flour.  It depends on what I am making.          As I am reviewing the product I gave it 5 stars.  I give the pricing 2 stars.
