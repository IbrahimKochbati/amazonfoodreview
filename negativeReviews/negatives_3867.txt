I enjoy sodas and carbonated drinks, but don't drink too many of them because I'm trying to consume healthier things.  I was sent a can of The Switch through the Amazon's vine program to review.          The smell is very strong, medicine like, and somewhat unapproachable.  The taste on the other hand is very sweet, and it does have hints of the kiwi and strawberry flavors.  It's a little too sweet for my liking, but I am the type of person who drinks juice watered down.          As far as being a "healthy alternative to soda", they do a pretty good job.  There's no HFCS (a big plus), and no artificial colors.  On the other hand, all of the juice in it is "reconstituted from concentrates".  The can says it has "natural flavors" which I always consider a dubious term to hide behind on items claiming to be "healthy".  Also, and 8.3 oz can of "The Switch" has 135 calories, while a 8.3 oz of Coke has roughly 109 calories, so this thing is a sugar bomb (even though it says there is "no sugar added".  No kidding!  It doesn't need it!).          If you like really sweet things, then this might be a good buy for you.  As for myself, I don't think I'd go out of my way to try this again.
