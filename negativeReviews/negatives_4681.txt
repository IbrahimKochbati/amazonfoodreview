My gang is typically not very fussy when it comes to food   if it doesn't move (or, at least move too much) they'll eat it. So, I was pretty sure they'd like this up scale food.          Surprisingly, one did not   while she didn't turn up her nose at it, she didn't really want to eat it either.  The other three gave it their licked clean food bowl seal of approval.          The cans are small (the "mini" can size much like Fancy Feast) which is a good match for single cat households since you don't have to deal with leftovers. The smell is much better than the low cost can foods, and about on a par with the more premium  ands such as Hills. The chicken pot pie was VERY watery, however   more like a soup than a stew. The sesame chicken was a bit more solid. The watery nature of the product also makes it messy to serve. To me, it's not a very good value especially considering that you're paying for a lot of water.          I don't think I'd get this again given the cost and the mess factor, plus the fact that  there are several other  ands that provide top notch nutrition at a lower cost (and less mess). I also try to purchase items that are US made, and this is made in Thailand. But, the majority of the cats snarfed it down, so it's deserving of at least 3 stars.
