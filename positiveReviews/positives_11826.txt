I have used Blackened Redfish seasoning for years, but made the mistake of ordering 2 20Oz containers of the wrong stuff, the Blackened STEAK magic. It was $20 and rather than returning it, I decided to try using it. It is the best steak I have had. I like sirloin better than ribeye because it's leaner. I would suggest following the recipe exactly. I use a Coleman stove out doors with a heavy steel French frying pan. Cast iron would work well too. It will smoke up your house unless you have an industrial hood. I never order steak anymore. It's always better at home. I would also recommend letting the steak come up to near room temperature before blackening it.
