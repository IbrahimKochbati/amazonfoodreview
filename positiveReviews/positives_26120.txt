This tea has a strong pungent smell that my husband hates (he says stinky socks) but call me weird I really like it.  I like parmasean cheese too though and that stinks.  Anyhow, I find both the aroma very relaxing and find that after a cup I am tired and ready to go to bed.  I am not even sure if it is the aroma or the actual tea that is knocking me out but for some reason it is so right for this body.
