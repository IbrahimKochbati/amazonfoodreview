I have tried many sauces from Habanero, to 7 Pod and Trinidad Scorpion, to the Ghost Chilli, and to those not too tasty extracts. And this is the hottest one I have. Hard to believe the hottest pepper in this sauce is the habanero. How can this be hotter than the ghost chilli and others I have. Because of the killer pepper extracts in there. If you can't even handle Ground Zero then don't even look at the final answer. It's ground zero knocked up a million notches. Don't believe me? Try one drop. One drop will leave you drooling and in a lot of pain. It taste pretty bad. It's only meant to taste hot and hurt you. I don't suggest one drop straight on the tongue like I did, put it in chilli or on cheese. But If you gotten up the nerve to try it straight then props to you, enjoy the pain.          Worth the money. This small bottle will last you years it's that hot. And cool for any hotsauce collection.
