As a tea junkie, Runa's traditional guayusa offers a simple, agreeable taste that's not like any other tea I've had. I used to swear by matcha green tea, but Runa is a superior alternative in that it's super cheap, more energizing, much easier to swallow, and offers just as many health benefits.           Also, if you look into it, Runa's doing some great things on the side of social entrepreneurship and rainforest conservation. I highly suggest reading into it   it'll make you love the product even more.
