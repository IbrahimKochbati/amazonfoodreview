I got this for my GR puppy at about 6 mths old but she didn't quite know how to get the treats out. However by 9 months old she figured it out and loves it! I give her kibble in here about 3 4 times a week and she gets it all out (1 cup) within about 20 minutes. Make sure you are away from  eakable things though because if your dog whips it around and tosses it   like mine does, it could definately  eak something. This is a great, durable toy at $11.92.
