Woah...wasn't expecting this to be as good as it is, honestly. When mixed with water, the consistency is a dead ringer for regular peanut butter and the taste is spot on. I was expecting bland, chalky paste but it definitely is nothing like that. MMM! So good! Excited to try it in on everything!! If you're on the fence, just give it a try. For way under $10, and way under the regular fat content of regular peanut butter, this stuff is a god send!
