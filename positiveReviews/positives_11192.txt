We love the big bold flavors we typically find in the dark roast coffees available for the Keurig.  However, my family and I found this one a bit too bitter.  The flavors are strong and this is definitely a bold coffee, but the lingering flavor was not as smooth as some of our more favorites.          We've tried this on two occasions, once from a sample pack and another time from a box of 24.  We all consistently agreed across the two times.  So I feel pretty confident in our assessment.  Perhaps others will like this if they put more sugar or cream in it to knock a bit of the bitterness off.  Since I use no cream and only a little sweetener, this is just a bit too strong for us.
