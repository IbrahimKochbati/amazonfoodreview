the idea of a chip alternative may be unconstitutional to some. but not when you have something like a bag of pop chips!          they have lots of flavor and lots of crunch. they hold their own next to a sandwich. if you eat them too fast the array of spices can get in your nose and make you sneeze. so sit back and enjoy each bite!
