I found the Switch Kiwi Berry Flavor to be good enough, but a little too sweet for my personal taste. I liked the fact that it was overly carbonated, and the amount in the can is just right, not too much to drink     at one time. It makes portion control easy. Would I buy it instead of a soda? Maybe not.
