I couldn't resist the price... so many beef sticks for so cheap. However, I think I was expecting something different. The jerky has a good taste, and at first it wasn't very oily, but as they got older (and exposed to the air) I did notice some oil spots forming through the casings of the sticks. Overall, if you can consume this, say, within 1 week of opening, they are great! If you need something that will stick around longer (stick, get it?) then maybe this isn't the right product. They also sent me a free sample of some of their other products with my order, and the shipping was quick. I like the company, the beef sticks just weren't what I was looking for, I guess.
