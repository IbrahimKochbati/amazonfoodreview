I had to pay a fortune to have our dog's teeth cleaned. Plus it was a difficult thing for her...she got very upset and was in pain for a few days. So I started using Greenies, and wow...they have her scheduled for a teeth cleaning that I will cancel, because it has kept her teeth so clean. Best of all, though, she is a very picky eater. Most things that are supposedly flavored to please dogs do not please her. She just won't eat them, but Greenies for teeth...she can't wait to have them. I just ask her if she wants to  ush her teeth, and she is ready and waiting. The other night I got out her pills to give her for arthritis and made the mistake of getting out the greenie at the same time. She didn't want the pills although they were covered in peanut butter, which she usually loves. Once she finished the greenie, she wanted the "peanut butter pills."
