I bought my mberry pack from mberry.us online hoping to use it to curb my sweet tooth. I followed the directions to the letter, allowing the tablet to dissolve completely on my tongue. I then tried balsalmic vinegar   nothing happened to the taste at all except that my tongue burned a little. So I tried hot sauce   nothing happened again except that my tongue burned a lot. Then I tried regular vinegar   nothing happened again. I even tried taking a second tablet, but it still did nothing but slightly burn my tongue. HUGE waste of money. Super disappointing. DOES NOT WORK!
