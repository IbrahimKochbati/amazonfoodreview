The service for return was poor. The product reached me melted and fully bloomed (chocolate was white with spots and streaks on the surface). Though this is something that can be reused by melting, not for the seeding for which I'd needed this. They were not agreeing for return for a product that reached me in a form that was not acceptable. I had to explain my need and purpose. They did not refund my previous shipment or tax nor did they pay for the return shipment. I ended up paying $25 for the return shipment. The product is a lot costly through this vendor. Actually double its price. I bought a 5kg block of the same chocolate from a local Callebaut vendor. Please research your local listings. Stop buying through these channels. If you want Callebaut chocolates, call the number in the callebaut website and get the contacts of the local distributor. While through this vendor the milk white chocolate for 1kg costed me close to $50 with shipping, I bought the 5kg block from the local distributor for just $47!!
