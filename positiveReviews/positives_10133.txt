I'm trying to limit my carbs but I am a noodle addict. I've tried several varieties of shirataki noodles, different shapes, with and without tofu and I like these ones best. The thicker ones just have a weird texture to me   too gummy and gelatinous. The angel hair ones come out very similar to thin rice noodles. They're pretty easy to use compared to cooking any pasta from dry.  Just give them a rinse and parboil for about 2 minutes and dry them off before putting them in whatever you're cooking. In my opinion, they do not work well in place of semolina pasta   they are much more like rice noodles with very little flavor of their own.  I especially like them in seafood curry stir fry   masks any fishy smell that might still be on them.
