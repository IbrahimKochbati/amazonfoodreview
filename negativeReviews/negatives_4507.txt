My baby loves Happy Baby's Chick Chick meal, so we tried the salmon. It is the first food that my 11 month old has ever spit back at me. I tried to feed him this four different days to see if he would get used to it, or change his mind. No luck. It's too bad that you can only purchase them in lots of 16.... lots of leftover salmon here.
