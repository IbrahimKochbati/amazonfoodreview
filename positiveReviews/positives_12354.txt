This is the most original root beer I've ever had. It has a kick: one for your head with the guarana (most energy drinks have this) and one for your tongue (it has capsaicin, the part of hot peppers that burn your mouth). This combination sounds weird i with cane sugar, but this is my favorite soda.          I find that either people love this or hate it so try it at your grocery store first before you buy a case.
