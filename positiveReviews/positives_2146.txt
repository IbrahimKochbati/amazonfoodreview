Good flavor and not too rich  fewer fat calories than the standard fare. It's not loaded up with canola oil like Campbell's and Progresso, so you can add a little quality EVOO like California Olive Ranch, or even butter for a healthier  ew if you prefer it that way like we do. I also add a little half and half, and saute some Hormel Bacon bits with red onion and garlic to add complexity to the flavor. I was impressed. I usually also add some Gorton's Wild Pacific Salmon (frozen, in most markets) to basically make it a healthy fish chowder.
