I really enjoy this coffee, not too strong, not too weak.  And it doesn't leave an after taste.  All that said, I decided to buy locally becausee I can get a better price, even the regular price. So I gave it a 4 for the price.  Also, anyone want to tell me why the 48 count is more expensive than ordering 2 of the 24 count?  LOL
