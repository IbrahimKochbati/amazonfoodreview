I bought these bags b c I thought they were tough, thick nylon.  I guess these bags would work perfectly fine if you're just using them for transport.  I needed a really tough one like the KBR guys try to sell us for $8 here in Afghanistan...2 of these bags are already in the trash after only 2 uses each.  They wash the laundry in the bag and both have ripped after only 2 uses.  I gave them a 3 b c they are not that bad..just not what I was needing.  The seller was awesome!  I received the bags here in Afghanistan after only 6 days from the original order date so I have to say the seller was very expedient.
