The Amazon product info claims they are a certified organic product.  The picture claims DOP certified.  Neither appears to be true.  The cans I received were just "certified", and it didn't say by who.  There is no USDA Organic label either.  I also knew all these things before I bought them since they are well documented in the Amazon reviews already, so I wasn't surprised by what I received.          On the plus side, they are better tomatoes than I can buy canned in the grocery stores locally, so I'm happy enough with them, and I used reward points from my Amazon.com Visa to buy them, so they were essentially free to me.          Would I buy them again?  Maybe.  If couldn't get any of the Strianese D.O.P. certified San Marzano tomatoes, then yes I probably would.  As I said, they are tasty and I do like them better than what I can buy locally, but they aren't the top tomato when it comes to what I can mail order.
