For a 220 calorie dish that can sit in your desk drawer indefinitely, this really isn't bad. It's certainly better than Chef Bouyardee or Easy Mac or actual Cup of Noodles. I've only ever had one other Dr. McDougall's product which was the Tortilla Soup and I much preferred it. I found this one to be a bit bland. It was pretty much just dried Cup of Noodles type noodles with some peanutty powder and a few green onions. I think the peanut flavor could have been more pronounced and I wasn't crazy about the texture of the noodles. I guess I was hoping for a bit more than ramen with peanut sauce.          I only gave this three stars because I thought it was a bit of a let down. I liked it but I didn't love it as much as I should have given my love of peanut sauce. I would maybe buy it again at a grocery store if it was on sale but I certainly don't see myself buying them in bulk from amazon. My go to Desk Drawer food is still Annie Chun's Udon Noodle Soup Bowl. The calorie count is pretty similar (I think Annie Chun's is like 280 or so) but the texture of the noodles is far superior because they use the vacuum sealed pre cooked noodles. However, if you're not in the mood for soup, these peanut noodles may be a better way to go after all.
