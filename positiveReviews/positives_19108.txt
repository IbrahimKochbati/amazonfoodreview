The name sounded great   chocolate raspberry truffle   but would it taste as good as it sounds? Well, I was impressed. This has to be one of my favorite flavored coffees, along with some hazelnut ones, even though I typically prefer unflavored coffees.          UPDATE 2011 01 03: I don't like this as much as I use too... it's not bad, but I'm just not "excited" about the flavor as much anymore. Plus I find it leaving an unpleasant aftertaste. I'm not "wanting" it in the morning, instead preferring to desire mostly unflavored coffees   like "Van Houtte Caf&eacute;, Costa Rica Tarrazu (Light Roast)", which is really good... so I'm reducing my rating to 4 out of 5 stars.
