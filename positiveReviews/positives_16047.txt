Ever since first having McVitie's Digestives many, many years ago, I continue to maintain that they are the best. Nothing that compares to them in the States.  Awesome to find these available through Amazon.  I've bought digestives at Whole Foods...different  and, pretty expensive.  No comparison to the taste of McVitie's.  Love them with goat cheese.  In the UK, loved them with Cranberry Stilton.  Awesome, awesome, awesome.  Graham crackers?  No comparison.  You gotta try 'em.
