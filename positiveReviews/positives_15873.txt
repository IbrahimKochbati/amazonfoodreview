I have 2 large  eeds; a Tibetan Mastiff 2 years old and a Newfie 8 years old. I used to buy the old Sam's  and Lamb and Rice formula   which is a good food, but I always had to add something to it, like milk,  oth, treats to make it palatable to the pups. This formula doesn't require anything but the kibble, and so treats remain treats instead of part of the meal.          They both eat it up without any issues; no digestive problems.          I originally found out about it through our dog trainer. She suggested it because my Newfie is a senior and is starting to have allergies   itchy skin. We live in the South and have 2 long haired large dogs who are prone to allergies. This has helped some, but I keep them on it because they do eat it and the ingredients are high quality.          I started giving them Omega 3,6,9s and Biotin again. I used to do this over a year ago and they both had beautiful hair and skin. My TM has some itching, but not bad   gorgeous coat. The Newfie is miserable and I hope putting her back on the Omega's and Biotin will reverse the issues. Her hair and skin was great when she was on them before, I just wasn't 100% sure it was the vitamins that helped. I will know soon enough and post my findings. Just put them back on them, so it may take me 2 months to update. I have also tried other holistic approaches to helping her with her skin as well as Benadryl   they help some, but not enough.          Won't be disappointed and you can't beat that delivery is free, no tax and it comes straight to your door   I enjoy that I do not have to lug the large bags around Sam's. :)
