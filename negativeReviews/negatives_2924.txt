I opened the box with the 3 cans of peanuts and all 3 cans had a large dent on the side. There was no damage to the box so obviously the cans were damaged prior to the packaging. At least the peanuts were OK. Maybe we are being sold "seconds" through Amazon by this company. Buyer beware or you may receive peanut butter rather peanuts from this company.
