The first sample came with my single cup  ewer. I liked the taste, but when I removed the k cup the foil had a huge hole in it. It was awkward and extremely messy. I thought it could have been a bad batch, so I bought a 12 pack of decaf. It was the same. Great taste, but very messy. It still had a huge hole, grounds were in my coffee, and weak foil. Disappointed.
