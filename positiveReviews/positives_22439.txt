Dan's Perfect Popcorn          Note:  This is a very thorough recipe, but it is very important you follow these steps closely.          Heat 2 TBS of vegetable oil in a medium sized pot for 5 minutes on high.          Pour in 1 2 cup of popcorn kernels and leave uncovered.  As soon as the first kernel pops, put the lid on crooked to let the steam escape.          Note: If your popcorn rises too high and is close to touching the bottom of the lid (use a clear lid) then remove the lid. Do not let the popcorn touch the moisture that accumulates on the bottom of the lid. It will ruin all those pieces.          When finished popping (about 1 second in between pops), pour popcorn into a large bowl and place the empty pot back on the burner (now turned off).          Add 1 TBS of unsalted butter (cut into small squares) into the pot you just cooked your popcorn in. Hold the pot and angle it so that the butter just stays on one side of the pot. If there are any remaining bits of popcorn in the pot, use your butter knife to knock them down into the melted butter. These are great little nuggets of joy while eating the popcorn!          Slowly pour half of the butter over the popcorn in a circular fashion, starting at the center and working your way outward to the edge of the bowl. You want to pour a little more butter around the center and less around the edges, since the center of the bowl is the deepest. Sprinkle salt (1 2 the amount you would use) over the top. Use your butter knife and your opposite hand together to lightly toss the popcorn.          Note: It is important to salt your popcorn after you pour the butter and before tossing, because the salt will stick better to the popcorn.          Pour the other half of the melted butter over the popcorn. Sprinkle the other half of salt over your popcorn.  Lightly toss again.  Taste it.  Add salt if necessary.  Eat right away.          Note: If you like your popcorn more buttery and or oily, add 1 2 to 1 TBS of each to the recipe.
