I like the Lavazza Tierra! 100% Arabica Whole Bean Espresso Coffee a lot. I've tried a lot of beans. They are reliable, and have a round, pleasing flavor. Not burnt, not acidic. I like them more than the other Lavazza options in 2.2 lb bags.          I use these beans with a superautomatic espresso machine. Nice crema. Nice flavor. The crema lasts for more than 5 minutes.
