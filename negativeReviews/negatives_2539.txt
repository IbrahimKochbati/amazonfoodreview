Oddly, I have given the cats Turkey & Spinach in the 5.5oz size and they seemed to like it. I bought 2 cases of this 3oz and they only touch it after realizing that I will not give them more food.          It may be because I gave them Turkey & Seafood for a while in between. It's odd because they scarf up that flavor, and they would scarf up the Turkey & Spinach in the 5.5oz size. WEIRD.          I rate it 5 stars for the ingredients and quality. I always feed them Castor & Pollux. However, as always, test not only the flavor but also the size of the can. When I scoop the food out of the can the consistency in the 3oz cans seems somewhat thicker than the 5.5oz (in all flavors I have tried). This may be a contributing factor to their distaste for this particular combination.          Great product, just verify kitty flavor approval.
