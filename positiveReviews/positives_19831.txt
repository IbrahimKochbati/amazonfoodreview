We ordered this candy for the color without tasting it for my daughter's wedding reception candy bar.  It was among the favorites.  It is not too sweet and not too tart  just right.  Due to huge popularity in my office, I have since reordered it to restock the candy jar.  It seems to be universally enjoyed.
