I'm a big Pamela's fan and this  ead mix does not disappoint.  It rises and bakes nicely every time, forming a delicious  own crust.  Important to note is that the  ead does come out a bit sweeter than I remember regular wheat  ead tasting when I used to bake it.  But I have used this  ead for garlic  ead, sandwiches   you name it   and it's fantastic!  My kids love it for grilled cheese.          The first time I baked it, I made it in a  ead maker and I remember being unimpressed   it seemed too moist and dense.  But I tried mixing it in my stand mixer and baking it in the oven (which, by the way, was hardly any more work that just throwing it into the  ead machine) and it has come out perfect every time.  I've done the cinnamon  ead variation on the back of the package (which I made into french toast... yum) and also made bagels with this mix.  All turned out very well.  The bagels, while a little labor intensive with the boiling, were tender and delicious (and made fantastic roasted red pepper and herbed cream cheese sandwiches).  Purchasing this with Amazon's subscribe and save will save you a lot of money... you can't go wrong!
