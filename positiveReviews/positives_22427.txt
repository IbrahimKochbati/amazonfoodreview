Really good tasting popcorn, best I have tasted yet. A bit salty in my opinion. Just a hint, when making popcorn in theatre style poppers, always pre heat the kettle, it avoids soggy corn which sticks together. Fact is, the only thing that makes theatre corn better, is what's used in the preperation, meaning your oil and seasoned salt. You can make just as good as popcorn on a cheap popcorn maker with the proper ingredients.
