This is one of the first crackers I tried, yes if your gluten free it may work but doesn't hit the spot like regular crackers.  There are MUCH better alternatives for you.  The crackers are chalking tasting and no one in the family liked them.  We did find that Glutino nows sells a VERY good Table Cracker.  Little more expensive but they are great for your soups, chilis, meatloafs and taste just about like a saltine.  You can't go wrong with Table Crackers.  Also try nut thins   had more compliments on those crackers then with these. Don't waste your money on them (regular, cheese or veggie) YUCK!
