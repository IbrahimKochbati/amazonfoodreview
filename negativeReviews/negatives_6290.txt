I have had good luck with Fee Brothers for other mixers, but this Orgeat is very bland. Not much flavor at all. Yep, if I had read the ingredients I wouldn't have bought it...artificial flavors. Good Orgeat shouldn't be that obscure, but it has gotten hard to find. Important for many of the "Tiki" drinks.
