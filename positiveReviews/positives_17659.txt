I love coffee, however, occasionally I have stomach problems from drinking too much of it. A low acid coffee seemed ideal, but would the taste be there? I am picky about my coffee and would drink none at all rather than old coffee or, even worse, instant. I tried the French style, which is not my first choice, but I found it quite acceptable. A  bonus is that the coffee does not take on the metallic taste that coffee often does when allowed to sit for a while. I recommend this product to anyone who sometimes passes up a third or fourth cup due to acid stomach or nausea. I am now looking to see if Puroast makes Columbian or other types of coffee in its low acid line.
