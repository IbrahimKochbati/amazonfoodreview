I wish I had bought a single packet before committing to the case.  My baby made a horrible face when I gave this to him.  My husband and I both tried it and it has a very unpleasant and strong after taste.  We opened a few different packets to see if maybe only one was bad.  They are all the same.  Not sure what we will do with the rest of this case.
