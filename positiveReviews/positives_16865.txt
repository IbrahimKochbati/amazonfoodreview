I usually am not one to submit reviews but after having used this product for two years I feel that it is definately worth a review.  I love Busy Buddy toys in generalfor my Cairn Terrier and this Tug A Jug tops them all.  The bottles that I have always had are in the size small and have an actual rope in the bottle, not the rubber rope as shown.  The actual rope lasts longer as a dog can't as easily chew through it.  A rubber rope of the same size I feel that my dog could have  oke into two pieces almost instantly.  I have found that if the rope is  oken eventually it can be removed and the toy is not  oken!  I add a few ping pong balls inside the bottle and the toy works just as well, if not better.  My dog has enjoyed this toy from day one.  He is very good at figuring out treat dispensing toys and getting bored with them quickly.  The Tug A Jug has not bored him yet and it has been 2 years!          Besides reviewing the toy itself, I would like to state that I have purchased this both at well known pet stores and here at Amazon.  In the future, I will only buy this from amazon.  It is the exact same thing for almost half the price!  Way to go Amazon, this is great.          I highly recommend this Busy Buddy Tug A Jug to anyone who has a very smart dog that is food motivated.  5 stars.
