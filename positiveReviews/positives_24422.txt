My cats were having so many digestive issues with other dry cat food. Let's just say the kitty litter was a lot messier than I wanted to clean up. This food is healthier than the other stuff in the store, and I don't feel like a bad cat mom feeding them stuff. Plus unlike most dry cat food, i can smell it all ove the house. This has the scent stay in the bowl! Most importantly, my cats love it!
