Was nervous about ordering this because one reviewer said it was not fresh.. We ordered two bags and no problem. Our rat terrier and my daughter's standard schnauzer love this food. They rejected several other  ands and flavors before we found this food. Their coats are beautiful and they digest this product very well.
