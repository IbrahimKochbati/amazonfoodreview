I generally make all of LO's food organic from scratch (yes, I work full time, but this is important to me, so I make the time).  However, I've tried a few pre packaged foods...and while LO loves the taste of Chick Chick, and I like that it is more well rounded than most others, I absolutely hate this packaging.  If my little one decides he doesn't want to finish the package after three bites, the rest is total waste...or I have to scoop it into a different container to store until he's ready to finish.     Absolutely love the item, but hate the packaging.
