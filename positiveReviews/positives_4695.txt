Heat 8 10 oz 2% or whole milk, not quite to boiling, in your microwave. Add ~1 1 4 rounded teaspoons of Ghirardelli Mocha Hot Choc powder + ~1 1 8 rounded teaspoons of Ghirardelli Hazelnut Hot choc powder, stirring to fully mix. Now add ~3 4 oz Christian Brothers VS Brandy. (Optionally) garnish with whipped cream or a small accent of vanilla ice cream and serve.     Notes: Not to be a  and whore, but Christian Bros (VS, not the more expensive VSOP) is the only  andy I've found to really have the right profile for this recipe. Exact proportions for all 4 ingredients should ultimately be to your own taste. Non fat and 1% milk are NOT recommended. The  andy should contribute its flavor but not be so strong as to have an obvious alcoholic note. I've for many years used a 1.0 Mocha + 1.5 Hazelnut ratio, but lately the Mocha product hasn't seemed as intense, so I've adjusted. You'll know it's right when the mocha + hazelnut +  andy flavors are in such balance that none is too dominant    the result will be a new experience "greater than the sum of its parts."
