I purchased this to make "popcorn", which I saw on Andrew Zimmern's Bizarre Foods (Ethiopia episode, season three). I placed a small pot with a lid on medium high heat with some canola oil. I added the sorghum, and then kept the kernels moving. Amazingly, they actually started popping. I half expected them to simply burn, but they popped quite nicely. Sorghum kernels are very small, producing a miniature "popcorn" that is slightly larger than an unpopped popcorn kernel. Popped sorghum has a heavier, fuller taste than regular popcorn. Best of all, there are no kernel husks in the end result... just little fluffy popped sorghum. I experimented with popping different quantities and found that keeping the amount limited works best. With larger quantities, a significant number of the kernels did not pop. However, this wasn't all that bad... as the unpopped sorghum kernels were very delicious as well, not at all hard or crunchy. The unpopped kernels had a nice toasted flavor, a lot like corn nuts.          Sorghum is one of those "wonder grains", that is used for everything from making sugar, molasses, animal feed, alcohol and biofuel. But, I now know that it makes a nice popcorn as well.
