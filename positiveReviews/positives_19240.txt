I have a 95lb pitbull  mastiff mix that often loves his rope bone and his squeaker toy and thought it would be great to challenge him with some thinking toys.  I was a bit weary of this toy because my dog might chew up the plastic treat covers but found they are rather tough and that food incentive was greater than the chew incentive.  Overall it took about 10 minutes with the advice of the instructions and my pup was on his way to collecting treats from his new puzzle.  It takes him a few seconds now to pull the right cap off and start chowing on his goodies.  Another thing I would like to note is clean up is pretty easy.  I washed the tray and cups with hot water and soap and let dry next to the counter.          This is a Social Writeup
