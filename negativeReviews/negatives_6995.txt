I ordered this product after thoroughly enjoying a competitor's black truffle sea salt product.  I had high hopes in being able to equally enjoy a white truffle version of this condiment because I rate white truffle higher in the flavor scale than black truffle.  The item was delivered on time in a vacuum sealed pouch.  The aroma upon opening the pouch was hypnotizing   made my mouth water in anticipation.  I place a portion into a glass jar to serve from and left the remaining product in the re sealable pouch.          After a couple of weeks the aroma disappeared and so did the truffle taste in the salt from both the glass jar refrigerated sample and the remaining product in the original pouch.  Because the list of ingredients did not identify the source of the truffle flavor, I have concluded that this was a sea salt product with added artificial truffle essence, the laboratory created aroma of truffle that contains no real truffle bits or natural flavoring.  As such I believe I wasted my money on what is now a bag of sea salt whose saltiness is on the bland side as well.
