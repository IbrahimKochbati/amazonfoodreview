I first came across the seasoning mixture known as Scichimi Togarashi where it was used as a condiment at a Japanese fast food chain in Southern California.          It manages through a wonderful synergy of ingredients to be a flavor enhancing medium of addictive power.  I use it primarily on Asian foods, and even on plain rice.          It has a spicy bite when applied moderately and really heightens the taste experience when used on meaty dishes, or vegetables such as onion which are already not shy foods.          The mixture is available in Asian markets but intrigued by the description provided by See Smell Taste I tried their somewhat pricier version.  It was like night vs day, perhaps because theirs was fresher or not mass produced.          I will be trying other products from this seller along with regularly having more precious tins of Scichimi Togarashi sent my way.
