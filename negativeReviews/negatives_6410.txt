Whenever I finish a strenuous workout, the first thing I want to do is slam a cold, thick milkshake down my throat. There's nothing quite as refreshing as a creamy, sickly sweet, dairy based beverage to cool you down after pushing your body to its  eaking point. I've slammed can after can of this and felt like a Superman.          But seriously, I think that's exactly what this drink is for. No, really? I'm supposed to devour a 370 calorie milkshake after every workout? I understand it contains a lot of protein, but at 370 calories, you might as well be eating liquid hamburger. Oh, I see this is also supposed to be a "meal replacement." Just don't let your kids drink these to the exclusion of actual food.          The milkshake was alright, though. Honestly, it wasn't much more than a Carnation Instant Breakfast. It had that same taste and consistency. And despite its calories, it didn't fill me up at all. I guess that's what you get for drinking your calories. I probably wouldn't get it again.
