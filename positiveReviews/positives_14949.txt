I've recently discovered, and some may say become obsessed with raw nut and seed butters,  I had ordered and devoured a jar of raw pumpkin seed from a different supplier, Then when I went to reorder, must to my dismay, the price was now outrageous!  $65.00 for  a jar.  So I thought, what should I do?  Luckily, Amazon came through for me, I found this  and while googling on Amazon,,,,and gave it a whirl, Well, it came in today and it's yummy,  No complaints,  This will fit the bill just fine,  I am not sure if it is raw, but it is coldpressed,  And it tastes healthy,  Hurray! Is a better value for the dollar too!
