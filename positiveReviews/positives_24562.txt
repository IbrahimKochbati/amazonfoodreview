I love pumpkin for baking and cooking, but my puppy loves it to keep her digestive system running smoothly. I ordered a case of these for 1.63 per can.  As this can be such a hard product to find, that was a great deal for me.     I also use this for teething treats by  freezing little bits in ice cubes (for freshness) and letting the puppy chew on them to help her gums.  There is no sugar or other ingredients and very low water content.          I also did not have the problem that others encountered with the cans denting.
