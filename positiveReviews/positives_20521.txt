I usually purchase these by the case at a local Walgreen's, saw them here, and with free shipping, for about 1 3 less than I usually pay...well, I hesitated, thought "what if they are old and stale, probably why they are so much cheaper..". Well, I decided to go ahead and try them, and am so glad I did! They are as fresh, maybe fresher than the ones I have purchased local. I notice now, as I am leaving this review, they are no longer free shipping, and with the price of shipping, makes them about what I pay locally...so, I hope they go back to offer free shipping, as I love these candies, and buy them quite often. Bring back free shipping, keep the freshness!!!
