This is the best dog food!  I have seven dogs, three over the age of 14 and they are as spry and energetic as dogs half their age.  We went grain free years ago after one of our dogs got cancer.  I began reading about excess carbohydrates and how BAD they are for our dogs (and us)...Initially we used EVO because it was great and it was the only grain free availble.  We were very happy with it until the price went through the roof!  We tried several different grain free food over the next year or so.  Some the dogs just didn't like.  Some aggravated my Lhasa Apso's allergies.  A couple of my dogs are susceptible to yeast infections and the EVO had curtailed that problem but it came back with other foods.  Finally we tried Earthborn's Grain Free line and VOILA!  They love it! The price is right, no allergies or infections...everyone is healthy and happy!This is the best food around and the price is right.
