I am not GF but my 7 year old daughter is and I like to try everything with her.  She almost did not get to eat any of them because they were soooo good!  I'm normally not a crispy cookie kind of girl, but the flavor of these cookies was better than even most nonGF cookies I've had.  We bought a small package from STARBUCKS and will definitely be purchasing many more from Whole Foods.
