We have an old Jack Russell who started exhibiting stress related problems after our other dog died. Her skin was looking bad and she was chewing on her own feet and legs. I suspected that depression was suppressing her immune system from the loss of her housemate. So I ditched her garden variety lamb rice dog food and got her this grainless salmon potato blend instead. It worked! She stopped chewing herself and the skin irritations from that cleared up. She still has some other bumps but she is generally very improved and no longer presents stress related behaviors or symptoms. Best of all, with this food her poop stopped stinking. Salmon! Go figure.
