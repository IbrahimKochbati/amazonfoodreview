I have a family member on a gluten free diet, and can't wait to tell her about this product.  It's a decent substitute for cookies, cookie bars or cereal bars, most of which she must avoid.  It does have a rather "pasty" consistency to me, but the full flavors of chocolate and coconut make up for that.  They are a bit pricy as cereal bars go, but worth it for those in search of a tasty gluten free   and fairly nutritious   snack.
