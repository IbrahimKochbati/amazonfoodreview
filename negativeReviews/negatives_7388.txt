I bought this gourmet popping corn believing I was getting better than I can get a my local Trader Joe's... Wrong It was over priced, the shipping cost almost as much as the corn did and most of all the quality of the corn was terrible. The kernels were tiny and not fluffy when they did pop ...mostly they didn't pop. We could not wait to be done with this product! Also I asked to cancel the shipment before it was shipped because the shipping price was too high and still I got it.
