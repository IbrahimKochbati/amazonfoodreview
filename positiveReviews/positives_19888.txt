I hardly dared hope that this would be the product I remembered from childhood.  I was amazed to find that the taste and consistency were everything I could have wanted.  It's exactly the same!  I haven't enjoyed anything so much in years.  Apart from the nostalgia factor, this candy is excellent.  People who have never experienced it can now see what we've been raving about for decades.  I hope this is always available!
