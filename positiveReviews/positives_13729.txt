Nutella the amazing treat          Are you a chocolate lover?  Well if you are, Nutella is what you want!          Every day when I come home from school and have a banana I think "well I don't want just a normal banana." So I go to the cupboard and get some Nutella and boy is it yummy!           One of my most favorite thing about this product is it's smooth and creamy. It's  practically good on anything! One time I had it on a potato chip and it actually  wasn't that bad!           If you're on the go they sell little mini jars with crackers on the side, so your kids stay happy and entertained!           Another thing I love about is it is healthy for you so it keeps your kids happy and healthy at the same time!  Nutella is not like normal chocolate. it never melts and it stays good for quite some time. You know how some chocolate is a bad habit? Well this one is the complete opposite.      If you're a chocolate lover this is the chocolate for you!
