first, the good news:  YES, these are really good.     the bad news: They are loaded with monosodium glutamate     Of course, this wasn't listed on Amazon as one of     the ingredients.     This is a good item if you're not sensitive to     MSG       Now I have to go to the 7 11 and buy the fried pork     rinds to feed my addiction.
