The bamboo arrived about 2 weeks after ordering, all intact and well packed.  However, there were no instructions for caring of the bamboo.  It is now almost a month since arriving and part of the bamboo stalk looks like it is dying and turning  own (part of the heart shape).  I would buy more from this company if the shipping wasn't so costly (for the area where I live the shipping was about $10 and the product itself $15).
