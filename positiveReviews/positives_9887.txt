The product ia excellent.  I've been buying it for a number of years.          However, the 12 packages of Sesmark arrived at my house smashed to bits.  Most of the  individual boxes looked like they had been kicked all the way here by UPS. The first box I opened had exactly 17 whole undamaged crackers.  I strongly recommend redesigned packaging or an alternative shipping policy.          Thank you.          Joan Mewborn
