For anyone who wants a quick and easy meal or to doctor up a plain piece of pork or chicken, Shake 'N Bake is a classic. For me, it's the fastest, most reliable way to bake a pork chop or piece of chicken and not have it come out of the oven looking either like beef jerky or a leather jacket.          Yeah...not really known for my culinary abilities.          No fuss, no muss, no bother baking is what Shake 'N Bake is all about. And it tastes good, too. This classic was like a blast from my younger years, and it left my bone in chops just as juicy and moist as I could hope for them to be. The flavor is bold enough not to require further seasoning   and for a salt lover like me, that's saying something   and the  eading mostly stayed nice and crisp throughout. I was completely satisfied by the Shake 'N Bake pork, and glad they've revived the old classic. I have every intention of adding this one to my dinner rotation.
