I like some of Coffee Bean Direct coffees, but I cannot stand the taste of this one, and no one else in the house likes it either. I wish I could of bought it in a smaller package, rather than the 5 lb bag that cost over $30. I do not recommend this product to anyone, but everybody has their own taste, and some people may like it.
