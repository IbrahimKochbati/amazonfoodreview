I liked the variety and it tastes good and is very easy to make. This is awesome for college students who don't have access to a kitchen but it's also good because it's such a quick snack.          The downside is that the bowls are very small. It could probably be a meal for kids but for adults, it's more a snack unless you decide to eat more than one but if you decide to, the box disappears quickly.
