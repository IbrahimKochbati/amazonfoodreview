I've tried many  ands of extra bold K cup coffees and this one is the best. Well rounded and bold as the caption states. It has gotten slightly weaker over the years, but it is still good. Retail keeps going up here on Amazon as well as other outlets. However, Tully's and Newman's Own is currently much less expensive at the local Club store (C   co). The cost difference is forcing me to move to other retail and  and options. One item of note, the patent on the K Cup is expiring on Sept. 16, 2012. When Green Mountain Roasters is no longer the exclusive manufacturer of K Cups, we can all hope for a large decline in retail prices.
