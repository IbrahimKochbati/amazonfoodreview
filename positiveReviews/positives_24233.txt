Big Train is the best instant chai! Make it with boiling hot water , stir it  iskly and top it off with some cream or milk and it relaxes and calms you. Great when you want to unwind and have something  more substantial than just tea but not as rich as hot chocolate  and not as stimulating as coffee. Enjoy!
