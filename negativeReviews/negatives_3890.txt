Don't get me wrong, it is good. It is sweet and tart. It is slightly fizzy but not overly so. It is just big enough to quench your thirst before it gets warm.          But WOW, it was sweet. I mean, this is Kool aid meets Grenadine syrup with some lemon lime soda tossed in. So if you are looking for something like soda water with a slight flavor, just keep going. If you want a sweet drink to get rid of a craving, then this is for you!
