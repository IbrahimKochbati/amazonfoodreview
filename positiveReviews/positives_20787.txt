I use gum arabic powder in making Gomme Syrup for sweetening various classic mixed drinks.  Different web sites have wildly differing prices for what amounts to the same material.  This is the least expensive I have found and it works as well as any other  and I've used.  Thank you, Frontier, for a fine product at a low price!
