I was very glad to see this product offered on Amazon as the flavor is very hard to find in my shopping area and I have never been able to find it in sugar free.  It is one of my husband's favorites and since he is diabetic the sugar free aspect is a big bonus. Product is smooth and creamy and when made with skim milk practically calorie free :)
