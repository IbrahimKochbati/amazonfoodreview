After years of being unable to eat butter due to dairy sensitivities, we were delighted to discover Pure Indian Foods Organic Ghee. Not only is it packed with nutrition, it gives us the opportunity to enjoy the taste of a much missed staple. Apparently, according to Nourishing Traditions proponents,  it aids in digestion, as well. Although ghee is often compared to theater popcorn butter, we have found the taste of this ghee in particular to be much milder and natural tasting. We will definitely keep this stocked!
