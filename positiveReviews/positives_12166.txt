The box says it's "one of the most sophisticated blends you'll ever enjoy. Borrowing berry flavors from African beans, a full body from Indonesian beans, and a subtle smokiness from a touch of French Roast, this blend represents a spectacular tapestry of flavors carefully woven together."  It's still a smooth tasting coffee even with all of those descripters.  This coffee actually  ings together 4 different coffees from 3 different continents.          Actually, this coffee would be for someone who likes a smooth cup of coffee, it's comparable to Folger's medium roast.  You can still add your french vanilla creamer and sweeteners with no problem.  It doesn't cause the coffee to go bitter.  It wouldn't disappoint the avid coffee drinker nor shun the occasional java drinker either. Overall, it's a nice cup of coffee.
