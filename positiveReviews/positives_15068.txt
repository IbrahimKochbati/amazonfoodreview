I was thrilled to discover that some companies are trying hard to provide the general public with a healthy solution to their sweet Tooth.  I am trying to avoid any food products that have Aspartame or any other sugar free sweetener with the exception of Stevia, which my doctor has recommended we use as the alternative to all the others. So my Hat's off to you for your diligence and care; Thank you.          I tried the hard candy, sour fruits, licorice, and lemon but was disappointed...I guess my sweet tooth craves something a bit sweeter! The sweets just weren't sweet enough for me! Everything arrived to my house in a short time of ordering; the packaging is good quality and well presented, I just didn't care for the candy.  I felt there could have been more flavour.          Again, I commend you for providing this alternative to all of us who are trying to live a healthier life.          Eugenie
