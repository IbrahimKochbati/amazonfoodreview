I share some of the views of other reviewers, particularly the fact that this product is from Thailand.  Upon opening the first can of the Sesame Chicken, I was struck by how high the quality looked (the shredded chicken looked as if it had been plucked from the bone), as well as the yummy smell.  I was tempted to heat some up and try it myself!  Resisting that urge, I served it to my cats and they went after it like white on rice, lapping every bit of it up.  And I have some picky cats!     The following day, I gave them the Chicken Pot Pie variety; it smelled good, but looked more like chicken soup, with a lot of liquid (and yes, it was somewhat messy).  My cats (except for one) dove into it nonetheless, although they did not wolf it down in one sitting as they did the other flavor.     All in all, my cats give the product a big paws up; however, like another reviewer, I would tend to give this out as a special treat versus daily feeding.  For that purpose, I do recommend this product.
