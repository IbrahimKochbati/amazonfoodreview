so far, nothing extremely impressive. the taste to be honest isn't anything special (i've had MUCH better) and for the price you get what you pay for. a bit annoyed that the string is super cheap and always falls off but it came nicely packaged and arrived MUCH faster than i expected (by like 5 days) so i suppose that's a plus. all in all, if you're looking for something extravagant, keep looking. as for the 'benefits', haven't really noticed anything new... but i'll keep drinking for a couple weeks and see how that goes, then update my review... till then, yeah maybe i should i invested in something else (but since it was barely any money i guess i didn't do too bad)..
