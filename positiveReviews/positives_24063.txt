Sweet potatoes are among my favorite vegetables, and I especially adore sweet potato chips. So an Amazon Vine offer of these chips seemed a sure bet.          They taste a bit like sweet potatoes, yet ever so slightly sweeter     with fewer calories and half the fat of a bag of real sweet potato chips (100 calories, 30% from fat, compared to 130 calories with half from fat in a regular bag of chips).          But I agree with others. The taste is slightly strange     and the ingredients tell why. The key ingredient isn't sweet potato, but RICE FLOUR! Sweet potato flakes (whatever those are) come second, then tapioca starch. Next comes oil (sunflower, safflower, or canola) then yellow corn flour. And finally there's cane syrup     sugar     which explains why the chips seem a tad sweeter than sweet potatoes.          I like these Sweet Potato Popchips well enough, and will keep the box at the ready for  own bag lunches over the next several weeks.          I may buy them again, too     but only if no real sweet potato chips are available to satisfy my sweet potato tooth.
