Love the flavor, but 12 of the cups in the 24 count box were misshapen melted, as if they'd been exposed to heat during filling.  My husband used two of the ones that were not affected, so I'm not returning them, but certainly wish quality control had caught this.  The affected k cups are so misshapen they will not fit into the space in the Keurig.
