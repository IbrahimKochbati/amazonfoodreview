This is a great product, however, you can buy it in a salumeria in Brooklyn, NY for $9.99.  Frank & Sal on 18th Avenue  Brooklyn. And I'm editing my review because amazon assigned me the profile name "LIAR LIAR." Animals! I was only stating a fact about what a rip off the site is.  In the future ,Amazonn please don't call me a liar. That's not nice you stupid thieves.
