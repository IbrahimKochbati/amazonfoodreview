I definitely remember buying Turkish Taffy in all four flavors (Vanilla, Bananna, Chocolate, and yes, Strawberry) for $0.05 at our local drugstore when I was a wee lad. I took a bit of a haitus because I became an adult (sort of), and because the Bonomos stopped making it. But I never forgot the wonderful flavors and consistency of the taffy; my favorite was the bananna.          So imagine my surprise when I saw Turkish Taffy for sale at our local County Fair last week! It was for sale for $1.59 almost 32X more expensive than it was thirty five years ago. But the flavor is right on (bananna and vanilla), and the consistency is excellent. I was able to  eak it up into nice pieces at room temperature with a few well placed whacks! The secret is to hit it several times at different places along the length of the bar against a hard, rounded or "blunt" object, such as the edge of a curb or a stair railing. Don't smack it against a flat surface. I was willing to overlook the incredible inflated price (Note; its cheaper here on Amazon   $1 bar if you get a 24 count box) and I enjoyed several bars.          The only thing spoiling a very nice effort by the folks currently distributing the product is that the wrapper is all wrong. Either they didn't bother to do their reserach, or more likley, they are hoping we will overlook what is probably a large cost savings and manufacturing efficiency. Today's product is wrapped in a plastic sleeve that has a seam running down the back and is sealed on both ends. As millions of people my age know, this kind of wrapper makes it very difficult to get at the chunks, particularly the small ones, that you have just created inside the covering.          The old wrapper was foil with the color matching the flavor on the outside (yellow for bananna, etc.), and silver metallic color on the inside. The metallic wrapper could be gently unfolded first on the ends, and then along the middle to expose 100% of the marvelous, freshly  oken taffy...and then folded back up and stuffed into your pocket!! Very important for those quick getaways on your bike. (That might have had a bananna seat...)          EXPLANATION OF STARS AWARDED:     **** for the effort to reintroduce Turkish Taffy + * for nice flavor   * for lousy wrapper + * for outstanding  eakability   ***** Basically, the product quality trumps the lousy wrapper in my opinion, although I discovered its not a good idea to stuff a half eaten bar wrapped in cheap plastic into your suitcoat pocket. So if you're listening Bonomo People, please  ing back the foil wrapper. With the 20X price increase (based on Amazon's price for a box), there's got to be a little profit margin in there for the original, authentic foil. Really.
