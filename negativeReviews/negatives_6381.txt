Okay, so call me stupid, but I was searching for small packs of jerky for lunch snacks and saw this one advertised as 36 count.  I actually thought I was going to get 36 individual oz or less packages of beef jerky.  Imagine my surprise when I got one 15oz package (not even a pound) for $36 plus shipping.  I hope the taste and texture is worth it!
