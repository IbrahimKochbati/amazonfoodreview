I understand many people love these things, but I bought the sea salt and vinegar popchips and I hated them. I LOVE regular  potato chips lay's and other  ands. These popchips not only taste bad but they have a bad after taste to me.     I think these popchips must be for "heath" type people who try to convince themselves these taste good.     We like what we like and we all have different experiences about this type of thing.     After reading so many positive reviews I thought these would be good.     They taste "hallow", "empty", too artificial chemical taste.     With a regular potato chip I get the "that's it" sensation, satisfying, full flavor.
