I have to say my golden and cocker love these treats and they are great for dogs, like my cocker, that have allergy issues and need higher quality food. I bought these at a specialty dog store for 3.00 more and the treats seem to be more solid than the ones I got from Amazon. The delivered treats were not consistent and many were hollow inside. This isn't even mentioning the fact that half the bag many of the treats were badly  oken up but I can look past that versus the quality. Great treats and the dogs don't complain about my complaints :).
