This is for sure not what I was expecting it to taste like. It's not bad but not for me. I like the carbonation and juice idea with no added sugar. When I first took a sip of it I noticed it has a bite to it. The best way I can describe it is a non alcoholic champagne. I however did like it better than the watermelon but still not for me.
