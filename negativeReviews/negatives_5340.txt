I don't have any reason not to believe that this coffee is good for those reflux or acid sufferers. If you really have a serious problem and can't drink the stuff, try it. (I am a "refluxer", but not of the serious kind.)     So, this coffee did not give me any heartburn or acid reflux. But in terms of quality (taste) it is no better nor worse than any Folgers or Taster's Choice. You should perhaps investigate whether the price justifies it.
