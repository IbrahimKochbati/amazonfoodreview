This mole is definately better than Dona Maria.  I find that the flavors of Dona Maria are not well balanced, too spicy, too much dark cocoa, etc.. Rogelio Bueno on the other hand has several notes of cinnamon and clove as well as a lighter cocoa that pairs well with Chicken and Pork.  Adding a pinch of sugar gives it just a bit more sweetness which balances the spicy smokiness of the sauce.  When I use this mole, I often serve extra sauce, whereas with Dona Maria, people clearly don't think the sauce is anything special.          Reduced Sodium Chicken Broth is the way to go.  Approx 1 1 2   2 14 oz. cans is a good amount.  Extra salt is not necesary.
