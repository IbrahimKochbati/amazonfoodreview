This is great for a quick, easy, versatile dessert when you don't want to heat up the oven. Although it doesn't taste exactly like cheesecake, it's a pretty good cheesecake like dessert for the price. I like to make the mini cheesecakes suggested on the box and top them with fruit. One note of caution: Amazon's cost per box is a little high. In this pack of 12, each box of mix costs about $2.30, but a box costs around $1.80 in my local Target. So, I recommend this product, and I suggest buying it at a local store.
