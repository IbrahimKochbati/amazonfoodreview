contrary to all of the glowing reviews this is the worst Earl Grey tea I've ever had   and that is comparing against bagged tea from the grocery store in addition to other loose leaf  ands.          The smell is way too perfume like yet still a bit pleasant, but the taste is nothing like the smell.  Way too astringent for me   yuck.  I've tried various weights and water temps to no avail.  The first steeping is not good, the second is more drinkable for me, 3rd steeping is not worth the effort.          I've choked down the first can and a half.  I'm going to gift the 3rd unopened can to someone who might enjoy it more than myself.          This tea is so bad I wonder if Rishi is all marketing, packaging, and setting price points to  and a sub par product and then have a team post positive reviews all over the net.  I'm not saying its so, but it does make one wonder . . .          2 stars only because I didn't horque it up.
