I typically purchase my favorite "grocery store"  ands in whole bean form and grind them myself on my burr grinder.  My typical  ands are Peet's House Blend or Newman's Organic in a medium roast, as well as the occasional bag of Starbucks or Green Mountain.  Thumbing through Amazon, I was intrigued by the Melitta Cafe Collection Classique Supreme Ground Coffee, and its extra fine grind, so I decided to give it a try.          I was very pleasantly surprised by the Melitta.  The coffee was darker and more opaque than normal, no doubt due to the finer grind.  The aroma was very rich and robust.  The taste is actually much better than I am used to   a rich, refined roast with a smooth mouthfeel.  I find it to be much better than Millstone and equivalents.          After trying this coffee, I am placing an order for 3 more bags.  I definitely recommend trying a bag of this coffee!
