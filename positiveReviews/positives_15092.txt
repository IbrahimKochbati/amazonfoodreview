My dog loves this food.  I will say i was skeptical at first since everyone talked about a new formula that was terrible.  Well, maybe this is a new formula but my dog loves it.  He has no problems eating and i can use this food as treats.  He has a nice shiny coat and looks very healthy.  He did have diaeresis at first but that was because the  eeder for feeding him cheap stuff and took a while for his stomach to adjust.
