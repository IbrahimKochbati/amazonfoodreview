I got this tea to drink at my office and it's absolutelly delicious. It has a frutty, sour taste which I love, the color also beautiful. It has a high content of Vitamin C, so all I can say is that it's marvelous          Product arrived promptly and well packed. This is hard to find in a local store so I'm very happy with the product and the seller
