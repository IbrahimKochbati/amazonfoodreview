I have  ewed Coopers Dark Ale, English Bitters and Irish Stout.  Much easier than the kits that require 1 3 hours of boiling. I simply add 4 pounds of everyday cane sugar, mix it with hot water from my coffee  ewer, add 5 gallons of tap water and pitch the yeast. Sometimes it takes 1 week to  ew, sometimes 2 weeks. I stopped using the hydrometer a long time ago. It's obvious when it's ready to bottle. I prime it with half a cup of cane sugar and bottle it in 2, 1, and 1.5 liter soda bottles. They work great. I also bottle some in the clear Mexican beer bottles and use my capper. Bottom line: Home  ewed Coopers makes store bought beer taste like soda water.
