My favorite to use in my Keurig. The Breakfast Blend is not too strong, but it isn't so weak that I can't taste the coffee after adding creamer. I do not like a dark roast, but I also don't like an incredibly weak roast. This blend is absolutely perfect for those who like a coffee that is just right. :)
