Hands down, this is the best manufactured gluten free bar I have ever tried. However, it's definitely more like a dessert or a cookie than an energy bar. It's soft, chewy, and fragrant with coconut. The primary flavors are of oats, then coconut, then chocolate chips. I don't taste the chia seeds (which are the new "in" item of health foods). Each one is slightly over 1 oz, which means it's pretty small. In addition, it's also non dairy, if that is a potential allergic issue.          Per bar: calories (180), fat (9g), carbs (23g), fiber (2g), and protein (2g).          I sometimes have used Clif or Luna bars as a quick snack or meal replacement because of the added vitamins. I would not do that with this one; it's too sweet. It's sweeter than the standard Clif or non iced Luna bar. I might incorporate this as an occasional treat, but would definite not recommend it for "whenever".
