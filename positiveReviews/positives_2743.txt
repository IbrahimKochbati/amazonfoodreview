It's amazing how little popularity that Diamond Pet Foods seems to have considering the quality ingredients their foods contain!  I worked at a pet store for about four years. Our number one recommendations on foods were Natural Balance and Wellness  two EXCEPTIONAL foods that are pretty expensive.  But for those owners who have multiple dogs or even one large  eed dog, those  ands can cripple your budget.  So when I would get customers who absolutely LOVED their pets and wanted to be able to feed them healthy food without  eaking their banks, I recommended Diamond.  Diamond dog food costs about the same as those commercial  ands like Purina and Iams, but contains ONLY natural, healthy ingredients.  Just remember, the less garbage you feed your dog (by products, fillers) the less your dog uses the bathroom  AND they stay fuller, longer!
