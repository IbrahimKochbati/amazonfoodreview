I have two Kitties and they love their food. I saw this cat food here and because I care about the cats,I decided to investigate this food because it looked good. With the problems with the cat foods from China recently,I was concerned about the wheat gluten and other foul additives which are not good for the kittens.          This company has a really good website where they state that none of those foul additives are in their foods and because of the classy looking website I was relieved enough to get this for my  ood.          On opening the can,I was surprised and pleased at the look of the food.     Bits of carrot and beautiful chunks of white meat chicken in a rich looking gravy. They say it's "People food for cats" and it truly looks THAT good. But enough of my palaver, the important judges spoke up in the way that counts most,they concentrated on the new food until the plate was empty followed by contented grooming. The little girl cat is primarily one that picks at her food a few minutes then leaves and comes back later for more eating and on & on,but with this stuff she was parked in front of the dish till everything was consumed. I take that as a good sign
