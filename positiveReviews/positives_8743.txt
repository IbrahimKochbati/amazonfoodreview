I've heard that some grade B Maple syrups are too strong.  Maybe so, but this stuff is excellent.  This is the second quart we've received, and the flavour is perfect.  A bit stronger than grade A, but sweet, and very pleasant to my taste.          PERSONAL TASTE NOTE: I also like my honey straight from the hive, and unfiltered honey is sometimes a bit stronger, as well, as it has bits of pollen and comb mixed in.  That being said, I have friends who are more finicky and they like this batch of syrup, as well.
