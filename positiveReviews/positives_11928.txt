When you first give them out, be careful, you might just draw back a nub! Our oldest dog was very nonchalant about her treats. We just about had to beg her to eat them. NOT THESE. She went nuts over these and looked forward to them every night. The vet said I should give her liver to build her red blood cells up. It helped buy us a little longer with her I think. Now the other 2 dogs are addicted to them also! It is a HEALTHY treat that they love. They would eat the whole tub in one sitting if I would let them! It has no awful liver smell either!
