I have made Iced Chai Lattes with this mix for about five people now and they all LOVE it.  There are instructions on the side of the container that tell you how to do it.  It's very simple.  My only suggestions is this:  When it says to use 1 and 1 3 cups of powder, only use 1 cup.  It can be too sweet if you use the amounts they tell you to use.
