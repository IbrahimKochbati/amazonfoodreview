As we all know.....any canned soup, organic or not, should be avoided or at least limited.  It does work for storm supplies due to its easy medium term storage and it being infrequently or never used.  It will end up in a hunting camp for a few days of quick meals toward the end of its shelf life.  Everything tastes better in fresh air and this stuff isn't bad.  Again, its use is very limited.          Don't like the BPA issue either.  I did speak to Wolfgang Puck about PBA and their plans.  Like most, they are treading water to see what the government (friends of the fda) does or does not do about it.  What's a little more poison added to the current mix in processed foods.          Ever notice that most of the Wolfgang Puck soup ingredients here on Amazon end at "Contains 2% or less of the Following"........?          As I indicated above, we did try this soup, and it tasted ok, nothing special.  Try adding a little more sea salt. It is better than the MSG enhanced, preservative laden Campbell's  and crap, a  and we would not buy regardless of circumstance.  One never knows who actually made this soup.          We consider the organic versions the lesser of (insert remaining cliche), and have a case......in case.
