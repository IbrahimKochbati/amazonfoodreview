That doesn't stop the majority of us from drinking this though. Yet I write this drinking one, so I can stay up the rest of the night to write a 8 10 page research paper for my University, so what can I say? Yet as an athlete and the  other of a diabetic, I can truly say that these Monster Energy drinks are horrible for you. However, they are an addiction. Some smoke others gamble but I choose to drink Monster. It is the only energy drink I enjoy and I will most likely keep it that way.
