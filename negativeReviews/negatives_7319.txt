I was so excited that I found canned pumpkin since there is a shortage at this time.  However, almost ever can in the case was dented.  I don't know if it was shipped in that condition (poor quality control) or the damage occurred during shipping (poor packaging).  I would love to order this again, but don't want the hassle.  However, Amazon took the return with no additional cost on my end.
