I love using the Cooper's OS lager can as a base for making various pale ales. Since it has bittering only,I can add different hops & DME's to it to make light to dark amber ales. It's easy to get consistent results with. Especially when re hydrating the yeast in 1.5C luke warm water to which 2tsp of dextrose has been added.     It's a good product for experimenting for the beginner & experienced home  ewer alike.
