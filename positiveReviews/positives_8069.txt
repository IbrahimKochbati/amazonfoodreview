I will start off by saying I have yet to purchase this on amazon but I have purchased this at health food stores. So I can not say how it will arrive to you but i cant tell you about the taste.       Amy's organic has consistently done a great job of creating delicious vegan vegetarian organic food. This soup has a very similar taste to certain canned pasta product. It totally  ought me back to my childhood. It is extremely delicious, low in fat and calories. It is a quick and healthy alternative to the old stand bys we are used to. Whether to give your child a better lunch or a trip down memory lane for yourself please give this soup a chance.
