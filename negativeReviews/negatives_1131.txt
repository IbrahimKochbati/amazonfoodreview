After reading all the great reviews, I optimistically ordered some of this tea. I've had problems with sinus congestion very often this winter and have tried all kinds of remedies with little success.  Unfortunately, this really didn't do anything for me.  The taste is OK (bearable), but it did nothing to relieve my sinus congestion.  (So far the only things I've found that have helped me somewhat are the Vicks personal warm mist humidifier and Neti Xlear)
