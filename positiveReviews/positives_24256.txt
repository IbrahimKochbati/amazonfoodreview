I've been trying different  ands of chai for a while.  My favorite been the Border's Cafe chai.  However, since Border's Cafe was phased out in favor of Seattle's Best Coffee I was back to square one.  Actually, this chai is so similar to the one sold at Border's Cafe, that I am pretty sure they were their supplier.  My search is over, I've found my chai !
