The title of this product is "Kelloggs Frosted Mini Wheats, Bite Size Cereal, 58.8 Ounce Box (Pack of 2)".          I naively believed was a pack of two Kelloggs Frosted Mini Wheats, Bite Size Cereal, 58.8 Ounce Boxes, partly based on the obvious interpretation of the title, and partly because it was way overpriced to be a single box.          But it turned out that I actually got a SINGLE box of overpriced Kelloggs Frosted Mini Wheats, Bite Size Cereal, 58.8 Ounce Box.          Sure, the box DID pack two separate BAGS of mini wheats inside the one box, but that hardly qualifies as a pack of two BOXES.
