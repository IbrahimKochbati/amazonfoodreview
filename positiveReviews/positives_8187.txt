I love this stuff.  There isn't an instant coffee out there that's anywhere near this good.  This isn't even in the same category as any other instant.  It actually tastes like real coffee!  Shocking, but true.  It's (no lie) almost as good as freshly  ewed Starbucks.  It's also great for iced coffee and for adding to smoothies and other recipes that call for a coffee kick.  However, the stuff is so darned expensive that I feel foolish buying it.  Unfortunately, it has to be a special splurge when my budget allows.
