We found these tablets to be pretty fun! I suggest dissolving a full tablet in your mouth, not cutting it in half as others suggested. And definitely be sure to move the tablet around your ENTIRE tongue...I missed the back of my tongue when dissolving the tablet so whenever I'd swallow I'd get a hint of the real flavor.          However, it was definitely neat to see how the tablet changes your taste!! We tried lemons, limes, grapefruit, buffalo wing flavored potato chips, sour patch kids, warhead sour spray, dill pickles, oranges, whiskey, and wine. I found the ruby red grapefruit to be absolutely AMAZING. The dill pickles tasted so much like sweet pickles, I had to double check the jar to make sure they weren't! Pinot grigio was particularly delicious, as the tablet cut through the sour ness turning it super sweet!!          Oranges were okay, just tasted a little sweeter than normal. The lemons were still a bit sour but I found myself eating 4 slices of them, which I don't think I could have done without the tablets! I swear, the ruby red grapefruit was by far the best, in my opinion.          We found that the more sour a food, the more drastic an effect. I definitely recommend trying these tablets with a full fridge so you can experience all types of foods! I'd say some grapefruit, lemons, and dill pickles are a must to try with these.          They're great to try with friends, as the novelty wears off after one or two tries. As long as there are new people around though, it's fun to see other reactions to the tablets. Definitely recommend!!
