Delicious sunflower nuts, I mix the Honey Roasted with the Unsalted          I have tried most of the varieties of Good Sense Sunflower Nuts, and have enjoyed them all.  My two favorites  so far  are the Honey Roasted & Unsalted.  But I have found that a 50 50 mix of these two varieties is what I enjoy most.  The mixture is the just right compromise.
