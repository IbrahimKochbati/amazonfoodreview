My dog Penny is a ten lb. Jack Russell mini dachshund mix, and is a little over a year old.  She eats a limited amount of treats, but they are usually "healthy" treats I purchase from Whole Foods (Zuke's).  These treats are crunchy and scored to  eak in half, which is great since I have a small dog.  She ran off to "bury" the first two (one she retrieved from in her blanket, the other, still "buried" in my bed clothes probably!).  Once she started eating the first one, she got very excited when I gave her another.  These seem to be pretty tasty for her, and they are made from real ingredients (barley, lamb, carrots, apples, palm oil and molasses), which also happen to be organic.  I can recommend these for any dog.
