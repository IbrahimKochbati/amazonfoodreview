My husband and I are backpackers...so we have carried a variety of bars with us while we are out hiking.  This includes Quaker bars, Luna bars, Cliff bars, Zone bars, etc. So, because I like to change it up, I thought I would give these bars a try, even though they don't carry the protein I am use to.  Additionally, I liked the claim of these bars:  These bars are gluten free, are a good source of fiber, have 9 grams of whole grains per bar, include 180 mg of omega 3 fatty acids, and are sweetened with agave and coconut sugar.          The bars themselves come packaged in your usual packaging, and this design is quite attractive as far as designs go.          When I saw the bar itself, I was a little skeptical.  It looked more like a moist, waxy, lump of ingredients than the solid "granola" bar I was use to.  However, I continued on ahead in the tasting adventure.  Additionally, they are decent sized and the numbers of carbs, sugars, and fat are comparable to smaller bars  so I feel like you are getting more bar to eat than other  ands for the same nutritional intake.          As far as taste?  I've got to admit.  I was amazed at the taste.  These bars are delicious!  They have more of a fresh quality about them than your usual granola bar.  The combination of the oatmeal and the coconut work well together.  You taste those two flavors over the chocolate.  It's hard to explain   but I give an A + to taste, texture and size.  Texture is very soft and chewy, so easy to eat.  (Other bars have made my jaw ache from chewing).          I would purchase these bars again and I'm excited to try additional flavors.
