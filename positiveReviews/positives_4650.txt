I have been finding quality food for one of my kitties who has developed an allergy to chicken.  I hesitated on this  and because of the price, but then when I saw how limited my choices were I  oke down and ordered a few of the flavors.  I have to say I am very pleased with the quality.  I also ordered some Evo venison and duck as well as the Natural Balance limited ingredients venison with peas and the duck with peas.  Neither of those COMPARE to this  and and my cats testify to that as well as I do.  The texture is so much better and she loves these the most.  I have gotten her the rabbit, duck and venison and she eats them all with more relish that either Evo or Natural Balance.  I do have to say that of those lesser  ands, the Natural Balance venison does have a nice texture and not as "pasty" as the duck with peas.  Mabel wasn't as crazy about it though, although she did eat it all but not with the same excitement as the Instinct  and.  When you are having a problem with a cat that can not or will not eat something, when you find something she will, it is worth it's weight in gold!  This  and is a keeper.
