Puroast Low Acid Coffee     If all you want is low acid, try other beverages. With Data.     To start with I do experience occasional heartburn, reflux, etc, so this was a very exciting taste test. I  ewed a pot of fairly well renowned regular coffee, and a pot of Puroast. I poured both into identical cups, no milk or sugar to start with. The regular coffee had a deep  own color, while the Puroast had a black  own color. I tested the pH of both, the regular was about 5 5.5 while the Puroast was indeed 7.0 or neutral as claimed. First taste was of the Puroast as I did not want to be prejudiced by the regular taste. Good grief... It was wet, it was warm, very flat taste with no finish, hardly what I would call even an average cup of coffee. The best comparison is that to a day old coffee that has been left to evaporate and oxidize. Perhaps burned charcoal aroma with hints of bitter chocolate and caramel? The standard coffee by comparison had a rich coffee aroma, and the taste was wonderfully balanced coffee bean with tinge of vanilla, and a pleasant finish with a slight kick (the balance finish kick is unfortunately from the acid).          I now added some whole milk, and as expected the regular coffee mellowed out a bit, but all of the wonderful flavor still came across. Incredibly when I added milk to the Puroast, it turned a poor tasting cup into an awful tasting cup. The flavor now became that of  mostly spoiled milk! This was such a strange sensation that I had three more people confirm the sour milk phenomenon. To top things of, the color had now become that of black  own mud.          So all in all, this was a bad experience. If you have a need to drink a low acid coffee do this. Get yourself your favorite cup of coffee and a bottle of antacid instead.
