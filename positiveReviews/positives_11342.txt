I first found these at our local "mart" store (you know which one) but they are often out of stock totally or only have one flavor.     This flavor, the apple cinnamon is good, but not my favorite. It's basically just applesauce with cinnamon like you can buy in the big jars, but this has no preservatives, colorings, additives, water dairy or gluten nothing artificial...just apples and cinnamon, but the texture is much smoother than regular applesauce. It's not as smooth as baby food, but somewhere in the middle. It's extremely convenient for on the go, for kids *no spill and it has a cap!*, trips etc. They're a little spendy..in fact, more so here than at the local store, which is strange, but worth it to have the type you want, when you want it. I actually think my husband and I like it more than my 2nd grader! My personal favorite is the apple strawberry flavor. I'm not a banana fan, so i haven't tried that flavor.     This  and also makes pure fruit bites, which are basically fruit snacks, but without added sugar, preservatives or anything but 100% fruit..and best of all in my opinion, NO GELATIN! They're very yummy, more so than sugary fruit snacks...they're a little tart which is nice. It's so great to have good snack food options, they're a great, fun way to get your daily fruits in. And, like the fruit pouches, they come in a resealable, ziplock type pouch which is also super convenient.          All Natural     No preservatives     No added sugar     Soooo YUMMY!     ..who could ask for anything more??
