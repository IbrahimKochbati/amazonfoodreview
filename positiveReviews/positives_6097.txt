This is not a coffee that I would drink on a regular basis. My morning coffee is freshly ground. However, at work I occasionally want a cup in the afternoon and the Folgers and Maxwell House that my coworkers  ew is undrinkable. The price on this coffee is a bit high but the taste is better than any other instant coffee I've tried so I'll keep getting it until I find something better and cheaper.
