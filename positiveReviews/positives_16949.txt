This product is super. My dog tends to wolf her food down and then wonder where it all went. Putting a cup of her food in this thing at dinner time makes her 'work' for it.     It is VERY tough, and with a dog as hard mouthed and persistent as mine, it has to be to last. She hasn't  oken any part of it    which means it's indestructible.     I'm trying to train her to  ing it to me when I say, "where's your bottle?" We'll see if she catches on.
