Most toys bones don't last long with my dog, this product lasted about 2 weeks, which is pretty good for something that's not plastic. My dog also LOVED this bone, he would chew it non stop for hours, and I plan on getting him another. One thing to watch out for is shards, most were large and so I didn't have to worry.
