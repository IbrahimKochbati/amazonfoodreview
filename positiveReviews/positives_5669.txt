My cairn, Jack, and westie, Mojo, both love the lamb what we refer to as "doggie cookie bones."     They're finally accepting the need to go out onto our five scrub acres to relieve themselves     with help of the Pro Plan Biscuits with Real Lamb as a reward.  We use the small ones as Jack     tends to overeat and Mojo weighs less than 20 lbs. This one item added to their daily menu has     made a huge difference in our household, reducing the "mama's not happy" time to about zilch!
