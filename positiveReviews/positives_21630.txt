I got this after reading about a study that said four cups of white tea a day   and no other changes to diet or exercise   could result in 4 to 8 lbs of weight loss in a year, and would actually reduce the number of fat cells in a person's body!  [...]          One note: this tea is not just white tea, but has green tea as well.  While I don't object to the tea having green tea in it   the study suggested that green tea was also good for weight loss, but not as good as white   it's certainly not obvious from the name, and I feel a bit deceived.  If it's White & Green Tea, call it White & Green tea, not White tea.  That's the reason I knocked this down to 4 stars.          For those that think that four cups of tea is a lot...  You're right.  But this tea is mild enough, and tasty enough, that I've been doing it for over a week and haven't gotten sick of it yet.  We'll see if that keeps up!
