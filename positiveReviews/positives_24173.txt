I bought a 2 pack of the liver flavored Everlasting Treats to see if my husky g.shepherd puppy would like them. She ate the first one in one sitting. That wasn't very "everlasting" and at nearly $4 ea it was an expensive treat. The 2nd one she took 2   3 days to eat, so I decided I would buy more of them as an occasional treat. My next puchase included the treat ball and a couple of other flavors (BBQ and Vanilla Mint). I put a Liver and a Vanilla Mint in the treat ball and she went LOVED the VM. It took effort this time to enjoy it, and she worked on it for over a week until there was nothing left but a disk of the treat in the treat ball (so I removed it, gave it to her, and put a new treat in the ball). The ball definitely helped a lot in slowing down the consumption time of the treat and she enjoys playing with it.          Two paws up!
