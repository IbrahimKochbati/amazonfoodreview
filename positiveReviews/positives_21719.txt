I love making pea soups   all kinds.  I received these peas a couple of days ago from Amazon and made my first batch of curry pea soup today.  These peas are some of the cleanest and of the highest quality I've ever purchased.  I always rinse and sort me legumes before I cook them and usually find something to sort out.  Not with these.  They where all beautiful and well formed with no trace of dirt, stems or any other de is.  I'm very impressed.  Oh, and they taste wonderful.  I highly recommend you purchase them   in fact, purchase two so you qualify for Amazon's free shipping!
