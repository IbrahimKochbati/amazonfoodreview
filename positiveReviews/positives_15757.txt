Both entrees were popular at my house, with all my furkids except "Mr. Picky!"  This product line should also be popular with humans, because it has a pleasant odor, and it looks like "people food," as the box says.  If you're concerned about issues such as "gluten free," it's that, too.          I did feel that the "Chicken Pot Pie Entree" had a lot of liquid in proportion to the amount of solids, especially for the price.  About half the can is  oth.  Kitties who prefer minced meals would probably not like this.
