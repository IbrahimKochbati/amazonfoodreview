Do not buy this! We repotted most of our plants with the soil and the one's with the soil are full of gnats. The one's that we didn't use it on don't have any. The potting soil has caused gnats to get everywhere in our house. I almost bit into a snadwich today with a gnat right where I was about to take a bite. They've been found in other food, drinks, dive bombing peoples heads and everywhere in between. So, unless you really like gnats, I would suggest another  and and DEFINITELY NOT this one!!!!
