This rice is very expensive in my area....when I found it here on Amazon I was thrilled !!!!     It's the only white rice our family eats now.....we love rice and this is so easy and fool proof to make that it comes out perfect every time....it tastes great, has a sort of nutty but light taste to it (hard to describe?), very flavorful either plain, with butter, or as my kids like to eat it with a little organic soy sauce mixed in. It is a softer type of rice....not as firm as some rice can be, but I prefer this type. Makes a nice lunch mixed with a little bit of chicken or beef teriyaki.     I recommend this rice....good stuff !!
