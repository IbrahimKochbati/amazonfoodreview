Quaker Oats have been a staple in my family for generations. It was the only oatmeal that my maternal grandmother prepared, although she always used the Old Fashioned Oatmeal that was actually cooked (and added real sugar, not sweetner, and whole milk for the best oats I ever ate). If she were alive today, I know she would have tried Quaker Instant Oatmeal in the packets. Prepared according to package directions, the oatmeal comes out smooth with no lumps. I found the  own sugar taste more than acceptable, but as usual with maple flavor I don't find it authentic, and there was a bit of an aftertaste. Each packet is one serving, which I don't find sufficient for a whole  eakfast, so adding toast and fruit, or bacon or sausage on the side makes for a meal that will stay with you for more than an hour or two. The packets are convenient for campers, hikers, vacationers, or office workers as they do not take up much room, and can be prepared quickly where hot water is available. And they can be eaten just plain, without milk, and still be a  quick meal or snack.
