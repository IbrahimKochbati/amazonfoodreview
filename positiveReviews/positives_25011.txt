The peach flavored tea is one of my family's favorites. The peach taste is just right  not too strong or syrupy tasting. There is also no chemical taste as sometimes happens with artificially sweetened drinks.          This is really easy to make. I just pour two packs into a large pitcher, stir, and keep it in my refrigerator so I always have a nice cold drink. It is very refreshing.          Shop for price. On sale at my local supermarket I can buy 4 packs for six dollars.
