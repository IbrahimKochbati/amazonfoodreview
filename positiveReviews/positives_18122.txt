I had never seen these chips before so I ordered the cheddar and sour cream and onion.  They were on special and it was a great value.  I love the individual bags, and the cheddar are my favorite.  They are definitely better than baked chips.          After I bought these I saw the larger bags at Stop and Shop, but I will keep getting the individual size from Amazon.
