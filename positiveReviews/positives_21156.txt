I first had tried this ginger drink while vacationing in Puerto Rico.  Since then I have purchased this in the Asian stores... it's delicious and so good for the stomach.  When we went on our cruise I took my own supply and used it on a regular basis for if needed sea sickness.  It taste delicious and good for all that ailes you...
