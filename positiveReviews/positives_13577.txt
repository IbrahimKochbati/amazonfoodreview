A little education in Ayurveda   In Ayurvedic principles, the Kapha 'element' is said to be similar to clay (elements of water and earth). It helps to hold our constitution together and provides structure, fluid balance, endurance and strength. It is the slow, stable, calming, sweet and cold aspect of the self and governs our resistance to disease and promotes self healing.          An imbalance in kapha leads to respiratory illnesses, excess cough cold symptoms, weight gain, general feeling of laziness heaviness.          Kapha tea is an excellent antidote to a kapha imbalance   the tea itself is spicy and invigorating with strong notes of cardamom, ginger followed by cinnamon and lemon verbena.  It's spicy, complex and my new favorite!  I ordered a bodum tea press so I can  ew this tea at work.
