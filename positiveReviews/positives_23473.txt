Just like I remember when I was a kid!  You know, the ones that you got at grandma and grandpa's house?  And just like when I was a kid, these Turkish delights make me want to sneak plenty more than one at a time they are soooo good!  The rose flavor is the best.  (Just don't give them to your kids  because they will love them too and then you will have to share!)  Seriously delightful!
