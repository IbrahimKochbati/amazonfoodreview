I bought this as a gift for my mom.  She loved the box and the candy was tasty but if you look at the picture in their advertisement it must be a close up because what I saw come out of the box looked like about half of what they show.  Truthfully, unless you're into home made candy, save your money and buy some English Toffee at Walmart.  It's probably just about as good and a lot less expensive.
