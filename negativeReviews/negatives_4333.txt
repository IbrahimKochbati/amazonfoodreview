The orange and lemon peels make this tea very hippy.  Despite  the initial oohing and ahing over the pretty blue flowers, this is a regrettable purchase.  I was hoping for a stronger bergamot component than Twinings' Earl Grey but instead I got something that seems very herbal.  Blech.  I disagree with the positive reviews.
