My dog loves them.  She is a 50 lb aussie and these are just the right size.  She clearly prefers them to any others we have given her... and this dog has gone through many bones in her day!  They are much thicker rawhide than some of the cheap ones you can get at the grocery store.  I like that they are natural too.  A little pricey, but my baby is worth it.
