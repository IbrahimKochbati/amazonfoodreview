my son, who is six months old an a very avid eater of baby food (he generally eats whatever we put in his mouth with gusto) actually made an "ick!" face when i put the crisp apples mix in his mouth.  i think that's the first time i've ever seen him do that with a food.          we tried both the crisp apples and the plump peas.  he ended up tolerating both (he definitely prefered the peas to the apples), but i tasted them myself, and, YUCK.  the plump peas taste like what they are...powdered.  they don't taste fresh at all.  the apples taste a bit better, but are kind of grainy and odd...and while i thought the sweet taste was OK, like i said, my son didn't seem to like it much at all.          i wish we liked these better because i love the idea of a lightweight baby food that we could stash in our diaper bag that doesn't weigh much....too bad these aren't it.
