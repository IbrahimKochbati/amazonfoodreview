Our guests love this popcorn!  The premeasured portions make it so easy to use, and while it's not perfectly easy to add the ingredients, for us it's more about the location of the kettle in our theatre style machine than the packaging.          Easy enough for my kids to make (teens, as I would worry about younger kids getting burnt on the kettle).          For those who think it's too salty, that is easy enough to remedy, don't use all the salt!  Salty is a matter of taste, and some people might think the saltiness is just right with the amount they put in each package.  So, isn't the amount of salt they provide just right?  If they used less, there would be people complaining that there isn't enough salt.          We think it's great!!
