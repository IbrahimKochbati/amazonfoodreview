Lavazza Super Crema in this configuration made terrible esspresso, terrible french press, terrible moka pot and the worst (outside of Folgers) drip coffee I've ever paid for.  At $30 per bag on average I thought I'd get a deal with the great reputation and taste of Lavazza that I'd experienced in restaurants and coffee shops.  Something must have happened to this shipment to ruin the flavor of this coffee.  I could not get a crema on any of the preparations I used, despite using a burr grinder, spice grinder etc. I feel as though I tried everything but a $2000 espresso machine and grinder to get a good cup...to no avail.  DO NOT BUY this product.  Stick to store bought Lavazza or the great reliability (albiet more expensive) Starbucks etc.  If I could get my money back, I would.  I bought three bags with a grand total of $91 invested thinking it would be a great hedge against rising coffee prices.  I reapeat, DO NOT BUY this product.
