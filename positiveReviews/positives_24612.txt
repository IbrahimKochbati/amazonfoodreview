My cats are canned pumpkin connoisseurs, though I do wonder about their street cred because they like the awful crud in Libby and other generic store  ands.  That said, this  and got a paws up from all of them.  The crazy critters will lick it off a spoon when I open a can.  Once opened though, the magic is gone.  It returns once mixed with their raw meat. :)          I use this  and for my pumpkin recipes because it tastes fresh and is not watery.  I'm fortunate to have received intact cans, so I'm sorry to read of others' experiences.  The product though is excellent quality.
