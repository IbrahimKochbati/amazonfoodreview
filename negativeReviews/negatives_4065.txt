A box of these was included with my new Keurig system. I fear and detest weak coffee, but a 10oz serving of this is still strong, with a satisfying body to it. Another positive is that it's not sour, like I found the Kona to be, nor it is especially bitter. But, though I'm fine with dark or French roasted coffees, the Newmans Own Special Blend tastes flat out burnt to me. Next job is to try a sampler pack to find my perfect K cup.
