If you like the taste and texture of steal cut oats more than "instant" oatmeal, but don't have the patience or time to cook the real stuff, give these a try!  The texture is much closer to steel cut oats, and the prep is super easy (a couple minutes in the microwave oven).  I have not bought a single pack of instant oatmeal since I discovered Coach's Oats.  I recommend them to everyone.
