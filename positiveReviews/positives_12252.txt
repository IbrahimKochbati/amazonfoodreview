I ordered two boxes of these bones for my commercial kennel.  I chose the Sportmix products because I was assured by their customer service rep (who responded to my inquiry within the hour) that the ingredients and manufacturing are US based.  I do not purchase foreign pet food ingredients   particularly China made pet products.  I am thoroughly happy with the apparent palatability of the bones.  The dogs fall over each other to get one.  I am a little dissatisfied with the condition of many of the bones   about 20% of them are  oken due to packaging.  They are not stacked   just loosely placed in the box to be knocked around during delivery.  This is the only thing I can fault, though.  Otherwise, a fair priced, quality, USA MADE product.
