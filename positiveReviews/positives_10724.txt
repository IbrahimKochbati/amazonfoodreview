I was kind of surprised after seeing smelling the biscuits but both of my dogs, including my notoriously picky Chihuahua, eat them up. They seem pretty hard but my little dogs (Chihuahua and Toy Fox Terrier) didn't have issues eating them and they are just the right size snack for little doggies. The only problem I have with them is that, because they are so crunchy, after my dogs get through with them there are crumbs all over the place.
