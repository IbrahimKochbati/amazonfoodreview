I was looking for an alternative green or white iced tea powder after I realized that the Lipton  ands all contained sucralose, and did not come in an unsweetened version.  I found Stash tea online and decided to try it, using stevia as the sweetener.  I bought the lemon ginger flavor.          By comparison, I think the Lipton powdered iced tea I had been used to drinking was more like sweetened and colored fruity "kool aid" for adults.  This is different.  I am having to get used to the green tea taste, and it upset my stomach a little (when I drink hot tea, I usually drink white tea, because I like the mild taste).          I tried using only half to a third of the packet in 16 ounces of water and that worked better.  I would probably like white tea better, but Stash doesn't make any white tea in the iced tea powder mix.  Anyway I hope to get used to the taste.  Since right now I like it watered down, it's really a good deal as far as price.
