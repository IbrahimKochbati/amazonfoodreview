I used to eat tofu almost every. And i havn't had those for a while.     So i was searching and i was actually surprised that amzon has tofu!     I was Half curious and Half pleased!So i bought it..and i don't regret it.     It's Organic, cheap and doesn't need to be refrigerated until opend.     I just like to eat these by it self or with udon soup.     I am going to buy this again. So good..: )
