This popcorn isn't bad tasting, but doesn't live up to the claim that it's like theater popcorn.  I think it's a little pricey based on the quantity of popped corn and the overall quality.  However, it is very convenient and hasn't gone to waste when made.  This full pack produces about the same corn quantity as half to three quarter cup of Orville's.  If more of the corn popped (lots of kernels wasted) and or the price was reduced, I would give it a 5 rating because of the combination of decent quality, good price, and convenience.
