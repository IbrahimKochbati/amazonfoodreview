This is my first Erin Baker Breakfast Cookie experience. I put all the cookies in the freezer upon arrival. I followed the supplied helpful hint to toast the cookies on the darkest setting.  Memories of my Grandmother's winter cookies warm from the oven commenced...tasty, toasty, outside and warm soft inside. These are yummy with a tall glass of the coldest milk or a hot coffee to go. I would buy these again.
