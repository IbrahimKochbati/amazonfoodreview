I thought the large would be too big for my Corgi's, but they seem to manage with it just fine. I did not notice that it comes in different sizes. My dog figured out how to get the treats out pretty quickly though. I also have the StarMark bob a lot and that seems to take them a little longer to get at the treats. You can adjust the hole sizes on the bob a lot.
