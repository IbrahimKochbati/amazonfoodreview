I started loving Oolong tea after I discovered a bottled product called 'Tejava'. That product is over a dollar for a 12 ounce bottle. I needed something less expensive so I tried this 'Prince of Peace'  and Oolong.          After a few  ewing experiments, I now love this stuff.          What I have learned; If  ewing as 'sun tea' this type of tea seems to come out very weak. If you put this tea in boiling water, it may come out bitter.          I now heat up my water in a microwave until it is, very hot to the touch, but no way near boiling. I then put in the tea bags and let it  ew for about twenty minutes (I like strong tea). I have, to my taste, duplicated the 'Tejava'  ew at a fraction of the original cost.          Enjoy          Ken
