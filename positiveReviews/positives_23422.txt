I am so glad that Amazon carries this in Prime now. We've been buying from petsmart which is both expensive and inconvenient. I really hope that let me subscribe and save at some point in the future!          Regarding the product, this really is the best cat food. My cats' coats are beautifully soft and shiny, they have a good level of energy, and I honestly think it helps with shedding.  We recently adopted a second cat, who was being fed purina pro plan. his coat was gritty and he shed like crazy, he was slightly overweight and kind of sluggish.  after about a month of avoderm, his coat became as soft as our other cat, lost the gritty texture, he lost the weight and has enough energy to keep up with his new friend. the kitties are healthy and happy   i won't feed them anything else.          also, i concur with the other review about the salmon flavor, my cats didn't really care for it either.
