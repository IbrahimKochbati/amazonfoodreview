I've probably tried about 15 varieties of beans from Rancho Gordo.  They're all excellent.  Some are better suited for one type dish than another, and if you visit their website, they will tell you what works best for which dish.          Some are just plain gorgeous to boot!  And being heirloom, I believe you can also save some back to plant, if you have the climate for growing them.  (Unfortunately, I don't.)          Out of all the ones I've tried, we like the Borlotti best   they cook up plump and will hold their shape, with a creamy interior.  They're fantastic for Mexican style beans   frijoles borrachos, refried, whatever you like.  And I've also cooked them with ham hocks garlic onions etc. for a delightful bowl of beans.          This particular assortment doesn't have the Borlotti beans but you could always add them to your order!  It's a nice sampler and will get you hooked on their products.          Oh yeah, sign up for their newsletter too, Steve sends out a good one with recipes and stories of the beans.
