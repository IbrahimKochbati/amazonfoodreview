I got my first package of the chili mix, from my sister in law. I did not know what I was in for, but gave it a try.  I made it according to directions, and threw in some  owned hamburger. The smell filled the room, as it boiled, and simmered.  I was not disappointed, with the way it tasted.  I don't like my chili spicey, and this one fit the bill exactly, as it has just the right amount of spices and herbs. I have tried a lot of chili, in a lot of places, and I will say that this is  the best MIX that I have ever tried. I would definitely recommend this for camping trips.  The 9.8 ounce bag, says that it makes 8 servings, but depending on how hungry your crew is, might only feed four.
