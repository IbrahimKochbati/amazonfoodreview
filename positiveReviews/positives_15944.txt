I was absolutely thrilled to be able order these as unique stocking stuffers this year. But, was I the only one who saw the movie "Serendipity" in my family? These packets of "Frozen Hot Chocolate" are just as delicious as everyone (in the other reviews) says they are. (Which makes me doubly happy that I ordered them!) Before they even arrived, I thought how silly I was to only order one set and went back and ordered more. My son and I just had to try it out before we gave these away for the holidays. It is even great mixed with ice cream. My only complaint is that the shipping is quite steep for these lightweight packets. Otherwise, I am a very happy customer!
