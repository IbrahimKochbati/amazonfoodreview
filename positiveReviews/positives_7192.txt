My cats are more enthusiastic about Turducken than just about any other cat food. They literally lick the plate clean. Even my LaPerm, who usually just gives me "silent meows," manages to squeak out an audible meow when I start putting this on a plate.  The ingredients are much higher quality than many  ands, too (no by products, corn, etc.). I will be ordering more.
