I tried these on a whim after hearing about Veggie Booty for a long time.  I knew I wasn't ready for VB, but I could certainly try out a new kind of cheese puff.  I previously thought that a day without Cheetos was a day wasted, so this was a big change.          These are the best things ever!  They taste like real cheese and there's some variation in the intensity of the flavor   every single one doesn't taste exactly the same.  They aren't as crunchy as Cheetos and don't turn your fingers orange!          After trying a couple bags purchased at the grocery store, I decided I loved them enough to invest in this 12 pack from Amazon.  Okay, so maybe I went a little wild and had a bag (or two) a day until they were gone   don't judge me!          Try these out!  Buy a bag at the grocery store and then get the 12 pack.  You'll be very happy that you did!
