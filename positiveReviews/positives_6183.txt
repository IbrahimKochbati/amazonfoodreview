I have a 10 month old Weimaraner that loved the Busy Bone Chewbone treat. He has some separation anxiety and they can help keep him calm. It takes him about 15 20 minutes to eat but it is long enough for him to calm himself down. I just make sure he keeps it off white stuff. The red  center bleeds a little if he drops the wet side down or a piece gets  oken off and falls on a light surface.  My dog will chew on one end then leave it if he gets distracted then come back and chew on the other end and the wet side dies surface he is on. I have been able to clean it out of stuff easily enough but it is a little bit of a annoying that I have to. I also wish they were cheaper.
