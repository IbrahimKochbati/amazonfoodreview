I buy these for my yorkies for beautiful hair and healthy hearts. They love the salmon paws with  occoli, and no diarrhea  issues     from the salmon, because of the  occoli. Good for their sensitive digestive systems, and nice chewy texture for their teeth, easily  oken up is a big plus for tiny mouths. Seller is very prompt and never a problem.
