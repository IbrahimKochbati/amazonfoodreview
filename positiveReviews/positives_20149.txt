I used to drive 15 miles down to Sunset Blvd in L.A. just to get this drink. I remembered back in '95, Orangina bottles sold from Terner's Liquor had the exact shape and size like Clearly Canadians'(16oz?), after a while I couldn't find it anymore. I searched everywhere, including places like BevMo, zilch! All of a sudden it emerged out of nowhere in the form of slightly smaller "bulby" bottles. There is just something about this beverage, that I'll never forget the taste of it, the lightly carbonated juice stings your tongue and not too sweet. It was and still very unique and refreshing. I have not been able to locate this drink for about 10 years and was lingering in my mind from time to time every time when I passed by the L.A. area.....until now, thanks to Trader Joe's I stock 'em up chilled!
