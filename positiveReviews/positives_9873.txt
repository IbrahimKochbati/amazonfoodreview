I usually never leave any reviews but since the product is worthy and there's no feedback at all I decided to do it. I ordered this tea because I have some mastopathy and my  easts hurt much during my cycle. Things seemed to get a bit worse a couple months ago so I decided to give this tea a try. I come from a country where there is a lot of trust in herbal medicine, I personally was exposed to Chinese herbal medicine as well so I thought I should try. I drank it for about a month once per day and I already see results! During this cycle my  easts got much better, almost not sensitive at all, just a bit by the very end of it. I will continue drinking it and will recommend it to all my girlfriends with the same problems. It is natural, it doesn't contain any hormones and it DOES work. It tastes very much like regular green tea with jasmine(because it has a small portion of both of them) and that's why I don't recommend to drink it before going to bed because it can keep you up( green tea has a bit of caffeine, a tiny portion). I drink it either in the morning or at  lunch time, it tastes good and helps you to wake up( and unlike coffee, green tea doesn't damage your kidneys).
