I just purchased this product and it was sent to me on thursday.  When I say nasty, cardboard taste, please believe me. I am on a low carb diet and these were just too disgusting for me to digest.  My sister, however loved them and downed them with a glass of riesling. She thinks that they are great! I on the other hand found them to be foul in taste and gritty in texture. Perhaps they would be better suited as a replacement of croutons in a salad.
