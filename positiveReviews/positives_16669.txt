As always, amazing price on amazon. Paid the same price for 45 chews, as I did for half the amount at the local pet store. Product shipped extremely quick even using the super saver shipping. My dog absolutely loves these treats. She hates going to her crate, but if I grab one of these out of the box that it came in, show it to her, and say "bed" she literally sprints to her crate in anticipation. Highly Recommended. Oh and her  eath is about half as stinky as it was before I started giving her these.
