I was so excited to find this coffee. I do have acid reflux and I thought this would be great for people like myself. I regularly take Omeprazole. I was not expecting this coffee to do magic but at least not produce more acid. I don't really know if it works for people with acid reflux because I could not drink more than half a cup as it doesn't taste good at all. It's not like it is too strong to drink   in fact it's very light. But the taste is weird.          Having said that, taste is a personal choice so some people may love it. Don't decide based on a review. If you're considering this, I strongly suggest trying it for yourself to see if you may like it.
