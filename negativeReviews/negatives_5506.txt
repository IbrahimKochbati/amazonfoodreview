Wow... terrible.  It's so bad that I actually logged onto Amazon to tell everyone how bad it is!  I didn't even buy it from here.  If I kill someone today, it's because a. this was terrible and b. not even close to enough food.  I'm assuming they taste test their food right?  Also "Fresh Mixer"????  Seriously???  A package that contains cooked chicken and is "good" for 2 years, hahaha, now THAT'S Fresh!!!  I'm sure there are no chemicals added to do that!  Don't get me wrong, I love me some chemicals, but those food's aren't labeled "fresh."  FAIL
