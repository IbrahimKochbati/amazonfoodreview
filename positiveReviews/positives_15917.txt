Hazelnut is such a delicate, distinctive flavor, but it's captured perfectly here! Nutty, toasty, warming, comforting, and even a little buttery and smooth. It goes well with the matcha base, making this a light and elegant drink rather than the heavy texture you'd expect from a hazelnut drink. It's a nice, basic, everyday matcha, great on its own or for combining with other flavors.
