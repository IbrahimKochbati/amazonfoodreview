This coffee is a bit bitter, and the flavoring is sort of... muddled. "Vanilla Nut Pumpkin Pie" seems like an extravagant name for a sort of spicy flavor, even if it is a nice flavor. There's also a fair amount of fine dust, so if you don't have a very fine filter, you'll find it floating in your coffee. I enjoyed the coffee well enough, but would buy something else next time.
