My selection, which contained 12 cans each of Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken, arrived quickly, and I looked forward to seeing how my kitties would like it.          I liked the fact that:          (1) Petite Cuisine has NO Wheat Gluten,          and          (2) it's made from "Human Grade" ingredients    which means even I can eat it if I really wanted to    and truth be told    I DID sample a bit from each of those 2 selections    and both selections tasted better than anything I have tasted when I buy a Brand Name can of canned chicken for myself.....          But ok    this Petite Cuisine is for my kitties, so let's see what THEY think of it:          Well, I had no idea what to expect when I opened the first can     Chicken Pot Pie (and word of caution    open the "Chicken Pot Pie" can over the sink  there's alot of Broth inside and it sloshes out if you are not careful).          However, Big Bad Baby Twinkle was standing behind me watching my every move, and once the top came off the can, her Supreme Largeness, BBBT, surprised me with several OCTAVES worth of Mew sical praise for the tempting smell.          Yes   I know you are supposed to mix new cat food with their old food, but I had no desire to mix this pristine, tasty, fresh diced chicken and veggies entree with any of their stinky canned stuff   so Big Bad Baby Twinkle and Sweet Cee Cee feasted on 1 2 can of "Chicken Pot Pie" each, along with the liquid  oth. I waited for a reaction    nothing untoward happened. They licked their chops and came after me for more of the same.          Now, it has been noted that there is alot of "water" (Broth) in this can of Chicken pot Pie    I am familiar with "Spot's Stew" and that  and also has alot of liquid in its can. I have no problem with this Chicken Pot Pie  oth    if anything, it helps to hydrate my kitties (cats, being descended from desert animals    get most of their liquid from their food   and as long as the sodium content of this  oth is low, then they can slurp it to their hearts delight    and they certainly did, as the dishes were licked clean)          The Sesame Chicken, was less liquidy and looked very nice, shredded with its vegetables    it had special smell, which actually was just the smell of Sesame Oil. But my cats inhaled this as greedily as they did the Chicken pot Pie. I was impressed that Sesame oil would be used (along with Soy oil) as an ingredient. I'm looking forward to seeing what these oils will eventually do to nourish (former abandoned, street kitty, but thoroughly vetted) Cee Cee's somewhat dull coat. * * *          And to top off the Petite Cuisine experience, each box comes with a coupon worth $2    $1 off when you buy a four pack, or four cans of Petite Cuisine from the supermarket    and another $1 coupon will be sent to you if you fill out your name and address on the first coupon before you present it to  the check out clerk.          The only thing I take an issue with is the origin    Thailand    why not keep this "at home" and produce it in the USA?          * * *UPDATE    Dec 18 2008    Cee Cee's coat grew out a little more, is BEAUTIFUL and silky!! Since the only new thing in her life is this food, I can surmise that this diet of Petite Cuisine DID help flesh her out and beautify her fur (She is a former street kitty, and has always been a little wan (although she goes to the vet regularly) since she was rescued and I  ought her inside.)
