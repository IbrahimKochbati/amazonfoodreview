Just got a popper and bought some of this as well as some West Bend popcorn (which I tried with the Lou Ana popcorn oil bars). I very much prefer these. More of the kernels popped, they were far fluffier, and the popcorn simply tasted better (this is after salting the West Bend with Paragon Butter Flavored Seasoning Salt). The packs make it very simple. Cut the top, dump in the kettle, hit the heater, wait for the sound of the sizzle, and go! My only concern is that you have to take a bit of care not to drop oil all over the place. If you cut the top off, then carefully 'roll' the pack, it makes it much easier to drop it all in, then squeeze the oil out.
