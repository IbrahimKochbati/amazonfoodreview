I have to agree with several other reviews here that state the "The Switch Orange Tangerine" is too sweet on it's own. I ended up making a cool summer drink out of the can that I tried   served over ice & mixed with soda water. It was fantastic! The soda water ice mixture helps cut down on the sweetness and improves on the refreshment factor.          A little more about "The Switch"... The can claims that this product is 100% Carbonated Juice with "No Sugar Added" and "No Preservatives". One can is 8.3 fluid ounces and provides 140 Calories. Total Sugars per can are 34g; 36g of carbs. One can provides 100% of the daily recommended dose of Vitamin C.          That being said, I can't see myself drinking "The Switch" everyday. Even without preservatives and added sugars this drink still packs in a lot of sugar in every can. Though to be fair, I rarely drink soda or sweetened carbonated beverages. Still, for a nice alternative to the standard soda I recommend "The Swtich". The Tangerine flavor is reminiscent of Tang.
