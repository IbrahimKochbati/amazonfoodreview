This salt is seriously fantastic. Lots of folks say there isn't a difference in taste from salt to salt. IMO, not true. Natural salt has minerals going for it that may make it milder than old fashioned sodium chloride. I'm sure all this can be debated.          This Maldon (aka English Sea Salt) is super chunky and crunchy. It's milder than normal salt, IMO and tastes great on just about everything. Also, "milder" doesn't mean "add more salt". I like to use this as a finishing salt to add a flavorful crunch to pan fried asparagus with black pepper and garlic, or sprinkle lightly on meats just before serving. Also is perfect for a coarse, dry herb rub for chicken.
