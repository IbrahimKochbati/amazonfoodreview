Love my K Cups.  Thought this deal was too good to be true, so I snagged it.     I guess the only drawback was that the product had outlived it's shelf date.  I wouldn't mind it as much if I were totally aware of it when purchasing.  I still would have bought it, but I felt a little cheated when it arrived.  So far the product tastes the same, I am just glad I bought it for me personally instead of for work or friends.
