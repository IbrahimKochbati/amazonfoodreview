Initially I purchased this in good faith for  ewing it as iced tea as it is quite difficult to find loose tea leaves in stores. Here's my initial report and impressions:          The tea leaves came loose of course but the packaging is terrible. The bag is not sealed and the flap is just folded so tea leaves came out of the bag while in transport. So a lot of your tea leaves will be inside the box which is not good. I would hope that in the future Lipton chooses a better packaging alternative to seal the bag so you don't have tea leaves all over the place.          And as another reviewer mentioned, it is true that this particular  and has little bits and pieces of tea leaves and is not as good quality compared to other  ands. And as always, you pay for what you get. I didn't expect this to be better than my Jasmine tea in a tin can which costs about $45 and taste fantastic. My goal was to buy cheap black tea leaves which are loose to make lemon iced tea which I was able to do well with that.          Here is my lemon iced tea recipe after a lot of trial and error and taste testing:           1 Gallon of Lemon Iced Tea           1. 1 Gallon of water     2. 5 9 Tablespoons of Lipton Black Tea     3. Empty teabags     4. 1 cup of sugar     5. 1 2 cup of lemon juice          Lipton's direction call for 2 tablespoons of Lipton Black Tea to make 1 1 2 quarts of black tea to drink. We know that 4 quarts is equal to 1 gallon, if we used 4 tablespoons of black tea we would only end up with 3 quarts of tea which is short of one gallon. If 2 tablespoons makes 1 1 2 quarts then 1 tablespoon would make about .75 of a quart. So you would need at least a minimum of 5 tablespoons or even about 5 1 4 tablespoons of tea leaves to get your 4 gallons. I would not recommend using more than 9 tablespoons as it would make the tea too strong. Some people have said that the tea is too strong for the little amount that you use to  ew your tea but I would have to disagree with that. I thought the tea wasn't strong enough.          So go ahead and boil your water till you hit the boiling point. Use between 5 9 tablespoons depending on how strong you want your tea to be and fill up those empty teabags. The directions call for  ewing your tea for about 3 5 minutes. Being a tea drinker I knew that if I  ew it too long that tannins would be released and make the tea bitter (yes! tannins are what make your tea bitter). If your water is too hot or you  ew your tea too long the tannins will be released in the leaves making your tea bitter. Initially I only  ewed my tea for about 2 minutes because I was scared that the tea would be bitter if I  ewed it too long. But I found that 2 minutes time was not enough time and increased my time to about 3 1 2 to 4 minutes. That is enough time to  ew the tea without releasing the tannins so Lipton's  ewing time was about spot on. After you finish  ewing your tea add your 1 cup of sugar and then your lemon juice. I used cane sugar and Hy Top reconstituted lemon juice but you can use whatever  and you like or you can even use fresh squeezed lemon juice if you want. I did try Real Lemon Juice while at another supermarket but I didn't like it compared to my generic  and of lemon juice by Hy Top.          You probably wanted to know if I actually drank the tea without it being Lemon Iced Tea, and I did. I didn't like it nor would I recommend you drink this tea this way. I just did not feel that this tea was up to quality compared to many other  ands. Maybe I've just been spoiled by other  ands but I just feel that this tea wasn't up to par against other black teas nor do I recommend drinking it as just plain black tea. I particularly like the English Breakfast Black Tea by Stash better than this tea. I just felt that the quality difference was a lot but I didn't feel like buying every bag for $0.09 each every time I went to the supermarket just to  ew Lemon Iced Tea. If you want to make lemon iced tea with the Stash  and you need 9 English Breakfast Black Tea bags and the same amount of sugar, lemon juice, and water. Economical wise I would get more tea buying Lipton but if taste matters I would choose another tea  and to make Lemon Iced Tea.          I haven't tried making Raspberry Iced Tea with this yet but we'll save that for another adventure.
