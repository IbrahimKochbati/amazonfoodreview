My finicky cat LOVED these petite cuisines.  He would scarf them down.  The ingredients are wholesome, lots of juices and you could actually see the real tuna, mini shrimps and so forth.  The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because it is really expensive in the stores.  But if money is no object for your little 4 legged feline friends, then I highly recommend this cat food.
