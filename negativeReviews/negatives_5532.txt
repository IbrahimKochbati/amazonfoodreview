This was definitely easy (read recommended for bachelors, single dad's, or those otherwise cooking impaired) though because my chops were thick it took almost twice as long too cook. Also, I'm not sure if it was again the size of the chops or their proximity in the pan, but the end product looked more like a kind of mushy batter than the crisp looking,  ead like substance shown in the picture on the cover of the package.          It did taste good, but not so good that a little BBQ sauce wasn't needed to zing it up. But then again I'll use any excuse I can find to consume BBQ sauce.          Bottom line   the kids loved it, me and the gf liked it. So it falls somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.
