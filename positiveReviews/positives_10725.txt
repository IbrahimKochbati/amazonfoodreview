As our household attempts to eat better quality products, we've taken to trying to do the same for our favorite four legged friends...unfortunately, the dogs seem to prefer hot dogs over organic treats every time. We've tried local home made peanut butter ones that seemed to rank one wag and a yawn. We tried another major  and organic treats that resulted in a look like "are you kidding?". We even tried a different Newmand's that ended up getting tossed   the dogs literally wouldn't touch them and acted outright offended at the suggestion this was their "treat". On the other hand, these were a hit. Rather than acting offended, they actually seemed to enjoy these. Bottom line   pooch approved.
