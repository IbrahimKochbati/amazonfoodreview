I ordered 3 of the 12 packs.  Each came in its own box with a single air packet to keep the case of cans from sliding around.     There was no protection at all on the other 5 sides.     Of the 36 cans, 14 had moderate to severe dents.     That is over 1 3 ($32+) of the product damaged.     I took video of the opening of the cases just to prove they arrived that way.     I am trying to hunt down a way to get a free case or two   at the average rate of denting it will take that to get to even.          SEE COMMENT ON FOLLOW UP.
