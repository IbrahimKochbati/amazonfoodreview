Grove Square is the best k cup hot cocoa I've tried.  And I've tried a number of the other  ands.  This tastes like "real" cocoa used to taste. And if you add a little milk it's even better. It's so hot from the Keurig that the milk helps cool it down anyway. If your looking for a real chocolate ly flavor give this a try.
