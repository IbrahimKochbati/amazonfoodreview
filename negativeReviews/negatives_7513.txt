I had purchased this product previously and I was very pleased with the taste. I thought it wouldn't taste very good, but after a few days I found myself craving it during the day. I use it after my daily workout to replenish electrolytes and it seems to work great. However, I was very disappointed when I went to re order. It previously cost my $15 and now they want $25 for the same thing. I had to go to an external website to purchase it for $15. This is very disappointing to me, since I prefer to do my online shopping on Amazon. Also, they took away the Subscribe & Save feature on this. Not happy...
