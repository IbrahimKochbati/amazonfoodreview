Mostly bought this tea assortment for the Chocolate Mint flavor, which has been disappointing. Has a fake chocolate taste. The only other flavors I've tried are Coconut Mango and White Peach. The White Peach is very good, while Coconut Mango is okay. I hope the other 3 flavors are better, otherwise I would say this 6 pack is a waste, which is a shame because I normally enjoy Stash teas.
