I just got this toy for my 1.5 yo German Shepherd. He's a big chewer, and true to the  eed's intelligence, and I have been looking for something to keep him occupied when I have to leave the house. This is it, I put a hand full of training treats in it, and it keeps him occupied for over an hour. I am slightly worried about the durability, but so far it's stood up to full grown GSD which is the true test for any toy in my mind. Well worth the money for any smart curious dog.
