My son has eaten cereal since he was 3 months old. He ABSOLUTELY LOVES this cereal. Its consistency is grainy, not mushy like most cereals. When I've tried to give him other cereals he can TELL the difference. This also promotes a healthy GI tract, which is great for my son because he get constipated from time to time.
