This formula is a life saver!  Our 2 month old had a little viral bug, which made him spit up a lot and be very fussy.  With this formula, he barely spits up at all and has been so much happier!          Ask your doctor for a sample!  When we took our baby in for his tummy troubles, the doc gave us a full sized can of this formula to take home and try!  Considering it costs about $14 retail, this was great!          Pros:     Reduced spit up and gas     Reduced fussiness     Easy to mix up          Cons:     Baby can't go as long between feedings, probably because it's easier to digest          You can also get 2 free cans of Similac (one Advance and one Sensitive) by mail if you register at their website.  Great product and great customer service!
