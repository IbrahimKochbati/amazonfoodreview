The best way I can describe it is that it's like the popcorn you get at a fair (you know they kind that used to cost $1 and came in a tall paper bag). This is exactly what I was looking for. Yes, it's a little salty, but isn't that what you expect when you eat popcorn? This is the only kind that I don't have to add salt to.
