I use this coffee for  eakfast.  It goes great with a croissant.  I alternate this with a "Breakfast Blend" coffee for variety.  They have slightly different flavor but the same mildness.  If your the type that prefer a kick start in the morning, then I would suggest a "Dark Roast.  I am retired and the "House Blend" goes well with a leisurely  eakfast.
