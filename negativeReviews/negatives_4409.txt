I bought this tea with great anticipation....gunpowder tea and mint sounded wonderful.  WELL!!  Look at that photo carefully.  This tea is unsweetened.  Ugh!  No where is there a written description regarding this.  Also, the mint is peppermint.  I figured it was going to be spearmint.  Finally, i thought gunpowder tea was a black tea.  This product is made with a green tea....leaving it with very little tea flavor.  Very strong peppermint flavor instead.  Guess that was my error in assumption on many things.  To me, not worth the money.  Bottles are smaller than expected and not one of the better made Tao products.
