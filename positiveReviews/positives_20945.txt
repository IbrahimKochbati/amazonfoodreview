No other instant "bottle" drink can satisfy.  The price, although not the best I have found, beats the supermarket and the home delivery makes the price palatable.  Peach On the Go is the best tasting of all the Crystal Light products with the exception of the Raspberry Tea   which still isn't available in the "bottle" packets.
