Quick review:     Rinsed Bone or Boneless pork chops go into a plastic bag or bowl to be coated by the Shake N Bake mix.  Place them onto a baking sheet for the required cooking time and temperature.  When they come out of the oven, you will have some of the tastiest and juiciest pork chops that you have had in a long time.  If I did not have to share with other members of the household, I could easily eat the 5 or 6 pieces that were cooked.          I have tried  ead crumbs and other  ands of a similar nature, but neither of them seemed to have any flavor.  They only seem to provide your pork with a texture and leave out any seasoning.          If you are thinking about trying Shake N Bake, just pick up a box at the market for a couple of bucks and you will not be disappointed.          Easily 5 stars!
