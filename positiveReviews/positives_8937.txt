I am so glad i started using this butter to cook with, it just makes anything taste great. the flavor is really buttery. Baking is also fantastic i think it adds moisture and a wonderful texture to foods. A must have in any pantry and it doesn't need refrigeration, so it always ready to use and easy to spread.
