The order arrived after 10 days with syrup leaking through the bubblewrap.  It is packaged in very thin, flimsy box, wrapped in bubblewrap but the syrup is running out of the bubble wrap so it cannot be mailed.  I see that this "is not eligible for returns".  Thanks Amazon.  This is the second time I have ordered syrup that has been either leaking or the top is  oken and cannot be closed.  The top on the first bottle I received fell apart when I opened it.          Went to Whole Foods and purchased delicious Grade B 32 oz. for $19.89.  Of course they had Grade A Dark Amber and many other grades and  ands, but we decided to try the Grade B and are are delighted.  Delicious on waffles.
