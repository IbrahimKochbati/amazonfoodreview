I really need to cut down on my sodium intake because I have very high blood pressure   I've been a salt fanatic for MANY years (I put salt on almost everything), so I'm a very harsh critic when it comes to salt substitutes. I recently ordered and received a similar no salt substitute "blend" from another website, and it has absolutely *NO* salt taste. I've tried a few others as well that also tasted nothing like salt...so I really didn't have high hopes for table tasty.  I figured I'd order it anyway based on the positive reviews (and it was shipped very fast).          I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted this product.  I thought for sure it would only taste like a sodium free spice blend like all the rest, but it actually has a salty taste when you try it right out of the bottle.  The taste and smell actually reminds me a lot of those flavor packets that come with Ramen noodles, or the "Cup a soup" packets in a box, which are both LOADED with sodium!          It's hard to believe   I have no idea how they've achieved this since there's NO sodium at all in the product.  All I know is I will now be ordering a large bag!
