I got a box of these little morsels from a girl scout back in May and was craving them so hard I caved and bought this box from Amazon. The box got rather banged up in shipping but the cookies were unharmed and positively amazing. Not stale or moisture damaged at all.          The whole box lasted about 15 minutes.
