My twin 10 month old babies treat this one as dessert.  Their first Earth's Best jar they loved was straight sweet potatoes.  After water, sweet potatoes are the first ingredient in this one, followed by apricot puree.  That's dessert for them right there.  After that comes the chicken and then  own rice flour (not as good as  own rice though).          This is a meal that babies around the age of mine are probably almost all going to love instantly.  Almost all babies love sweet potatoes for starters.  Add apricot puree and there's really not much one could do to discourage babies after that.  I recommend this flavor  and.          Ingredients per label: Water, organic sweet potatoes, organic apricot puree, mechanically separated organic chicken, organic  own rice flour.          The rice flour absorbed the water and gave it a real nice consistency, and the sweet potatoes gave it a nice color.          Nutrition per label: 80 calories, 15% protein, 90% vitamin A, 2% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 6% iron.          This one had the most vitamin A of all Earth's Best jars I've tried.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.
