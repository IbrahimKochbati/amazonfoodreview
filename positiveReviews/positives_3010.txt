I was nervous after reading some of the reviews about the taste of this and or quality, but after having been consuming this for a couple days, I really do enjoy it!  Initially I thought it would be gross, but it really wasn't!  It is nice with the fruit in it, and has a kind of "nutty" taste. Great shipping, great quality, amazing nprice, and I def. rec!
