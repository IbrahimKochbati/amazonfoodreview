OK I know cute tittle! Let me first say I received this product free as part of amazon.com's VINE Program to generate reviews. I have has heartburn acid reflux since I was a teenager (yes nervous kid) and I am always looking for low acid products. This Puroast Low Acid coffee taste great, you cannot tell, the difference between this and any fine french roast and you won't get heartburn. So I can give this a high recommendation.
