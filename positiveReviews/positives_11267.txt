I switched to this food to try and eliminate food allergies.  After spending hundreds of dollars at the vet for my dog who wouldn't stop licking his paws raw.  Within 3 weeks he stopped licking and his hair stopped falling out.  I also mixed this dry food with EVO 95% venison in a can. I took about a week to slowly switch over to the new food. So now his only protein was venison and all grain free. The food is expenspensive but cheaper than weekly vet visits and giving him steroids sprays baths.  Make sure you don't give your dog anything else like rawhides, treats or table food.
