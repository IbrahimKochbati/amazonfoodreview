What I like about them:     1) Very thick chips.     2) No trans fat and all natural, according to the info on the bag.     3) Flavor, but that's a subjective thing.     4) 2oz bags, which keep you from eating too much at one time. Just set a limit of 1 bag.          Cons:     As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil.
