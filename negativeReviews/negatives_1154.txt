The cookies came sealed and seem to be high quality in there ingredients.  The only thing is they just don't taste that good. My girlfriend and I thought these might be a good dessert like option while doing the Paleo diet, but after trying one of each kind over a couple days we just don't find ourselves going back for more.  I would much rather not have a dessert and really check that box on a cheat day than being left wanting more after eating these.  If you have a true gluten allergy, maybe this is a good option for you but I'm not a believer.
