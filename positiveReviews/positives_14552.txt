When I write a review on teas I am always hesitant to either fully recommend any given tea, or conversely, to recommend that it not be touched with a ten foot pole and that it is not fit for human consumption.  The reason for this is taste.  We are all different in this area and what may be an absolute delight for me, may quite well be another's gastronomical bane. Finding the "just right tea;" the tea that is the beginning and the end for the lover of tea is an adventure and in my opinion, an adventure that should last a life time.  I started drinking tea (we are talking hot tea here) as a small child, as did my wife, and we have been together on our search for well over 50 years now.  I have to tell you that the trip has been wonderful!          Now a person can sink a lot of money into their tea habit and hobby over the years.  Nothing is worse (well, I suppose many things are indeed worse...I just use this as an expression) than to spend a King's Ransom on a large amount of new tea(s) that you want to try and find that you find you cannot stand the stuff!  We have found in recent years a bit of a solution to this problem in these "variety packs" offered by many companies   Twinings being the leader in this marketing method.  We get to sample different varieties and blends, in this case four separate blends, without having to sell our first born into bondage to be able to afford it.  The other upside to this variety pack, as with many like packs, is that you get several tea bags of the same blend so that you have plenty to make your mind up with.  We never try just one cup or one  ew as taste can change from day to day as well as moods; and trust me, when it comes to tea drinking, moods and attitude do count!          With this variety pack you get a nice sampling of English  eakfast, Earl Grey, Lady Grey and Irish  eakfast teas to sample.  All of these teas are of the black variety; all are different and all have a nice full bodied presents which is ideal if dark full bodied teas are "your thing."          Even this pack though will show the difference in taste.  I am fond of the English  eakfast tea (My favorite if this selection), where as my wife favors the Lady Grey.          This is a good selection to simply get to know four nice blends.  If you  ew it correctly, use good quality water and let yourself relax and be as objective as possible, I should think you will be pretty happy with it...or maybe not.  I personally liked it.          Don Blankenship     The Ozarks
