Very good hot chocolate.  Nice rich flavor.  We used the smallest setting on our Keurig, and made sure to shake it to make sure the powder was loose in the K cup. The K cup was completely empty after  ewing. There is sucralose in it, but I could not detect the aftertaste of it.  I'm pretty sensitive to that aftertaste. I will buy this product again.
