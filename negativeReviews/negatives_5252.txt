I have no idea if this tastes like the real thing (I'm going to guess no), but it is very tasty.  It's easy to make and is filling.  Most instant noodles are either too bland or too spicey for me, but this has a perfectly seasoned  oth.  The noodles are firm without being too tough like some of the Annie Chun soup bowls.  I really liked the huge pieces of green onion in it as well.  Good product and my new favorite flavor.          Huge downside?  1940mg of sodium per bowl, which is more sodium then you need in day never mind one meal.  Ouch.  The bowl has 2 servings and rounds out at 440 calories.  Not something you want to eat very often.  I really want to buy them again until I read the label.  It's too bad, but it's not something I'll eat again.
