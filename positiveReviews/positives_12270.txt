I first ran across this wonderful stuff several years ago while visiting friends in California.  It was instant love!  I have of course not been able to purchase this product here on the E. Coast but friends living in California, traveling through that area, and indeed..every time I make a visit, bottles of this stuff wind up on my shelf.          I use this tasty sauce on just about any appropriate food item.  It is a condiment I keep on the table during every meal.  Now don't think you are just getting a hot sauce here...no, no, no!  The flavor is what makes this the best.  The only sauce I have ever tasted that came near it was from two bottles of liquid heaven I purchased in Jamaica which is made and bottled by a single family their and is almost impossible to get.  This product though is almost its equal.          The sauce is smooth with a garlic taste most certainly, but not overwhelming.  No edgy jalapeno after taste is present (Jalapeno are not my favorite, that's for sure). This product, as one reviewer her put it, does not focus simply on the burn as most of these concoctions do.  I am not sure what all goes in the stuff, but what ever it is, it works.          This is the primary ingredient for a BBQ sauce I make (sorry, old family secret) and of course it works right out of the bottle on almost all meat, fish and many, many vegetables.  I personally do not like any sort of sauce on my eggs but I have many good friends that do and they rave about this stuff every time they stay over and I fix  eakfast for them.          If this stuff is ever offered nationally, I hope they do not fool around with the process too much.  I would rather it remain a bit hard to get than risk loosing this unique flavor.          Trust me and give this stuff a try...I promise you will not be sorry.
