My life could be a coffee commercial.  I have to be at work by 5AM every day.  I can't say this Melitta Classic coffee makes me want to get out of bed per usual, but it has definitely been a perk over the last couple of days.  I drink a lot of coffee every day  usually a black classic roast of some sort.  And I have no shame in admitting that when I  ew at home it is usually a mid priced coffee purchased at the Supermarket.  Its only when I am out that I get to partake in a more premium  and.          I was delighted to find that Melitta's Classique is a medium  ew ground super fine producing a rich and savory cup of coffee.  The balance of flavor is delicious and lends well to creamers. The only disappointment I encountered was the packaging.  I was very careful and still managed to end up with a floor full of grounds while initially opening the package. It arrived fresh, and I will definitely be making a purchase again.
