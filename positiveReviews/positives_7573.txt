I just found about chia seeds and I actually bought this bag so I could plant them. The seeds are growing like weeds and I've discovered that they are great in my foods also! My husband put them in a tomato sauce to thicken it, I add a teaspoonful to my cereal, and a tablespoon to my lemonade. They're fun to eat and take on the flavor of what ever I'm making!
