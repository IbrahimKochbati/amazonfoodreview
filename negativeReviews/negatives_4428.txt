I've been buying these mints since August 2010.  They were a subscribe and save item that we got twice a month. The mint taste was not always consistent, with some boxes very strong tasting and some with a mild mint taste, but we accepted that.          However, the last box we got in July 2012 ended our two year relationship with Newman's Own Cinnamon mints. Here's the story: I opened the box, took a roll and handed a roll to my husband.  We each popped a mint in our mouths.  I few seconds later we looked at each other and both said "They taste like soap!" I don't know what happened in the manufacturing process, but that ended it for us.  Amazon was good enough to refund our money when I contacted them.  I cancelled our subscription and we're afraid to order any more.          I'm rating this product 3 stars instead of one because we got a lot of boxes that were great. We just can't get past that last box.
