My whole family have been eating this popcorn for years, popping it in "Tommy's" 8 oz popper while watching movies in our outdoors movie theater. It's so good, on the rare occasion we do go to the "Indoor Movie Theater", my kids don't want "Movie Theater Popcorn" because what we make at home is better. With Tommy's, we can experiment with different salts and additives (cheddar, butter buds, etc), and it pops wonderfully. It's almost all we eat. You won't be disappointed!!
