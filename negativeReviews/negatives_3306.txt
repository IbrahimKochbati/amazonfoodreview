I am a fan of Silver Palate cookbooks and was delighted to see this sauce on the grocery shelf. After getting it home and warming it in a saucepan, I gave it a taste. It was so salty, it was inedible. (And I am not reluctant to use salt.) 660 mg of sodium per 1 2 cup? Are they serious? The salt overpowers any subtle flavors in the sauce. With hypertension representing a major health problem, this is irresponsible. It leaves a bad taste in more ways than one.
