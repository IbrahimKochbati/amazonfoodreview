We often pick up boneless pork when it's on sale because it's versatile.     Having this coating on hand allows me to toss together a quick dinner that we always enjoy.          I often add a little ground sage and black pepper to the coating.  Sometimes a little parmesan cheese.     If you're only preparing a small amount and have plenty of leftover coating for another small meal, a trick my  other shared with me is to use a good sized ziplock bag for the coating.  The leftover coating can be labeled "Pork" and dated and tossed into the freezer instead of throwing it out.  Same with chicken coating.  I often mix up my own coating and have plenty leftover for another meal.
