This is absolutely based on personal preference, but I feel a little disappointed with this tea. Raised on a strong pallet of black teas, I don't really have an appreciation for lighter teas, and barley bases are almost tasteless to me. So while this stuff smells exactly like a sugar cookie, its less than 'tasty'.          I have however taken to putting a bag or two in with my coffee grinds to give my coffee a nice cookie flavor. The longer steep time and the bitterness of coffee really makes the flavor stand out more. Throw in a spoonful of hot chocolate and  own sugar and you have a Chocolate Chip Cookie Latte that could rival anything a commercial cafe could come up with.
