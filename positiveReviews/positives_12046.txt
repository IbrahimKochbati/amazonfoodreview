Oh man, did Baumer Foods ever blast this one out of the park!          This stuff is so good I even wrote their president a letter to let him know     just how happy he's made me. LOL          I have been addicted to Crystal Hot Sauce for 20 years, and this new addition     is a welcome compliment to their regular sauce, that IMO is much more flavorful,     and less vinegary, than all the other Louisiana style sauces. This new Extra Hot     Sauce builds on that flavor, but with 5 times the heat. Its not an in your face     kind of heat either, but a good long slow burn that any chilihead will appreciate.          Maybe the best thing about the Baumer Crystal product line is that its available     just about everywhere... and its cheap. 5 Scovies          Postscript: In the mail today I got a personal letter back from the CEO of Baumer     Foods thanking me for my business, and the envelope included coupons for 2 free     bottles of Crystal Hot Sauce...any size! I love these guys, and you will too.
