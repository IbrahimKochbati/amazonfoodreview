My ex girlfriend is a lovely woman in many ways, but her cat...well pretty much everybody and everything is beneath him. He is picky about being petted, how he is being petted, how long he is being petted, and by whom (I think the phase of the moon figures into this somehow too, but I digress). This persnickety nature also applies  in spades  to his food. When I gave Zede (the cat, not the ex gf) some of this food, he actually ate it without giving me his "How dare you put this slop in front of me, knave?" look. I got reports later that he became even more enamored with the stuff as time went on. So there you have it: an endorsement from Zede the finicky feline. Well, how else do you rate cat food? I'm not going to try it myself...and besides, I'm a vegetarian!
