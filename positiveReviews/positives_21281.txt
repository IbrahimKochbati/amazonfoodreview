If you like milk chocolate, you have to try these truffles. They are delicious! Both the outer chocolate coating and the center are creamy and smooth. They are addictive and you'll want to eat more than one! Lindt's truffles come in a variety of flavors. Milk chocolate is one of my favorites, but I would suggest checking out some of their other flavors as well.
