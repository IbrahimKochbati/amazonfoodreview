I use these to keep my finicky toddler's protein levels up. What's great, is that they're delicious just about any way you can imagine cooking a sausage!          A favorite Recipe: Sautee one large onion, about a tablespoon each dried basil and oregano, and some salt and pepper in about 2T of butter. Add sausage, that's been cut into coins, and russet potatoes cut into 1 4" thick rounds. Cover all with chicken stock and simmer until potatoes are soft but not dissolved. Throw in a few handfuls of pre washed baby spinach (I usually use about a half a pound, and frozen would work fine, just put it in a minute earlier). Stir until the spinach is cooked, and then serve! Enjoy!
