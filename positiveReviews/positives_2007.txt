The negative reviews of Mrs Mays products just because it is made in China are not really valid, cannot base on other companies' poor quality control and apply to every company in the country!  There are many bad quality foods that are made in the USA that's bad for your health, so just because it's labeled made in USA doesn't mean it is good quality.  As long as a company takes pride in their quality control and not greed for profit only deserves good ratings and fair sales.
