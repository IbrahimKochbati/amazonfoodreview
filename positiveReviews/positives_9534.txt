My little dog has allergies; but I recently read, where sweet potato products     are digested easily and rarely cause problems to such an animal. So, I decided     to try these.  Honestly, if I offer him two or more different treats at once;     he chooses this one FIRST EVERY TIME !!  And NO stomach or bowel problems.     I'll be buying these again & AGAIN !!
