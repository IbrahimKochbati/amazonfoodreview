I've been consuming this every morning for over a year now.Wonderful with some fresh fruit or dried fruit. The smaller single serving packs are perfect for work or travel. Those of you Bariatric pts should really try this. Start your day with high protien ( add skim milk) without the bloat and sickening sweet shakes.Those shakes make you want sweets carbs, as do all sweet tasting foods.I stay clear of them.
