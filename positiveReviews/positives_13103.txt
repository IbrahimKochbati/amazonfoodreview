When I ordered this product, I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  I kind of had in mind a "curry ketchup" (literally just ketchup with a curry aftertaste), but the description made me think that wasn't quite on the mark.  But since I've been happy with Maya Kaimal's other products, and as a lover of both Indian food and ketchup, I had to give it a try.          My suspicion that this wouldn't just be "ketchup plus some curry flavor" was borne out.  Honestly, it's a little difficult to describe.  It's as though someone scrapped the idea of ketchup and decided to start over and build a new ketchup out of some new ingredients and some old ones.  That's a weird description, I know, so I'll go into a little more detail.  It's just that nearly every ketchup you buy is basically slight variations on a theme.  This is different, but still identifiably ketchup.          The spicy ketchup isn't smooth like most ketchups; it has a definite texture to it.  It's very slightly thicker than most ketchups, but not so much that you use it any differently.  It's not as tart as ketchup tends to be, nor as sweet as some (particularly ones that use sugar instead of HFCS).  It has a pleasant tomato flavor with a hint of smokiness and a definite Indian flair.  But all of the flavors are very, very integrated.  Like I said before, this isn't "ketchup plus."  It has a very unified, if complex, flavor.  And for those who are worried about the "spicy" part of the name, this ketchup has a little bit of bite to it, about as much heat as a one star curry.          I've tried it on a variety of different foods that I normally eat with ketchup and I admit my success has been mixed.  I tried it first with some fast food french fries, which was decidedly underwhelming.  It wasn't bad; it's just that it was more novel than good.  I tried it later with tater tots, which was much better.  I've had it on an ordinary cheeseburger, which was good but it didn't wow me like it wowed one of my friends.  But the two biggest successes I've had with it have been the most surprising.          One, this ketchup is excellent on a hot dog.  Yes, I know you aren't "supposed" to put ketchup on hot dogs, but I don't like mustard or relish and I don't always want a chili dog.  And for what it's worth, I think the spicy Indian ketchup actually "goes with" hot dogs better than ordinary ketchup (which isn't to say I like it more, per se, just that the flavors seem more complementary).          And two, I just tried this ketchup tonight on some black pepper and bleu cheese hamburgers I picked up at the store.  Again, I didn't expect much but tried it on a whim.  Amazing.  The black pepper really  ought out the spiciness of the ketchup.  And the pockets of bleu cheese in the burgers... I really did not expect bleu cheese to go well with Indian themed ketchup, but the combination was just incredible.  A stronger bleu cheese might not work as well, but this was fairly mild.          I've tried a few different variant ketchups in the past (did I mention I really like ketchup?), but I rarely find anything that's worth getting again.  Not only am I glad I bought this bottle of spicy Indian ketchup, but when it's gone I plan on buying another.  I still use my Heinz, mind you.  The two ketchups are not interchangeable.  But they do seem to be good on largely the same things, and the spicy Indian ketchup is great for adding just a bit of flair to your food.  Highly recommend.
