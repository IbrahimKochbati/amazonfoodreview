For me, I'm a mint lover, I pop these like candy, and I don't think I'm the only one ;).          These are really minty, but not as minty as the peppermint one, which I find too strong, to the point that it creates discomfort. So I love these, because its pretty powerful stuff, but not overwhelming. One thing I love about Altoids mints, is that when you first put one in your mouth, you get this pleasant sweet taste, and it slowly moves on to being minty, all without a sugar crust.          The mints themselves are mainly shaped very nicely, but every now and then their deformed a little or cracked. (Which somehow adds to the traditional ness.)          The tin was great, kept the mints in there securely. I've never gotten a bad tin and there would be no reason to.          I suggest these to anyone who likes mints, or has bad  eath of any sort. These are just great.
