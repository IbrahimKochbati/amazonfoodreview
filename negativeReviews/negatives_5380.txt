The manufacturer of this Dark French Roast Coffee advertises that it is gourmet coffee with less than half of the acid found in regular coffee. This minimizes, they say, heartburn, acid reflux, and mild stomach irritation. They add that their coffee lacks "the bitterness" found in regular coffee. My wife and I tried the coffee and found no difference in taste between it and the regular store  and coffees.
