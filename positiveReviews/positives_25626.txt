I must say that I nearly passed on this tea because of some of the reviews. In the end, I decided to give it a try, because it is more affordable than some of the others. I can honestly say that I have no idea why anyone would complain about this product. These are not ground up pieces of junk that you get in tea bags, but rather, they are large pieces of flower petals. It is so pretty, that I put it in a clear glass apothecary jar, right out on my kitchen counter! I was also pleased that the bag seems larger than it looks in the picture. I purchased this to see if it will help lower my husband's blood pressure. That remains to be seen, but so far, we both are enjoying this delicious beverage. We used to drink gallons of regular sun tea year round. We have replaced that with this hibiscus tea. Oh, and I forgot to mention that the  ewed tea is pretty too. It has the salmon pink color of a blush wine   you almost want to serve it in wine glasses!
