We had been looking for a healthy waffle mix that tasted good, along with being made with natural ingredients. Most of the mixes I would find, either did not taste good, or full of ingredients I prefer to avoid. This has been the perfect mix, along with the Proctor Silex waffle maker we also purchased from Amazon.          We have found that 1 2 cup of mix and about 1 2 cup of water is the exact mixture for this waffle iron and six minutes is the idea cook time. Now that we have figured that out, we just mix, pour, and time the cooking process. We have started adding a few things like fresh blueberries, Watkins flavorings and other fruit to give them some variety without adding a lot of calories. Keeping the calories in check was a goal we had too when deciding on this mix.          If you like waffles and looking for a good alternative to the normal mixes, this is it. Also a big plus is all you need is water and no other ingredients. If you are a backpacker or camper, this can be an advantage too.
