I have been using this product since fall 2008. I use it as a morning oatmeal mix in and have been very pleased. It adds a vaguely sweet nutty, chocolate taste (though not EXACTLY like "cocoa," which might irk some people with the wrong expectations) and a good amount of protein and fiber to boot. I also like to use it in baking that could use a chocolate y hint (and discreet nutritional benefits) without adding too much bulk. Natural ingredients, fair trade certified, low calorie, lots of protein and fiber, tastes good    what more could you want? (Warning, though: do not, "for the heck of it," try to eat a spoon of this stuff out of the canister! Ha! A friend of mine made that mistake and remarked its texture dryness (not flavor) as similar to eating straight baby powder. Does not dissolve easily on tongue.)
