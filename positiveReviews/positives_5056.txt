I purchased a Keurig so my husband could make just one cup of coffee for  eakfast instead of making a French press full and pitching half of it.  I use it to make unsweetened iced tea.  With the plethora of sweetened iced tea k cups, it's great to have one with the good, clean and fresh taste of unsweetened tea.  I use the largest setting and then add about 1 2 cup of cold water to the Pyrex liquid measuring pitcher.  With the addition of water, it cuts the strength to the proper consistency.  I don't bother with all the glasses with ice and then  ewing over ice.  I just make the tea and pour it from the pitcher.  Good stuff.
