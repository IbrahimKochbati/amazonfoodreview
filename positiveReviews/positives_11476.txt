I've been using the product in dishes that call for white rice or a rice mix.  My daughter liked both of them really well. In the second receipe I didn't have the seasoning quite like it should have been but both recipes I tried were good.  I will work on the seasoning.  I liked the idea of having something that cooked so quickly, was whole wheat, organic, etc.
