OK, so I went ahead and bought a 24 pack even though it had an aweful review.  "How Bad could it be?"  Well not so bad that I'm going to waste it but I doubt that I'll be re ordering.          **** UPDATE: I've finished most of it and it does grow on you.  GET OVER THAT IT REALLY DOESN"T TASTE LIKE ROOT BEER and it's OK.  Probably still won't re order but will try their Cream Soda.
