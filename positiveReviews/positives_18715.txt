I bake cakes and this is the ONLY filling I do not attempt to make myself because it is so delicious and so easy to use that there is no point in trying to duplicate it!  The case price is great, much more of a deal than buying individual cans at the grocery store.  I will continue to buy this product for years to come.  Most importantly, my cake customers love it too.
