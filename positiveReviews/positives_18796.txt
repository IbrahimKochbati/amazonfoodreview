My dog had food allergies until I found Castor & Pollux Ultramix and ALeergy Free Dog Treats.  Castor and Pollux is a great  and and one that my dog loves.  This is a great price for the 1 pound treats.  I was paying more at PETCO than what these cost on Amazon.  You should try these.  I am sure your dog will love them.
