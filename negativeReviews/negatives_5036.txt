Even though I used small puppy kibble, my puppy could not get the kibble out of the bottle. For the treats to come out, the dog needs to pull on the rope and whip the bottle around. Because of the shape of the bottle, the kibble will not spill out on its own while lying on its side. I would think that holding onto the rope and whipping it around would be quite dangerous for the dog as well as anyone standing nearby   the bottle is made from hard plastic and would definitely hurt if it hit you.          I decided to remove the rope completely and tried putting in a little ball to slow down the flow of the kibble. That didn't work either   the ball completely blocked the opening (maybe I'll try again with a smaller ball). In the end, I just ended up putting a larger treat (a small milkbone biscuit) in with the kibble and that seemed to work a little better. My puppy is able to get the treats to spill out by tipping the bottle upright. I think I need to experiment more with different sized balls or milkbone biscuits so the kibble spills out easily, but not too easily.          On the plus side, the large opening on the bottom of the bottle is great. It makes it very easy to fill the bottle with kibble or treats.          I gave this product a 3 because it does what I wanted   it slows down my puppy's eating and keeps him busy for a little while, but for us, it didn't work the way it was intended to work and has the possibility of injuring the dog.
