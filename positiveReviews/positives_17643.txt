Puroast has a great thing going for people who need reduced acid foods. I've been ordering directly from Puroast for about a year, but I'm really glad to see their product is catching on and their distribution is getting more aggressive. I was even able to find it in my local supermarket a couple weeks ago when I suddenly ran out of my Puroast mocha java.          My wife stopped drinking coffee a couple of years ago because the acid helped contribute to discomfort she had due to IC (interstitial cystitis). She began drinking only peppermint tea as a hot drink, and that, along with some other dietary changes, helped her a lot. I also had some problems with urinary tract discomfort as well as stomach acid discomfort, but I couldn't stop drinking hot coffee cold turkey (LOL) and read about Puroast. I tried it and it has become a staple in my daily diet: one large cup a day. Recently, my wife decided to try a cup every now and then, and so far she hasn't had any problems at all due to acid.          The coffee tastes full bodied even though Puroast does something proprietary to reduce the acid in the coffee. The French Roast has plenty of rich coffee taste. I happen to prefer more of a medium roast, but that's just me. All the Puroast coffee varieties that I've tried are plenty good enough for me  with the distinct benefit of low acid. You can get beans or two different grinds, and they sell the coffee in small packets as well as 1 lb, 2 lb and even up to 5 lb bags. They also have flavored coffees, like the mocha java I mentioned above.          All in all, this is a great find and a great addition to Amazon's product lines for people who would like to enjoy the foods and drinks they like but need a reduced acid alternative. Highly recommended!
