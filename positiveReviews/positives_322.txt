This is a wonderful warm flavored tea, especially now in colder weather.     This tea has a sweet,soothing chamomile fragrance. It is subtle and sweet.It's one of the better chamomile teas.     If you find it hard to sleep at times, a cup of this sweet chamomile tea may help.     If you really like sweet taste try Bigelow Chamomile Mango Herbal Tea.     I highly recommend both.
