I was hoping that we would like this product more, however we just can't get over the texture. We found that it was easy to mix and made somewhat flat pancakes (we really like fluffy) Overall   I'd suggest buying one pack at your local store before springing for a pack of 4. On the other hand, the birds seem to LOVE this mix so I've been delighted to see them outside my window :)
