Wow, this is soooo good and has easily become my favorite dressing! I typically make my own dressings, however I do use this one as a treat!          It was given to me as a gift and I absolutely love it! It's a perfect balance of sweet and oily and bitter. Granted, it needs a good shaking since it's oil based! I absolutely love this and am sad I am running out! If you eat salads like me every day, then you will want this dressing! It's unique and I NEVER had somebody over who didn't love it! :)
