We have been using 17 Day Diet guided by Low Glycemic eating for about 6 7 months, with fair success. This amber agave nectar has become our primary sweetener because of the low glycemic effect on blood sugar. The taste is mellow,and the sweetening power is higher than sugar [so you use less], but without the "twang" of honey. the one thing I have not tried it on (still using sugar) is making kombucha   I still use sugar, as I'm not sure it would be a good idea to introduce a raw element into kombucha. But actually, that may just be my own over caution and nothing related to actual chemistry or circumstance.          Our primary uses are sweetening yogurt, using it in the little baking I do, and use in salad dressings, fruit desserts, etc. Because we are limiting our sweets consumption,we don't use a lot of this, but it's nice to have when we need it. I plan to try using it in some homemade jams later this season. I buy it on subscription, and the cost is about 33% less than the local WalMart and more than 50% less than the health food store on this same  and. "Best by" date on the bottles I received in May is 2015.
