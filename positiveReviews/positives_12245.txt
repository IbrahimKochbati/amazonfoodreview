I love Diamond  and foods, and was reccomended to use them by my vet when my dog developed allergies to preservatives food colors.  I thought the Biscuits would follow the same standards.  I was disappointed to open them and find a rainbow of colored biscuits.  I try to give the  ight red ones to the dog that is not allergic.  The dogs like them well enough.  They were a good deal, and if you buy colored treats, you'd probably give them 5 stars.
