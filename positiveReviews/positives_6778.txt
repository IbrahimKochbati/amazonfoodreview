I thought I didn't care for decaf espresso since it always had a bitter flavor that ranged from a moderate undertone to an overwhelming bite. I enjoy strong flavored coffee, but bitter coffee is another story.          Well, it turns out that I was just drinking the wrong stuff. Lavazza decaf is absolutely delightful. Strong, full bodied, but no bitterness. Nice crema, smooth and rich. Really hits the spot!          It does, however, have a bit more caffeine than other decafs. Not much, but I can feel it a bit (I'm very sensitive to caffeine   if you're not, you probably won't notice it). Not enough that it causes a problem. But even if it did, I'd probably still drink this   it's that good!          Highly recommend.
