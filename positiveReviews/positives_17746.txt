I enjoy whole roasted coffee beans. Once you grind your own coffee you just can never go back to coffee in a can, or certainly not instant coffee. Well, whole bean coffees are expensive in a grocery store or supermarket. I've discovered a lower cost alternative. I pick up two or three pound containers at Trader Joe's or Costco. The Costco source is particularly interesting in that they always seem to have two or three different kinds, but the kinds seem to change on every other visit. Over the years, I've had coffees from all over the world. This latest time there was a pallet of Kirkland Signature Dark Roast Espresso Blend (with a little tag that said roasted by Starbucks Coffee Co.) The aroma around the display was excellent and I couldn't resist.          When I opened the bag, the rich aroma was almost overwhelming. My wife even loved it and she isn't a coffee drinker. The coffee itself isn't all that impressive. It has a good light tasty flavor that seems mild and slightly sweet and goes down quite easily. I'd have to guess that the caffeine content was not up to the level I was used to in other whole bean coffees and it doesn't provide that good morning jolt. I was expecting something richer and more robust, more like a dark roast. Well, this is a nice coffee, but if you're looking for something that will grow hair on your chest, this is not the one. It has a good flavor, but it's weak. I'll have no trouble finishing the bag, but I'm disappointed. The aroma was so promising and the coffee just wasn't up to it.          Gary Peterson
