i have enjoyed this product for quite some time.  however, i am disgusted by the fact that the price keeps increasing!  at $35 per case, customers are paying more than $4 per box for 5 small cookie bars   ridiculous!  i will find a healthier, more reasonably priced snack to munch on. shame on nana and amazon. . .
