This product is billed as an all natural anti oxident and electrolyte replacing beverage.  Sort of like all natural Gatorade with anti oxidents.          Like a sports beverage, it too is also kinda bland.  I love some of the Gatorade flavors, some not so much.  This drink falls into the not so much category for me.          It is sorta sweet, sorta pineapple y, and also sorta bland.  My wife commented that it has a slippery feel in her mouth, like the glass had soap in it still.  I didn't think it was that bad but the drink really didn't appeal to me.          In the end, yes, this drink is probably much better for you than a glass of apple juice and definitely better than some sugar infused punch.  But as a sports drink, I think I'll stick with plain old gatorade; it's cheaper and contains fewer calories per serving.          If going the all natural route with your juices drinks is of the utmost importance this may be something to consider and bump this review to 3 stars.
