I love this stuff, and make great, small, homemade pizzas or crusty  eads with this paste as part of the topping.          First, in my cast iron skillet*, I grill each side of thick slices of Italian  or French    ead or small rounds of store bought pizza dough.          Then I rub each side of each slice with peeled garlic clove.          After that, I squirt extra virgin olive oil on each side of the  ead or pizza round.          When the olive oil has had a chance to sink into the slices, I squeeze** a two  or three inch ribbon of pesto paste on the top of each slice.          Then, I top the slices with shredded cheese(s), a dash of smoked paprika and whatever else takes my fancy.          Finally, I place the  eads onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet which then goes into a preheated 375 degree oven for five to seven minutes, or until the cheese has melted.          *Tip: I scrub my cast iron grills and skillets with course salt to get them clean.          **Tip: I don't squeeze the paste out from the top of the tube. Instead, I use my kitchen shears and cut the bottom open, and then I squeeze a two or three inch long ribbon atop the pizza or  ead.          BE CAREFUL NOT TO CUT YOURSELF ON THE CUT EDGES OF THE METAL TUBE OF PASTE.  ENJOY!
