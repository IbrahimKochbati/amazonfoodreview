The "reviewer from Florida" was being extremely kind in their review.     This gruel is not even fit for farm animals.  I've lived in Hawaii most     of my life and have shopped mostly in the local health food stores so i have had     many many different batches of Basmati rice.  What Amazon has sent me is NOT     edible in my opinion.  It is not long grained as Basmati should be and does not     cook as it should   it fully cooks too soon and does not need the full amount of     water that Basmati usually does.     I am tempted to contact the FDA to see what it really is!          My apologies to the "reviewer from Florida"   i should have listened to you and     passed on all this frustration   Amazon does not allow returns on groceries.     Needless to say   i am now stuck with several pounds of inedible rice.
