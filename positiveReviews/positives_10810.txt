When I first opened the package, I wasn't sure how much a dog would like these treats.  They look like dense  icks and smell like tea leaves.  I gave one to my friends' border collie and she was a little wary of this new treat at first.  After carefully sniffing and licking the treat a few times, she bit into it and started eating with gusto.  When she was done, she checked all around to make sure no crumbs were wasted and got up to beg for more.  These treats seemed to be a big hit with her.          As other people have pointed out, these treats are pretty sizable and hard.  They probably aren't great for smaller dogs.
