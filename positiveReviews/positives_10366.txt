We have a very picky cat. He turns his nose up to well loved kitty delights such as Fancy Feast, Friskies, or anything too low  ow for his tastes. He LOVES these treats, which says a lot. You never can predict what your cat's taste buds will enjoy, but I'd recommend these treats on the basis that a) a picky kitty likes them; and b) they don't stink to high hell.
