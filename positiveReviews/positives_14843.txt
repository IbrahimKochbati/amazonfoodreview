A delicate aroma greeted me when I opened the can of this tea. The flavor was different than that of any other Earl Grey tea I've tried. This is the reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5   basically it's not what I expected. Perhaps bergamot citrus was what set it apart from other companies. However though it's different it was very good. Tangy and flavorful, it seemed to get better with every sip. I don't usually add anything to the tea (no sugar, sweeteners, milk, etc.), but this tea in particular truly didn't need any additions. I am planning to try other teas from Rishi.
