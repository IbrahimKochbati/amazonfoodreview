Okay, I personally loved how these chips taste. They are super crunchy and flavorful. I chose to take away one star because the Sea Salt & Vinegar flavor was way too salty. BBQ was my favorite. Next time I order, I am getting just the BBQ. They taste just like the greasy unhealthier versions made by other  ands. The Cheddar was good but you can tell it was a healthy version of this flavor chips. The rest of the flavors I would say taste as they normally do, nothing special or out of the typical range of those flavors.
