Never having bought REALLY expensive coffee like Kona, I was hesitant to spend the price on this one. However, I have having a hard time finding a light roast decaf coffee that had the flavor that I wanted, so I reluctantly decided to spend the money on it.          The first thing I noticed was how SMOOTH my cup of coffee was... very creamy.  I LOVED that.  Then the aftertaste kicked in; a strong, intriguing flavor that was not at all unpleasant. I don't know how to exactly describe it, but it did make me go back for a second cup; I wanted to try it iced too!  It was top notch iced with some chocolate; it has a strong enough flavor but in a light roast so you don't get that burnt flavor, but it REALLY stood out with the chocolate flavor with it.  It seemed to be very low acid as well, it didn't eat at my stomach the way that the Sumatra coffee I had been drinking lately had.          I'm still not sure if I can justify the price of the coffee for the flavor, but I suspect I will be back for more!  The more I write about it the more I want to go  ew up a cup... and although it's 8:30 in the evening, it IS decaf, so I can, right? :D
