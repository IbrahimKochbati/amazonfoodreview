First off, I hate to trash a product that is not only "green", but made in America, however we are less than pleased with this cutting board. First off the color of the one we received is way lighter than the one illustrated. I specifically want a color close to that shown to match our new kitchen cabinets. Right away upon using it AS a cutting board, small chips started coming off of the cutting surface and with just over a month of use, the board is now warped from being rinsed off under warm tap water so that it wobbles from side to side, definitely not what you want to happen when you are trying to cut something. Lastly, be aware that these boards are made of multiple pieces of wood glued together, ours is 4 pieces. I doubt this board will last half as long as the bamboo board it replaced.
