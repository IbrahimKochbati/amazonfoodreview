When I first saw the website for this i thought it was a joke, especially growing up listening to the Offspring, Pennywise, the Vandals et al... anyways, decided to see who carried it and they have it at my podunk, hillbilly a$$ food 4 less here... $3 bucks a bottle, kinda pricey, I thought, till i saw how much it is here on amazon... I suggest checking your local Albertson's or Food 4 less and seeing if they have it, you'll never want tapatillo or chalula again... this is the real deal and tastes amazing!! I guess if it's one thing us Southern Californian's have in common it's our love of mexican food, and as any good So Cal resident knows, the salsa makes the burrito (or at least can make it go down easier in some cases)... Seriously good hot sauce!!!
