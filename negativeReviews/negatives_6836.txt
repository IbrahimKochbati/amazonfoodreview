This popcorn package is a great idea.  It has MANY flaws.  It is very difficult to pour the oil into the popcorn popper.  It is best when you heat the oil for  3 5 minutes and then add the popcorn and seasoning.,  The popcorn does not pop completely.  There are lots of left over kernels that never pop.  I am very disappointed in this product.  I will not purchase this product again.
