WILD RIDE WAS A LOT BETTER WHEN I STARTED EATING IT A FEW YEARS BACK. THE NEW PURCHASE OF SEVERAL BAGS (ATE TWO SO FAR) HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTING. FLAVOR PROFILE HAS CHANGED AND PRODUCT IS TOUGH AND DRY. GOING TO LOOK FOR A NEW REPLACEMENT BRAND. TOO BAD. PROBABLY GOT TOOK FOR A WILD RIDE (CRASHING) WITH THIS PURCHASE.
