Although I do not buy Canidae through Amazon, I wanted to rave about it's quality.  I am a dealer and own and operate a pet boarding facility.  I switch dogs everyday to Canidae without mixing diets due to the nature of the business and it saves me tons in labor.  The dogs not only gobble it up   they do not get upset tummies.  I have been feeding my pack of competitive working dogs (Border Collies and Australian Shepherds) for 6 years and about 30 boarding dogs per day and I have not found anything even close to the quality and value of Canidae.  Many kennels try to cut corners on feed but I believe paying a little more for Canidae has made money.  The dogs feel great, the kennels stay clean, and the owners have peace of mind. (Less poop to scoop is a big deal around here) I am a strong supporter of any feed company that puts together an all natural   excellent ingredient product and have tried many, but I'm completely sold on Canidae.
