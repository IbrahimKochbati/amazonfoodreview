This sauce is HOT   and yet it tastes like yum. :)          Pros: it tastes good; it is not pure heat, and yet, your mouth will be burning for over half an hour.  It's great in chili, salsa, V8, or heck, even poured on chips or crackers.          Cons: none, unless you have no tolerance for spicy food!
