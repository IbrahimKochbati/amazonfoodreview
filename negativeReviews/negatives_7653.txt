I had high expectations for these cookies but they weren't quite as good as I anticipated.          They are very chewy and fresh tasting    that's the good news. But they're not exactly bursting with flavor and, as moist as they seem to the touch, they tasted dry as I ate them. My wife said the same, unprompted. I tried them with black coffee and they're just a bit gluey as you munch.          If you want chocolate, this would not be a great choice. If you want something more akin to the mild taste of a scone, these individually wrapped cookies would be okay if you don't mind the dryness.
