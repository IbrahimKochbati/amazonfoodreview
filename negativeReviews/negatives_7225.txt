I ordered this flavor of Big Train (the product the coffee shops use) because I wanted more at a time. Unfortunately, it was only about 3 4's full, and did not, to me, taste like vanilla. Oddly enough, the smell reminds me of apples. ;^)     I am going back to buying the chocolate pouches of Big Train Chai.   "
