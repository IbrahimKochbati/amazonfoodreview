I am a long time tea drinker and have tried many  ands, but it was on a trip to Scotland that I found the tea of my dreams! I still  ew other  ands, but this will always be my go to tea, especially in the afternoons or when I'm stressed out. I also recommend Brodies Scottish Breakfast Tea for those who need to kick start their day with a stout 'cuppa'. Thank you, Amazon, for carrying this rather obscure  and (in America, anyway) and allowing me to stock up!
