These are awesome and if you know where to find the discount codes they can be super inexpensive.  I love the all natural ingrediants and I actually find them to taste great.  I actually put a little in my older kids oatmeal and they love it too.  I make 90% of my daughters baby food but this great for on the go or as a supplement.          My twin niece and nephew who are 18 months old love these as a snack and my sister says they are so great for car rides or trips to the museum.  I highly recommend these over any other baby food product.
