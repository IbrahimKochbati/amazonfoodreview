I have been using this tea for years. I enjoy the taste, the smell, and the affect it has on me. I usually drink coffee or green tea, but I keep this tea handy and drink a couple of times a week. Whenever I start feeling like I'm getting sick, I use it, leaving the bags to steep as I drink it. The stronger it is, the more affect. I also give it to my friends and family whenever they are feeling ill.
