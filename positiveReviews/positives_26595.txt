I have tried many K cups and some are hits and others are just plain misses. This one is a HIT! I don't like strong, bitter tasting coffee. This one has a smooth, mild taste that I love. I normally only drink one cup of coffee per day, but I have found myself craving this for an afternoon treat. I will definitely be purchasing this flavor again.
