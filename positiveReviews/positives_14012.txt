Someone made mention on the WeightWatcher message board about this PB2 product. I     "ran" right over here and read all the reviews and ordered a jar.  I took everyones     critique.  Love it!!!  I mixed 1 T. in a pinch bowl and gingerly added water to the right conistancy and added 1 t. of good jam. Wonderful on WW toast.  Afterwards I was sorry I didn't add a sliced banana. There is always tomorrow!          I recommend that you visit the Bellplantation website as they have many recipes and ideas.  Which is helpful because this is a new concept.  Can't wait till lunch!!!     You can buy this product over the counter but it would be a two hour trip for me.     Try it you will like it as I have tried all the "other" peanut butters before.
