This sparkling juice drink has a decent and refreshing flavor, though somewhat reminiscent of the canned orange juice (can't remember the  and) I had once in awhile as a kid.          It's a nice idea to have a soda that has no added sugar, though the juice combination isn't as impressive as the name might sound. This beverage contains a mix of the following juices (reconstituted with sparkling water): apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola. The beverage also includes gum acacia and soy.          Despite the fact that there are no added sugars, the calorie and carb counts are quite high   in fact higher than an average soda. An 8.3 ounce can contains 140 calories and 36g carbs.
