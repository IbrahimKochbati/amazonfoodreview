I am one of the weird people who actually like instant coffee better than fresh  ewed (in most cases), so these are a winner for me.  Very convenient and inexpensive in the long run, in that you only use what you need (how many pots of coffee have you dumped out?).  This pkg seemed to be one of the better values.  For anyone who needs a quick single cup of coffee, can't be beat.          Thumbs up!
