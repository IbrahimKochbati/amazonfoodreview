First: we are talking about a shaker of actual gold flakes. Anything negative probably falls into the category of, "Seriously? You just bought a shaker of GOLD FLAKES." That being said, the shaker itself could be better; the flakes come out all right and not too clumpy, which is good  I'm using these for a specialty cocktail  but I have a feeling about 30% of the gold I just paid an outrageous sum for is going to end up stuck to the sides of the shaker with no way to extract.          Also. I know it's real gold, but this price is just silly. I can't use the candy gold flakes for my purpose so I'm stuck with these guys, and I do appreciate they make a hard to find product, but their margin must be astronomical.
