The flavor and quality cannot compare to Zevia Ginger Ale made with erythritol and stevia but not into a mega commercial commodity. I don't know all of what they must do to "process" Truvia into what it is since they don't have to disclose the process or the additives, but no comparison to just good erythritol and stevia. Wouldn't have thought it would make such a difference. We will never buy any of these sodas again. All of the Zevia sodas are good (although more expensive, they are worth it) and don't make everyone have serious intestinal pain.
