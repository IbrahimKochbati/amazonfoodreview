I have used "spike" for  20 years!! It,s best on all veggies, taken the place of smoked meats, butter, and on baked potatoes spike and a little margarine is all you need. In soups, especially vegetable soup; spike is the  bomb! I used to get this seasoning at organic vitamin stores, but now I can buy at amazon in 6 packs.
