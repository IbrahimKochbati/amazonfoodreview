Be careful if you have a chocolate allergy.  The last box I purchased has cocoa powder as the ingredient and the cones are  own.  I know previous boxes did not contain cocoa powder and were a normal cone color.  The distributor should market these as chocolate cones and not try to pass them off as something else.  Note:  Be especially leary since this seller doesn't list ingredients.
