I normally order 2 pounds a month from this company, so that should apeak for itself.  For reasons unknown, I only ordered 1 pound this last time (12 7 11. This was my only stroke of good luck, for I received a bag of rancid nuts! They had a chemical taste, and I think it would have been nice if someone tasted one before shipping it out.I had to dispose of them in the trash, fearing my squirrel friend would suffer dire consequences, were he to eat one! Nuff said!Note: I just made a mistake on this order! Same company, but a later order that was for only one pound, not the 2 pound order of 12 7! That 2 pound order was fine. The next order was the bad one!
