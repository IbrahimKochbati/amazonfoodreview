It's not great plain, but it's wonderful mixed with other herbs.  It can be a little bland if you don't put anything but the rosehips in the infuser.  Hibiscus goes great with it, though.  It's a great tea for children because it's mild and fruity, for adults add it to something else.     Also, you can eat the rosehips after they've been  ewed, sounds weird but they are great, they taste a little bit like an apple and have lots of vitamin C.  Watch out for the pith (that's the best word I can think of for the little hairlike thorns that surround the seeds), though, if you decide to eat the hips.  Every once in a while you find one that hasn't been de pithed properly, hence you need to avoid the pith if you eat the  ewed hips.
