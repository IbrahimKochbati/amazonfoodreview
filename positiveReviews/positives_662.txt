Although I did enjoy the other flavor I ordered a tiny bit more, the Chocolate with walnuts one, this was still a very enjoyable flavor.  Wonderful service from Ms. Das, including a hand signed coupon for a discount on future orders, along with samples of a couple other caramel flavors.  I'd order this or the Chocolate and walnut flavor again for sure, along with more of Das Food's gourmet salt.
