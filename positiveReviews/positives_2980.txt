Cannot consider ourselves experts on North African or Middle Eastern cuisine, or having enough experience with Ras El Hanout to say the aroma and taste is better than competitors.  But the product was extremely fresh and of exquisite smell and taste so am very pleased with the purchase.  Will buy more when the time comes.
