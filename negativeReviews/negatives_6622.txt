Unfortunately I can't recommend these.  I like saving money, but I believe that buying these over the individually wrapped Pack of 84 is a mistake.  I actually bought these and the individually wrapped variety of the same product, so I think I can be a good judge on this decision.          One note:  Don't be confused by the picture of this product.  It is NOT individually wrapped as shown.          Here's why I can't recommend these:          They are dried out, especially compared to the individually wrapped ones.  When I bite into one of these its kind of chewy, not moist at all, has less taste, and is less appealing overall than the individually wrapped ones.  The individually wrapped ones has a lot more taste, moistness (making it easier to bite into), and when you bite into it, you can really taste the freshness.          The other, more important reason is that 90% of the time these have caused me... lets just call it "issues" in the bathroom shortly after eating them.  I have always had an iron stomach, but I have one stick and these "issues" start occurring.  This has been the case since the day I bought them.  This is not AT ALL the case with the individually wrapped beef sticks.  I can have two of those and experience no "issues."  I double checked the date on the box (they were new) and also insured that I was properly storing these sticks (I was).  So I really can only blame the fact that they are not fresh enough because they are not individually wrapped.  Possibly there's something more to this.  Maybe Jack Links put more preservatives in the bagged sticks to keep them fresher since they aren't individually wrapped.  I don't know, but this would make some sense.          Please, do yourself a favor and buy the individually wrapped version of these sticks.  Its worth the extra money for the freshness you get from unwrapping each stick and to not possibly experience "issues, which will lead to buyers remorse.
