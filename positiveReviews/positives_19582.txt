My cat Woody aka the Woodster is a feral cat. When he got this Cosmic Catnip,     well let us just say...he wanted to roll it into a fat joint a la Tommy Chong and     somoke it like the bad ass cat he really is! In fact I am going back to Amazon and     buy him a Hookah for his birthday. P Marchetti Beltsville, MD.
