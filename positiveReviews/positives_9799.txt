I make some wicked white chocolate macadamia cookies from scratch, and they're why I purchased the Azar Nut Co.'s Raw Macadamia Nuts.  Actually, I bought the halves and pieces, not whole nuts, but Amazon doesn't seem to carry the halves and pieces at this time.  The halves and pieces were about seven dollars cheaper than the whole nuts.  In any case, the whole nuts are still a far better price per pound than you pay in the grocery store for those little baggies of nuts that you have to buy several of to make a batch of cookies.          The nuts come in a large foil bag with a resealable "ziploc" style closure.  My bag was fresh, and perfect for my cookies.  Highly recommend!
