I am impressed with this product and it's in eakable freshness,the package from the comopany is Buetiful itself.But these CheeseNips are undeniably delicious!theyre very fresh and Tasty very Cheesy.I just bought a package from a a local Safeway store and they were terrible.Stale hard and just Terrible the backing was even terrible.I am glad I didn't cancel this order.I'd thought about after the purchase at this local San Jose Safeway!Well thank you and I would just like to say I like this product.Thank you and God Bless you.I look forward to doing more business with you.
