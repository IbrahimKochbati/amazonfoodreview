I was excited to try these Pork Rinds and so when they came, I popped some in the Microwave immediately.  If you are a traditional Pork Rind Lover, these are probably not for you.  They have the consistency of a Rice Cake.  Although they taste like a pork rind, it is not the same as the "feel" of a pork rind.  There is no "air" pockets, or crackling sensation that you get with holding a "regular" rind in your mouth.  I am sure these are great for some, but I am just not ready to call this good.  I gave my bag to a friend.  Lesson Learned.
