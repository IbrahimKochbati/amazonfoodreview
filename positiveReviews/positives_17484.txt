This is the best almond milk I've ever tasted!!! (vanilla flavor is even sweeter) and it is the only almond milk I know that doesn't contain Carrageenan (which is not good for you) I used to drink other Silk milks such as very vanilla soy milk...but switched to this when I got pregnant. I didn't want to feed my baby with carrageenan.I wish Silk company could find a way to not use carrageenan in any of their milks! But this one is my favorite!!!
