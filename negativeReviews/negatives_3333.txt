My dogs are decidedly not "new age" or impressed by the fact that these dog treats "are high in protein, naturally preserved with no wheat or corn, no artificial colors of [sic] flavor enhancers, and are free of added hormones, antibiotics and chemical additives."          Out of the bag, these treats seem decidedly overmanufactured, dry, dusty, and uninteresting. But I left it to my Australian Shepherds to decide on their own. During the first taste test, Kirwan, who will throw his head back like an alligator and eat anything tossed his way, crunched through the first one but was not interested in a second helping of these Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats. Pippin, who has a more discerning palette, moved his across the rug with his nose and subsequently abandoned it.          This morning, I placed a treat on the floor for each dog, and Kirwan ate his without enthusiasm while Pippin again ignored his.          Look, I love my dogs and I think Newman's Own is a fine company. But this product seems to me the result of overzealous people going to great lengths to make themselves feel good about what they are feeding their dogs. I cannot imagine the amount of farmland, energy, and resources expended to create these organic dog treats. We are really out of balance here with our priorities and perspectives.          Perhaps some animal nutritionist blessed this recipe, the art department created the bucolic packaging, and the marketing folks carefully crafted the spin for this product, all to make us feel good about having these tucked away in our pantries, but at $4 a bag, this will be the only time this product appears in our house. Besides, my dogs, who actually like foul smelling foods and will gloriously roll in who knows what sorts of awful stuff they find, do not like these sorts of boutique fa ications.          I really think a reality check is needed. (And I can already feel the sharp sting of venom as folks take me to task for holding a contrarian opinion here.)
