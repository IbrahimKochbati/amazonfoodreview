I tried two flavors of Switch; the Orange Tangerine and the Watermelon Strawberry. I liked the watermelon flavor a lot, but found that with Orange Tangerine, the flavor of the can came through a bit too much. It reminded me of why I've never really enjoyed drinking canned orange juice. Still, it was fairly good and the carbonation made it light and refreshing. Both flavors were a big, big hit with my 8 year old son.
