My wife and I thought this was gone the way of so many things we used to take for granted, but not so.  If you grew up in the US in the 40s, 50s and early 60s, most Mom's used this.  You just follow the directions on the can and anyone can have consistently excellent moist meatloaf each and every time.  My wife had gone so far as to make her own recipe, but now that we can obtain Hunt's again, there is no contest.  Makes the best tasting US style meatloaf you can make.  Hope you enjoy it as much as we do.  ColGilly
