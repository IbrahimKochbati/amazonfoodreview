Yum! Yum!  I liked these and they are certainly yummy chips.  They are a tad sweet and a tad salty mixed.  I guess they are more sweet than salty, though. Why only four stars?  These are like Pringles or Munchos in that they take mashed potato product (in this case, sweet potato), and form them into shapes and bake (excuse me, "pop") them.  I would have liked these better (and they would be more healthy) had they been from whole sweet potatoes and then chipped and baked. Most of the good nutritional value of the Sweet Potato has been lost, I would imagine.  Still, a tastey treat that is certainly not terribly bad for you!  :)
