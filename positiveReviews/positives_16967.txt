Just a word of advice:  If your dog is used to playing tug of war with a rope they will easily pick this toy up.  If they aren't, it probably is not the toy for your dog.          At first, my chocolate lab was a little leery because he never had a bottle as a toy.  It took a couple days of playing tug of war and leaving the tug a jug on the floor before he really knew it was "his".  Once I finally got him used to realizing it was his own, he saw me put his kibble in it.  Then it took a little bit before he was able to figure out how to work it.  Granted, the interactive part is you helping your dog realize the toy's value.  Now, it is something that can occupy him for 20 25 minutes. He'll do anything for treats.  Although, I'm not sure that he really, really likes it but he focuses in on it until every kibble disappears. I think that it is good for him and makes him do something different to get treats.  I like interactive toys :)          On the other hand, our little dog, still doesn't know how to get the treats out or how to use this toy.  Just a guess, he probably never will figure it out.  So, some dogs will take to it, and others will look at you like you're crazy for giving them a toy that doesn't squeak!
