I am very happy that I  ought this Lipton Loose Tea as this loose tea is what we had when I was a Child and its is still as good as I remember it was then ,are better tea than any of the other's tea that are already in a tea bag the flavor of this tea is what a glass of tea was supposed to be likes.I will always buy the loose tea now that I found a supplier I have looked in all of the big name  and super markets and never found any loose tea.I got mine order to come in every three month now but may have to get mine order up from one box too two boxes ..
