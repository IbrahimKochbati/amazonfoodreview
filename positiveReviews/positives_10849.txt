These treats are natural, which is good if you're looking for that sort of thing. I was a bit skeptical because our hound mutt wasn't a big fan of the Natural Balance dog food (we've since switched her to Blue Buffalo which she loves   I think she mostly wasn't a fan of the fish flavor). So I was skeptical of a natural doggie treat.          These a pretty good sized treats. They are scored down the middle, so you could theoretically  eak it in two for a smaller treat or smaller dog. They are pretty hard and pretty dry though, so it might be tough. If you have a dog with gum or tooth problems, this is definitely not the treat for you.          But the most important thing is that the dog likes them. Not as much as a plain ol' fake Milk Bone or some of her other stuff, but she definitely likes them.
