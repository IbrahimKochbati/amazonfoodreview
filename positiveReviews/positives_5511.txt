They were packaged so perfect and OMG if there were 100 stars, I would give them 100 stars, they are out of this world.  The crust melts in you mouth and the filling is perfect and delicious and scrumptious, The filling is not chintzy yet not too sweet. I used to make them when I was a kid with my mother for Christmas but they never came out like these.  I bet there is not one comment that is less than 5. They taste just like they look. They are beyond delicious and I  allow myself one or two a day.  If you're hesitating about how good they are, one bite and you'll know yuuuuuuuuuuum!!!!!
