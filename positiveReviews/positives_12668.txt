This is a  eakfast blend coffee and, for many coffee producers, a  eakfast blend also means "the strongest daggone  ew we can make" mentality.  Well, caffeine is caffeine and this guy is a bit strong for me.  I prefer Caribou's  eakfast blend over this Green Mountain version. It's just entirely more smooth, no bitterness at all, and just a very enjoyable cup of coffee.  I think this one tastes a bit burnt, like Starbuck's, not at all as nice as some of their other blends (especially the pumpkin spice   awesome!).  Try it to see if it suits your taste but get the 12 pack first.  Otherwise, if you think the way I do, 24 of these guys is a LOT of coffee to wash down!
