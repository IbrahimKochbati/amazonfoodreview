Upon the recommendation of my MD, I ordered this and started sprinkling my  eakfast and dinner with it to increase my dietary intake of iodine and assist in treatment of my hypothyroid condition. (I'm on Armour Thyroid as well.) My thyroid levels seem to be doing better as of the most recent blood test. I don't think these flakes have much flavor, so I usually add sea salt in addition to the kelp flakes. But I do think the flakes help increase bio available iodine in the body.
