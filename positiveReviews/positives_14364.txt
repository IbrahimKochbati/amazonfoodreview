We've given our dog Zuke's Hip Action for about two years. She had been taking Rimadyl for back problems, but due to some other health problems could no longer take that long term. The Hip Action product is working for her to keep her free from pain and very mobile. It has made a great difference in her quality of life   plus she loves getting her 'treat' every day!
