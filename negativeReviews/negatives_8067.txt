It gets one star for the price, fat and salt content and because it's 3.65 oz. rather than the 4 oz. in  ands available in local groceries.  The pieces were thick and flat, which is more attractive than the wrinkly stuff.  But the fat content is 13% compared to a more typical 2% and delivers 35 fat calories per 1 oz serving compared to a typical 5 calories from fat in a 1 oz. serving from the three different  ands our local Kroger Grocery carries.  All that fat didn't make it more tender or less chewy.  And that fat is displacing protein in a 1 oz serving, so 1 0z. delivers 90 calories instead of 70.  And there was 520 mg salt compared to 470 from the store  ands.          Unless this just hits your palate in some incredible way, can't understand why anyone would buy this product.
