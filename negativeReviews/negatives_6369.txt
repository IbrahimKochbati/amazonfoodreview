I purchased two boxes (50 K cups)and out of the 50, 40 of them ended up in the trash can, beside the fact that every time I tryed to  ew a cup of coffee, coffee grind was all over the machine and inside the coffee cup, due to the K cup bursting during  ewing. I did not have any problem with the same  and of coffee i purchased from my local supermarket though. I will not buy it ever again on line. A real nightmare.
