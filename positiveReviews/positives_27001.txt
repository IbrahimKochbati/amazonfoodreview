I love my beef jerky and this is the style I like at a great price, especially if subscribed. At $11 for a pound shipped, how can anyone complain? Since preferences differ, I'd class myself as disliking the moist style beef jerky that have become popular in recent years, I would say this is similar jack links, a bit more dehydrated. My favorite used to be a bone dry japanese  and I cant seem to find anymore. It's not quite that dry, and they do tenderize it it in some manner. However, not over processed so you'll some across vein and fat as some reviewer complained of, but it give it a very natural texture. I give it 5 stars although its not perfect in consideration of the absolutely low cost as 4 1 2 isn't an option.
