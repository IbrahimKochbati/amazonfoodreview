I've been drinking Yogi tea for a few years and finally got tired of paying the high price at the local supermarket.          Glad I found this stuff on Amazon for less than half price!          The first box I received was labeled DeTox, but all the tea inside was Ginger.          Called Amazon customer service to do an exchange and they wouldn't take the tea back for security reasons, but they shipped out another box at no charge.          Second box came with the correct flavor.
