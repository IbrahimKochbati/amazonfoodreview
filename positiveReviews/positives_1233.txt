The main ingredients in this dog food are so much better than the ingredients in the common grocery store  ands, and it tends to be less expensive than specialty  ands.  My dog's coat looks shiny and he seems much healthier since we switched to this food about a year ago.  The other nice thing is that Target sells this  and, so if you ever find yourself at the end of the bag and you haven't ordered more in time, you can stop by Target.
