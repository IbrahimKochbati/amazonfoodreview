What a wonderful starter kit this is.  While I am and was familiar with some varieties of exotic sea salts, I certainly had not had the opportunity to try this many at one time.  Tather than chance buying a product that I did not like and being stuck with it, this allowed me to give each and everyone a try.          I plan to order at least three more sets for presents this coming year for friends that, like me, are foodies.          This is an excellent product.
