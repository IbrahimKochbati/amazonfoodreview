I bought the 4 pack of this coffee based on the reviews of others and the price. It is a lot of coffee, since we drink less than 1 pot per day.  I really enjoy the flavor.  I put a little cream and sweetener (agave nectar) in my coffee, but this coffee has great flavor that comes through.  I'm not super picky on coffee, but I can tell when I have "bad" coffee.  This is definitely good coffee and I plan to keep buying this coffee as the only coffee we have in our house.
