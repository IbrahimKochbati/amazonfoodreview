Purchased several of these from various sellers including amazon, never any complaints.  Our baby loves them (55 lb. golden retriever).  She is a very aggressive chewer and the larger ones actually last her about half an hour.  She is always excited when we go to the pantry and she hears one of her many treat bags opening.  She escpecially loves these.  Sometimes if the isn't in the mood to go to town on it, I will let her lick it and that usually gets her juices flowing and she will finish it.          She will be age 2 in April and the vet says here teeth look really good.  This has the most mechanical chewing action for an edible product I've seen.  Greenies are nice but they dissappear really quick and can get pricey.  I wouldn't reccomend a steady diet of these however I usually go every other or every third day and supplement with Checkups or Greenies and nylabones.  Way easier than  using or the dangers of water additives and rawhide.
