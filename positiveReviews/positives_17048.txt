If you have a dog labeled "destructive when bored" DO NOT pass up on this toy! It's absolutely the best puppysitter. It's been three months, but when I put her kibble in it I still know that she's good for about 20 minutes while I do dishes or whatever. I hate constantly kenneling her when I need to focus on something, so this has been wonderful because it lets her play so much longer.          Pros             Totally entertains her for a minimum of ten minutes            Can hold her dinner and then some, I can adjust her playtime with how much I put in it. The less I put in it the longer she plays            Easy to load treats in. just unscrew the bottom and you're good!
