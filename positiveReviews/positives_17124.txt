The ingredients are simple and natural: Wisconsin butter, Salt, Truffle Oil, White Truffles, & Natural Flavorings yet a little of this butter goes a long way to impart an earthly garlicky flavor in your food. Arrives tucked in cold packs and lasts a long time in the freezer. The butter is filled with bits of truffle you can see and taste. I think their secret is whipping truffle oil into the butter to enhance the flavoring. Regardless of the secret, it's a potent and tasty truffle butter.
