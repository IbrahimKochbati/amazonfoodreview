Our three dogs love Greenies. They are very expensive (usually $32.99, but marked down to $29.99 sometimes). Then, on top of that you have state tax. So ... if I buy 4 boxes: two Petite and two Teenies in a store that has "Pet" as part of the name, it'll cost me over $135.00. If I do the same thing through Amazon companies prices it costs me about $85.00. That's a difference of $50.00 (for the Math impaired reader ...). Go with free shipping because it, literally, gets here the same time frame. Use the $50.00 and take your spouse out to dinner!     The product is great. I did notice that two in the same day was a bit tough on my Pomeranian's digestive system and caused a little diarrhea. The dogs love the taste and would eat them all the time. We get the small ones despite having two larger dogs because they will chomp them down in a heartbeat. With the smaller sizes the dogs still get a treat and the boxes have a lot larger amount of Greenies in them.
