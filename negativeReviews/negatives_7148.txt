I love chips...and have been noshing on the regular Popchips for months now...love most of the flavors. So when I saw the multigrain, I thought, why not?  UGH...it wasn't crispy and the taste was bland and dull. I am so disheartened to have 23 bags left, that I don't know if I will continue my regular subscription.  Do not get these unless you want chips that would be better served as packing material
