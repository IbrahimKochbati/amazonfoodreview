This limited ingredient food is a life saver for my dog who can't eat grains, flax or peas.  It smells good and it must taste good, because he scarfs it down.  Normally, he is quite finicky and I have to add canned to his dry food for him to eat it.  Not this one!  I wish it was sold in my local pet shop!
