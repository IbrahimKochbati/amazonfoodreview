I like buying Paul Newman products because the profits go to his camp for ill children.  And they taste good too. These pretzels fit that bill.  And I believe the price is reasonable, as well.  It's great to eat pretzels that have a good amount of protein in them, unlike the "average" pretzel with just a bunch of carbohydrates.  All my family and friends like them too.  The only little downside, for me, is they taste a bit too salty. However, the rest of my family didn't find them too salty and thought they were just fine. They are low in fat, with 4 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein per serving. I will definitely buy Paul Newman's Organic Pretzels again and again.
