My lab border collie mix loves these.  She's a chewer so I can leave her with one of these when I leave which keeps her busy.  Great deal too   half the price than from the vets office. Update 4 4 11   I ordered another bag of chews and the quality is inconsistent.  This bag had no Chlorhexidine coating on the chews so my dog wont eat them.  Returning and getting from Entirely Pets in the hopes that these will be better.
