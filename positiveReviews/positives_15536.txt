The tree came very well packaged and protected. I was worried about it getting through the cold since I was ordering it in December, but it came and was very healthy from what I observed (given I don't know much about Bonsai trees). It came in the type of pot seen in the photo, but I would have liked it to come with a tray.          I would have also liked the dimensions to have been posted. At least the height so you understand what you're buying first.          Overall a beautiful tree that arrived very quickly :) My friend loved it!
