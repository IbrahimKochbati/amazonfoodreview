This creamer is very rich and creamy.  It is convenient and does not have to be refrigerated.  We used powered French Vanilla creamer and had to be make special trips to the store because we were always running out.  A bottle of the concentrated creamer lasts longer and tastes better.  The flavor reminds you of sweet condensed milk.  Someone in a previous review said you cannot take the pump off once it is put on. The manufacturer must have changed this because it now just unscrews so you can clean the pump if necessary and also get the last drops that won't pump out.  Even though the 2 bottles seem costly it has definitely saved us money.  Amazon is the only place I have been able to find this creamer.  It now a staple in our pantry.
