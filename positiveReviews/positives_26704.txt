So, after adopting our dog, we discovered he had chronic ear infections, most like due to a food allergy, and so began our search for the perfect food.  This was food number 3.  We made it through about half the bag, when we noticed he was crazy itchy and had another ear infection.  I also went online to research the food and found a number of alarming reviews where dogs had reactions to the food.  Of course, there could be outside circumstances involved in these other instances, so I also made sure to read all the positive reviews.  However, this was clearly not working for my dog.  To settle my concerns around the negative reviews however, I decided to call the company.  It turns out that quite a few dogs are sensitive to sweet potatoes, and also, possibly, peas, which is also an ingredient in this food.  They were super nice, and sent me a voucher for a free bag of treats, and a voucher for a full size replacement bag of food in any of their other varieties, to be redeemed at any pet store that carries their product!  So, although this food was a no go for the Murph, I can't fault the company. They were great.
