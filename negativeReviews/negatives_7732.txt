I purchased a couple of these for a luau because I was expecting something close to what we get in the cans in Hawaii.  After opening the packet, they smelled really close and this is where the goodness ended.  After adding the water, I took a sip and it was some of the worst stuff that I had ever tasted.  All it really ended up being was colored sugar water and did not taste anything remotely close to the drink in the can.  If you are looking for Hawaiian Sun products, skip this one and go with the cans.  Save yourself the embarrassment of making this for a party and having to take it away.  If I could give this product negative stars, I would.
