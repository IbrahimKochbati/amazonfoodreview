I'm pregnant, and lately have been craving foods from my childhood (like peanut butter sandwiches, barbecue chips, apple juice). I've been in a soup mood lately and bought a bunch of Amy's soups at Whole Foods. This soup is light and delicious, and tastes like spaghetti O's! Of course it is more soup like and healthier, but that's what this reminded me of!
