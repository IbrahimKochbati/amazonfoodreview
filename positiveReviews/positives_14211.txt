I bought Maldon Sea Salt after a friend mentioned how good it was.  I can't believe the difference between it and other salts.  The crunchy texture and the clean taste makes it perfect for everything from steak to a baked potato to desserts.  It is and will be a permanent fixture on our table from now on.
