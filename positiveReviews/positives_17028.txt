The busy buddy is one of my favorite toys I have bought my dog. He loves it and it usually takes him about 20 minutes to get all the treats out (I don't fill it all the way up). I haven't tried to put his food in it, but I'm sure it would be perfect as well. My dog loves this toy and it is fun to watch him try to work his moves to get the treats out. The only problem with this toy is that it is loud and my room mate hates it and takes it away. So just don't have hard wood floors like I do and you'll be set.
