In the past I have bought my syrup from World Market when on sale and when I lived in Seattle. Although  our local  Fred Meyer store stocks Torani the flavors are limited. So I  subscribed the the sugar free variety pack thinking I could tolerate the two flavors I don't much care for. Wrong. the Raspberry and Irish Creme keep piling up because I don't like them. But some reviewers have given me a few ideas. I merely tolerate the hazelnut and vanilla. Love the caramel and chocolate. What I would really like is to be able to select my own sugar free variety pack and or be able to purchase one that has coconut (my absolute fav), white chocolate, almond, caramel, peppermint, and ginger ead syrup (I am addicted to this flavor). I would even settle for sugar free coconut in the three pack. PLEASE add more flavors.
