Ths is the third Busy Buddy I have bought, I have a chocolate lab that loves this thing, keeps her busy for at least an hour.  The only complaint I have and the reason I have bought three is the threads where you screw the top on is a little easy to strip and  eak.  Could just be because my dog is a little rough on it, but I still love it and so does she.
