Over a year ago I purchased a Breville K Cups  ewer and immediately found the the available selection and choices to exceed what I had expected. I loved using it and  ewing what I wanted, 1 cup at a time. I found that I was paying about 40cents cup and that was also great.     Now the prices have soared to nearly or over $1 cup and that has made me slow down my purchase rate and my enjoyment of my single cup  ewer.          Enter the DisposaKups and suddenly the price is reasonable again and I can grind my own or purchase Eko ew and use their coffees. These are so simple, convenient and easy that I really enjoy that my world of coffee is wide open again.          Thanks for such a great product!          Ted
