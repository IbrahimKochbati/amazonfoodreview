I haven't used Shake n Bake for years. I decided to try it again, and I'm glad I did. It only took 15 minutes in the oven, and it tasted pretty good. It was nice and crunchy without any frying. I made it with a box of Stove Top stuffing and some green beans. I had dinner on the table in less then 30 minutes. My 18 yr. old son had two helpings. He told me to make this more often too. I'm going to be buying this more often now, because I forgot just how easy it was to use Shake n Bake, and the chance to try it again  ought back old memories.
