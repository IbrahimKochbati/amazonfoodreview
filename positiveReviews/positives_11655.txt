Usually diet sugar candies disappoint me (even natural ones).  However, we were not disappointed with this candy.  It does dissolve really fast, but the flavor is fantastic.  My kids think they are great as well as all adults who have tried them. My only objection is that they are so addictive.  I have to use self control to not eat too many at once.
