Wow.     For those on a gluten & dairy free diet, these are ideal as a quick snack, something to keep in a purse or glove box. My partner has some very strict dietary needs (Chron's) and seldom is something available for her that not only tastes good, but doesn't come at a cost to her digestive system.     This is perfect!
