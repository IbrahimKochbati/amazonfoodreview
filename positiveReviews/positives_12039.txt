I've been experimenting with Cajun food for quite sometime. I've talked with several different Creole Chefs and two of the three that I have spoked with have recommended this seasoning over any other. From now on, this is the only Creole seasoning I use on any meat. I've bought the variety pack of Chef Paul Prudhomme's seasonings, and nothing really stuck out like this one. If you have been using Chef Paul Prudhomme's seasonings, and haven't purchased this one, you are in for a treat. I can't find this specific product in the stores, which makes the 24 oz can a great buy.
