This is a great way to trick children into drinking "juice", it is organic, flavorful and the berries give the tea a red pink purple color.  No more food coloring, artificial flavors or sweeteners.  Everything I could have asked for.  Even the packaging is Green, it is printed with soy ink.  This is a company you should be proud to support.  The only way it could be better is if it was made in my home town, so it would take less energy to get it into my tummy.  It is absolutely refreshing and nourishing.
