I've tried several of the Blue Diamond jar almonds and the Butter Toffee almonds are the best.  They would probably be my favorite almond, but they're high carb. I guess the trick is to only eat a few at a time....  We can all do that, right?  : )          I agree with the other reviewer who said that the Blue Diamond almonds in the cans are better than the ones in the jars    my favorite are the Vinegar & Salt    but the Butter Toffee almonds are the exception.
