I've always wanted to go to a raw diet for my Cairn but in its frozen form it took up too much room in our RV fridge freezer as we travel camp a lot!  A friend recently told me about Addiction and this is the answer for us   takes up little space in our cupboard and provides a healthy diet, along with a mixture of Wysong Epigen kibble, and fresh fruits and vegetables that our Cairn loves; he's a very happy camper!  The cats at home love it, too!  We've only tried Brushtail but get the Venison treats for variety.  I'm sure we'll try the others, too, for a change up from time to time   (done in moderation and over a period of time so as not to upset the tummies!)!!!!
