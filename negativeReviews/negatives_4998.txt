This toy is not so good if the treats or kibble is too big.....  even small kibbles have a hard time getting out of the jug.  I think this toy needs to be re designed    My dog kept trying to pick up the jug from it's base so he can tip it up side down but the jug was too big to be picked up and made of slippery plastic (he's a Newfoundland with a big mouth).  He learned how to dump the food out with empty soda bottles that I would put kibble in.  It took a long time for him to get his food out and then at the end when there was only a little left he didn't want to play anymore because they would not come out.  I think I will either take the rope out or drill a small hole at the tid of the jug to make it more fun.
