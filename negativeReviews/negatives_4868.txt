Supposed to be for cleaning their teeth   right...  well   that would assume they held up to some for of chewing...  our little Border TERRIER (not Collie) "eats" one of these in about 5 minutes...  too fast to be of any use to the teeth and almost too fast to cause concern in the digestive tract.  Bummer too because these are supposed to be great for pups teeth...  just an agressive chewer defeats Greenie...  that's all.
