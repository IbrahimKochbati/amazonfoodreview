This is miracle stuff!          I've used it for years and have completely stopped 'searching' for anything else and even moreso   have stopped 'TRYING' anything else.          This stuff cleans, clears, de yellows, de greens, and even helps alleviate certain disease issues before (and even after) they've started.  I've found this much less stressful on the fish when dealing with a 'dirty or diseased or medicated' fish tank. Changing the water (especially after meds) can sometimes create such a harmful blow on the fish... whereas this is so much more gentle on the fish; thus allowing a water change after the fact without the incredible stress or damage to delicate fish. Even if you're in need of adding meds, I've found this a fabulous 'pre intervention'    why, because many times this need only occurs due to lack of proper maintenance of the tank. By alleviating the 'nasties' before a small water change + adding meds; I personally have found this a lifesaver when it comes to those fish in 'not to happy' condition. I've seen many die, but I've seen less die when using this in combination of meds and H2O changes. Obviously, you're call.... but if you're looking for a helpful moment in time   this be it!!!          Additionally, should one have issues with water quality, even after changing the water    this will absolutely fix it!!! I still recommend however to start with this first (you'd be amazed at what clarity can occur while at work for even only 8 hours).          If you have never used this stuff, I promise you, this WILL produce miracles beyond any fishkeepers expectations.          Your fish will thank you!!! You will thank you!!          This stuff is the 'bee's knees',     it's the 'holy grail',     it be the ying to any fish's yang!!          You will never be sorry you purchased it,     It's worth every penny!     ... that is, as long as the deals here don't suddenly change.     If so, as always, we the people shall figure out what it's made out of and then just wholesale penny it from an alt manufacturer.          AND, this IS a DEAL! [...] has always strived to be one of the best priced places online... and here, they found their niche even moreso! I buy from them regularly, and shall continue. They 'quick ship', they honor their prices, and are happy to fix any faux pas.          You just can't go wrong with:     1) this gift from 'the gods', and     2) buying anything from [...]          I swear by this product and have yet to find anything else in 9 years of fishkeeping that even comes close to the miracle of this product.     .... yes Virginia   there is a Santa Fish somewhere out there and his name is PolyFilter!!!
