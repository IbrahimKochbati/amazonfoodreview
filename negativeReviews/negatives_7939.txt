I picked up this bar at a local food store called Eatzi's.  The packaging is fun and I'd never heard of this  and before. I'm not a chocolate connoisseur by any means, but enjoy dark chocolate now and then.  This bar wasn't wonderful or terrible   just average.  Given the price, I doubt I will buy one again as there are numerous specialty chocolates to try.
