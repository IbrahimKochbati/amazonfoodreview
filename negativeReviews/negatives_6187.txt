I just want to know, Is this Madhaya Organic Coconut Sugar 100% Coconut Sugar? The nutritional label as to what actually is contained inside this bag is not available and I read that even for products that claim to be Organic Coconut Sugar a mix of industrial sugar may have been added. Please, help. I no longer consume white sugar but substituted with dark honey but now I am reading that TRUE Organic Coconut Sugar w  no added fillers is the best option for sweetening the palate. Thank you! :)
