I was really looking forward to sampling this product. It's not bad, but a little too sweet tasting for me. Also, at 140 calories for an 8.3 oz can, I thought that was on the high end. But it does contain 34 grams of sugar, and one must remember that fruit juice is not low in calories. I would have preferred more sparkling water and less juice. On the plus side, it has no artificial ingredients or colors. And no corn syrup! I am sure many will like this product more than I, especially those who prefer more sweetness in their beverages.
