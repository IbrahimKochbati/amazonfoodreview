We save lots of money using these instead of flavored coffee creamer from the grocery store. I love the raspberry for Italian sodas and in whipped cream for a great fresh berry topping. Chocolate is my least favorite because I'm a chocolate snob but I have made some decadent raspberry mochas with it. Great value  a small bottle is over $5 at my grocery store!
