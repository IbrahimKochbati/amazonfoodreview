The drink flavor is Kiwi Berry but I tasted a lot of flavors in it besides Kiwi and Berry. There are six fruit juice concentrates included. Note that Kiwi, although listed first on the can label before Berry, is the third fruit listed on the ingredient panel after Apple and Grape. Acerola (Barbados cherry or wild crapemyrtle per Wikipedia), Raspberry and Strawberry are listed as numbers 4, 5 and 6.          I tried the beverage cold without ice then with ice.  Even drinking it a little later after it got watered down with the ice it was still a strong flavor and still tasted carbonated.  I noted that there was no aftertaste from Kiwi that I find in other drinks like Hansen.          I don't believe the smaller size (8.3 oz.) was created for children, I think it is small to compete with the energy drinks out there that seem to appear in a similar size can.  HOWEVER, there is no caffeine, no added sugar, no guarana, or other "energy" added ingredients in this drink so it is safe for children and adults who do not wish to drink stimulant type drinks.  But, another HOWEVER is that this drink is 135 calories just for 8.3 ounces, 34 carbs including 33g of sugar (natural from the fruit juice concentrates).  There is 15mg of sodium and 100% of an adults daily requirement of Vitamin C.          I am not sure if I would buy this drink again but it does taste nice.  I would like to try some other flavors from The Switch, however.  This one might make a good base for a punchbowl drink (with ice cream?)          I think I should have given this drink fewer stars, now that I think about it.
