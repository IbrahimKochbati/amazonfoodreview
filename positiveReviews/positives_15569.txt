My Australian Shepard puppy LOVES these treats. She is usually a tough one to impress but these little things I swear made her eyes roll back. Picked these up very cheap at my local grocery store and well worth it. One thing to consider with these is you have probably 100 or more mini treats inside this bag. Compared to other dog treats that maybe have a few large pieces, this will go a long way... especially if you have a dog that needs to be  ibed.
