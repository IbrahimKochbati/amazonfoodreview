I usually have pretty low expectations for boxed dinners, but this dish certainly was surprisingly full of flavor. There was plenty of spice, so I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is not a fan of hot, spicy food, but if you are buying food from this region, it's probably to be expected (the description calls it mildly spicy). The vegetables dominate the mixture, which was very easy to prepare, even in the microwave. Despite what the box says, you get one nice sized serving per package. Considering this isn't a dish most would be likely to make on their own, it's a nice cullinary departure and worth a try.
