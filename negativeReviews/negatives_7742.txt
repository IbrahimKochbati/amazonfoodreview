I love the product and have bought at other places.  The reason I bought this from Amazon is they had a deal that allowed me to buy it for much less per bag than other places.  When I got it I noticed one of the 12 bags was opened already.  OK I was still in the black on the deal but after I put it on the shelf for a few days I pulled it down to get another bag and 3 more were open.  4 of the 12 bags were open and that isn't acceptable.
