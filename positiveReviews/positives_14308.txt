Pinnacle Dog Food is the best in my opinion.  My dogs have had excellent long term health and long term perfect weight with this food.  Its good for all life stages, from puppy to geriatric, and I feed "ad libitum" so that their bowl is never empty.  They self regulate their intake and this is the only food I've been able to do that with.  And they love it.
