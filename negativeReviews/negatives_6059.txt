This Green Mountain Flavor Variety is nice. I enjoyed having more than one flavor to choose from. The best flavor in there was the Caramel Vanilla Cream!! WOW! That flavor shocked me and I liked it the most! It reminded me of a Starbucks vibe, only better. The only reason I didn't rate this item higher is because I would have liked to test ALL Green Mountain flavors... this variety pack was loaded with only 4 flavors and I was tired of French Vanilla and Hazelnut. I would like to see a "variety" pack containing 2 of each flavor that Green Mountain has to offer... now that would be cause for a rating of 4 or 5 stars!!!
