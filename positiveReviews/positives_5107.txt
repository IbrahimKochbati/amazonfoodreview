I'm training for my first marathon in November 2011 and these chews have kept me going during my long 18 to 20 mile training runs.  I dissolve them in water rather than carry them as chews and sip steadily after mile 8.  They taste like concentrated hawaiian punch and do not upset my stomach whatsoever.  I also eat them prior to a workout if I am feeling low energy and will even snack on them in lieu of candy.  Seriously, they are that good.  I have tried GU as well as Powerbar gels and both do the trick but are nowhere near as tasty.  The consistency of the chews are slightly softer than DOTs candy.
