I absolutely am addicted to these.  I was taking Lipitor for my cholestrol and couldn't have pink grapefruit juice or eat pink grapefruit, which I absolutely love.  But these satisfied my craving for it completely plus it didn't interfere with the meds!  I  ought the bag to work and put them in my candy jar on my desk and have gotten several other people hooked on them! They're the best!
