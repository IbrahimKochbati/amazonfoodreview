it is WONDERFUL, never had a flower yet, i just LOVE the leaves! May 2012 i accidentally dropped it...  oke 2 of its good leaves as it hit the floor! BUT it grew right back, this is what makes me so happy, i was so scared it would die on me! But no, this beauty came up with 2 more leaves. LOL!!!!! Love it, just awesome plant, you need fertilizer and good soil for these kinds of plants, it all depends on what you have as a soil starting stuff...
