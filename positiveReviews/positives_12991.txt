Just wrote a long review of these on the link for one bag, wish I'd found this first...will use next time!!! Awesome little cookies, my new favorite. I counted the crackers in one bag...got 90. Times 6 bags at this price is only 5 cents per cracker. Ok, they're small, but if you're rewarding behavior in training you want the treats small and convenient to use, so these are just right for my needs.
