This was my first experience with a kona blend and it was a very pleasant and tasteful coffee. It was sweet, with somewhat of floral undertones, with a wonderful aftertaste. All in all a very good coffee.          One caveat for those who like full bodied and or darker roasts: this comes accross to me as a light roast (although is labeled as a medium roast). To be honest it did take away from the experience a little for me as I prefer medium roasts, but I still give it a five star rating because of the quality of the flavor.
