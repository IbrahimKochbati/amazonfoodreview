Not only does this flour have the advantage of being organic (which is of questionable significance) but it has made my pizza dough and waffle batter much better than with previous flours. I am not sure if it justifies the high cost and I am not sure I will continue to use this flour due to the cost, but for now I am enjoying the benefits.
