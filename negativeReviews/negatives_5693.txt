i have been buying starbucks syrup for so long which i have enjoyed, but thought that there might be something better out there, but i was disappointed to find that this product did not live up to its description and my expectations.  i found it to taste pretty artificial and it does not really enhance the taste of my coffee.  unfortunatly only ok.
