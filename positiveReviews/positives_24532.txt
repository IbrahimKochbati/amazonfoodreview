I have bought this canned pumpkin for a while now.  No complaints with product, no complaints with Amazon.  I get free shipping, it arrives very timely, and I use a lot of it since I feed it to my five cats.  Can't find it cheaper anywhere and it comes to my house.  Very satisfied with the whole package
