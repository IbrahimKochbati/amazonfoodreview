My wife and I have decided hands down, this is our favorite K cup. We've tried a lot of others, and Donut Shop and Caribu Day eak are certainly still up there. However, this has a very solid body flavor with a medium roast. Almost a bold flavor with a smooth finish. Excellent flavor versus strength. Really nice to get up on a lazy Sunday morning and have a nice cup of Breakfast in Bed!          Also, I see another reviewer had problems with messy K cups. I can say after about 6 boxes of theses, I haven't had any issues. Very unfortunate for the other reviewer, but looks like it was rather isolated.          Give it a try, you'll certainly enjoy it, the wife and I sure do!
