Being the candy lover that I am, I wanted to buy some cute lollipops that I could pull out of my bag and enjoy whenever I felt like it. For that purpose alone, I'd give them five stars. However  at first lick, the lollipop has a slightly off taste; but this goes away after a minute and is not unbearable or disgusting in any way. I laughed quite a bit at the reviews of outraged individuals because the lollipops are 'Made in China'  I'm not dead dying sick. Good enough? As well, the text on the wrapper is fine  I wasn't repulsed by it and I'm not afraid to share. I'd only rewrap them if they were for presentation rather than eating.     The colors are not as vivid as in the picture, and the lolipops are not glazed  so they do not have that shiny look that many others have. None of mine came  oken, and they were well wrapped. I'm happy with my purchase and plan on eating them all(minus the few that I share with friends), but I'd try something different next time.
