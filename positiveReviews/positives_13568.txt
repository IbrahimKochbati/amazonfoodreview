These bars are delicious! They're soft and chewy and mildly sweet.  I actually like sweet bars and was wondering after I read other reviews if these would be sweet enough. They're perfect! I love coconut and was hoping to find a yummy snack sized bar to enjoy. These are fresh tasting and delicious! The price is worth it too because they taste like a quality bar.
