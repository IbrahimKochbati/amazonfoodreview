Features:     None of the following:  wheat, soybeans, corn, added animal fat, poultry fat, by products, sugar, artificial preservatives, salt, or sunflower oil          Uses free range fed bison that are not fed hormones or chemicals. THE LUCKY BISON ARE CONSIDERATELY NOT  CASTRATED, BRANDED, OR DEHORNED BEFORE BEING TURNED INTO DOG FOOD.          Blueberries help support a healthy urinary tract.          Yucca Schidigera Extract   helps to lessen stool odor and is an aid to the joints. As long as our dogs do it outside, I don't care how their stools smell.          Millet, Brown Rice, Cracked Pearled Barley are complex carbohydrates that, according to Solid Gold, are good sources of fiber. The non allergic grains are certified organic and free of pesticides.          Just a Wee Bit is intended to be a good alternative for those dogs who can't tolerate lamb, beef, or chicken in their diets.     Solid Gold uses only wild caught fish, not fish from fish farms.     Nutritionally complete and balanced.  This is true. The bag did not tip over when I stood it up.          Made in the USA          Each bag is specially sealed for freshness hermetically. I don't know where they find all the hermets to do this though.     As of this writing, a four pound bag of Just a Wee Bit is a shade under 13 dollars at PETCO.          Bella's Experience            In an impulsive frenzy, the Spudette fed Bella the new food right out of the bag with a little bit of Solid Gold canned food. Bad move. When introducing a new food, one should add a small amount of the new to the old and then gradually increase the percentage of new food in the mix until you reach 100% of the new stuff. Not surprisingly Bella got a bout of runny stools after this rude introduction to Just a Wee Bit.          Within a week, however, Bella had adjusted to her new food and seems to be doing well on this new diet. I haven't smelled her stools to see if they are less odiferous and have no intentions of conducting such a test. As an added test, I put less than an tablespoon of the Solid Gold kibble on the plates of Evie and Piper. They actually seemed to like this new food quite a bit, even the ever fussy Piper.          Just a Wee Bit is the smallest dog kibble I have ever seen, and I've seen quite a few  ands. Ever look at the little paper circles inside a whole puncher? Individual pieces of this kibble are almost as big as those paper cut outs and about as thick as a nickel. Be careful pouring this food because it's easy to drop a few pieces and almost impossible to find them. You'll have to rely on your dog's sense of smell to recover any dropped kibble. Occasionally Bella gets bits of this micro kibble caught in her throat making us think the tiny size of the pieces is too extreme.          Finally   I must admit that, based on the inclusion of wholesome ingredients and the exclusion of junk, this is an excellent dog food. Most dogs should thrive on such a recipe. One on a budget will probably prefer to find an alternate quality food that isn't so expensive. Since this formula is intended for dogs that have allergic reactions to some common ingredients in other foods, the extra expense really isn't necessary for dogs that have no such allergy problems. For hypersensitive Evie, this is a terrific choice. For dogs that can eat anything, it might be considered extreme.
