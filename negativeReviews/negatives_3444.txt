Love this coffee, so I was rather disappointed when I recieved this particular shipment.  The box said it was a pack of 50, but there were only 47 K cups in the box.  And one of the K cups had come open, reducing the quantity to 46 and creating a mess of coffee grounds in the box.  Not sure who takes the blame for this   the coffee box was sealed and included inside another box with other items, so that leads me to believe fault lies with "The Coffee People."  I suppose if many others are experiencing this same issue, it may be time to choose another coffee provider.          March 29 Update: Discovered 8 other faulty cups in this batch   Top seal would come loose while  ewing & cause grounds to overflow from top of K cup, or the internal filter would leak by and puke coffee grounds into my cup.  I was beginning to suspect a faulty  ewer,but when these same results occurred on a second and third  ewer, the problem lies in the K cup...
