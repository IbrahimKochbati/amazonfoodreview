Let me start off by saying I love these. My dog gets so excited when he gets one of these. These are not durable and go away within an hour or two, but they are meant to. These are not meant to be for a teething puppy or for a chew toy that lasts. These are supposed to be super special treats that you give your dog once in a blue moon (Like if you are leaving to go on a trip). Yes, they are expensive, but for a reason. They are made in the U.S. and for those of you that do not know, it is healthier to get treats from the U.S. if you can. They are also healthy. One Dentastix is about 300 calories and I read many reviews saying it gave their dog diarrhea and made them sick. Yes there is a review saying this made their dog sick, but he probably ate it too fast. Your dog may need to be watched while eating these. These are meant for a treat and not a bone that lasts. But my dog loves them and that makes me happy!
