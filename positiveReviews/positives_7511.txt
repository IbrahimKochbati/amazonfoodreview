This is real stevia extract without any additives. Most of the companies that claim to be selling stevia are really selling stevia extract combined with other things, like fiber or artificial sweeteners, but this is the real deal. It's extremely sweet, which means you only have to use a small amount at a time, and you should melt it with hot water if you plan to put it in a cold drink. Stevia also tastes a little . . . different. (Some describe it as tasting like licorice, but I never thought so). I suggest starting with the smallest amount and then upping the quantity until you find a level of sweetness that tastes good to you. Because of stomach problems, this is the only sweetener I use, and I like it very much. I highly recommend it.
