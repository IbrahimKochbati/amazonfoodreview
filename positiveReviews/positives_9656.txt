Bluebirds aren't the only birds that love these.  Nuthatches and Woodpeckers love these too.  I mix them with mealworms in a small bluebird feeder and my bluebirds stayed all year.  They even nested in one of my nest boxes(4 or 5 fledglings), which is NOT out in the open.  My lot is mostly wooded.  The parents  ing the young to the feeder as well.  I'm looking forward to having them again all winter too.
