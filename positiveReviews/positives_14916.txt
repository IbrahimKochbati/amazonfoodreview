i got my case today, boiled 3 eggs, a little red onion,some sweet midgies, 2 cans of taters and spices and i loved my tater salad!  i bought these mostly for that purpose since i am a potato salad fan.  this was much less work and the results actually taste better than if i had boiled them myself. it must be because as another lady stated   no spots or mushiness.  will keep these on s&s. also wanted to comment that i received them 4 days after ordering. ty amazon.
