I used the Shake N Bake Pork Pouch on 6 boneless pork cutlets. The product is very easy to use. I poured the contents into a Zip loc bag, placed the moistened cutlets in one at a time, sealed the bag, and shook. Put the cutlets on a cookie sheet and bake. So easy! It was a big hit with the family, everyone loved how tasty and moist their cutlets were. We will definitely use this again, and try out the chicken too.
