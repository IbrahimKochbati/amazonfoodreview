Both of my children are gluten intolerant and one with wheat allergy.  They never thought they would eat a sandwich or taste good pizza dough again until Pamela's.  They have tried many different  ead mixes and nothing compares to the quality and taste of Pamela's  ead mix.  Actually, if the product is labeled "Pamela's" it must be excellent.          Excited to see what Pamela creates next!     Thanks Pamela,     Sincerely,     The Campbells
