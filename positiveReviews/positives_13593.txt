I am so done purchasing ANY and ALL other fruit snacks for my 3 and 1 year old now that I have found Little Ducks ! I was given a bag from my friend Stephen in NC.  He told me that they were the BEST snack nutritionally and financially for my little babes.  I opened the bag and started sampling them myself.  I wanted to taste what I would be feeding my children.  Before I knew it,  I had eaten HALF the bag myself !!!  I got myself composed and feed them to my two little ones.  They both handled the tiny snacks into their mouths, and soon the bag was COMPLETELY  empty !  Let me just say,  WE love them.  So glad to see we can purchase them on line for easy and convenience.  They will remain a staple in my home.  We eat them straight out of the bag, put them on organic yogurt, and also mix them in our oatmeal and cream of wheat.  Great product for EVERYONE to enjoy!!
