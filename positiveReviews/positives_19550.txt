I got hooked on these delicious little Ouzo candies when they were selling them at my local World Market. Much to my dismay, they just suddenly disappeared off the shelves! I pouted for a little bit and then realized I might be able to find them online   and lo and behold: Amazon carries them. (Of course Amazon carries them, they carry everything!) So, now I'm still able to get my delicious little alcohol free ouzo fix :)
