This is the best GF  ead mix that I have ever tried.  We are also dairy free so we make it with 1 2 cup of soy milk.  It is great the way it is, although sometimes we add some cinnamon and raisens.  Each loaf lasts 3 full days.  We have frozen half loaves, and that works although the  ead is more dry than when it is fresh.  Highly recommend.
