Received these in March 2012 and the expiration date was August 2013, so I got nearly a year and a half recommended shelf life.          The chicken is good quality and is flavorful. Great for chicken tacos, burritos and chicken salad. Quick and easy, I rinse the contents.          There is nearly 50 grams (10 grams per serving and the serving size is 2 ounces) of protein in each can which is one reason for selecting this product. I keep a year supply of food on hand and these fit in nicely with my food storage and rotation efforts.          I also ordered the Tyson canned chicken and was very pleased to note the Tyson arrived at the same time and has a Fe uary 2015 recommended shelf life. I like both products and recommend both.
