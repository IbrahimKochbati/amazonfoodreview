I try every Asian salad dressing I can find.     This is my favorite one for salads because of it's delicate taste.     My other favorite is "Newman's Own, Low Fat Sesame Ginger".     The ginger in Newman's gives it a stronger flavor which is great     as a marinade or just sprinkle on rice and vege dishes.
