I learned about these from a co worker after he made a bulk purhcase of several kinds of beef sticks a year ago.  He spread them around and so I got to sample a variety: I've ordered the Honey Stung four times since then. Two other co workers have also ordered them on several occassions this past year and they're "believers" too.  Additionally, we've all ordered several of the Buffalo Bills  ands and they're all superb!  As long as you don't eat the whole bag, I'd also call these "Atkins friendly" as well, as that is also a motivator for me ordering these so many times (other than them being just being great, well seasoned snacks).  Buy 'em, you'll love 'em!
