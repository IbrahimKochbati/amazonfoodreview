I like this food for my dog. Avaoderm seems like a repudable company. Dogfoodadvisor is a good website to go to to find good information about all kibble and wet food. My dog likes this food, and did very well on it. Her coat was super soft and she had lots of energy. I just noticed during the summer months her urine burned the grass. After some reading on the subject I found that high fish and beef diets can increase the uric acid in dogs and cause burn spots on your grass. Once off the fish and beef soley foods the urin grass burns stopped.          Update: Avoderm just came out with a revolving grain free line of kibble. Turkey, Duck, and Trout. My dog is on the Turkey and loves it. She is allergic to Chicken. Even though this has chicken fat in it, it's the chicken protein she is allergic to and chicken fat does not contain the protein. I buy thick slices of fresh, low sodium turkey at the deli and top the food with peices of turkey and she eats everything. I could barely get her to eat once a day and now she is eating 2  3 times a day and seems to be enjoying it. So far Petsmart, and Webers is the only ones carrying it. I give the Turkey a 5 stars!!!
