These are an interesting and tasty alternative to microwave popcorn, well worth trying. The spicy version is not very spicy, but has a little kick. Be careful to even out the contents of the bag before microwaving and to make sure the bag rotates freely in microwaves with a turntable. Microwave time is short, about 90 seconds. They come out hot and fresh tasting. Pieces are relatively small, about an inch square. They have a less intense pork flavor than the best pork rinds, but having them hot helps compensate. Amazingly, pork rinds are becoming "diet food." They have no carbs, there is a lot of air in them that minimizes the calories for the volume, and relatively small quantities are satisfying. Anyway, it is a good story to go with a tasty snack.
