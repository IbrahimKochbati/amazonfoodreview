This ghee is the best available    the fat is high quality and the nutrients are powerful, due to the fact that the ghee is made from grass fed butter during the spring and fall season, when the cows are eating fast growing green grass. That last part is important    that means that this ghee has high amounts of K2 compared to other ghees. K2 is the great bone and teeth building nutrient; it helps the body deposit calcium appropriately. K2 cannot be gotten from green leafy vegetables    it can only be gotten from animal fats, organ meats, or some kinds of fermented vegetables.          Also, apparently this ghee has tested as high in K2 as the very expensive "butter oil" that I used to buy.          Finally, I've seen an improvement in my kids' teeth since I've been giving them several spoonfuls of ghee each day. We use it like a supplement.          Thank you for a high quality product!
