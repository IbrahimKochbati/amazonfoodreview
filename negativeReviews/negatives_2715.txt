I frequently buy Post Shredded Wheat, and decided to try this new cereal because it's made of whole grain wheat.  My teenage children had the same opinion about Caramel Delight that I did...they liked it as an occasional high fiber snack, but it's way too sweet as a cereal!  General Mills should reduce the sugar, and instead increase the insoluble fiber in this cereal. That would make it perfect!
