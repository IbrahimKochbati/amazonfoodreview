Remember?  Yeah, that stuff.  It's pretty good, right?  Well, it still is!          It's not the whole new cuisine  onze cut essence of marinated whatever blah blah blah    this is the same Shake 'N Bake that's been around for 40 years.  There's a reason why it's still around   it's good tasting and easy to make!  It's not the Flavor of the Month, it's the flavor of everyday life in that same wholesome way that it has always been.          It tastes like home, the dinner that mom made, that we ate before doing homework and watching Happy Days on TV.
