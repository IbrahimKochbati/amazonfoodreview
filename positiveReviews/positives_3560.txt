This product is very good but I have this feeling that it is rather highly priced. I don't know why gluten free products in general are very expensive when they are made from easily available ingredients.People with Gluten problem are not just "eating Healthy" but are sick and should not be exploited. I like the muffins particularly when they are toasted.
