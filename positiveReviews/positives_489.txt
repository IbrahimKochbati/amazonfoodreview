We've long enjoyed this  and of chip, so when we began to think seriously about limiting out salt intake we were particularly pleased to find these.            Granted I bought them somewhat reluctantly because I'm a confirmed salt aholic, generously sprinkling it on everything from eggs to green beans.  I was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to boot.            How nice to be able to munch on these without worrying about too much salt.
