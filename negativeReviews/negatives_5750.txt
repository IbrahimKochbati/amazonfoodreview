I HAD TO THROW  THE WHOLE BAG TO THE GARBAGE CAN. I TRIED AND I TRIED TO MAKE MY DOG EAT IT BUT HE REFUSED. I AM TRYING NOW THE NATURES VARIETY RAW FROZEN FOOD RABBIT  AND THANKS GOD HE LIKES IT. I ALSO FEED HIM RAW PORK  FROM THE SUPERMARKET. MY DOG LIKES FRESH RAW MEATS NOT DRY MEATS. HE ALSO EATS FRESH VEGETABLES LIKE TOMATOES, BROCCOLI, GREEN BELL PEPPER ETC.
