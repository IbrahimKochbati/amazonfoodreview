First off, I hadn't had Shake n' Bake since I was a kid and it was always kind of fun to help in the kitchen when "help" meant shaking a bag of meat and  ead crumbs like a wrapped package at Christmas.          It was really very easy to make and a quick process.  Preheat the oven, shake shake shake, stick them in to bake and while it's baking see if I can get the side dishes fixed before it's ready to come back out of the oven.  Mashed potatoes, green beans, salad, applesauce etc. all go great with the  eaded pork chops.  It's a quick and easy way to get a healthy mid week meal that everybody wants to eat.
