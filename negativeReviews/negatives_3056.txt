I love dark roast, strong and robust coffees and thought this was a good choice based on the reviews.  Upon opening the bag, the aroma was pungent and acidic, and the beans appeared over roasted and had an oily appearance.  When I made the first batch my wife observed that the aroma was off putting, nowhere near the pleasant character some reviewers raved about.  The taste was simply awful   way over roasted, with an unpleasant harshness that reminded me of burned Chickory or an over strong Sumatran rather than a quality African coffee.  We finally decided to blend this 50 50 with a medium roast Colombian and that toned it down enough to restore some drinkability.  Most disappointing because I believe the reviewers who loved it likely got a good batch   we most certainly did not...
