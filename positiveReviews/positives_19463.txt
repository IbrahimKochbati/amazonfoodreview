The flavor of these nuts is similar to cinnamon toast cereal, yet they are filling and healthy, containing little sugar and almost no salt. I would deduct a star for being priced too high both here and in the supermarket, but Blue Diamond deserves credit for their restraint in using quality ingredients and in not producing a sugar encrusted candy. Now if they would only go against the trend of charging a huge markup for minimal extra processing cost...          The other reviewer seems to think these contain lactose. The ingredients:     ALMONDS, EVAPORATED CANE JUICE, BROWN SUGAR, CORN MALTODEXTRIN, CINNAMON, NATURAL FLAVORS AND SALT. PEANUT FREE. MAY CONTAIN OTHER TREE NUTS. Unless OTHER TREE NUTS comes from cows, I don't think this is true.
