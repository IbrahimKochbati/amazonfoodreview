I bought this as a cheaper alternative to New Tca Interactive Plastic Dog Toy Tornado Helps Prevent Boredom With Different Puzzles ... sometimes the off  and toys are great, not in this case. The problem with this toy's setup is that all of the compartments are available at the same time. Two quick turns and the toy is completely empty. The "game" lasts for under 5 seconds for my "special" dog. To add further insult, its poorly made.          I threw it away.
