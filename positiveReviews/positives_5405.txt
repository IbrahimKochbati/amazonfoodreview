It is just like a k cup...no ground left in the bottom of my coffee.  Makes a strong, hot cup of Joe.  The cup melts to the shape of your coffee maker.  It works wonderfully, but when i did the math for saving a few bucks...the whole reason i went looking for an alternative...it is just about the same as buying the prepackaged cups (i try to buy the K cups around $28), except you can choose your own coffee and YOU have to measure it out.  Now i have not used all 50 cups yet so i will see if some of my coffee is left over and then it might be a little cheaper. The  eakdown... $18 dollars for the disposable cups (shipping included), and $10 for my favorite coffee + time to fill the cups + environmentally wasteful   We need a better solution.  The reusable filters received mixed reviews, but i might give it a shot.
