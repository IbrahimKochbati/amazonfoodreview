I had seen Nutella in the States growing up but didn't really become a heavy user until I lived in Europe for a year. This stuff is amazing   it's super chocolatey with a hint of hazelnut that gives it a really full bodied, mature flavor. I usually put it on bagels or English muffins as a quick, satisfying dessert. It's also great for baking (Nutella  ownies are awesome!)          In terms of nutrition, the calories per tablespoon of Nutella is pretty close to the American sandwich staple, peanut butter. Nutella doesn't have quite as much protein as peanut butter but it also doesn't have as much fat or sodium, so there's a trade off.          All in all I LOVE this spread and I always have a big jar in my pantry.
