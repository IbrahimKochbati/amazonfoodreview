This popcorn is delicious!  You know how some popcorn can be tasteless, sort of like styrofoam?  This popcorn has a really nice "corn" taste and seems to have less hulls.  It is the only popcorn I have been able to eat while having  aces on my teeth.  It is not easy to find in the stores, so being able to purchase this on Amazon is nice.
