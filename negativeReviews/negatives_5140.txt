My pup and I really enjoyed this in the beginning.  She very quickly learned how to hold the rope with one paw and tip the bottle with the other to get food out.  We were starting to learn some other things (adding balls inside to change how the food fell out, etc).  Screwing the cap on was always difficult, with it needing to be lined up exactly right.  Soon, however, the threads  oke off the bottle so that we could no longer screw the "cap" on.  Now it is useless.
