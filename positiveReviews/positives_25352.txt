I have two beautiful large rescue dogs, Heidi Sue, two and Loosey Bell, 13 that love the Chews.  All I have to do is say chew chew and the jumping and barking starts. Heidi finishes hers first and starts barking at Loosey to try to steal her chew.  It is quite a show and amazing such a treat can cause so much fun.  It is such a great product and is recommended by my vet. I only wish the price was lower as it is expensive and not always in my budget. I am glad that Amazon offers several places to buy the treats so I can compare prices. Thank you
