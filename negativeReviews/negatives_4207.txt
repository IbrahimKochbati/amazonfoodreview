Ordered this because I've enjoyed Japanese style curry when I can find it, and used Golden Curry in the past to make it at home.  Never found the mild variety here, so I ordered this along with the medium hot (which I haven't tried yet).  The mild is hardly even a curry in terms of flavor, it's more like an extremely thick sort of gravy.  It's not bad by any measure, but it's hardly worth picking up if you're a fan of Japanese curry.  Go for something with higher heat, unless you've got kids around with sensitive taste buds or something like that.
