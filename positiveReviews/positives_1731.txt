This product is indeed fabulous and you can get it at many grocery stores for a lesser price.  Overall a great product and makes awesome red sauce!  TO SQUISM:  I find it very disturbing that you casually refer to hitting your wife, even if you are joking, this is not the place for that sort of behavior!!!!  If you really hit your wife your a punk coward.  Domestic abuse IS NOT a laughing matter and I was personally offended by your review.  Try to maintain some amount of class when posting on here.  I am sure that is something you are incapable of doing, judging by your disgusting and classless review.
