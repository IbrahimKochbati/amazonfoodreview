I can't really speak to the Detox effectiveness but this is the first herbal tea I've ever really liked the taste of.  I make one cup of tea, add a little packet of stevia then put it in a 32 oz jug of water and chill.  Even diluted that much it still has a nice flavor to me.  I love my Starbucks Iced Venti Soy Chai Tea but my waistline doesn't.  So between this and General Foods International Chai Latte (Sugar Free) I'm staying clear of Starbucks.
