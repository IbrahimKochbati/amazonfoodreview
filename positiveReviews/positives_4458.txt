I got the wonderful vanilla beans about a month ago. The first thing I did was to make vanilla sugar. Then I put 10 split beans in 3 4 cup mix of rum and  andy. I shake it every other day. Smells wonderful so far.  I'm going to split a few beans to put on my stevia  which I use every day.  I also sent a pack of Madascar Bourbon vanilla beans to my 78 year old big sister but she "freaked " out.  "What will I do with these?".     So far I find these vanilla beans luxuriously wonderful. Smelly, soft and tasty if you just take a tiny bite in your morning coffee.
