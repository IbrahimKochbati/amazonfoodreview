Very Good product. Made an excellent cup of tea, Strong and Tanic, reflecting it's Vit. C content. The picture doesn't do the bag Justice as it has a zip lock feature. It will take some time to drink all of this one bag and I purchased 4 different varieties. The zip lock bag would do well if I were were drinking from only one. I vacuum packed 3 4 of each and stored them in the freezer. The partial bags are in the fridge ready to use. I'm looking forward to drinking these fine organic teas for some time to come and save big $s as well.
