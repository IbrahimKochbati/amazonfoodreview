I've always been a fan of grape soda, but I never drank it that much compared to the colas.  Mostly because my favorite was "Nehi Grape" and it was super difficult to find.  Harder to find than TAB, even.  Fast forward maybe 15 years, Zevia comes out with Zevia Grape and it's awesome.          It has a very similar flavor to Nehi Grape, but with stevia instead.  It's a little on the sweet side, but not hypersweet or bitter like some of their other flavors (mountain zevia and grapefruit citrus ginger ale, respectively).  This is a by far my favorite zevia flavor in their lineup of sodas; and it's close to perfect.          One final note: I want to say is that this is a fakegrape flavor, and although it is pleasant, it resembles nothing to grape juice whatsoever.
