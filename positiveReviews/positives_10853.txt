I have 3 large dogs, 2 lab golden retriever mixes and 1 golden retriever, and they all loved these.  One is a little pickier than the others, and was slower to take it from my hand but once she had her first one, she didn't hesitate again.  I like these because they are healthier for my dogs, and also because they took longer to chew than an average dog biscuit.  This is a quality product, healthy for my dogs, yet obviously with ingredients that dogs love.  I also like that bit of extra chewing time they take.  I'm glad we got to try them   I will definitely be buying these again.
