My dog used to LOVE these.  I thought I was was giving him a great "treat", that was actually a supplement to improve his arthritis symptoms.  Then, his liver enzymes were elevated, and he was becoming less active, and always thirsty.  Thank goodness a friend sent me a link about the FDA warnings, 2 3 since, 2009!     Hundreds of dogs have died,very painful and expensive deaths.  If you love your dog go to the FDA  website yourself...and Do Not BUY these "treats"!
