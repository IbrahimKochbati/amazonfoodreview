Given this blend's orgin, the name "English" Breakfast is a bit of a misnomer, because it was a Scotsman   a 19th century Edinburgh tea master named Drysdale   who first marketed his particular blend under the name " eakfast tea." It proved so popular, however, that it was soon copied by tea houses all over Britain, many of which then added the word "English," which has been part of its name ever since.          English Breakfast can contain black teas from a variety of origins, among them India, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Malawi and China. Stronger than most other teas, the blend is made to match the traditionally heavy English  eakfast, which to this day often includes pork, sausages and eggs, and for this reason English Breakfast tea also maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk. It is certainly less refined than Darjeeling or even Earl Grey, but hard to beat as an everyday "work horse," and as good or better an early morning pick me up as any kind of coffee.
