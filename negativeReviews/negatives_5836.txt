I have enjoyed creme  ulee on many occasions and thought that this coffee would provide a hint of that delicious dessert.  It has a strange and unpleasant aftertaste.  If, after tasting this coffee, someone offered me a menu featuring Creme Brulee for dessert, I would avoid it at all costs.  There is no flavor in this coffee that bears any resemblance to Creme Brulee.
