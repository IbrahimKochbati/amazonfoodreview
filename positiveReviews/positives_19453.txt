To me, they are just okay.  To my 8 year old who has a life threatening allergy to nuts and can't have bars with tree nuts or made on shared equipment with tree nuts, he thinks they are great.  He actually likes them and that's what matters.  He can have peanut butter (legumes) but all the bars are made on shared equipment with tree nuts!  So Enjoy Life is our pricey  and of choice for convenience snacks and granola.  They should make a pumpkin seed bar or mix the two.  And up the protein for a protein snack bar since that's what the kids who can't have the nut bars need.
