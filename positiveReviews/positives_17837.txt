I've never given my dogs real pig ears, so I don't know how tough they are, but I assume they are like rawhide.     Instead of gnawing on Better than Ears for a long time, they eat them pretty fast.     Not a problem, just not what I expected.     Man, do they go crazy over these things. But then again...who can resist bacon flavor?
