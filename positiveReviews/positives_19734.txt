This is a pretty good snack food.  I don't miss meat, but i do miss the seasonings put on it.  This is very tasty and has a nice texture.  A packet is 4 servings, and 100 calories per serving, pretty much equal protein and carbs, so it's a high protein food for most people.          Problems: the inner packaging isn't that easy to deal with, a knife is needed to cut it open.  So not a great on the go food.  Also, there is not a lot of volume for the 400 calories, so it's not a good food if you are watching your weight.
