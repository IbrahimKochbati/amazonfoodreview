Believe that it is not right to sell a package of 7 boxes of McVitie's Digestive Biscuits less than a month before they were scheduled to expire on April 2011.  If I had known you were going to do that I would not have bought them.     Please do inform your customers the expiration date when you advertisement on your website.
