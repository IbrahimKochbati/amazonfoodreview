I have never bought this cereal from Amazon and highly doubt that I'd ever will for the price that they are asking. However, the cereal is really awesome. I love how many different foods they have in here and yet it still works! It is really fun to eat; wondering what I'll get in the next serving batch. The fact that it is healthy makes me love it even more.
