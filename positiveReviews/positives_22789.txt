I first found Minor's bases at BJ's and quickly decided to chuck buying canned chicken  oth and beef  oth and boullion cubes. It's cheaper than canned, too, if you can find a local source. In using these to make recipes, I add the appropriate amount of base for the amount of water or liquid called for and do not add any salt called for by the recipe until the very end, when it can be added to taste.  I note the amont of salt added and record it for future use.  This is especially applicable in recipes calling for boullion cubes (horribly salty usually).  Of late, in talking with restaurant owners,I learned Minor bases a what many restaurants use.  The base keeps in the refridgerator seemingly forever.  Search the internet for sources or, better yet, ask your local restaurants if they use it and where they get their supplies locally.
