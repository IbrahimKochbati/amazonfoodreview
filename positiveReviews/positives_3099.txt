I usually find the citrus sodas too tart acidic for my tastes, and I find the black cherry Fresca too cloyingly sweet. I LOVE the peach; it's so crisp and refreshing without being acidic, and is just the right sweet for me. Other than ginger ale, it's my favorite "white" soda. I have been having trouble finding this in the grocery, and really hope it hasn't been discontinued.
