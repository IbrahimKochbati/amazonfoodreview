I like the mint, but the only reason I have bought these mint are because I like the tin. The tins are very nice. There are a lot of project I can build using these candy tins. The mint is not bad either, very freshing.          They sell these mint for $2.50 tin here in San Francisco, so 12 tins will cost me $30, and I saved about 10 dollars to get it here.
