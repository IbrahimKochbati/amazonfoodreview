Sure, I could have gone on a food crusade at the local grocery to find a similar product. But I don't think I would have found a product as good and tasty as Dr. McDougall. The noodles are quick and easy to prepare and above all else tasty enough to satisfy my appetite. I was surprised that there were enough peanuts in every bite just like at a Thai food restaurant. Overall, I'm pleased with my order and the quality of the product.
