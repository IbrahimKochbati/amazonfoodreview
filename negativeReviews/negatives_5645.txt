I normally love Popchips.  I couldn't find them in the local stores so I ordered them here.  The flavor doesn't seem as good... they are a little more  owned,thinner and seemed more crispy in a harder sort of way.  I don't know if the batch was off or if they have changed how they make them.  I was disappointed.
