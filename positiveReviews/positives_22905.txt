I do not have much experience with Bigelow outside of their Earl Grey (of which I generally choose Twinings), but I do love their Plantation Mint. I general keep at least half a box of it around at all times, because it is a wonderfully flavored tea that my friends enjoy and it is something they will drink no matter what particular blend I might be  ewing for myself.          With a little bit of honey, it makes a nice medium bodied tea for a cold night whose mint helps to open the sinuses and the soothe the throat. Cooled with ice in a tea glass, it is an extra refreshing drink that fits right in on a summer day. It is this versatality that demonstrates how well this blend is balanced. It tends to stay away from bitterness even on over steeping, so it is easier to adjust to a strength you like without having to resort to milk to round the edges.          And, to better justify buying it the "Amazon six pack", it has a good long shelf life and it keeps its flavor strong for a couple of years.
