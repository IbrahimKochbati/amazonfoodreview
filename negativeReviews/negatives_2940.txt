I purchased this coffee on sale at my local Vons. They had it on sale for $4.99 a bag so I bought four bags    can't beat that price, right? I figured, how bad could it be?          It is beyond bad. First, if this is "French Roast" coffee than I'm Angelina Jolie. There is not on identifiably French Roast aspect about it. The taste is nothing short of horrid. I tried making a pot with more coffee and one with less coffee. Nothing worked    it's just awful.          I am taking back the three unopened bags as this is just undrinkable. I threw the open bag away.          This is how bad it is: I have a can of Folger's in my pantry for those emergency mornings when you wake up and learn you're out of coffee. I poured out the Gevalia and made a pot of Folgers and it was better than the Gevalia. Since Folger's is barely drinkable, imagine how horrid Gevalia is.          Save your money. It's not even worth buying when it's on sale.
