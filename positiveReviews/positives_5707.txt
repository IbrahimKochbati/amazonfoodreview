We have always loved this snack.  Each time we seem to enjoy it a little bit more.  My daughter is a huge fan of it and is so glad that we can grab it and go.  It's a nutritious snack that satisfies all the tastebuds.  Some of us have even tried the slightly spicy  and.  Having both flavors allows us to satisfy those who like spicy and those who don't with the same snack...thus no arguments between the kids!
