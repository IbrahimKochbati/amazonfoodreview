I first had the opportunity of having this tea about 13 years ago.  The blend used for this tea is very smooth.  I have tried several other chai green tea  ands, but none can compare to Yogi Tea.  I have allowed several friends, and co workers to sample this tea, and all are hooked on it.  I have also tried the redbush chai, and black chai teas from Yogi Tea, all were very good but the taste of the chai green is superb by far.  Follow the directions, allowing the tea to steep, to get the full effect, you won't be disappointed.  I usually use white sugar only as a sweentener, but have also used Equal sweetener.  Thank you Yogi Tea for a wonderful tea.
