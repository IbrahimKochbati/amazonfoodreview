I eat steel cut oatmeal almost every morning and I was so happy to discover this sweetener.  Just the right amount of maple flavor and not too sweet.  I'd much rather use agave than something artificial or pre sweetened.  I'm sure it would also be delicious on pancakes or maybe even ice cream!  YUM!
