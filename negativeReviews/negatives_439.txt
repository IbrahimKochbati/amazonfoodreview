My husband just bought a Keurig coffe maker. In the box was samples, his favorite was Donut Shop. I ordered the 35 K Cup for him. I was so disappointed, out of the 35 k cups 11 were decaf, giving me 6 k cups of each of the 4 flavors.     I also ordered the Wolfgang Puck sampler, I got 12 flavors 4 each. How cool is that!     I would order Donut Shop again, just not the sampler.
