Hello, just want to let you know the smoke point is 350F for this oil. Hope you folks haven't been cooking at a temperature beyond that, you could be eating bad oil. REFINED avocado oil is up to 520F, but this is NOT fully refined (which makes a better product in terms of retaining nutrients and flavors). The 350F is clearly stated on the manufacturer's website, and also their response to an email inquiry I sent.          "The smoke point of REFINED Avocado oil is in fact the highest of any     vegetable oil at around 520. Our oil is not fully refined, and in so being     retains the wonderful flavor and aroma of Avocados. The smoke point for our     oil is as stated 350 because it has more avocado solids in it, that's why it     tastes so good. Fully refined oils are  odorized and less flavorful.     Hope this helps.     Thank you for your support of La Tourangelle."          That means there are a lot of retailers out there providing the wrong information on this. If you want a high smoke point, make sure it is REFINED avocado oil. For its purposes, this is still a great oil to use.
