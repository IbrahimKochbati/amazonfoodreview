We've been buying the Country Cut beef jerky for almost 2 years.  It's definitely the most moist(and tender on your teeth) of the variations they offer IMO.  As for this, if you are one of those people who love Asian inspired "hot" foods and have no problems with a searing burn in your mouth, the Chipotle Habanero is right up your alley.  If you are one of those people who can drink hot sauce(like Louisiana Hot Sauce) like nothing but want something more spicier, then Spicy is more at your level.  They are not kidding when they call this one Habanero.  It's delicious but HOT!  Be forewarned :P
