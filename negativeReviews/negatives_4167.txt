I bought this product because I thought it might make a good backpacking food and not because it is low in fat calories. I really wanted to like this product but, I do not like the taste or the fact that there is added sugar. A lot of people seem to like the taste though so, I am not unhappy I gave it a try. I will keep it and try using it as a flavoring in cooking.
