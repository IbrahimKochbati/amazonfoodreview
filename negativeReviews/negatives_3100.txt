Before I start, I will openly admit that I love a good cup of coffee and over the years have become a bit of a coffee snob with my tastes.  I don't like any flavored coffees, iced coffees, or even much of the frilly expressos and cappaccinos.  I simply like a great cup of coffee.          I liked the Melitta coffee okay but I'm truthfully not convinced it is worth its price.  Don't get me wrong, I consumed the whole bag; I am just unsure it is something I will purchase again.  It had the nice, strong taste of shade grown coffee beans which I liked but I wouldn't say I loved.  I'm not sure it is any better than some of the specialties you can purchase in your local grocery (I'm not talking Folgers and Maxwell House here, but the other shade grown coffees).          If this product comes up in a good sale, I might be tempted to purchase it for a special occasion but otherwise, I probably won't be buying again.
