My Cat Loved it so I did give it 4 stars for quality and taste.     My one problem with it, and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is that Petite Cuisine is made in Thailand. I didn't notice the label when I got this at first.     I'm going on a green kick lately and it seems to be a shame that     you can make this product in another country, ship it here and the company can save money with all that overhead. I wish it was made in the U.S.A.     Part of going green is buying locally.
