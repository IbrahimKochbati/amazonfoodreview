This popcorn is not the same as movie theater popcorn. If you have ever been to target and tried the popcorn that they sell at the little target snack bar it the same as that but ten times saltier. I recommend only outing half of the packet of salt. I am the tips of guy that eats super salty popcorn but this was way to much. Instead of buying this you should buy coconut oil, and kernals from the store, it ends up to be cheaper and tast allot more like movie theater popcorn
