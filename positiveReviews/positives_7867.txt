I found microwave pork rinds quite by accident. But ever since, they are something I have wanted. Now I found them on Amazon, and I couldn't be happier.      It's a quick, easily prepared snack, and as other reviewers have pointed out, not bad for your diet.      Once they come put of the microwave, open the bag, pour them out, and marvel as you hear them still popping and crackling in the bowl. I may never go back to bagged pork rinds ever again
