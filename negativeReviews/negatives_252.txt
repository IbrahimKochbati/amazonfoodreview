The Uncle Ray's BBQ Potato Chips are comparable to Lays or most commonly available chips in local markets.  The BBQ spice ia a bit too much; the one pound bags consisted of about half  oken chips.  I won't think about buying these again, even with the discounted price and will pay a bit more for a much better kettle fried potato chip.
