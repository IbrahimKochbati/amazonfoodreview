I did lots of research in my quest to find reasonably priced, 100% maple syrup.  I settled on Coombs Family Farms Grade B, and we have been so pleased with it!  I have two children under the age of three, and they love the rich and savory flavor as much as we do.  It has been a big hit at our house!  After trying this maple syrup, I'll never buy anything less than 100%.  We like this  and a lot, but the price was good and we were able to get the 15% discount in addition.  If they continue to offer it, we would buy from them again.
