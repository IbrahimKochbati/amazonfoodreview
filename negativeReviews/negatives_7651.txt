The cookies are soft but very dry and tasted nothing like an oatmeal cookie. It reminded me more of a Keebler Soft n Chewy cookie, with a few almond bits tossed in.  If the bits of almonds and chocolate were bigger I think my kids would of liked these cookies. They all passed on having a second cookie. These won't be making it into the lunchboxes this year.
