I'm going to have to go against everyone else's reviews here so far, because I found this rice to be both dry and very bland. It's certainly not delicious, and I was extremely disappointed, particularly because I bought it on the strength of the other reviews here.          For those curious, I made this in my Zojirushi (made in Japan) rice cooker, which makes perfect rice every time.          On the plus side, it certainly is healthy, and other people seem to like it, but I didn't at all.
