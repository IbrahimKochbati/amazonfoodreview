I have to agree with many of the posters below. Earl Grey is my favorite tea and I have tried every  and I have ever come across. I was completely floored by how good this tea is. It is absolutely the best Earl Grey I've ever had and that includes some pricey gourmet blends. And what a bargain: 3 tins for less than $20! Don't waste your time with anything else.
