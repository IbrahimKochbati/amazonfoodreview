BEEN TRYING EVERY COFFEE BRAND AND FLAVOR FOR OVER A YEAR NOW AND THIS IS IT.  I JUST LOVE THIS COFFEE.  YOU SHOULD TRY A SMALL BOX AND SEE IF YOU AGREE.  EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT TASTE FOR COFFEE SO YOU MAY NOT LIKE IT, BUT WORTH A TRY.  I ALWAYS SAY IF YOU DON'T BUY A LOTTO TICKET YOU WILL NEVER WIN.
