I love York Peppermint Patties like you wouldn't believe, and in fact this is perhaps the only mint flavored *anything* I actually enjoy (except for Wrigley's peppermint gum).  However, once you bite into one, the taste of mint will inadvertently satisfy your tastebuds so you won't feel like eating anything else.  In this sense, you can't literally MUNCH on a bag of these because sooner rather than later your tastebuds will say "Okay, no more mint please!"  The only way to eat a York Peppermint Patty is right after supper for dessert.  Perhaps this makes York Peppermint Patties the ultimate dessert since you won't get the urge to stuff down too many at once and make yourself sick.
