My bloodhound mix loves, loves, loves this toy. She walks around carrying it from the rope until she can settle into her favorite corner to "go to work". The only problem is that we live in an apartment building with hardwood floors.  The hard plastic hitting the floor is definitely LOUD and our dog likes to throw it up the air for added effect, which creates an even louder THUD.  I would definitely recommend this toy but if you have neighbors downstairs, they might hate you.
