I was really worried when I ordered this that the phantom power would make it overheat, apparently I was worried for nothing! I use this paired with a Blue Yeti Pro, a seriously beefy microphone, running over shielded cable that is about eighty feet away, It's absolutely great!          The one downside that I have seen from this piece of kit: It will occasionally not register as a USB device, Granted I only have seen it happen once, but you will always want to double check your connections!
