The Crunchmaster  and is definitely my favorite  and of gluten free crackers. Previously, I had only tried the white cheddar and regular multi grain so I was excited about a variety pack. My favorites were the white cheddar and garden vegetable (these two are square in shape and less grainy). The other flavors (rosemary & olive oil, roasted garlic and toasted onion) were octagonal shape and have a nuttier consistency. I liked all of them though the octagonal shaped flavors were best with toppings, while the squares were better on their own.
