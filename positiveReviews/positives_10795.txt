These definitely work as treats, since my dog is very excited to get one.          However, even though they are scored to  eak easily, they only  eak once, and half of one of these is still too big for a small treat for my 18 lb dog.  Half is about twice the size (or more) of several other  ands of treats I have around, so I think these may be extra big.  Might be great for big dogs who can barely taste regular sized treats!          My other complaint is that the name of the product should be "Barley and Lamb" dog treats, since the first two ingredients are in that order.  Otherwise, though, the ingredients are pronounceable and look very healthy and I feel good about this dog treat....as long as I want to give her a BIG treat!
