My dogs really love this food. Found for a very cheap price to try at around $11 for a case of 24 cans, but prices have more than doubled now. First time I served this to my dogs, my cat got in their bowl and started eating. This is the first time the cat has ever eaten the dog food! Went by again, but much too expensive for the small cans. cans are only 5.5 ounces and I have to feed each of my dogs touch cans for one meal.  Wish they would make this in 13 ounce cans and lower the price.
