Twinings blend of Ceylon and Indian tea produces that more traditional hearty aroma and pungent flavor. In non tea terms that means that it has the ideal combination of  iskness,  ightness, strength and flavor. Normally I wouldn't attribute these things to a canned tea that has been processed and sat in warehouses, trucks, and stores for long periods of time. Yet Twinings seems to hold up well. I love tea, would drink 24 7 if possible, and more often than not there are only three  ands that sit on my shelf in any consistent manner and Twinings is definetly one of them.
