This Pecan Pie really made an international journey. My son has been living in China for the past year and was really lonely for some good old fashion American food for the holidays. Pecan Pie is one of the favorites. We saw this boxed pie and couldn't pass it up! But we were surprised to learn how few ovens there are in China. Most of the food is steamed and fried. The lack of an oven was disappointing and we didn't hear much more until my son told me he had found some friends who had an American style oven and he had cooked the pie for them! It was really a huge hit. I notice this company makes other pies and I think I will send other over. I strongly suggest this 'pie in a box' for anyone who wants to give a special treat!
