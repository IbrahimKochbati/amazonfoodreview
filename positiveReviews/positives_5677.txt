Pink Lemonade is one of my all time favorite drinks, so when I saw Pilsbury had this beautifully pink "Pink Lemonade" frosting, I had to get it. I paired it with their "Pink Lemonade" cake mix.          I think I died and went to pink lemonade heaven! Actual lemon flavoring gives this just a hint of tartness, while the sweetness drives you mad! The gorgeous pink color says "Easter" and "Spring"!          Perfect for dessert for the family, or the ladies tea.          I highly recommend this yummy frosting! [Try it with the cake mix too!]
