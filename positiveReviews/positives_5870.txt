i get horrible gas, stomach pain and loose stools if I drink a glass of cow milk or eat in cereal. I have tried lactase pills and special milk with no results.           I use this instead and have none of those symptoms.  Measure into your mixing bowl, cup, pitcher, etc. and SLOWLY mix in HOT water. As soon as it's paste, you can add cold water.  Doing it this way prevents clumping.          I like it and add JUST A TOUCH of sugar or other sweetner & kids can't tell the difference between this and cow milk.  I use 1 TBS of unsulphured, blackstrap molasses per 16oz milk. It turns the milk light  own (think iced coffee) but my family doesn't mind. We like the way it tastes and appreciate the extra iron, calcium and potassium from the molasses (has to be unsulphured, blackstrap). This type has only 11g carbs per TBSP. I use slighty less powder than recommended (3 scoops for 16oz instead of the recommended 4). This helps to weaken the goat flavor.
