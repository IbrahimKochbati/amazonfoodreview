I have bought greenies for my dog for 7 years (since she was a puppy). She has always had digestive problems, but we didn't know why. While googling greenies a couple of weeks ago, I found that several dogs have died because they were not able to digest greenies. Please do some research before buying this product again. It could save your dog's life. Since switching to another dog treat, my dog has not had any problems (although it has only been two weeks).
