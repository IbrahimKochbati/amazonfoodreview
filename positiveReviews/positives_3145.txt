I was somewhat skeptical about purchasing any XLR to USB adaptor, but I have to say...this thing works great! The recordings are crisp and clear, just as good as recording on my camcorder in PCM! Now, I can record directly to my PC without the need of Mini DV tapes and capturing the audio to the computer! The unit is a bit cheap feeling (weight wise) but don't let that fool you one bit!          It's true plug and play too! No need for any additional drivers software...simply plug everything together and you're off and running! Overall, it's a great product! I highly recommend this for anyone who does any amount of voice recording!
