Okay, it's just oatmeal. Actually, it's more than that. Firstly, Quaker is a maker of quality products and has been known for quality for generations. Secondly, oatmeal is a very heart healthy food that can help reduce cholesterol. Thirdly, for all its benefits, it is a very inexpensive choice for a healthy  eakfast (or midnight snack!).          I like oatmeal and have since childhood. This product (in delicious maple,  own sugar flavor) tastes good and, unlike many of the generic products, you can taste the maple as well as the  own sugar. The flavorings are well distributed throughout the product and every bite provides good taste as well as nutrition.          This is a quality product at a good price. What's not to like?
