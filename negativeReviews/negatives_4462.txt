I fed and recommended this food for several years as one of the best dry foods available. However, over the last few months (late 2007) something has changed.  My dogs experienced chronic digestive upset on the food and refused to eat it.  Upon switching to another quality food, the problems stopped.  I tried another bag last week   same results.  Other dog owners  eeders vets handlers have also reported problems with Canidae foods over the past few months.  No one, including myself, has been successful in getting any sort of satisfactory reply from Canidae when asked if they had changed formulas, ingredient suppliers, etc. I'm disappointed   Canidae was one of the few 'quality foods' that had not raised prices significantly over the past year and was still affordable for most dog owners.  Apparently that has also led to changes that the company has not been willing to address.  I'm very disappointed that a food I recommended so highly in the past has had these problems.  I've changed my dogs to Eagle Pack Holistic Selects. It's more expensive, but they are back to their old selves   healthy, no digestive troubles, and great coats.
