I really like this tea.  I have been drinking bigelow Eggnoggin but find this tea to have more flavor, not as light as the eggnogg one.  I also get more of a kick from the caffeine in this tea.  All in all, I subscribed to it for every 6 months, what a great way to buy groceries this is, cheaper than in the store and THEY pay the shipping.  Highly recommend subscription.
