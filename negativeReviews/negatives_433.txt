Sea salt is more easily administered with a salt mill. This is just a salt shaker that delivers uncontrollable amounts of sea salt and anti caking agent into your food, and no iodide. The anti caking agent isn't event that effective, so the salt either comes out in clumps or gets stuck at the exit. Stay away!
