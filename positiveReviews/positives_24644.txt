I use a lot of pumpkin.  I especially enjoy it mixed in my morning oatmeal and my little dog considers it a real treat.          I was leery of purchasing this product because of the some of the negative reviews so after opening my first can of Farmer's Market Organic Canned Pumpkin, I felt obliged to do a review.          I am so glad that I ignored the negative reviews.  I happened to have a can of Libby's pumpkin puree (my usual  and) already open so it was easy to do a comparison.  The Farmer's Market pumpkin seemed a little creamier and the color was very similar but perhaps just a shade less  ight.  To my palate, it seemed to have a slightly earthier taste, more like sweet potato but when I added cinnamon and sweetener, it was impossible to detect a difference.          None of the cans were dented and the expiration date of October 2013 is almost three years in the future.  I am very happy with this purchase and delighted that it is offered on subscribe and save since pumpkin puree is not something all grocery stores routinely stock in the off season.
