The shipping was very prompt and the packaging excellent.  All other items in this order were excellent.  These were lollipops shaped and "painted" like flamingos.  But you have to hold them up close to the eye to figure out what they are!  They'll be "OK" to set out on the candy buffet, but they won't be the eye catching item we'd anticipated when we ordered.
