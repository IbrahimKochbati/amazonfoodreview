OK, I can't stand these things, but my babies love them, so I gave it 2 stars, not one. First of all, it's just puffed corn, like Peanut Puffs, if you've had those by Envirokids. And that wouldn't be so bad if they didn't taste like you were licking a cinnamon stick or putting a teaspoon of ground spice in  your mouth. For being "all natural" it sure does pack an unpleasant wallop! Watch out! Maybe the Honey Nut is better...
