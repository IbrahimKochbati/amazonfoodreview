So I thought thinkthin creamy peanut butter was my favoooorite (but) white chocolate chip has won my heart. I love having one of these when I'm in a rush with a tall glass of unsweetened almond milk ..mmm. They are super good and contain 20 grams of PROTEIN! I love them :). Never have I ordered them from amazon I pick mine up at whole foods HEB  or kroger. Try them!
