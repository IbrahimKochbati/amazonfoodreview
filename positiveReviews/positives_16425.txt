I've been giving these dental chews to my chihuahua mix daily when I leave for work in the morning. She absolutely loves them and looks forward to them. Before I started giving these to her, she would cry when I was leaving, but now she actually gets excited. They don't last too long, but they last long enough for me to leave without her noticing. And these big boxes last for months.
