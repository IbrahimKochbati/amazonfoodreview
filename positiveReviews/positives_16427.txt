I have been feeding Greenies to my 9 year old Schipperke since she was old enough to eat them.  She loves them, her teeth are exceptionally clean which I attribute to having fed these to her all of these years.  My Boy Schipperke is now 6 and I have feed them to him also.  My Vet remarks every time I take them for appointments how clean their teeth are.  I also  ush their teeth most nights so a combined effort and my dogs teeth have never needed to be cleaned which has saved their little bodies from the trauma of anesthesia. Feed the right size and ALWAYS watch your animal with any treat.
