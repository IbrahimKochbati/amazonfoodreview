I have  a Keurig coffee maker and have tried lots of K cups and different  ands and roasts of coffee but the Natucket Blend is my FAVORITE.  The Nantucket blend is a smooth and rich coffee that is not too strong or too weak.  Anyone who owns a Keurig should try the Natucket Blend by Green Mountain.  They will realize it is the best!  The price is great on Amazon too!
