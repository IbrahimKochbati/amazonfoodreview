   class "tiny"  Length:: 0:19 Mins              It took my dog no more than 4 hours to destroy this.  First off there are two types of rope that this product can come with   we've seen a cotton rope or a rubber one.  Ours came with the rubber one (as shown in the x small and small size on amazon).     First, my dog took to chewing the jug.  She saw the treats and would hit at the jug.  She also chewed on the grip and bone.  In addition to being loud as others complain, she just kept tripping over it.  She's a clumsy dog, but every couple of minutes it would roll behind her and as the jug is really bulky, kind of knock into her.  Also, the rubber rope didn't stand up to her chewing AT ALL.  In addition, we couldn't find treats that really...came out of it easily at all.  She got it out every now and then, which was good, but she didn't ever figure out how to go about doing so and just tore at the bottom of the judge.     For reference, we had the medium large for about a 40 45 pound 1 year old beagle basset mix.
