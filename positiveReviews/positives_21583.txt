GOOD QUICK EASY.  This is good polenta, and very quick to make.  This is pre cooked cornmeal.          NOT A LONER.  Since this is only cornmeal, it does require other things to jazz it up.  It would not be too good by itself.  First, it needs salt or some type of seasoning (unless the other foods you choose to eat with it has salt).  I think it would go good with beans or chili.  I think the same type of foods that go good with corn ead would go good with polenta.  I think iced tea would be the perfect drink for polenta, since (I think) it is the perfect drink with corn ead.          MAKES GOOD COMPANY.  I am not complaining that it is not a loner and does best with other foods.  (Anyway, who usually only eats one type of food at a time?)  I think some spicy beans, mashed potatoes, or assorted vegetables (such as green beans, okry, etc) would go great with polenta.          MEETS MY NEEDS.  Almost everything I eat is either vegetables, fruits, nuts, or grains.  This is one of those (grains), so it fits right in with the others.          YOU HAVE MY WORD FOR IT.  I already tried this (as soon as I got home from the store with it!), and it is really good.          QUALITY.  It is good food, and at a really decent price.          PASSES MY TOUGH CREDENTIALS.  I love it!!!
