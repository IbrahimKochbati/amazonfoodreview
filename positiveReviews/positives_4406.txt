I am very excited that I have found this oatmeal.  It tastes great and it is quick to make.  When looking to go gluten free, so many of the books I was reading were offering eggs as a morning  eakfast item.  I don't like eggs so my life seemed pretty much doomed to Silk milk smoothies.  This is a great  eakfast option for me now.  My only gripe is that my grocery store cannot seem to keep it on the shelf so when I see if, I buy a couple of boxes.
