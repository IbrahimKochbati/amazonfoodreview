The cereals had a weird odour and also the colour is a slight tinge of greenish greyish. Even though, the tins were originally sealed and expiry date is in 2012!          Is there a production problem for the cereals? Perhaps amazon.com should do a sample check!          This is a serious problem and should be investigated immediately as the cereals are meant for our dear babies!
