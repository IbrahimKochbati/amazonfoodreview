This is a refreshing, tasty, sweet drink, and a nice change from soda.     The strawberry kiwi mix has great taste, and would be terrific on a hot day. I was surprised by the intensity of the flavor, and did not expect the sweetness.     My personal preference, though, is for non carbonated drinks, and I would have preferred it without carbonation.     It is also quite high in calories at 135 calories for 8.3 ounces, which is fairly hefty.     I believe that this is a healthier, better tasting summer drink, which has a much more natural and fresher taste than colas do, and I believe that most people will really love it.
