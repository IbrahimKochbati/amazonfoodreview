I'm not a huge flavored coffee person, but I really love these! The coffee is mild to medium bodied and the flavoring isn't overpowering. It's got a great aroma (the co worker next to me always loves when I  ew one of these) and a clean, distinct taste.          I've got these on Subscribe and Save!
