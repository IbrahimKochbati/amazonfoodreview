This stuff really does taste AWFUL, but it's not like you drink it all day long...suck it up, drink it fast, and chase it with some juice. It works great! It gave me plenty of energy that lasts a long time without the jittery, shakey, crack addict feeling that you get from a lot of other products. Just be careful not to drink it too late in the day.  I made the mistake of trying it at 5pm and didn't get to sleep until around 1:30 (Yeah, I'm an idiot. Didn't really think that through). A fantastic side effect: It kills your appetite. I don't get any of my usual food cravings when I use it. Yay!
