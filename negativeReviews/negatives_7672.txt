Overall, I liked the cookies for their flavor, pleasant aroma and texture.  However, while somewhat moist and pleasantly chewy, they did taste a little dry. I had a few with my usual coffee, and they paired quite well.  I also had a few with milk, and that didn't turn out well.          The cookies actually reminded me of a few of the high fiber energy bars on the market.  The cookies themselves were heavy on the oats and quite generous with the chocolate (but not the almonds).  Each cookie was quite substantial and just two of them with milk could be a satisfying meal.          The cookies were soft and chewy, but not at all gooey, like eating a jelly bean or peanut butter.  The oat content had good consistency and the total cookie was pleasing to nibble on.          Would I buy the product if given the chance?  Probably not, as it is not a good dippin' cookie.  I tried pairing it with milk, and it did not dip well (it fell apart when wetted), though it did taste good with milk.  Still, the fiber content and heft alone have their merits, and in a pinch, I would definitely take a few bites.
