I am not usually an huge fan of Earl Grey, I tend to like  milder flavors but this one knocked me over. The aroma is wonderful and the tin is packed to the top.. not 3 4 full like some tea's I have purchased       This is one that is going to be reordered in this house, we all liked it that much.     I served this to  a friend who is an avid Tea drinker  ( only the best tea's for her) and she was raving about it and took the name to order for herself.     That said it all for me.
