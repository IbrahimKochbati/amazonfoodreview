I've purchased the Farmers Organic canned Pumpkin the last few years from our coop & paid up to $32.00 per case.  I purchased the pumpkin from Amazon for $12 per case, wow was this a great deal!  We use the pumpkin to make the most wonderful pumpkin cupcakes with cream cheese icing & we also feed it to our boxers on a regular basis.          I ordered 6 cases & they were delivered perfect, no dents at all.  Boy was I happy after reading all of the reviews of others that had a bad experience.  The price has jumped to $16 per case since last Friday so I will wait until the price goes back down again before I order more.
