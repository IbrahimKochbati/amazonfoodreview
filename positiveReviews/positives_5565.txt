I made the 10 bean soup with a few modifications.  I added carrots, onions, celery, and potatoes.  However, I did not have to adjust the seasoning.  This is not a bland soup.  Excellent!  I also gave Women's Bean soups, dips, and salsas to my extended family for Christmas.  Everyone loved the gift  it simplified my shopping, and I felt like I was helping those who really need the help.
