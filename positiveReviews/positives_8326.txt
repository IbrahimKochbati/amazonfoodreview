If you want the best iced tea  and most economical tea around, make it from this fabulous Lipton tea.  Add 3 cups of boiling water to 3 tablespoons of tea; seep 3 minutes and pour into 3 cups very cold water. Serve over generous glass of ice cubes. Sugarless tea that needs nothing but maybe some lemon wedges. You can drink for a month on one box of tea! All bottled teas have too much sugar or substitute; this is healthy and I have been drinking it for 40 years!
