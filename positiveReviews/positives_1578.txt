I have a Waring belgian waffle maker and was looking for a good batter to use. I tried this based on reviews and with add my strong recommendation for this mix.          It was very easy to make and the waffles had a wonderful flavor ... loved the malt flavor that came through.          I will definitely be buying more when the current mix runs out.
