A friend turned us on to Earth and Vine's Sake Teriyaki marinade and I think we're addicted.  It's great on burgers but I mainly use it on steaks.  Definitely the best teriyaki sauce I've ever used as it provides sweetness without overpowering the natural meat flavors.  (Helps the steak and burgers char up real nice, too!)
