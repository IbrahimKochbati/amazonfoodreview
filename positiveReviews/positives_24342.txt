The mix was enough to make about 10, 20 oz hurricanes.  The instructions were good and the drink turned out very tasty and was almost as easy to make as buying a hurricane at Pat O'Briens.  The only thing I did differently when I made them a second time was to add more water to the mix so it was less concentrated, but you can easily adjust the strength for your own tastebuds.  Enjoy!
