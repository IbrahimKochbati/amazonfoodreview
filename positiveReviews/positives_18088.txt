First time purchaser on Timothy's 'White Hot Chocolate'.  I made a cup Saturday morning and liked it alot, however it was a bit watery and kind of sweet.  I then looked into my stash of K Cups and found an Italian Blend coffee that I also loved but was a 'bit' strong, by itself.  I found an insulated container and set it aside.  I  ewed a cup of White Hot Chocolate and poured it into the insulated container.  I then  ewed up a cup of Italian Roast and mixed it in with the White Hot Chocolate...yummy!  Try it; please?
