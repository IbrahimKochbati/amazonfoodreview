This is incredible smelling and tasting coffee. I'm fortunate to live in a city that's known for it's coffee, so I'm spoiled when it comes to being able to get a good cup of joe. This Melitta Cafe coffee is the best, pre ground, home  ewed coffee I've ever had, hands down. As cheesy as it sounds, I even had one of those television commercial moments when I first opened the bag: I said "Ah!" and inhaled the woody and nutty aroma deeply. I was instantly sold. The coffee is ground very fine, allowing all the flavor to end up in your cup and not in the trash, garden, or food bin. Even when watered down to make an iced drink the flavor stays prominent. This would be a great blend for homemade coffee ice cream or desserts that use non instant coffee as an ingredient. I would and have recommended this  and to family and friends.
