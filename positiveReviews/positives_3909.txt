We used to buy this sauce at our local grocery store which closed in September.  Luckily, we were able to find it at Amazon.  You do have to buy a 6 pack but the expiration date is March 2012.  Habanero Peppers give it a kick even though it has no onions.  I'm allergic to onions so this is a welcome product.  Very hard to find any good sauce with no onions.
