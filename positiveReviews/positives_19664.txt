Vegan or not, teriyaki primal strips are utterly delicious.  I cannot get enough of them.  The flavor is unimaginable.  The texture is incredible.  Everyone I have given samples to has been amazed.  They are expensive, as far as that goes.  But you cannot go wrong on flavor and texture.  These are so darn great that I have't tried any of the other flavors or textures so far.
