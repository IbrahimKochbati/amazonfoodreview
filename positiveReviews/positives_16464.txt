This is a favorite treat of our 7 month old standard poodle puppy. He is an aggressive chewer, so we need something which will occupy him. The Greenie really seems to satisfy    after chewing through it (which, admittedly, only takes a few minutes) he will lie down and stop bothering us during dinner.          I wish these were less expensive. Each Greenie costs about $1.50, so it pains me a little to see it evaporate so quickly. But that is a function of my dog, not the product.
