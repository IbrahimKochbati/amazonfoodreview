I have been using Bell Plantation for 3 years and think it is a God send. It works perfectly into the Weight Watchers program giving you all the taste of peanut butter without the caloric cost. Because it is powdered you have the option of making your peanut butter thick or thin. I think Bell's has a great peanut butter taste and I feel good about leaving out all of that artery clogging oil. My three children like Bell's 10years old, 13 years old and 15 years old. I feel good about giving them a healthy alternative. Love it, love it, love it!
