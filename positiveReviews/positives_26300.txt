I was so very happy to have found this after looking for it for so long. It tastes better then store bought "Fresh" milk! This NIDO Powder is just so natural, no preservatives or funny taste. I usually use it with tea instead of regular milk, or with cereal.  I ran out of milk last night actually, so I just added 3 full teaspoons to a glass of water and Voila! rich authentic taste. Can't praise it enough!  Brought me back to my childhood. I had bought 4 tins and I loved them so much I gave one to a friend to try! she loves it and now I'm ordering more, probably 8 this time! I love NIDO , this particular one not he ones that have baby pictures on them, those have added Vitamins I think. Not the same taste. Great Seller smooth transaction arrived a few days early which was a great surprise. Thank you
