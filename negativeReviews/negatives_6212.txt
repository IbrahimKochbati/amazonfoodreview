This was okay,not even hot, tasted kinda like it was old.i was really bummed out. i had high hopes , even though,i ate it anyhow.although the free sample was top shelf, finest of quality,fresh ,and definitely executive standard.to me,the habenero flavor was stale tasting,and not worth the money,honest.
