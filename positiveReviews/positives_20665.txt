I was originally using the Traditional Medicinal's  and peppermint tea along with the Dandelion Root because I could not stand the taste of the dandelion by itself. I have to say this one has a much more mellow taste and the price is far better. I have taken to having a cup after dinner and it makes for a very enjoyable evening experience. I normally sweeten it with a teaspoon or two of light organic agave nectar. It just takes the taste over the top. I initially thought a six pack would be overkill but after having a few cups I see that I am going to  eeze through my supply relatively quickly.
