This is some of the most delicious and authentic tasting maple syrup we've come across. My 3 year old loves to have it with milk   he calls the whole drink "Maple Syrup"    thats how much he likes it. The stuff they sell at costco feels like sugar water compared to this product. You will not be disappointed!
