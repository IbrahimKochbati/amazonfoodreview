These packs have the perfect recipe of oil, corn, and seasoning. I've been trying to get a corn recipe that duplicates the flavor of a big amusement park popper. Put this corn in a souvenir bucket from one of our big amusement parks in Orlando and you can't tell the difference. Everybody that's tasted it is very impressed.          I have a whirly pop popper, the larger size that should use the 5.5oz packs that come with the popper. While these 6oz packs work fine in the popper, the corn nearly bursts from the popper. Next time I'll get the 4oz packs.          Perfect texture, fluffiness, color, and flavor. I love it!
