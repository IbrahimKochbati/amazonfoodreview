I ordered Buffalo Bills Chipotle Habenero beef jerky for my  other for Christmas.  He's an absolute jerky fiend, but it's hard to find good jerky anymore!  I'm so glad I found Buffalo Bills!  Forget Jack Links or O'berto, which can be dry, tough, and flavorless.  For just a couple ounces of that kind in the store, you'll pay $5 or $6 a bag.  Here, you get half a pound for a great price!  And the quality can't be beat!          I haven't tried the Chipotle Habanero that I ordered for my  other (we'll have to wait until Christmas to hear feedback about that), but my boyfriend and I couldn't help but dig into the free sample of cajun jerky they included (a great way to get repeat customers, btw!), and it was wonderful!  So flavorful and chewy.  I had to take the sample away otherwise he would have eaten the whole thing in one sitting.          My package arrived within a couple days of ordering and the jerky looks fresh and delicious.  I can't wait to try the habanero one! (If my  other lets me...)          Definitely recommend!!!
