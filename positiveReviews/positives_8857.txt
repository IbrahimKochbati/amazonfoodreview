These chocolates are made in small batches in Kohler Wisconsin. We use to drive to Kohler to buy them. It's good to know that you can order them on Amazon. Each piece has an amazing combination of flavors and textures. I particularly enjoy the ones with molasses, they are called Blackstrap terrapins. Let me know if you like them.
