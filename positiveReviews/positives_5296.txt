Switch is a 100% natural carbonated fruit juice beverage. I like the way it tastes.  It's very sweet and a little tangy.  The ingredients are as follows: 100% juice from apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola, gum acacia, natural flavors and colors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), soy.          An 8.3 oz can has 140 calories, 36 grams of carbs,  100% daily requirement of vitamin C and not much else.
