WE loved this for our dog, at first. Unfortunately after a few uses, his abdomen became distended, he became flatulent (and very stanky, yes STANKY), and had loose stools. Not exactly something you want in a large dog. Peanut butter will be on our shopping list from now on; it's cheaper and works so much better.
