This review is from my wife:          "I'm not one who has all the right words for describing taste and flavor, unfortunately.  I say "unfortunately" because this is a very good tasting coffee and it deserves elegant description.  What I can tell you is that it has no edgy bitterness.  No bitterness at all, actually.  It's rich and smooth.  Yum.          I use a European coffee press for  ewing and this grind worked beautifully in that.  Not too course, not small enough to make a mess through the screen."
