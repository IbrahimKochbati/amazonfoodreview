I would never have guessed that this ketchup has no sugar added  my wife served it to me on burgers and it seriously tasted better than Heinz, which is what I've eaten since I was five years old. Even my kids love this ketchup and would never guess that it doesn't have all the junky chemicals of the name  ands. New family favorite.
