I'm a big coffee drinker so I'm quite picky about the  ands and roasts I buy. This Melitta coffee is a medium roast, very smooth and not bitter. The grind is very fine so I was expecting it to be strong or espresso like, but it turned out to be a nicely balanced medium blend. I prefer this type of coffee to the  ands that are overly strong and have a burnt taste. Just make sure to follow the instructions on the bag for the amount of coffee per water. You can adjust more or less coffee based on your preferences. If you're making it as iced, use a little extra coffee. I'm glad I found this  and for a nice everyday coffee.
