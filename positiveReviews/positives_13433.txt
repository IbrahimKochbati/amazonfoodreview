Has the richest flavor. Other K Cup  ands taste really bad after you try this one. Flavor might vary a bit between batches, but they are all good and strong. It is a waste to prepare a "large" cup with this, since it can easily handle a "large+small", which amounts to ~400ml of rich coffee. If you like espresso, go with small. Worth every penny, thank you Newman :)          PS: Decaf is equally good.
