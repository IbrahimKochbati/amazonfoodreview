I have tried almost every kind of "fake meat" product out there. While I really like the Morning Stars and the Boca "ground meat" you can't really make them into anything.          This product was great. Soak it for 15 minutes in water, and viola you have a really good ground meat you can make something out of,  The only problem is that it tends to be a little saly for my taste, so be carefull when you are seasoning it.
