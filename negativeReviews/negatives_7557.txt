We've ordered these before and had no problem. This time however, with the second treat, my boxer mix almost choked to death. I pulled the small chunk out of his mouth. Later on at night, he hacked up and vomited another small piece along with his two earlier meals of the day. The piece was still super hard. It seems that they fragment easier than before after a bit of chewing. Will not be ordering again and will be returning my bag as the choking risk is not worth it. There are other and better chews out there. For those of you that feed this to your dogs, please watch carefully as they might try to eat the small fragmented pieces!
