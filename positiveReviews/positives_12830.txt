I love these Switch "sodas" they are very tasty and do not contain any bad ingredients. I love to drink soda and when I go to the store I can never find any without high fructose corn syrup. These switch sodas are very easy drinking but contain NO HFCS! For that reason alone I give this a 5 star. The can size is kind of small compared to what we Americans are used to drinking 16 oz soda is the standard size here in the US. These are 1 2 that size and a quick swig can knock it out.          The kiwi strawberry flavor is very yummy. I highly recommend this to everyone looking for an alternative to other sodas.
