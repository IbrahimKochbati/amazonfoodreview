After getting a home espresso machine after months of anticipation, I was so excited to order these Lavazza beans after reading     several positive reviews. Many have claimed that these are some of the best of the Lavazza line, but I have to firmly disagree.     Although I have had delicious Lavazza coffee at restaurants, Lavazza's whole bean coffee end needs to perform better quality control  despite an expiry date of August 2013, the beans I purchased have so far made just awful coffee, with a weak flavor, harsh acidity and a slightly stale taste as both drip coffee and espresso.          I can't blame Amazon since the beans are indeed good for another 18 months, but buyer beware!
