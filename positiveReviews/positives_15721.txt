I discovered Petite Cuisine when I tried to switch my 13 year old cat from dry food to canned; I tried every variety of canned food, and while he wouldn't touch any other  and, he inhaled this stuff. I'm a vegetarian, but Petite Cuisine looks more like real chicken fish than anything I've seen   actual, identifiable strips of meat!  What a concept.          My new kittens love it as well, and Chicken Pot Pie is by far their favorite flavor.  It's got a little more fat than the fish flavors, but still well within the AAFCO guidelines. It's also a little more expensive; you can usually get 24 packs of fish flavors for $18 if you go to the manufacturer's web site. But the chicken pot pie makes a great treat for a healthy dinner.          But: check out Joe's post about menadione.
