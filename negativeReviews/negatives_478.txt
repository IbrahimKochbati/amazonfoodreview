The title of my review says it all (as long as it didn't get cut off). These have a lot more air in them than the Gerber Little Crunchies. These crush extremely easily and get dust crumbs all over the place. Also, they do not taste nearly as good as the Gerber Little Crunchies. They might be better for you, and I like that it has a hint of veggies in it, but my 17 month old isn't very happy with them. She'll snack on them if that's her only option and she's really hungry, but she definitely will not choose them. We first got these several months ago and she's had the same reaction to them every time since then.
