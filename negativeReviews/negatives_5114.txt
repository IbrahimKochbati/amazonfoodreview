I have a 10 pound Yorkie who admittedly destroys most toys we give him.  I thought this toy would be an exception based upon other reviews.  He has a ball that he rolls around that dispenses food and seems to enjoy it and it has lasted longer than most of the other toys.  For this reason I thought he would love this toy.  Less than 36 hours later he became so frustrated in not being able to get the treats that he tore the rope in two.
