My husband and I love this!  I usually caramelize Walla Walla sweet onions to mix in the cooked product.  We have also added sauteed zucchini and chopped fresh tomatoes.  I do not feel deprived being on a gluten free diet when I can indulge in this.  (And no it is not mac and cheese   and I don't believe it is meant to be!)
