I really like this flavoring. I try to stay away from sugar and artificial sweeteners so this was perfect because it contains absolutely no sweetener so I can add my own (mostly liquid stevia).  I also love vanilla flavoring in many things I make so I sometimes use this in place of extract which can be pricey if you use it a lot. For example, I make my own almond milk so I like to add vanilla to sweeten and lighten the taste. This works better than an extract because there is no alcohol taste. I also make blueberry syrup with agave and this flavoring and it turns out very good. I put it in pancake batter and the flavor still holds after cooking (also with cookies). I use this all the time and now I am not dropping $10 every couple of weeks for vanilla extract.
