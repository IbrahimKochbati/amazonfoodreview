This has got to be the best chili you an make from a mix.  My husband loves to eat soups and we are always trying new ones, but when we stumbled upon this one, it is the only one we buy if it is available.  I even have to say it is better than my mother's home made chili recipe I put in my novel, I wrote about a women hunting guide in Idaho, so people can make it and sample it.  Shhhh, don't tell my mother.
