This Earl Grey is of very high quality with an even texture and nice color when  ewe. The bergamot is pronounced without being too strong, unless you're really sensitive to bergamot. I found the overall taste to be quite mild, even when it had been steeping a long while. This is definitely the best organic Earl Grey I've tasted.
