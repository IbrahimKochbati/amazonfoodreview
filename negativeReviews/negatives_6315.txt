The stuffed grape vine leaves were great. The only problem that I encountered was that the can was very, very, very large. Consequently, unless you are using these as a dish that is shared at a meal for several folks it is almost impossible to get through the entire tin in any kind of reasonable time. It would be great if the same product, which tastes wonderful, were available in a smaller size tin.
