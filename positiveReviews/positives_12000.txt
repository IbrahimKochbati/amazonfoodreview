We have been using these treats for a very long time, decades, and find they are accepted by almost any of our pets: dog, cat or ferret. They are their reward for taking their meds nicely. We prefer the largest size tubs for economy and convenience, which are usually not available at the pet stores. Thank you for carrying these.
