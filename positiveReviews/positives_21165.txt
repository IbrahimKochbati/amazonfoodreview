I USE TO PURCHASE IS PRODUCT IN MY LOCAL GROCERY STORE. THEY DON'T CARRY THIS  BRAND ANYMORE. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. I FOUND IT AGAIN ON AMAZON.COM AND ORDERED HAZELNUT AND VANILLA FLAVORINGS. (MY FAVORITES !) I JUST USE ONE TABLET IN MY COFFEE. I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT OVERPOWERING LIKE SOME OF THE SYRUPS AND COFFEE HOUSES USE....AND IT'S SUGAR FREE.
