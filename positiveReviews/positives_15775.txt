The package of 6 price is amazing.  I have been buying these in my store.  One small bottle costs about $6.00.  When I saw these, I thought I would never go through all of them, I'm now ordering my second set.  I even ordered the pumps, which makes it super easy to measure how much you are adding, one pump or two.  Normal flavor 2 pumps, chocolate often just 1 (it is strong), extra flavor or large cup might be 3.          I mainly use these in coffee.  I've found flavored coffee just doesn't taste as good.  I talked to a friend who owns a coffee store and he said none of the coffee stores will use the flavored coffee because you just don't get a lot of the flavor, that is why they all use the syrups, more variety and better flavor.          My main suggestion is to not be afraid of mixing the flavors, again a trick I saw in the coffee shops.  I found mixing the caramel and chocolate in my coffee with milk is as close to a starbucks latte that I can get.  I didn't like the raspberry much until I added a tiny bit of chocolate.  Wow chocolate covered raspberries!  This is great on vanilla ice Cream too.  So if you find you don't like one of the flavors, try adding a bit of another.
