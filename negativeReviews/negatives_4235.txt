This soil is unpredictable, except that it's definitely deadly if you add fertilizer during the first two months.  By unpredictable, I mean even without adding fertilizer, it may burn your plants due to hot spots in the soil, where the 6 months of time release nutrients come out all at once.          Don't use this on prize garden stock without testing first.  You simply cannot control the nutrient uptake with this potting soil.
