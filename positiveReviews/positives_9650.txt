We started buying 100% meat diets on our vet's recommendation for getting our big fatty to lose weight on a "catkins" diet.  Cats are obligate carnivores, so feeding them other foods that contain rice, or lots of vegetables, really isn't in line with how their bodies have evolved.  The vet recommended Before Grain and Wysong, but my cats very clearly told me they like Before Grain much better.  They lap it up, have become a healthier weight (the fat one lost, the small one gained), and have had no tummy problems ever since they switched off Friskies and onto this!          My understanding is that cats do need a few vitamins, since they do get some semi digested vegetables from the guts of their prey.  We mix in some Wysong "Call of the Wild" into the meat.          Surprisingly, they love quail.  Far more than chicken, and a bit more than turkey.  My understanding is that cats naturally eat small fowl and rodents, so quail is actually the closest to what they actually eat in the wild.
