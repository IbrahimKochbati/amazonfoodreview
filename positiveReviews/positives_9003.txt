The only problem I had with these plants were that I ordered six (6), 3 different colour flowers and  they weren't tagged. now i have to wait till they start flowering to see whats what. Having said that the plants arrived in  Excellent condition  and ahead of schedule,with all their leaves intact and still green . I have ordered from this supplier again, and will do so in the future.
