I ordered this product 1 17 10 and was sent notification that it was backordered.  The only reason I ordered it online was because my local health food store was out of it for weeks.  Meanwhile, the health food store has been restocked for a month, and I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE PRODUCT FROM MY ONLINE ORDER YET.  I like the product very much, but order it from another supplier.
