Every day is Thanksgiving at Sophie and Sam's dinner mat when they receive their Whiskas Turkey and Giblets in gravy.  They are quick to devour it and clean each other right after eating (I know they hope to pick up a piece hidden in the fur!).  I only buy from Amazon because of their awesome prices!
