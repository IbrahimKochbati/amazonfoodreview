I really like the pineapple shortcakes sold here. Unlike some of the mass production pineapple shortcakes that use artificial flavoring, Tasselfield's pineapple shortcakes use real pineapples and it makes the whole world difference. You can even taste the fibers from pineapple.          I opted for the traditional pineapple this time. I will be interested in trying out the Longan or mango variety next time.
