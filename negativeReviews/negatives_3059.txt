Been searching for years for a better sauce than Pizza Quick.  Tried many other  ands and end up going back there.  Pastorelli is thick and has a nice assertive tomato flavor but the pizza is fairly bitter and astringent.  I'm going to try mixing in a little sugar and wine next time.  The search for the perfect sauce goes on...
