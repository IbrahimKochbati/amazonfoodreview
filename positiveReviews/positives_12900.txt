It's exactly what it claims to be: carbonated juice. Imagine mixing 2 parts snapple with 1 part seltzer. It's a lot like that, but simpler.          The flavor is definitely juicy, not sugary like soda. But, it's not very complex. Think juice box. Kiwi is the primary flavor. I can hardly taste any strawberry. It tasted more like grape and maybe a hint raspberry.          All in all, an excellent alternative to soda. It's a bit on the pricey side at nearly a dollar for a 8.3 oz can. The only non natural ingredient is ascorbic acid AKA Vitamin C as a preservative. In fact, I would recommend they add a little more Vitamin C to give it more tart. As is, it contains 100% DV of Vitamin C.          I'd say its worth buying. Its a refreshing drink that doesn't leave you feeling guilty or crashing from a sugar high later. Just don't get in the habit of expecting the flavor as labeled.
