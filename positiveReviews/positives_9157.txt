If it wasn't for me standing in the checkout line at Whole Foods, I would have never even noticed the bag. I decided to try it out and OMG they are the best. I love that the chocolate is not an overwhelming sweetness but just enough to compliment the dried bananas. I honestly can't wait to get my hands on another bag. The only disappointment that I have is that you can't buy them at every Whole Foods.
