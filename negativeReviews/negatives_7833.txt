I am typically happy with all the purchases I make on Amazon.  However, I was a bit disappointed with this purchase.     The item was delivered quickly as Amazon has fantastic shipping.  When I went to enjoy my first bag of sour skittles, I found that the candy appeared to be melted and the colors of the skittles ran into each other.  Moreover, the sour coating was minimal to non existent.  I consistently found the same result with all the individually packaged bags.  I don't know if there was a storage problem or if I received a bad batch, but i wasn't satisfied with the purchase.
