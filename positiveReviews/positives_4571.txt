Thanks to the wonderful reviews I read about this crisp ead, I decided to purchase. There are many other crisp eads crackers that I've purchased that taste like cardboard and have little flavor.  I think this crisp ead is really delicious   a little sweet with lots of crunch and a variety of seeds. Great flavor.  I like that it's organic, whole grain, and relatively high in protein.  It's a little different from other crackers and it is great topped with egg or tuna salad or all by itself. Delicious! I will have to try some of the other Doctor Kracker Crisp eads. I will certainly be ordering more of these.
