Ingredients listed: Pure cane sugar, and 100% pure powdered Japanese green tea.          Nutrition Facts: all 0%, except Sodium (15mg) and Sugar (12g)          Basic Instructions: add one packet to 8oz of cold water and stir or shake well to dissolve...          My Opinion: It is too sweet for my taste, even diluted in a 16.9oz water bottle. It almost tastes like sugar water. I think the unsweetened version would be better. 5 star because it delivers what it promises.          This is Japanese green tea. NOT Chinese green tea. There is a difference.
