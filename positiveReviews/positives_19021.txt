We have 2 Min Pin mixed  eed dogs that are 2x   3x larger than normal min pins. Because of their size, normal treats are either too big or too small. These knee bones are perfect for them and we finally found something they won't power through in 10 minutes. These bones are a bit messy so we either give them to the dogs outside or on a blanket inside. They do have a smell when first being chewed but it goes away as the dogs work on them. We are very happy with these bones.
