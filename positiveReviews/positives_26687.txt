All of Blairs products are Great Quality. These are by far the hottest Ive tried & I am about the only one I  know who can eat them. What makes these so good is that the heat is ALL there but there is tons of flavor too! The Parmesean & Cajun are also quite good with a bit less heat! I have bought them by the case On Blairs site, its nice to see them offered through Amazon too!
