If you're used to regular super sweet gum, you may not like this because it has a little less flavor. You really do get used to it though and it's probably much better for your teeth.          I started chewing this years ago when it was made with sorbitol. They've since reformulated it with xylitol and while it took me a little while to get used to it, I'm hooked yet again. I go through this stuff like it's candy! I literally chew a piece after almost everything I eat. It keeps my teeth clean and my  eath a little fresher. The weird thing about this gum is that the flavor doesn't last very long. That's fine with me. I usually spit it out after 5 10 minutes.
