I own a 7 year old miniature Australian Sheppard. He's about 22 lbs.  He seems to really like the taste of these biscuits.  He does have a bit of difficulty eating them though. They are quite thick in size.  Most dog biscuits I give him are less than 1 2" thick...these are closer to 5 8".  He has a bit of trouble getting his mouth around them to  eak them up. Eventually he does, but has to really work at it.  I would prefer them to be a bit thinner.  I think a larger dog like a lab would do better with these treats.
