Well I bought this item before and enjoyed it immensely. Pink Salmon is very good for you.          This time I ordered again, received ALBACORE TUNA INSTEAD OF PINK SALMON. AMAZON DOES NOT DO RETURNS ON GROCERIES SUCH AS THESE, EVEN IF NOT OPENED THAT I CAN SEE. I sent personally an email to Raincoast Trading Company based in Canada, also left a phone message as well. Delayed response, but finally got emails and they were courteous but they redirected me to try help center to get credit and get the correct item. Gone through hoops in the help center of Amazon to no avail. Until I found the Toll Free Amazon phone number, Amazon LLC confirmed they can not accept the return, but will send the correct item promptly. We shall see, awaiting a replacement item.     A minor complaint they are smaller can sizes than the normal pink salmon I am used to ordering.     Anyone want some tuna? O well.          P.S. Updated  review Sept 30th 2009, I finally got the ordered item, partly because the Amazon rep corrected it when I called in and sent it fast! BTW, it cost me a Toll Call to Canada to the company without a prompt reply. That just added insult to injury. Well I was able to order from a different merchant through Amazon. Thank you Amazon for coming through :)
