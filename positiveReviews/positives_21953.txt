This is THE best gluten free pasta ever. I have used it for pasta salads that I served to friends, and they never knew they weren't eating regular pasta. One caveat  be sure to not overcook it, or it will get mushy. I've tried all the Tinkyada shapes, and they are all good, but the fusilli is my favorite because it's so versatile.
