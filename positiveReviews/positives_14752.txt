I can't really describe how this works or what it does to me. I drink it and then for about an hour or two I get a good mind focus on what i'm doing. I buy a ton of this product around finals. This is the best price I've found and I like it enough that I took the time to see if I could find it cheaper. It's about $3 for one at the store.          ADDED: After writing this review I really searched hard on if this water contains fluoride. I found out it does if your on the east coast. If you dont know how bad Fluoride is for your  ain, specifically the pineal gland, you need to do some research. I highly doubt I will ever buy this product again. If you don't mind fluoride and it's harmfull effects on your sleep or intelligence, buy some.          But I will say if you take the fluoride out, it's a really great product.
