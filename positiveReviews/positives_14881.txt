I prefer my coffee black.  Usually, I turn to my Keurig for a great cup of rich black coffee.  However, the Dolce Gusto does a nice cup of unadorned coffee, as well.  The Caffee Lungo is, indeed, a very nice, naked coffee.  For my taste, though, it is a bit to strongly  flavored.  The frothiness is not altogether to my liking.  However, with a bit of milk and sugar the Lungo is very tasty, indeed.          There are two ways to  ew it.  The smaller cup is the "Americano" while the larger is the Caffee Lungo.  A frothy "Americano" seems a bit odd but it is tasty, if a bit to strong.          Remember, the strength of the flavor is largely a result of a dark roasting.  A rule of thumb is the darker the roast the less caffeine in the  coffee.          Anyway, the Dolce Gusto continues to impress me.
