I tried this Root beer for the first time about a week ago. I had been drinking Zevia Root Beer (which is really good, too), but decided to start buying this  and, instead. I love the taste of both, but this one has a creamy taste to it which I prefer. I was so glad to find sugar free sodas that didn't have all those nasty artificial sweeteners in them!! I highly recommend Blue Sky Free (and Zevia, as well). Oh, and the Blue Sky Free Cherry Vanilla Creme is awesome!! The only ones I don't personally recommend are the colas in either Zevia or Blue Sky free  and.. they are bleh, but that's just me.
