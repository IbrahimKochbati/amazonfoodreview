Discovered these sauces at a restaurant in Monterrey, CA, and searched everywhere at the Gilroy Garlic Festival, but it was not available.     Finally found it at Amazon.          It's spicy but doesn't burn.  Pleasantly garlicky.  My family is hooked, and we put it on everything. Try it on grilled fish for something a little different.
