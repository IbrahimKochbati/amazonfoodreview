I got this for my mom who does not like strong coffee.  Paramount Rwanda Coffee is great.  Depending on how much water you use you can get a cup of coffee that satisfies the palate of a strong coffee drinker as well as that of someone who prefers a milder blend.  If you're looking for a flexible grind this coffee certainly fits the cup ;)
