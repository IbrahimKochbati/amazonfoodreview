Our family has dubbed the Murray River Australian Pink Flake salt "Salt Crack". It is quite delicious and addictive. Love the way the flakes dissolve. it is a perfect finishing salt. We don't use Morton's salt on our table any longer. We give bottles of this salt to friends as presents and it has been a big hit.   "
