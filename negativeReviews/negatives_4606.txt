These sugar pearls are used for makign Belgian "steet waffles" common in the 18th century, (and now resurrected by foodies).  The waffles are properly called "Gaufre Liege" and are made using this type of beet based sugar pearls which melt and carmelize using a dough recipe.          The more common gooey batter Belgian Waffle recipe is called the "Bruxelles" type, and it would be very odd to use these sugar pearls when preparing them.  Ordinary Belgian "Bruxelles" waffle batter can be made perfectly using common cane sugar.
