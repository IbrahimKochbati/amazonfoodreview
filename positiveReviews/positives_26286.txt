I have been eating CERTS Mixed Fruits for more than 30 years.  They have a a mixture of flavors, pineapple, orange, grape, cherry etc.  They are not only refreshing but great  eath mints. All my friends always ask me for them as they know I always have at least 2 rolls with me at all times.  My 19 year old grandson hits my stash all the time.
