The Chili Lime popchips are a bit overwhelming. My friends said they couldn't really eat them by themselves, they taste better with a meal. However, I happily ate a whole bag just by itself, and it was fun.          The chili (spicy) comes on strong at first, then you taste the lime, then it ends with a spicy limey aftertaste that is quite pleasant. This was my first time trying Popchips, and I loved eating them, the texture is great.          The only thing I didn't like was the size of the bags. It's like they are only half filled, or the bags are twice the size they need to be. It makes it look like there is more in the bag than there is.          Note that although these are '100 calorie' bags, each bag has 16 carbs. If you are on a low carb diet, that eats up a large chunk of your daily serving, so beware! Because, like with most chips, you can't just eat one chip.
