This is by far the best dog food I've given my dog! I was having problems with my dog eating for almost a year before we started this dog food. She just wouldn't want to eat. We feed her twice a day, splitting up the daily amount. She just wasn't interested and would eat just a little bit once a day. When we switched her to this food, she has eaten her dog food (the whole amount) every day. I also read on a dog food rating website what the best dog foods were and Canidae was one of the top dog foods on the market! This makes me feel good about giving my dog something she loves and it's also very healthy. Let's just say, she has more energy than all of her doggie friends. She can play longer and harder than any of them and I know it's because I give her a quality dog food.
