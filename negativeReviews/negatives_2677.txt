810 MILIGRAMS OF SALT PER SERVING is not a healthy amount!  Yet the     other ingredients in this condensed soup make it SO delicious, even     a "salt counter" like myself finds it hard to resist!  THIS IS NOT     A SNACK FOOD!  It needs to be MIXED with other, preferably totally     salt free ingredients!  Not only a soup can be made with this     "condensed yumminess".  I have used it, (with salt free tuna and or     salmon), instead of mayonaise, and added  ead crumbs, for a     delicious tuna spread!          So    enjoy this condensed soup!  Just be aware of the absolutely     t r e m e n d o u s amount of dangerous sodium in it, and drink,     eat, and cook with it, accordingly.          ...............................................................          NOTE TO CAMPBELL'S: I realize that salt here is used as a preservative.  But VITAMIN E is also a good preservative.  Perhaps     you could use less salt and more vitamin E to preserve your soups?     I hope so!  And will be looking forward eagerly to the day when     you do!  Thanks!
