This mustard is NOT for the mild mannered, but for those who truly appreciate great German food!  This product is original as sauer kraut und rot Kohl!  Its taste is very original and authentic for those who will appreciate a bit of zip in their mustard.  Try it on  ats, burgers (etc.), and you simply won't be disappointed.  Alles Gute!  Jim
