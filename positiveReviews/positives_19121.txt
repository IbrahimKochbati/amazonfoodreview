I've tried so many K cups. The greatest problem I have with K cups is many are too weak for me and I've never liked a "strong" cup of coffee. You know the one's that make your grow chest hair. I've tried many flavored K cups but all are a milder coffee for some reason. However, I'm so glad I found this vanilla k cup. I can actually taste the vanilla and coffee in my cup of coffee with this k cup. I enjoyed my sample of this so much that I bought 2 boxes of 48ct in addition to the Hazelnut. I hope the Hazelnut is just as good.
