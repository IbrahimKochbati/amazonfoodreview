I ordered this product assuming that I'd be receiving white cheddar popcorn. However, what I received was white cheddar puffcorn. Disappointing at first, but I couldn't resist. It came in a nice "pirate's chest" (opposed to boring packaging) and the quality and smell of the snack was awesome. This stuff is pretty good, but be noted that you're not getting popcorn!
