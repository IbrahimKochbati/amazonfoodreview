UPDATE:  My original review is below this update. but if you are looking for the original Spear O Mint flavor (which is great), these are now the "new and improved" flavor which is terrible.  It is not just a slight difference, it is a complete overhaul.  It is more like Pep O Mint with an overpowering chemical flavor.  It seems someone at the company must have decided since some people like "conspicuously strong mints" we should sell them.  Unfortunately instead of leaving my favorite flavor Life Saver alone and coming out with a new strong mint, they made the foolish decision to re flavor these.  I actually started choking on them it was so bad.  I thought it was just a mistake (I've had Pep O Mint occasionally mixed in a pack of Wint O Green or Spear O Mint before), but I quickly realized no, it is just the "new and [not] improved" flavor.  I've contacted the company previously (when they started adding artificial sweetener to some of the regular flavors) and they told me that their "taste tests" revealed that folks preferred the new flavor.  I think they must have found a test panel of folks who like the aftertaste of artificial sweetener.  I'm going to complain to the company again, but it will probably once again fall on deaf ears.          MY ORIGINAL REVIEW [based on the original flavor Spear O Mint, which I also gave 5 stars]     These have become extremely hard to find.  It seems that the stores believe there is only a market for sugarless mints.  I hate sugarless products and the associated throat dryness that comes with consuming them.     These are great tasting, sweetened with sugar, and also seem to act as an upset stomach reliever.
