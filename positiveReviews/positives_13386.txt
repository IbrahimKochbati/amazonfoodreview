I love waking up to a fabulous cup of coffee.  Newman's special blend Arabica coffee for me leaves nothing to be desired;  taste, aroma, boldness and ease of preparation make this a daily morning must have.  I would certainly recommend that if you are a coffee lover, that you give it a try.  I think it's the best thing since sliced  ead.  And Amazon is the way to go, I order when I'm running low and it is at my doorstep the following day.  Really, I don't see how anyone can ask for more.
