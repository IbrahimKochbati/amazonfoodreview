it's lucky charms   you should know what it is by now and whether you like it or not.  what i want to comment is that if you have amazon.com prime, you can not beat the price.  you empty your last bit of cereal into your bowl on monday morning.  you looking at the news on your computer.  you click onto amazon.com and order your cereal and get it by wednesday without anymore expense (if you have prime).  no tax on food (in my state).  better than driving to costco and spending a thousand for what was supposed to be a run for toilet paper.  i love it.  the subscription service is even better   you save an additional 15%!  and it auto ships for free whenever you want it to ship.  and there are coupons on the item detail page sometimes.  right now, it is the best deal around.  you can even order from your phone, kindle   wherever.  how easy can it be!  thank you amazon.
