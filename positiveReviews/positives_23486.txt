Another tasty soup from Progresso. These guys seem to have making a good soup with low calories and low sodium down pat. A can makes two servings, and one serving along with a moderate calorie sandwich makes a great lunch for someone losing weight, or maintaining weight. One thing I've come to appreciate about Progresso soups is that they are seasoned much like I season homemade soups. They have a variety of spices that make an effective combination. I'd appreciate it if they'd leave the noodles out, but there aren't so many that they disturb either the vegetable soup or the nutritional value. The rest of the package makes up for it.
