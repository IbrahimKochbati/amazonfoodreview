My friend  ought this over for a party, and we tried the limes, lemons, oranges and bananas! The initial taste of the tablet is pretty nasty, but just stick with it until it's dissolved completely on your tongue, coating it. After that, sour fruit like lemons and limes taste like the BEST sour candy you have ever tasted in your life and you will DEVOUR them :D
