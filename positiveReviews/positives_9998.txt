So I  like really dark roasts but not quite expresso. This particular roast is dark but not their darkest per coffee direct.     If you go to their site there are great explanations of each roast. It is cheaper to order thru amazon (especially quick ship if you are a prime member). This one produces very very smooth coffee using my Capresso grind and  ew. My wife thinks it makes the best coffee we have ever made at home.     I emailed them and got an answer within a half hour. FYI the 2 darkest they have before expresso roast are Dark Sumatra and Dark Celbes which I'm going to try next time.     Great coffee,great price. I highly recommend.
