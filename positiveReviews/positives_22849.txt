Bigelow Vanilla Caramel tea is the most delicious tea I have ever tasted. I  use Silk soy creamer with the tea to add an extra vanilla taste. I make my 5 cup pot of tea every morning using 3 bags of the Bigelow caramel tea with 2 bags of Bigelow decaffeinated English tea. I like my tea slightly decaffeinated. I wish you made a decaffeinated caramel vanilla tea because the taste would probably be mind blowing.
