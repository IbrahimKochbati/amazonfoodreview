I got one K Cup of Wolfgang Puck's Colombian Reserve dark roast as part of a variety 35 pack that I bought here on Amazon. Since I'd always assumed that I preferred the less burnt flavor of a light or medium roast, I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed the way this coffee sat on my tongue. It is sweet, full, and gently bitter. I  ewed it in a 9.25 oz. cup in an effort to dilute it a little, but I may be gutsy enough to try a 7.25 oz. cup the next time around.
