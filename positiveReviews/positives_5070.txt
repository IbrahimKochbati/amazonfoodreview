My dogs really like these. My six year old adopted Spoodle came to us with bad teeth and a weight problem. She had 14 teeth pulled and is halfway to her weight goal, and has learned to like crunchy snacks.          My ten year old lab likes anything, but also needs to watch his teeth and his weight.          I like to give them a treat before I leave the house, so that they are happy instead of anxious when they see me get my coat and keys.          These treats are perfect at only 18 calores each, and the dogs are excited to eat them. The lab makes short work of it, but the Spoodle gets to give her remaining teeth a workout. ChristineJW
