I use lemon zest for cooking, when I don't make my own. It is great in Mediterranean dishes.     I decided to get this for a new toothpaste recipe I picked up. Yeah, that sounds strange, but if you make your own toothpaste you don't have to worry about how much fluoride you are getting in it, and it is probably one eighth the cost of commercially prepared products.     I decided if I was getting fluoride in tap water, I didn't need it in my toothpaste also. And now I am not sure I need it at all. It sure didn't seem to prevent cavities for me. So, since I can't find non fluoridated toothpaste under $6 a tube at the store, I am going to be going for the Zesty life. Their orange zest is great also!
