This marinade is out of this world. I won't use anything else on my  isket. Picking up more today to try on a roast. I haven't found any product better than this. It's a bit on the extravagant side, but so worth it. You won't be disappointed. Now that I know they have new products, may try those. (Yes they have a new  isket sauce. I'll still use this on my  isket. Can't go wrong with perfection. Brisket recipe: Take a  isket with a nice slab of fat over it (you can take it off later) not too thick not too thin (you need this for keeping the meat moist and tender). Pour 1 2 bottles over the  isket (depends on the size) in a deep roasting pan (I use an enamel pan)deep enough to be able to put a piece of foil over the top without touching the  isket. Seal the edges of the foil around the pan to make a tent. Put in the oven at 250 275 degrees for a few hours. ( Frozen  isket is even better) if frozen, then cook longer (at least double time) You can check it from time to time. Watch out for the steam when you roll back a corner side. Check with a fork to see if it starts to flake, taste it, you'll know if it's done. This will be the flaky, moistest  isket you ever ate. (skim off the fat and throw away). S l o w cooking is the way to go with  isket. This marinade is what makes it sooooo good.
