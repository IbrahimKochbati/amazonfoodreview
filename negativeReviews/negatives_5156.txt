My 10 month old Lab needed some  ain toys, and this seemed like an ideal option. There is a problem to solve, and the reward is food   what could be better for a Lab? The problem is that she is a chewer, and though she did figure out pretty readily how to get the food out, she was way more interested in chewing on the rope. When I removed the rope   which also made it way easier to get the food out   she then thought it would be more gratifying to chew her way to the food, rather than rise to the intellectual challenge of tipping the bottle and dispensing a treat.          And oh yes, this thing is loud when it hits the floor or cabinets in the kitchen, etc. Pretty durable, considering all she wants to do is chew it and it's not intended as a chew toy   but she has only spent maybe two hours with it total.
