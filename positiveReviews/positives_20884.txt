I'm a dark roast fan but my wife wanted me to order this for her.  She usually isn't a big coffee fan but ocassionally she wants a cup that isn't too rough.  This fit the bill for her, very smooth and with enough cream sugar she will drink it.  I had a cup of it black one night and it's very good for light roast.          I always recommend this one for dinner guests with desert, they always seem to  ag on it.
