Our daughter (now 10 months) is a relatively good eater, but this has been one of her favorites for a few months now. It's a simple combination, but she finishes the packet each time (which is good because the package isn't resealable)! We make food for her too, but we like having these organic pouches as an easy option for travel and for the days we just want something quick.
