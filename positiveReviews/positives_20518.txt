**another up date***3 21 12          This is not a item taste, it's package inside of box.     It's came with 12 boxes but 3 boxes inside of boxes, about 15 packets are leaking.     It's syrup so it's took few days to notice leaking under the box.          I send email to Amazon.com because I can't return all of them because of 3 boxes was defected.     Well see what they going to tell me.          **UP DATE**          I ordered this from Amazon and realized it came with 12 BOXES. Yes it is cheap with 12 boxed.     I purchased with using amazon card discount limited time so it 20%off as well.     I really love this on plan yogurt. Yuzu citrus with Oligo fructose and honey     Good for cholesterol!          So I changed to 5 star and title.          This is great product, I can use for 6 months.          ******************          I purchased this Yuzu Infusion and tried few days ago. It was taste really good especially with plane yogurt.     Yuzu citrus taste very refreshing and I will repeat again for sure.     It's also look like pure syrup but not sour like lemon. Yuzu is great for any kind of sweets and yogurt.          However this price is very expensive!if it's only 1 box. It's only comes with 10 packet not 12 pack for 12oz 1box that they describe on the box. If it's comes 12 boxes with this price is good deal.     It's also you can find from World market as former name Cost plus market as lower as five. ninety nine for 1 box with 10 packet.
