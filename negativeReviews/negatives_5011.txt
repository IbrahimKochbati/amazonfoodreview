I was initially surprised how big the toy was (small), but my dog (12 lb Terrier mix) ended up loving it anyways.  I feed him his meals between various puzzle toys and it does wonders for his destructive tendencies.  I was upset when it  oke after only one week.  I have mostly carpet with minimal tile floor, so not sure if he got rough with it on the hard surfaces.  I tried taping the bottom shut after I fill it with food, but eventually the screw part totally fell apart and I had to throw it away.  Not sure I will buy another one at this price.  :(
