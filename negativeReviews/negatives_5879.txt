This kept my dog's attention for a couple minutes the first few times we used it, but now she has no interest.  I think my 2 year old enjoyed it more than my dog did.  It seems to slide around too easy and our dog has a tough time getting the yellow "cups" out.  She's not overly food driven, so that may be part of the problem.  Guess we'll try something else.
