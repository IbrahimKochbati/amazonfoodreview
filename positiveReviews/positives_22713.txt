I have tried several different portion packs and this is the best!!! It has the movie theater taste your looking for. It is a little salty so, if you don't like salty,don't buy it. Don't be alarmed when the package arrives and the oil is solid. That is normal. Either keep them in a warm place(boiler room) or turn on the warmer part of your popcorn maker first and rest the package on it and the oil will liquify. Then enjoy the show!!!
