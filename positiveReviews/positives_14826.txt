I found an excellent infuser and loose leaf Earl Grey all in the same day. This may become my daily tea. Does well on a 2nd steeping  still smooth and slightly smokey, not at all bitter tea flavor comes through nicely with maybe a bit less bergamot zing than the first time, still very tasty. You can really tell the difference on teas like this one which use real bergamot, especially of good quality. And a decent black tea is often missing in even some of Earl Greys with good bergamot, which is sometimes used to hide inferior leaves. Rishi included high quality in both departments, so the tea carries through on its own even after the spicy citrus does its work. It may be a bit strong for some, and I wouldn't know what is considered better from a traditional point of view (I'm not British), but it's just right for me. My favorite Earl Grey to date.
