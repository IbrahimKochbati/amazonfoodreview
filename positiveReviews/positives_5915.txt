I have been exclusively  eat feeding my son, so when the 6 month mark came up and had to introduce solids I was nervous. I knew  eastmilk was the best thing to mix cereal with, but I really didnt want to mess with the hassel of pumping! I tried whole milk (ok per pediatrician), which made him so fussy : (, then water, he wouldn't eat it. Then I did actually try some  eastmilk I had frozen from the early weeks of nursing, he still refused it! I then heard on the Dr. Oz show that goats milk is most like  eat milk and thats what  ought me to this product! I was so happy to find this product for him, he eats his cereal with no problems now and absolutly no tummy problems either : ) No pumping and no formula needed! Couldn't ask for anything better! Highly reccomended!
