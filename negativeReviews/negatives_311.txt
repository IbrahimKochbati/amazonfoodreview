Thought these were the larger sized ones you see in stores but I was mistaken.  These pops are about 7" inches long and a little less than 1" inch wide.  Flavors are comparable to Flavor Ice, not necessarily better.  My wife and I enjoy these throughout the year instead of ice cream, but we can only find them in our local grocery store during the summer months.  Glad we can get them via Amazon! These were on sale for $5.48 per box of 100 with free shipping, so I think we got a good value.  Without the sale pricing, I'm not sure if we'd choose these over another  and, but if they do go on sale again, we would probably buy them again.  Not bad, just a little small...  Eat two!  ; )
