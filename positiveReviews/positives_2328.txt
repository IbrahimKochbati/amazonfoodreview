I bought these locally, not from amazon. I'm in Arizona and they are sold in Albertsons and Bashas stores. They are absolutely delicious and taste just like other cookies. I bought all four of the "flavors" to test them out. The only one I didn't like was the chewy chocolate chip. All others though are wonderful. I count calories and try to eat healthy, but I do indulge with treats sometimes. This is the perfect treat since it has all the vitamins and fiber! I will never eat a regular cookie again. What's the point when you can actually get nutrition from tasty cookies!?
