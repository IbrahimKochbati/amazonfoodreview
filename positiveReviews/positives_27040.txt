Sometimes I have low blood sugar.  Several times my blood sugar dropped so low as to concern my doctors.  I asked what I could do and the diabetic nurse suggested I keep some pure apple juice available.  I found Motts to be a reliable  and.          Motts Apple Juice suggests  8 ounces as a serving.  The nurse suggested that 4 Ounces should be my first dose.  Four ounces of apple juice has 15 grams of carbs and 13 grams of natural sugar.  I discovered that the 4 oz.  serving reliably raises my blood sugar 25 points, which is usually enough to reach  the rescue goal of 75 bg (mg dl).          I have concluded that apple juice is a natural healthy beverage for most humans.  Motts is tasty and not very acidic.  The 4oz. Serving is a natural "pick me up" available for everyone.  I am very happy with this product.
