Don't buy these from Amazon Warehouse like I did...total waste of money for these dry hunks of blandness.  I wouldn't know what they are like fresh, it wasn't sold to me that way...but at least my dog had dog chews.  Not sure why Amazon insists on selling worthless food rather than throw it away and risk ticking off customers and or poisoning them.  I know they are closer to the expiration date buying it through the warehouse but seriously...THROW BAD FOOD AWAY AMAZON!  Sheesh.
