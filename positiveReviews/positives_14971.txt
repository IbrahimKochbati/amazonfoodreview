When I returned to work a few months ago a few months ago after the birth of my 2nd child, I initially was able to pump 10 12oz during my lunch hour but after about 4 weeks at work, my supply precipitously declined. I then started to take non gaia  and fenugreek seed capsules for a week without a significant change in my supply.  I then switched to this  and Gaia and took 3 capsule after  eakfast and 3 capsules after lunch along with Gaia lactation support 1 capsule between  eakfast & lunch and my supply was instantaneously back up: 10 ounces at lunch again. I've been doing this for about a month now with excellent results. This stuff is amazing!
