This is a good "base" for vegetarian chili.  Straight out of the can it may be too mild for hot chili fans, but that is easy to change.  The mix of beans and vege meat is just right, the moisture and the seasonings are quite nice.  Add "heat" (chillis, etc.) and a variety of condiments and you have a very nice, healthy meal.
