I tried MANY different ways to prepare this green tea (varying water temperatures with 2 min, 3 min, 4 min boils), and yet I couldn;t get a decent tasting tea with this  and. I've been drinking tea for 30 years and I honestly have to say, among the worst I've tasted. There is a also a fishy smell to the tea.
