I tried this salt in a sampler of eight, and this one was so much better than the others that I immediately looked for it on line. I know; salt is salt is salt, right?  But this one will change your mind.  The taste and texture are unmistakable.  The salt looks like snow crystals, peach colored from the minerals in the water from which it's harvested, and the flakes melt like ice shavings on the tongue, leaving a  ight, clear taste that's addictive.  As a replacement for salt in recipes, it's expensive; but it's a great substitute for table salt    not just because it feels like a guilty pleasure, but because I wind up using much less of it to get the equivalent level of salinity    with far more crunch and character.
