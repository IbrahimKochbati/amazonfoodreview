Excellent stuff! My baby is allergic to dairy and soy.     This is the only formula she could tolerate. It     smells but she loves it! When they are under a year     old you add  own rice syrup to give more calories.     Then you gradually wean them off of the  own     syrup so by the time they are a year they are drinking     straight goats milk.
