My elderly (soon to be 17) beagle, Dakota, is super picky about what he eats.  Making a different dish (has to have different protein source and flavoring) every other night is the only way I can keep weight on this once food frenzied chow hound.  The ONLY consistent item he eats    including dog treats and human table food    are Greenies treats.  The "Senior" variety is the perfect texture (softer than the regular Greenies treats) for his aging, sensitive teeth.  The inclusion of glucosamine and chondroitin to help with his joints give me hope that it helps the creaking and cracking of his joints.  Whatever the formula they use to make it easier to digest is a plus since I know his aging system doesn't work as well in his older years.  Dakota gets one petite Greenies Senior treat everyday and he has never turned down an offer for one yet.
