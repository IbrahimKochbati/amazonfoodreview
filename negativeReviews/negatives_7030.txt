If you think mud is an exotic flavor, then this is the tea for you. Otherwise, you might want to think twice. This tea smelled wonderful while  ewing, but in the cup the taste is muted and muddled. There is some kind of spice there  I know because 1) it says so on the package and 2) I can feel the bite of something on my tongue, but I can't place what the spice is and it's aroma is barely discernible during drinking. It's like a mouthful of flat, flavorless... I don't know what. It was unbearable without sugar, and it didn't improve with it. I didn't add milk because I didn't want to waste milk. Take a pass on this one.
