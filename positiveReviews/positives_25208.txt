This is awesome stuff at an unreal price when it goes on sale on Amazon. I ordered twice, and both times received the shipment in 24 hours!          We prefer the grade B over the grade A as it has a richer flavor, and is pretty multi purpose. I first bought Coombs  and a few years ago, and keep coming back for more. It has a very clean and pure maple taste. No complaints!
