Having never sampled this flavor, I took a chance and ordered a 2 pack because it sounded so delicious.  I'm happy to say I made the right choice.  It's an excellent combination of chocolate and raspberry, where one flavor does not overpower the other.  It's my new favorite K cup, and I will definitely buy more when this supply runs out!
