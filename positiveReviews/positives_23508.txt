I tried the French Vanilla Granola made my Golden Temple, from a bulk store and "fell in love" with it.  It was so good that the store supply was out quite frequently... apparently  I wasn't the only one who thinks this Granola has exceptional taste.  I was thrilled to find this product on Amazon.  I purchased this 6 box Pack a couple of weeks ago and 4+ boxes have been throughly enjoyed thus far.  If you like Granola and French Vanilla is a flavor you enjoy... you have to try this Granola!
