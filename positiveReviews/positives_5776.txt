I put 1 2 teabags of Easy Now in an entire teapot let it steep for 20 30 min and have some before bed. No matter when I got to sleep, I always wake up 7 8 hours later, feeling good, and without having woken up in the middle of the night. (except maybe to use the restroom, but I always fall back asleep instantly) Its also great anytime during the day to just calm your nerves, it won't make you sleepy. This is easily my favorite calming tea.
