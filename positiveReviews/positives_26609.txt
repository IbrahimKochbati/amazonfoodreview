I started drinking coffee at the age of 2 when my grandpa would sneak me some in my cup. Ever since, I've required milk and sugar in my coffee as that's how I knew coffee. Drinking any coffee black was not the most appealing experience, until Cairbou. I've had Caribou coffee before the K Cups and I'm a fan of their flavor, which is captured very well. Brewing this in 8 10oz cup sizes will give you the best flavor, and best of all, you won't need to have milk and sugar around all the time.          There's no argument against the convenience and quality of a Keurig, and the Caribou Blend may be the best available, meaning little slices of heaven in each cup. The only downside is cost, which exists with all K Cups. However, even at about $0.66 every 10 11oz, it's still cheaper than my neighborhood coffee shop AND it's in my own kitchen. Worth every penny.          There are other great  ands out there, but this flavor is the first to really stand on its own merits with me, and I feel like I need to pass that along.
