Ive been trying a few different  ands and blends of k cups recently and this one is by far my least favorite. To compare, i have just finished a caribou blend box, a newmans organic dark roast box, etc. I tend to like a medium strength coffee and i find the darker roasts work better for me i tried the tullys black with sugar, and immediatly got this burnt cigarette aftertaste  long time coffee drinkers know this taste ugh. I havent gotten this aftertaste with the other  ands. I tried the tullys again, with milk and sugar, which is my usual preparation i thought this might mask that flavor, but i can still taste it. I am dissatisfied with this  and, and i wont buy it again, too much wasted money with the boxes being 10 bucks each.
