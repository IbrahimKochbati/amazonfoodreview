I LOVE King Syrup!! As a child I would visit my grandmother in PA and we would have it for  eakfast on buttered toast. I always looked forward to my visit because the Midwest didn't have it. It one of those childhood memories that gives you the warm and fuzzies. I would be enjoying  eakfast while listening to my grandmother tell a story. When my family would pack up to return to MO, my folks would buy a couple cases of King Syrup to hold us over to the next visit. To this day, I am "54", everytime I eat it, I think of her and the wonderful memories, a time when things were simpler but good. ; )
