The quality of the Petite Cuisine cat food is not the problem.  There is no question that the food is high quality.  There are no meat by products and if you know what "by products" are you will be happy about that. The problem is that my cats don't seem to like it nearly as much as the fish flavors.  The four cans have only two varieties and my cats weren't thrilled with either one.  In fact, two of my cats don't like these at all.  The sesame chicken is made up of thin strips of chicken which two of my four cats seem to think is tasty enough.  The chicken pot pie is liked by only one cat.  I think the other cats don't like it because it has too much liquid.  The liquid isn't a gravy but rather a watery  oth and there is just too much of it.          So before you buy this 24 pack size, you will definitely want to try the 4 pack to see if your cats like it.  If they do then this size pack is quite a savings over the 4 packs so it is worth it. If they don't then you only lost a few dollars.
