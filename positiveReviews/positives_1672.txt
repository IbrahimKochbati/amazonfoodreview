I tried this product because it was a "Friday Special" and it caught my eye it being 100% fruit and 100% organic.  I don't have any children, but this looked interesting to try because I've been trying to eat healthier and sometimes it's hard to get my recommended amount of fruit servings a day.  I buy fruit but it always seems to go bad before I can eat it all.  I bought the banana mish mash also, and really like it, too.  I like to add it to my oatmeal, or spread it on top of my peanut butter toast, or just by itself!  To clarify the ingredients  it has 3 different fruits, not just peach and not just banana.  Obviously, I'm ok with this...just wanted to throw that out there.  There are multiple things I love about this product.  Here goes.. and not in any particular order...     1) Easy to open, convenient, resealable pouch     2) It tastes great!     3) All natural, 100% fruit...no nasty preservatives or chemicals     4) 100% organic     5) Great for everyone, not just babies.     6) The price is good compared with other similar products, and I love the free shipping!
