I repotted all my house plants with Miracle Gro last year.  All got gnats and earthworms (potted plants don't like earthworms). My plants were never so unhappy and sickly.  Not sure that it was the soil to blame, I repotted all the plants with a fresh bag of Miracle Gro in spring  (after soaking the roots in water bucket overnight to get rid of the earthworms).  Still have gnat and earthworm problems.     So it seems that Miracle Gro did not just stop screening the soil.  The mix was not heat treated properly to kill larvae and stuff. Do not use this  and, unless you want unhappy plants, gnat infestation, and earthworms!
