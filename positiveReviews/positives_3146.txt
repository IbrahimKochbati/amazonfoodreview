3 years ago I bought a Digidesign 002 protools rack and a lot of other equipment to start recording   but I could never get it to work with my OS on either computer.  I was at an impasse for a long time until I saw this product on Blue's website.  I already had a $400 condenser mic in the closet I had never gotten to use and didn't want to spend more money on a quality USB mic.  I couldn't be happy that this product exists   in it's quality or price!  I noticed no noise or coloration of the signal and it worked without a problem.  It does exactly what it's suppose to do    act like it doesn't exist.  It just serves it purpose to convert the signal well, and stays out of the way on everything else.  It does feel light weight and the signal was a little lower than i thought (as many reviews said) and that is the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars.  But I don't think that should keep anyone from getting this product.
