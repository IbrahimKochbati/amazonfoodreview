I bought this as Dr Oz recomended this for boosing your imune system. I used it in cooking and it tasted good for the first day. BUT the next day my soup smelled awful and we had to throw it out! It is also known as Devil's Dung and that is what the soup smelled like!!! I think I will put this in capsules and use it that way!     Live and learn. :o)
