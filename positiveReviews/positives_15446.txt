I love these cereal bars; they're delicious.  However, I loved them more when I had a greater variety to choose from. Snackwells really missed the mark by discontinuing the Cranberry Almond and Maplenut! They were my favorite!  Having only Cinnamon Raisin, Chocolate, and Peanut Butter makes Snackwells just like everyone else.  Boo!!          As for Amazon.com, whom I also love, but not in this case; WHY?  Well, most grocery stores sell them for under $3 so why would anyone by four boxes at $13.54 plus S&H and then have to wait for them to come when you can go down the street to the nearest store and pay $12??
