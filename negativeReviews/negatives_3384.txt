These were completely repulsive. After I tried one, I looked at the package ingredients. Liquid egg was listed as an ingredient. This explains alot. I don't eat eggs at all, so I imagine I was particularly sensitive to the flavor of egg in a cracker, but it seemed concentrated to me. I don't expect an eggy taste to a cracker, just buttery. It is strange that Glutino can sell pretzels that are better than the wheat based kind, and have these crackers taste so awful. I guess they work for some people, just really weren't for me.
