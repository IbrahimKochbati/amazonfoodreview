I have never used Tahini before   and my hummus was good, but always, something was missing... After I found out of Tahini, I ordered it (and it was shipped extremelly fast)and used it. The result was amazing! One spoon into the hummus prepared from one bag (1lb beans) and I had my favorite ready to go!
