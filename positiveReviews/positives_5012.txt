My 2 year old eats the Chocolate Munch Cookie and LOVES them. I bought them not because they were gluten free, but because they are sweetener free. He calls them "chocolate treat," if that gives you any indication of how good he thinks they are. I would definitely recommend this flavor to everyone. I have found that with the subscribe and save discount I can get the boxes cheaper on Amazon than in stores like Sunflower, Sprouts and Whole Foods.
