Originally, these were made in US. Now made in China ( see back of bag) ... advertised as natural,cage free, no hormones, no fillers, no antibiotics ...HUH? Not in China... I will not trust these as safe treats. Follow up:  My dogs vomited after they ate these. 3 09 original warnings from FDA 2007 re: chicken product from China... a follow up was issued by the FDA again on 12 18 08 to remain vigilant and of concern if fed to smaller dogs.          Update: DEC 2011 All chicken Jerky remains a problem according to the FDA (product from China noted again to be of concern)     Some dogs made ill from chicken jerky product recovered with treatment and others have died.     The email from my vet stated that the FDA would like you to report if you have a problem with chicken jerky treats.
