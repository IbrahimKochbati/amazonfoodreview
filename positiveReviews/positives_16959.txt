This is working great if dry food pellets you use are of the right size to be dispensed relatively easily.  The earlier version had a plastic "rope" which was easier to clean.  Also, the glass in my 2nd one is  oken.  Assume you will need to get a new one every 1 2 years or so.  I use it every day and my dog gets all her dry food (main source of food) from the bottle.
