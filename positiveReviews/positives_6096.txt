As far as instant coffees go, this one is amazingly good.  Usually, I have to use sugar with instant coffee, as they generally taste really bitter.  Not so with this one.  I can drink it straight and it tastes like real coffee.          While this will never fully replace  ewed Starbucks coffee for me, it is still pretty good and I will be keeping it my desk at work.
