Canidae is an excellent food that is meat based and is great for people who are looking for a top quality dog food, but don't want to  eak the bank. I know a lot of people who can not afford dog food that is extremely expensive, and yet they don't want to feed cheap fillers or grain based foods. If you are a person on a tight budget Canidae is worth a try. You will notice a big difference in energy as well as skin and coat. A lot of senior dogs switch to the ALS formula and have more zoomies and more energy than on other lower quality diets. Canidae is worth every penny.
