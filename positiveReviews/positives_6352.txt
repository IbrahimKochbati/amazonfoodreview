I tried this flavor within a variety pack and LOVED IT!  I usually add cream and sugar to my coffee.  With this k cup I added coconut creamer and found that I did not have to add any sugar!  It was so sweet and light and tasted just like a pina colada.  I absolutley love this k cup and am planning to sign up for subscribe and save on this one!
