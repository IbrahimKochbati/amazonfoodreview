I bought this because it was on sale and I was curious. It's made from the nectar of coconut flowers. It has this incredibly amazing flavor that is like sugar and coffee and caramel and chocolate and butter and maple and salt and cinammon and rich gooey goodness dripping through my mouth. One of the most delicious things I have ever tasted, and that's with a spoon straight out of the bag. I haven't even put it in anything yet.
