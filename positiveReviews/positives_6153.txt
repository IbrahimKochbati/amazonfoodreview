I love the fact that this is multi grain baby food.... but like people food, good for you things NEVER taste great... so mix it with bananas or some other fruit. Yes, the texture is a bit difficult to swallow for little ones, hence why you want to thin it out. I read the other reviews and can't believe they never thought to mix this food with something else.
