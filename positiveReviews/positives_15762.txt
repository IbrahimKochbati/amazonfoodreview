All four of my cats loved this canned cat food!  The food in each can really looked and smelled as if a human being could eat the food.          The seasame chicken entree and chicken pot pie entree were both very popular with my cats.  Neither flavor smelled bad.  The chicken pot pie entree was kind of runny, but my cats really enjoyed lapping up the juice.  I've feed my cats a few cans of each flavor, and none of them have got the diarrhea from the food.  Their stomachs seem to tolerate the food quite well.  I've had probelms in the past with canned cat food causing stomach and other digestive problems for my cats.          According to the can's list of ingredients, all the ingredients are natural   no by products are used.  While the food is not organic, at least the food doesn't use by products.  No wheat gluten is used either.     I went to the company's website and found that the company uses only dolphin safe tuna and does not use any child labor.  None of the ingredients come from China, which has a horrible record on food safety.  The cat food is made in  Thailand, but as far as I know, Thailand does not have a poor record of food safety, and Thai people do love their pet cats, I sure Thai pet owners would not want to harm their cats with poor quality pet food.  I personally see nothing to fear from Thai cat food.          I think I will be ordering more Petite Cusine in the future and would not hestitate recommending this food to my cat loving friends.
