I am a moderate drinker of both sodas and juices, so I was intrigued by the promise of The Switch.  I would receive the vitamin benefits of my juices with the fizzy fun of a soda.  The can is slim, so it fits nicely in my lunch bag but would rattle around in my car cup holder if I decided to take it as a to go  eakfast drink.  Once I had it all nice and chilled, I popped the top and listed to the fizz.  It was not quite the satisfying pop and fizz of a Coca Cola, but that is because this drink has less carbonation.  When I took a sip, I was immediately transported back to grade school field trips where we were given bag lunches with juice boxes.  While it was a nice moment of nostalgia, the novelty quickly wore off.  The juice was nice, but I am not sure the carbonation really added anything to it.          My biggest concern really deals more with the people who may not do their due diligence before deciding to purchase this product.  If you have a soda addiction, but you drink diet soda, this would be a calorie explosion.  While it is natural juice, you must remember that natural juice is high in sugar.  If you are accustomed to guzzling three or four sodas per day (or more) then you would not want to replace them with this beverage.  It must be approached with the same dietary caution as you would use with regular juice.  But if you have difficulty drinking juice or getting your recommended fruit servings each day, this might be a fun alternative.          The price is high compared to soda, but it is low compared to some other individually bottled canned juices.  I really liked the light kiwi berry taste more than the black cherry.  I think that it makes a nice treat, but it is not going to be complete substitute for me.
