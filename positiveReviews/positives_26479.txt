These chews have really helped with her bad  eath! They help kill the bacteria (I'm guessing) and remove plaque (with enzymes). I give her 1 or 2 a day, and she absolutely loves them. She can chew through one pretty fast. They are about 5 to 6 inches long and range from thin and crispy to thicker and more hard (all inside the same bag). I like the variety, and I think my dog does as well. They don't stain the carpet (I have almost white carpet). I recommend these over regular bones as a treat because the enzymes inside the bone really help dogs with their teeth, and do not just cover up bad  eath with a "doggie mint" I always like to supervise my dog when she is chewing a bone   give them to your dog when you are watching TV so or reading so you can keep an eye on your dog. Have fun :)
