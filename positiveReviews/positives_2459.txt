I'm glad my 45lb cocker standard poodle puppy loves the stuff because I trust the  and and its superior nutrition. Compare labels! My previous feed (Pedigree) was mostly corn. My little dude is healthy and happy and high energy and has a glossy coat. Also, superior nutrition produces smaller, compact stools.
