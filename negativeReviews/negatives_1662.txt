This was the most potent orange drink I have ever had. It might be "100% juice," but this drink has some kick.          There are no artificial sweeteners in this drink, but it is so highly concentrated that it was overwhelmingly sweet and even the tang of the carbonation couldn't cute into the sugary flavor.          It was WAY too strong for me and I thought it had kind of an odd aftertaste, but if you like carbonation and have a powerful craving for orange tangerine, this is the drink for you.
