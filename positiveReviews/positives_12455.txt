This is a great fruit soda, will surprise you if you are used to artificially flavored junk.          BUT... It's much cheaper in supermarkets. Trader Joe's, as noted above, sells it for under $3 in a four pack.          There also exists an all natural version without the preservative or artificial colors, that is sold in Whole Foods. Side by side it tastes a little better, but is more expensive. I prefer it.
