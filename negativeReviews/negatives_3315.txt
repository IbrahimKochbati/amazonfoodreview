I have always trusted the "Newman's Own"  and.  From popcorn to salad dressings, I have never been disappointed in one of their products.  Until now.  Each dog treat is scored to  eak it easy and is of similar size to a fig newton about 2" X 1 1 4 inch and quite thick   about 1 2 inch. And hard as a rock.  I am all for organic products, but when my dogs don't care for them, it's not like I can  ibe them to eat it like I can with kids.  Our dogs are around 15 20 pounds and I think these dog treats are a little bit too hard for them.  The first time we tried to feet these treats to them they turned up their noses. They were absolutely NOT interested at all.  The next time we tried they carried them around in their mouths for a minute or so, and decided, for some reason, that they were inedible.  However, the third try must have been when they were REALLY hungry because they appeared more interested. But this is more like rawhide than a "treat". Our dogs really had to work on this for a long time. Our younger dog, a Shih Tzu did okay and after about 15 minutes was making headway on eating it.  Our elderly Japanese Chin who is 14 (that's 98 in dog years) was  much more fussy.  She seemed interested for awhile and even though she still has all her teeth, she just couldn't be enticed to do much more than sniff it. Perhaps a larger dog would like these better. I haven't given up on "Newman's Own"  and but I doubt that I'll try their New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Biscuits (made with lamb and barley)again.
