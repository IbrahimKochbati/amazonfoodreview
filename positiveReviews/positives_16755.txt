Madhava Organic Agave Nectar was supposed to be an experiment for me when I purchased the first time a couple years ago. Now it is the main sweetener I use in cooking! It is a very light tasting natural sugar substitute that I keep on hand for all baking. I never have to worry about a sugar rush or dip in blood sugar when using agave nectar. It can even be used in my new favorite drink: prickly pear agave margaritas! So good! Subscribe and Save has made it easy to do so and less expensive than buying at the grocery store. Even though more natural products have become easily available I will continue to purchase from amazon since I know that it will be fresh and shipped super quick.
