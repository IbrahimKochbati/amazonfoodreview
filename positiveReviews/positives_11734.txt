These bars by Pamela's Products are very good and are just right when you need a quick snack. They are very chewy and the selection of ingredients are combined as to not dominate the other. The coconut does leave an aftertaste. I was surprised how tasty these are considering they are gluten free. As one reviewer stated, they do stick to your teeth and it's good to have a drink handy to wash it down with. These are tastier and healthier than your typical cereal bar even if they are a bit higher in calories. Good product.
