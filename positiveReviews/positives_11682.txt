I highly recommend these bars.  I actually got them because they were my name but ended up really liking them.  I tend to get low blood sugar attacks so I always carry food with me in case I get hungry.  I was surprised that these bars not only tasted good but they also stayed the hunger away for a great deal of time.  I wish I knew where I could purchase them locally.
