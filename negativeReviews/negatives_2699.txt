In order for tea to be labeled "decaff" is must be under 0.4% caffeine when residue levels are tested.  A tea at 2% caffeine is not decaff.  Non decaff tea is anywhere between 3 5% caffeine.  So ...  at 2% caffeine, this is a caffeinated tea, with caffeine slightly less than what is naturally present in the tea leaf.
