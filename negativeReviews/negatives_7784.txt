I thought I was getting a bargain.  I saw the product was available in bulk.  The price looked good. I ordered it.  Afterwards, I did the math.  I could have saved money buying the same quantity at my nearby chain grocery store.  I'll not be ordering a case of Mott's Strawberry Applesauce, 4 ounce Cups online again.
