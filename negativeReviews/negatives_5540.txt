There are few dinners easier and more satisfying than a coated pork chop.  For those that don't want the hassle and calories of frying, Shake N Bake and similar coatings have been a staple for years.  Just an egg wash, coat it with the mix and bake.  Its just that easy and just that good.          However, after trying both, I would still have to give the nod to Oven Fry extra crispy pork coating.  The SNB is a finer more powdery texture whereas the Oven Fry gives it a thicker more flavorful crust that keep juices in better.  Oven Fry gets a five from me, SNB only a three.  But either way you go, its better than a naked chop.
