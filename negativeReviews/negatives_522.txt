I bought this for our young son and was disappointed in several aspects of this dispenser:          (1) It's made of cheap plastic and arrived w  the globe scratched and cracked.          (2) The top doesn't screw on  it just pops off w  very little exertion.          (3) Part of the appeal for me was that this dispenser is coin operated.  What the description on Amazon doesn't tell you, however, is that a coin is not necessary to dispense the candy.  Furthermore, when the crank is just barely turned, the candy (usually two pieces) flies out so quickly that some goes on the floor w o your hand there to catch it.  A young child is often not coordinated enough to turn the crank and put his hand out to catch the candy.          (4) The dispenser only came w  enough candy to just fill the bottom of the globe.          (5) It is very much over priced at $29.99.
