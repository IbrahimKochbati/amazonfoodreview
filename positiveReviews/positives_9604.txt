Ordered the La Tourangelle Roasted Pistachio Oil, 8.45 Ounce Tin.  Arrived before I thought it would, super well packed for shipping.  I opened and tasted it immediately to check its freshness.  The pistachio nuts tasted like they had been freshly roasted, ground, and squeezed.  The oil exceeded my expectations.  Will buy more and share the experience with friends (cooks and chefs).
