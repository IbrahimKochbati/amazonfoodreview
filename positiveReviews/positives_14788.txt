I buy Mrs. Butterworth's Original Syrup from Amazon.com for two reasons: I'm crippled and housebound and can have items delivered to my door   and Mrs. Butterworth's is great on pancakes or hot biscuits and if you gain a little weight, who cares? Everyone will still love you as you are and you've had the pleasure of having Mrs. Butterworth's at your table!
