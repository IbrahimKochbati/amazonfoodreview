I am trying this tea to see if it speeds up my hair growth as most people have said it would.  It tastes great! I take some cheesecloth, put about 2 tablespoons in, tie it with string and let it seep in my tea for about 10 minutes for maximum potency. I will let you know how its working by the end of the month
