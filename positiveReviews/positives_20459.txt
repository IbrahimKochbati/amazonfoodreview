I really did not want to review this marmalade because it is soo good and soo hard to find. When Amazon finally had it I bought all available jars of it (nine)so I should be set for a while. it has a spectacular taste, hard to describe but to be compared with the affect canary diamonds have on people, we just do not want to live without them anymore.          Just in case y'all buy up the entire production of this divine marmalade, I planted a Yuzu tree which should withstand our North Georgia climate just fine and provide me with plenty of fruit to survive the times when y'all act as greedy as I did and buy up everything that is available.          This marmalade is not only good on toasted English muffins, it makes chicken salad sparkle end makes some creamy cheeses become memorable.
