Some licorice products leave the teeth with a black film but not so with the Panda soft licorice chews.  It is a delicious licorice product that improves with age, in my opinion.  The candy from a freshly opened box is very soft and tends to stick in the teeth more than candy from a box which has been opened and closed for several days because it hardens as air circulates around the candy.  If I place it in an airtight container, it remains soft, but I really love it as the texture changes.  The flavor is consistently delicious and it is now my licorice of choice.  I was expecting the box to contain a plastic bag but it simply has a plastic seal along the top of the box with nothing inside to seal.  Therefore, if you want your licorice to remain fresh, I'd recommend placing it in an airtight container.  I've also purchased the raspberry flavor but haven't tried that yet.  I have a hard time considering fruit flavored candies as "licorice," but enjoy the confection also.
