I guess I thought of this can as being the usual commercial #10 can, so the Price of about $16 a can did not seem too bad, but when they arrived I saw that these were somewhat smaller.  They are less than a half gallon.  I don't see the size as that much of a problem. All I have to do is rethink how I would use it in a recipe and free shipping helped with feeling better about the purchase, but if I saw that size can in a store I would not pay $16.00 for 51 oz. can.          I would have to see what fresh clams would cost first.  I would like if they made the clams bigger chunks, but I could buy some fresh to add to it.  Most clam chowder is made with bigger chunks than what Snow makes.          Good product despite the price!
