I ordered the the sweetner because I could not find it in stores anymore. The original dispenser was a much smaller container with a small flip lid that was very easy to get 1 or 2 tablets out. This new dispenser has a spring loaded mechanism that is supposed to shoot out 1 tablet at a time but half the time crushed bits of the tablet come out and sometimes nothing comes out . Another example how trying to make something so simple is made into something that seems smarter but is not!!!!!!!!
