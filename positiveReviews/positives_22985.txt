I am a great believer in olive oil, especially the benefits of cooking with extra virgin olive oil and name  and olive oil. Bertolli is consistent in quality, and extra virgin is less fattening even if the taste is supposedly not as good as the 100% pure variety. It's great as an oil and vinegar combination for salads, and in this poor economy, you will also find that it makes a great hair conditioner that is much cheaper than real hair conditioner.          As I said two products ago, you do what you have to do.
