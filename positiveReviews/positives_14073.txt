I'm a chomper.  When it comes to lollies, hard candies, chocolate, etc., I like to bite.  With these, I can simply let them melt in my mouth.  At just over an inch in diameter and less than an eighth of an inch thick, I have the patience to not chew these disks of chocolate heaven.  The salt on top is a luxury for your senses.  They must not put any in the chocolate itself, however, as there is only 50 mg. of sodium per serving (two servings per bag).  These chocolate rounds are an excellent way to indulge yourself.
