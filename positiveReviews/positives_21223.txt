It's freaking delicious. I make goat yogurt and this is better than anything I've bought commercially, so I'm really pleased.          BTW, I use my toaster oven as an incubator. I put a thermometer inside to monitor those low temperatures... So far so good and I'm glad I don't need another device in the kitchen.          Note that you need to start incubating at 75 degrees and then slowly raise the temp to 105, 110. Don't go much higher.. food enzymes start to die at around 116 degrees.          PS     The only reason why I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because the package did not give decent instructions for people working without the Yogourmet yogurt maker, and I wasted a batch by not cooling to 75 degrees. : )
