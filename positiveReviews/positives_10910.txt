With an ingredient list that includes barley, lamb, carrots, and apples (all organic), and a nice thick size, this makes my knucklehead happy. He's a mutt of mixed fox hound and beagle blood and just this morning he coughed up a Brillo pad when we were out for a walk, so take that into consideration if you wish. He has experienced no issues on the other end either, if you get my drift. If you are somewhat conscientious about what you feed your dog, you can't go wrong with these treats.
