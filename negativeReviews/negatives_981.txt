Thought I had died and gone to heaven when I made the bisquit recipe.  I was wrong! Went to indigestion hell.  I had serious hope for this product. I truley loved the mix, but it didn't love me.  I haven't had indigestion since I gave up gluten until I ate a bisquit from this mix.  Best luck on getting it right bisquick.
