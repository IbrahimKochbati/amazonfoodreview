There is nothing as delicious as the use of fresh herbs, this is no exception,     When I opened the bag the aroma was so sumptuous it's, the difference like     Having a shaker of pepper or fresh ground pepper which would you choose ?     I know what I want, there are also nutmeg grinders out there so it's easy to     Use or buy a little grater so you can put it straight over your dish.     I hope this review was helpfull, Bon appetite.
