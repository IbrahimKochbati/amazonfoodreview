These are great training treats when you need something lightweight that won't make a mess of your pockets. I have a couple problems with them though. First, they are too expensive for every day training. Second, the sizes are so inconsistent that you need to cut some of the large cubes up (at this price, they should be ready to eat). Actually there is a third, which is that the powder leftover on the bottom is useless to me.          I've found it much cheaper to just put some sliced beef liver from the store in the oven and bake till dry. Cut it up, put it in small portions, and freeze. My dog likes it better than the freeze dried anyway. I do a whole bunch at a time so I am not prepping frequently. But I figure if I have to prep something, it might as well be something cheap!
