It has been mentioned that you only use HALF the Splenda blend than regular  own sugar, which is very cool. The only problem I have run into is when I need  own sugar for volume (making a crust for my rhubarb crunch), half does not work, so I end up using regular  own sugar (rather than double Splenda). Other than that it works like a charm and you can hardly taste the difference!
