Since learning my husband has celiac disease, he hasn't been able to eat pizza with us on homemade pizza nights. It used to be a treat. So I was excited when I first tried the  ead mix thinking he could enjoy pizza again. However, the dough never seems to bake throughout; it always turns out gummy. We've tried letting it rise even longer than the hour recommended, even that didn't help. I still have a few bags left so I'm going to try something other than pizza.
