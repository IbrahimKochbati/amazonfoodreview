We switched to tea sometime back.We  ew a pot in the morning and if anything is left over my wife has it as ice tea later in the day,so we waste nothing.     For me Orange Pekoe rules, it's a matter of personal taste as there is a very wide selection of teas on the market.     Brooke Bond has been around for years,you cannot go wrong with any of their products.
