I have not had many  ands of grape leaves   big grocery store chain deli (I think they have the Divina  and), and a couple others.  I liked the Roland  and especially for the price.  At around 2$ lb. that beats the 5 7$ lb. anywhere local, and the taste is fairly close (a little less).  But, I do like to add fresh lemon juice as the directions recommend.  They are fairly soft and a few came apart while serving (not a big deal), but as far as texture is concerned, I'd prefer them with more leafy texture.  Overall, I can't complain   a little less flavor texture, but a lot better value.
