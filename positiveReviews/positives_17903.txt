I have to say i was surprised with the shaken bake. I rarely cook pork and decided to try, I picked up some pork loin 1 2 thick and tossed them around in a bowl, I covered 8 pieces with enough left to sprinkle on top. I even cooked them on a cookie sheet on the covered grill instead of the oven as it was to hot to cook inside. I checked on them with a meat tester and did not turn them as listed in instructions. They came out tender inside with a crispy crust, everyone liked them. I gave it a 4 out of 5 because although I liked the flavor it was very salty to me, no one else noticed but I rarely use salt cooking and it really sticks out to me. I would be willing to try a reduced sodium version. 240mg per 1 6 of a packet.
