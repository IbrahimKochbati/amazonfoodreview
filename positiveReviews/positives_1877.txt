If you're a fan of full bodied coffees, give this one a shot.          For my taste, the vast majority of k cups are too watery and weak (even on the small cup setting), so I gravitate towards the extra bold varieties.  I had previously been enjoying Newman's Own Extra Bold and GM Dark Magic.  After reading some favorable comparisons between those and Mahogany, I decided to give it a chance.          I find that it's slightly less bitter (not that bitter is bad) than Newman's EB or Dark Magic, and a little smoother.  I also think it's more full bodied without any burned bean flavor.  I've tried the Mahogany on the larger cup setting and actually still liked it    something I've never said before.
