This was actually a gift to my daughter (along with 3 cases of other Baxter's soups). She's of the opinion that Baxter's is absolutely the BEST canned soup on the Planet (of the soups she's tasted, which include the major American  ands   she doesn't cook much). The Lobster Bisque rated just below Baxter's Scottish Smoked Salmon (which she rated the BEST EVER). (From my own perspective, and usually cooking my own food, I have to admit that the Baxter's soup line, for canned soup, is superior).
