   class "tiny"  Length:: 0:48 Mins              Our golden retrievers love this toy, I have to buy another one because my 2 year old dog hogs it and won't let the other dogs play with it.  Best dog toy I ever bought.  you won't be dissapointed.  Great for smart dogs who get bored easily.  Hours of fun.
