I actually bought a box in Walmart. It was, needless to say, inexpensive so I thought it was worth a taste test. One cup was Barry's Classic blend(loose), one cup Tetley (bag) and the other was Lipton (loose). Tetley's came in a distant distant 2nd while Barry's and Lipton were tied for first. Both were very similar in body, richness and strength. A word of warning don't ever buy cheap (in quality) loose or bagged tea. It will be stems and bits of leaves swept up from the floor at least that is what it looks and tastes like. The tea should be just leaves as dark  own as semi sweet chocolate. All good (and some bad) tea is grown in Africa, India and Sri Lanka ( Ceylon).
