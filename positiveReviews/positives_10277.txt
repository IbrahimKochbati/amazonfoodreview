This is a nice freezer tray. The base is so supple; it's really easy to pop the food out. The size is a little large for what I need at the moment. My baby is 6 months old and only eats the ice cube size portions right now, but I can see that the larger size of this Beaba tray will come in handy as my baby grows.
