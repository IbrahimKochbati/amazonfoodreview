I am so happy to try and enjoy pop chips. They were recommended on calorie count.com, products like this are not available at local grocers. Caloriecount.com mentioned the snacks were available from Amazon.com which we all know is easy to order and accept delivery to your door. The pop chips are delicious, they come in many flavors. I have ordered them twice and shared them with friends. We love the single serving 100 calorie packs. The treats are tasty and delicious. I am on an email list to alert me when the jalepemo flavored pop chips become available. Thanks Amazon! I am planning to order them again for snacks on a family vacation. The variety will make this a fun treat and when compared to other 100 calorie treats this product gets a 10 10 rating from our family.
