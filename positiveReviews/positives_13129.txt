I had been using this cat food for several months.  I had rescued a cat looking awfully skinny and dehydrated and as she began to fatten a little she quickly showed signs of pregnancy.  She gave birth a few weeks late to 6 kittens and I still have them all.  They have been fed nothing but Diamond once weaned and have beautiful coats and are very healthy and bouncy.  So thankful for Diamond.
