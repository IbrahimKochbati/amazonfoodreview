I was a little skeptical when ordering this product. With everything it had going for it I figured there had to be a catch. Wheat Free, Gluten free, Non Dairy   I wasn't expecting much in the way of flavor. I was pleasantly surprised that, while it seems subdued, there is flavor and it's alright. I can taste the chocolate & the coconut predominately. As it states on the box, they are "moist & chewy". I wasn't a fan of the texture at first but by the time I got to the 3rd bar it was fine.          What I didn't like is that one bar has 180 calories (80 of which come from fat). So much for a healthy "whenever" bar.          15mg of Cholesterol, 130mg of sodium (yikes), 23g Total Carbohydrates, 2g of dietary fiber, 8g of sugar, 2g of protein.          It also states that there are 180mg Omega 3 fatty acids, 9 grams of whole grains, & 0 grams trans fats.          The numbers above are for 1 bar which   1 serving.          This product contains coconut, eggs, soy, and almonds. It is processed on equipment that also makes products containing peanuts, other tree nuts, soy, and milk.          So this isn't something I would personally chose to get again. They're alright in terms of flavor but they just seem to have too much of a downside when inspecting the label.
