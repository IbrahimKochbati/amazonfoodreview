bought this 5 hour energy knockoff at local grocery shop. I couldn't have more than 3 sips of the orange flavor, had to dilute with mountain dew, but even then it was bad. Few days later, I tried this grape flavor to help me with an all nighter. I had one sip and I almost threw up. I'm not lying! This is a horrible drink and should not be consumed. I never created a review, and i shop a lot here, but this one of those times that you strongly feel about something (either real good, or real bad) Do yourself a favor, buy just one can to try for yourself. Obviously the previous review is by the manufacturer.
