With Amazon Prime free shipping this food is a great deal. Much cheaper than in the pet store.          My two dogs, both seniors, love this food. My small dog has a skin problem during the warmer months and this food has helped him to not be so itchy. My large dog has arthritis, for which he is taking a glucosamine chondritin MSM supplement and aspirin. When my large dog began eating this food, after a few weeks I saw an improvement in his movement. Not so stiff now and it's easier for him to jump.          Recommended for people who have senior dogs with skin or arthritis problems.
