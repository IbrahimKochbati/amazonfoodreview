POPCHIPS CHILI LIME POTATO is a crunchy potato chip, that is not your grandfather's potato chip.  First, for the positive comments.  The chips are salty, but not so salty that you will experience a pressing urge to drink a cup of cool water.  The chips are crunchy and crisp, but they do not produce several fragments when you  eak them.  In other words, they  eak very cleanly.  Although the chips are a new product, they resemble a traditional potato product where thin sliced aged potatoes are first dipped in low temperature oil, allowed to cool, and then dipped in a high temperature oil, where the high temperature provokes expansion resulting in a puffy potato.  This product apparently uses this type of technology, not for ordinary sliced potatoes, but for potato chips. Best of all, this product is tangy with a slight hotness and a slight lime flavor.  The chips are round, perhaps resembling a deflated bean bag chair, and sprinkled with red dots.  The product is pleasant to the eye.  For those who become addicted to this product, there is little need to worry about calorie overload.  The reason you don't have to worry about calorie overload is that the ratio of carbohydrates to fat is about 16 grams carbs 3 grams fat.  And now, for the negative comments.  I have no negative comments about the POPCHIPS CHILI LIME POTATO product.
