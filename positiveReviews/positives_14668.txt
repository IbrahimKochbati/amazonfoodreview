My favourite tea in loose leaf form... it just doesn't get any better than this.  The tins are a good size (not so small that it's gone after four cups of tea but not so large that it'll be stale and moldy before you could possibly finish it) that fit nicely in my desk at work as well as on the counter by the teapot.  The tea is fresh and flavourful with the quality I've come to expect from Twinings.
