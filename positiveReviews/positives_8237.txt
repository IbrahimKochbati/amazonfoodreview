Hemp foods are great, the slightly nutty taste is always something I enjoy. I almost rated this item four stars because it doesn't have a strong hemp seed taste   but after some thought it is probably best that way.          I add a bit of  own sugar and one packet will fill me up (not true with most other oatmeals).
