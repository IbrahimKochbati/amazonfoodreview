I will never understand the soaps from mainstream, and sometimes otherwise great  ands, who claim to have a line of "sensitive skin" products which still contain Sodium Lauryl or Laureth (as in this case) Sulfate. If you're someone who needs sensitive skin products there's a more than decent chance that you also need stuff without SLS. Boo. Refer to their bar soap, which is wonderful.
