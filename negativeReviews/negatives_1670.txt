Nice idea...to create self filling cups for those who own Keurig Brewers but want to use their own bagged coffee, or those who do not want to incur the high cost of purchasing pre made  ewing cups.  The idea is, one takes a plastic cup, puts in the pre molded filter, adds one's own coffee grounds, closes the cup with the lid and then pops the cup into the  ewer, disposing of it at the end.  However...the plastic on the cups is a bit flimsy, such that if one pushes too hard down on the lid, the entire cup collapses, accordion style...another drawback is that the lids do not fit snugly without careful maneuvering, so that it can take longer than one might expect to close the cups...these two problems defeating the purpose of "fast" which is basically the primary advantage of Keurig  ewers in the first place.  Another advantage of the  ewer is the lack of a mess, which these cups also do not address well....there is always coffee left to either drip down or on top of the lid following  ewing which requires cleanup of the cup holder...granted it is not major clean up, but nevertheless...  And finally, the potential advantage of cost savings...the cups appear to be relatively inexpensive, but add in the cost of shipping and handling, which is some $6 on top of the featured price (about 50% more), and the per cup price increases...try purchasing multiple packages to reduce shipping cost...no go, the company just doubles the cost of shipping one package; ergo, if you were to say order 100 cups, you would pay more than 30 dollars and a third would be shipping and handling.  In addition to the other problems with the design, it more or less defeats the purpose.  Large packages of the pre made pods can be purchased for nearly the same per pod cost.  Would not recommend these, until the company lowers shipping costs, improves design, or both.  You're better off just using the mesh filter pod that comes with your  ewer, and simply rinsing it out...same time involved, less cost and lower environmental impact.
