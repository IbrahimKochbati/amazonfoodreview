Super crispy and great flavor, I was very pleased with this product.  I do not fry much of anything and this is really close to crisp fried meat without the grease.  I also made some potato wedges on the same pan after rolling them in the remaining crumbs.  These were what my sister calls Jo Jo's and were very much enjoyed also.
