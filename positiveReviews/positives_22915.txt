"Plantation Mint" recreates old traditional Southern USA fine, mellow, balanced black tea with cool spearmint to invigorate, refresh and soothe at any time. Good icy or hot. Good with or without cream or honey. With natural spearmint leaf added to good black tea leaf. With richly balanced tea and mint in individual sealed steeping bags. Healthful antioxidants from both the black tea and spearmint. Soothes even someones belly as well as attitude due to MELLOW spearmint known to do so    such as versus ache, nausea, heartburn and indigestion. Not somewhat harsh like peppermint yet not somewhat bland like green tea. BALANCED indeed. Great virtue at a small price for this pack of six 20 count boxes. Bigelow and Amazon, thank you ever so kindly +++
