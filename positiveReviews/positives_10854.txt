Newman's Own Organics   New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats, Lamb and Barley Recipe, are a hit with my dog. I own a Shar Pei Beagle mix with an extremely finicky appetite. She is very hard to buy treats for, as she turns her nose up to most dry, larger treats. I had my misgivings about this product, as the treats are larger than I expected, two cookie like squares attached to each other. There is also no powerful or distinct smell of her usual favorite treats, peanut butter or cheese. Yet, every time I give one to her it disappears in seconds! I'll definitely be buying more of these.          I'm also grateful for the healthier ingredients: organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic apples, organic palm oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols, a source of Vitamin E), and organic molasses.
