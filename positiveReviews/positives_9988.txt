you do need to know that five pounds is a bunch of coffee. if you have two people drinking about 4 6 cups a day (i think our grind &  ew carafe counts five ounces as a cup), which i think was our rate, it will take you about month to five weeks to get through it. after four weeks it can lose a good deal of its flavor, so you want to try to use it before then.  we keep the unused portion in ziploc gallon bags, otherwise i don't think we would even get four to five weeks out of it.  for the price, you can't beat it, and if the last little bit gets a little stale then you can always move on to another bag or realize that you need to find someone to coffee pool with next time you order a five pound bag. they also sell one pound bags, which i've not tried yet.
