I normally purchase already grown containers of cat grass at my local pet store. However, the last few pots developed bugs in them, which just wasn't sanitary. I bought these seeds from Hirts and they grew insanely fast! My cats love the taste. I've already bought another pack so I can re plant once the cats finish off this batch.
