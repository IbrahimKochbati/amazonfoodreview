I swear, my dogs eat better than I do. And while my dogs are hardly picky, they definitely love these treats. I am a little curious about how there is stamp on the side of the bag that says it's not for human consumption. If it's all organic meat with no wheat or additives, why can only dogs eat them? More of joke than anything, just amused me. But there aren't a whole lot of treats in the bag and they're not cheap, so I guess it just boils down to the question of how healthy should a dog treat be, and honestly, how healthy are they anyway over the next  and? I don't know, but my dogs like them and that's a success for me.
