I've enjoyed this chai for over six years now and still can't wait to wake up in the morning to a cup (my reason to jump out of bed). The company recently discontinued the spicy mix (orange box), but they would like to hear your comments; possibly if there was enough interest they would reintroduce it. I usually add extra cinnamon and cloves to the original variety.
