I create language teaching materials for a living on both PCs and Macs. Not only do I care about the sound quality of audio recordings for voice, but I record a lot of music as well. For work I that I do at home, I bought the Blue Microphones Icicle to use with high quality condenser mics. Before buying I read lots of reviews here and some others online.          When the Icicle arrived, it worked fine right of the bat. Since then I have recorded hours and hours of audio on it, using both PCs and Macs. Not once have I had any problems with the product.
