The aroma of this blend is sharp and bold, but not as appealing as some of the other varieties ive tried, semi astringent. I  ewed this on the 7.25oz setting and found it to be strong and dark enough to use milk and one tsp of sugar.     The taste is underwhelming, and seems to be along the lines of an average at best cup of coffee. The taste characteristic is along the lines of walnut and  andy, which is nice but not present enough to make this blend memorable.     It is as drinkable as a mild cup of starbucks coffee...
