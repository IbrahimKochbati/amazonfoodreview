At 60 years old I have had the care of cats my entire life.  Presently have four cats, three of which were "barn cats" and one came out of the woods and adopted us.  These cats love and gobble up Friskies Pate varieties "Mariner's Catch", "Sea Captain's Choice" and "Ocean Whitefish with Tuna".  I also serve as a "foster parent" for the local pet shelter and find that these 3 varieties of food are the best tolerated and completely consumed of all varieties.  The "Salmon" pate is very rich and I use it only as a special treat.  Incidentally, my cats always reach great age on Friskies.  Our cat "Kitten" died at 23 years old. She jumped off of a high bed and severely injured her spine and at the time it happened the Vet asked what food we used all of those years.  It has always been Friskies...dry and wet pet foods.  I find it is the best value and maintains our pet's good health right to the end.  The youngest cat that has died in our care was 18 years old and I have have had 28 cats as permanent pets, and countless foster pets over the years.
