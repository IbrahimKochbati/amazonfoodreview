There was a pumpkin shortage in our local supermarkets, so I resorted to ordering this case online.  Besides the fact that ten out of the twelve cans were dented, I used one can out of pure desperation.  Yes, I was desperate for pumpkin.  It's watery.  It's not solid packed.  And using the same ingredients I always do in the dish I used it, it was sub par.  I have since sent the product back mainly because of the dented situation   otherwise, I probably would have given it to a food bank or something   they don't take dented cans either and rightfully so!  Amazon took it back and I'm sure will be crediting my money.  I WISH I HAD READ THE OTHER COMMENTS before I purchased this.  Beware of dented cans.
