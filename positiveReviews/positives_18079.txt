This coffee is amazing.. we stayed at the Shore Club in Miami Beach and we had some of this coffee with our  eakfast at Ago Restaurant.  Hooked ever since, this is the only coffee I ever drink now.  Starbucks, Caribou are nothing compared to this.  One sip or sniff of the aroma, will get you hooked forever.  If you ever make it out to South Beach, ILLY has a store on Ocean Drive.
