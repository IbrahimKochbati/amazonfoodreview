I really enjoy this and can enjoy it because the calories are so low. I like to sprinkle it on yogurt...apple, banana, plain...it's really yummy. My daughter puts it into her protein shake in the morning and has said dipping banana pieced or celery is also good. We've finished the jar and are starting on the 16oz pack. I hope this is a product that will stay around!
