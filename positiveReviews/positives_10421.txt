I used Cavenders Greek seasoning for the first time several years ago when my sister sent me 2 8 oz. containers as part of a birthday gift.  It is one of the best, most useful and prolific gifts I have ever received.  I use this seasoning on chicken, beef, pork and seafood dishes and in soups and stews as well.  This is one of the best seasonings I have ever used.  I refuse to cook without it. I use the salt free Cavenders as often as I use the Cavenders with salt.  Whatever your choice,I suggest that everyone who wants to pump up the flavor of their foods try this seasoing and like me, you will make it a staple in your household.
