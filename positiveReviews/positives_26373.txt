My dogs go crazy for these chews!  They are their absolute favorite treat.  I like that the sizes vary so I can give the smaller size to my older dog and the rest to the other two.  The best part is that these chews help keep their teeth clean.  I also use the CET toothpaste.  These chews seem to digest just fine so no worries about that.  I recommend these highly.
