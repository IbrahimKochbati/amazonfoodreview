I have to admit, I'm no stranger to dog treats.  I've had about forty years worth of dogs, and they've all gotten one sort of biscuit or another, and I've tasted the varieties.  With only two exceptions I've not been able to discern any of the advertised flavors.  Neither peanut butter, nor liver, nor any of the assorted others.  The best biscuit I've tasted was given out at a neighborhood coffee spot.  The waitress  ought it out to the table I was sharing with my good dog Sam, and asked me if I'd like to give it to him.  It looked an awful lot like the scone I had on my own plate, so I said yes, and waited for her to leave.  Once she was out of sight I tasted it, and if it wasn't the same as my scone it was darn close.  Since I had my own, Sam got his, but I have considered going back for coffee and a doggy treat sans doggie.  The other biscuit whose flavoring I could taste was baked by my wife and it was something like an over baked crust of  ead.  My good dog Shalako ate 'em up   I passed on future offerings.          On to Newman's Own.  I'm a sucker for anything Newman's Own   not that I like everything the company puts out, but I appreciate the altruism   so I jumped at the chance to review Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley etc's.  Upon opening the package I was hit with an aroma.  Nothing that got my mouth watering, but very few dog biscuits have an aroma, so that was a good sign.  The biscuits were a good color   standard  own, but they didn't look dyed.  Another good sign.  What also surprised me was how solid they were.  Not at all crumbly, and it took a bit of effort to  eak it in half, even though each biscuit is scored for  eaking.          I put the first biscuit behind my back and changed hands a few times, spreading the aroma.  When I held my closed fists out for Sam to choose the one with the biscuit he sniffed both but fixated on the correct one right away.  It was that good aroma.  When I gave it to him I think he was as surprised as I with its hearty texture.  I could see it was a good tooth cleaner, and as Sam never gets animal bones, a good thing to have.  The next test was for him to choose from hands that each held a biscuit, one with Newman's, the other with another  and.  The strong aroma didn't work to Newman's advantage this time, and Sam went for the hand with his old familiar treat.  But as soon as he downed it he was sniffing around for the Newman's Own that I still held out in front of me.          I don't know if these tests prove anything.  I skipped the human taste test as the biscuits are so durable I was afraid I'd crack an implant.          I'd buy Newman's if I saw them, but not for myself.  I'd get them for Sam.  He's a dog who deserves a good treat.
