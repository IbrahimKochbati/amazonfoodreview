I haven't seen this  and in cans before; how exciting!  I know this  and can be hard to find at the store so it is nice to see it being sold here at Amazon.  I am a big fan of 100% juice that has been lightly carbonated and have tried the few  ands that are available and Switch is one of my favorites.  My biggest beef with the  and is that it is just super hard to find, which has now been resolved.  I have to say that I don't love the orange tangerine flavor, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five;  I just don't really like orange flavored drinks but did like how this one had more tangerine flavor than straight up orange.  I would definintely recommend this  and!
