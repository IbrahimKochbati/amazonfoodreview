Yeah, get in a rush and "combine to save" , looked at ticket later and found that we had paid 8$+ for shipping of a 3 dollar box of salt. Which we could have got at about 25 places in town. Will have to say it was well packed and arrived quickly. So they did deliver. Well recommended if you reallllly need salt and are in realllllly remote location. hehe
