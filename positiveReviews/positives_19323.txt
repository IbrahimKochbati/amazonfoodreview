This is a nice tasting white tea.  When  ewing the Strawberry Paraiso make sure to steep for 2 minutes. You can boil the water in a teapot, but remember to add some ice cubes to cool it down in your tea maker.  The temperature is supposed to be at 175 degrees. It is my favorite so far from Teavana. Yum!
