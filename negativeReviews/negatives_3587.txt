These crackers used to taste delicious and, although not necessarily the healthiest snack, they were really great to munch on! But, I just recently opened a box and, after one telltale bite, I was disappointed to find that they now add autolyzed yeast extract, a common favor enhancer that is practically the same as MSG.  I have adverse reactions to both MSG and autolyzed yeast extract. Too bad they ruined this product for me and other MSG sensitive folks out there.  I wonder why they did it?!
