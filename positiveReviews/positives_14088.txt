Not a connoisseur by any stretch, but tea is whole leaf and tastes good.  Considering the Twinnings tins in the store give you about 1 5th the amount for the same price (and it's tea leave dust) this is all the more valuable.  1lb lasts a while so maybe portion into zip top bags for longer storage.          Not sure how folks cannot make a strong cup of tea with this product. It has the capacity to make rocket fuel if you use too much.
