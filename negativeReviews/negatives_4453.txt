When i first opened the box it looked perfectly fine. the expiration date was april 2012 the bag seemed fine. That is until i went to open the corner. The resealable pouring spout was already opened. The seal is supposed to be intact until it is opened for the first time. To me it looks as if someone had reused this bag. Im not entirely sure if it is even the same dog food. Someone could have just put in what ever they feel like and called it "Canidae" and charged me $55.00. The dog food looked different as well. it had the same texture but the pieces were all bigger and a darker color. I had a bag of canidae that i had from before so i compared them! I will not be feeding this to my dog. I guess lesson learned from buying on the internet. maybe my story will make you think twice. on the  ight side the price was cheaper and the shipping to hawaii for me was less than a week! free shipping i may add! So buy at your own risk! My dogs health isnt worth taking a chance that it could be canidae in there! I want to be certain that it is 100 % canidae!!           Phillip
