They are OK, but my husband only eats them when we are in car. We keep them there for a celiac snack. (Hard to find when roaming around.) He won't eat them otherwise. They are definitely raspberry, but are kind of dry.       We have never tried any other snack bars, so in all honesty they may be the norm. I don't know.       We DO like Enjoy Life's other products.       They are GF, have no MSG or related products or aspartates.
