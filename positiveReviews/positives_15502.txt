I tried the traditional chai mix at the coffee cart at Scripps Institution of Oceanography and it was, needless to say, love at first sip.  So, when I found the vanilla chai mix on Amazon, I simply had to have it.  Aside from the fact that all I could do with my milk is microwave or boil it, this mix is absolutely heavenly.  For Chai purists who are used to the traditional way of making chai, this may not be necessarily your first choice, but for those of us amateurs, it offers a quick fix.  My only suggestion is, if you happen to be lucky enough to own an espresso machine that can foam your milk, make sure you do so as it seems to be what added the additional body that I enjoyed at the coffee cart but failed to reproduce at home.
