Absolutely great,  i used to make my home made yoghurt using a pot of natural yoghurt added to the milk , i decided to give a try to the yogurmet starter and results .....this is much better, faster and it get the job very well done,  with solid and  compact yoghurt even with the skimmed milk i use.     you cannot go wrong with it ! highly recommended ...just make sure you don't buy it all !!!i as i will buy again soon !
