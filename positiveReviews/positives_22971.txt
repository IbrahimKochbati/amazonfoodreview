The flavor, like the previous reviewer said, is hard to describe. I'm thinking Green Apple Mountain Dew. It's really good. And it works. Great for a mid morning coffee slump pick me up. And I like that I can choose the amount I use, unlike a regular energy drink. This price is absolutely ridiculous though. I can get it at a local gas station for two dollars a bottle, not seven.          Four stars for a five star product and a one star price.
