Best Gluten free crackers I've had yet, amazon's price on this item is a bit high, buy from whole foods for less.  The box comes with two air tight packs which is good for keeping them fresh, but like many GF foods it's not a really full box.  If you expecting an amount similar to a full box of ritz it's not even close.  But compared to other GF foods the price is comparable to similar crackers.
