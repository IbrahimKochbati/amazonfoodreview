I gave my dog one of these every evening to clean her teeth and I noticed she would gulp abnormally loud to get them down, but I thought nothing of it. That is until tonight when she started choking on a piece that she tried to swallow, after she had been chewing on it for a while and softened it with her saliva. Reading other reviews about this product confirmed my suspicions that this was not a rare occurrence. One should always monitor and supervise their dogs when they are chewing something whether it is a toy or a treat, however, you should not expect your dog to choke on a chew treat under otherwise normal circumstances. I will throw this bag out and stick with dental chews like Greenies that she can chew into smaller pieces and not lodge into her airway. If you value your dog's life I would stay away from this product!
