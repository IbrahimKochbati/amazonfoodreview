Upon recieving order, Boston Baked Beans were immediately thrown in the trash. It may be a personal preferrence but, they were hard as a rock and not soft at all where the coating is concerned.They were removed from my list. I ordered a good supply but, was really disapointed. Not so much in the seller but, in the product.
