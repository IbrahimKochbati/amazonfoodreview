I was expecting  ead like the package says, NOT! Its like eating a sticky chewy pancake.  And on top of that its pretty much tastless.  Im not impressed at all.  The only reason I gave this 2 stars is its better than nothing.  But for the price I paid I expected something special.  I won't buy this again.  Also it says on the package to ad cheese if you desire.  Its like a whole cup of cheese, and cheese is expensive.  I haven't tried it without cheese but I will try the next batch plain.  Oh well still searching for a decent  ead substiute.
