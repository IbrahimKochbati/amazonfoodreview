Possibly the best candy you can buy. Tart and tangy, bursting with flavor, bet you cant eat just one. I have tried other, but the Haribo Gummis are the very best. You cant beat te 5 pound bag, as the candy store in my town wants $1.98 for a 3 oz. bag. The white grapefruit are also very good, they both are tangy and not super sweet. It is so nice when they come right to your door, I will not buy candy any other way, especially Haribo products. Amazon Rules.
