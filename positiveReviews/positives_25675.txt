I find the tabs so convenient to take with me in my purse and also use them at home.  Best part is each tab is the equivalent of one teaspoon of sugar which is all I want.  The packets are the equivalent of two teaspoons   I don't want the waste or mess of using one half of a packet.  Wish they were easier to find locally since the shipping was not free.
