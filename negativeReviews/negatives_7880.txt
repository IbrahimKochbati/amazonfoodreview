I just had to warn potential buyers of this product that it may not stay down in certain dogs with sensitive stomachs; after trying 3 times (each time a smaller piece of the whole) with our malamute mix, with the same upset stomach results, they are now on the banned list for her.  Just thought you should know!  I do have 5 others dogs who seemed to do OK with them....but I wonder what it is that bugs her?!
