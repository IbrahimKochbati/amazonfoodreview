Just got this coffee in the mail today, it arrived early on the estimated delivery date. I am currently drinking a cup and its smooth and goes down easy not really acidic. I use half and half and splenda but I was be good with just cream,milk,half and half etc no sugar or sweetener needed. 48 cups for the price is a little much considering there are places that sell 96 for 51$ also you have to factor in the cost of shipping. If your looking for K cups in bulk try coffeeforless.com otherwise this is fine.
