I rarely eat mayo and haven't bought a jar of it in years. However, since I am pregnant and had a hankering for a BLT, I did want a touch of mayo on it so it wouldn't be dry. Picked up a jar of the regular lemonaise at Fresh Market b c it was the least expensive canola based mayo on the shelf.          That BLT was the best I have ever tasted. Granted, I used some awesome bacon (Nueske's applewood smoked), some wonderful tomato stand vine ripe tomatoes, and some yummy fresh italian sourdough  ead (lightly toasted) (plus some standard iceberg lettuce), but the mayo really stood out. Delicious. Tangy. Fresh & not overprocessed tasting.          My husband was quite surprised to hear me raving over a jar of mayo, since I order everything w o it. This stuff, lemonaise, however, is definitely an exception.
