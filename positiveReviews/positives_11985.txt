Freeze dried liver treats are easy to carry around in a treat pouch, don't have to be refrigerated and, so far as I know, are healthy, high protein snacks without a lot of chemical additives and preservatives. All of those attributes are nice but wouldn't be so important if the dog didn't like them. Our dog, who gets lots of small, bite size treats as part of his continuing training, gets tired of diced sausage shaped moist food from the pet store and cut up franks from the grocery, but he'll run a mile for a liver treat! I do wish they were smaller and or less expensive. We usually cut them in quarters with a sharp knife to make them last longer.
