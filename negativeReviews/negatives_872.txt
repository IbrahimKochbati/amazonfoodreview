I concur with previous reviewers in that these muffins have such a bitter taste! I also bake often and I'm certain it wasn't me. My gluten eating husband didn't like them either. They were also dense.     If you are looking for an apple cinnamon flavor and need a mix, you might be better off using Pamela's Baking Mix (which is awesome!) and adding apples and cinnamon to it. The muffin recipe is on the back of the Pamela bag.     In conclusion, I don't recommend these; they were really disappointing.
