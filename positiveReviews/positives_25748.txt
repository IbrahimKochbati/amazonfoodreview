You know, when they say it's sugar free, carb free, you tend to think it'll be taste free.  Being a diabetic, I was desparetly wanting some flavor on my chicken wings, and I thought I'd give this a try.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It tastes pretty good!  My only negative would be that its a little runny, but I can live with that.
