These are supposed to be cherry and  andy filled chocolates. If they contain  andy, it is too subtle for me to detect. A clue to the cause may be the stickiness of the package and the cracks in the candies. It appears they were mistreated at some point and may have leaked. But the box they came in shows no damage. A friend speculated that airline decompression burst them. Maybe, but other imported chocolates don't suffer this problem.          I should also mention that the chocolate tastes a little bit dusty on the outside.          I can't really recommend these Laroshell candies. There are other  ands which are quite good.
