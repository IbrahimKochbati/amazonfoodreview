This is not Decaf "Extra Bold". Something is wrong with the computer or the person shipping the product. They have sent Decaf "Light Roast" twice in place of Decaf "Extra Bold". This really needs to be fixed. I sent back the first order. The second order they decided to overnight to me to make up for the mistake. I know the second time it also said Decaf "Light Roast" on the box, but I opened it anyway in hope it was just marked wrong on the outside box and inside would be the correct product. No such luck. I now have coffee I don't want. I'm sure the Decaf Extra Bold is great coffee but if they can't send it I can't try it!!!
