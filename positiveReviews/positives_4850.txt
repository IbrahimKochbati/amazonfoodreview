I love Sleepytime tea at night while I'm laying in bed reading a book, winding down for sleep. It has a fresh, comforting flavor, and a really great scent. It is a main part of my relaxing bedtime ritual, and I make use of Amazon's automatic re ordering program, which saves me So Much money compared to grocery store prices. I only gave 4 stars because after about a week of drinking it every night it kind of loses it's charm. That's when I alternate it with Celestial's Tension Tamer, just to keep things interesting. Great product for herbal tea lovers, and again, a much better price here than in the grocery stores.
