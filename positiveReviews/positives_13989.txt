Agree with other reviewers that PB2 is twice as expensive on Amazon so definitely shop around for better deals.  The texture of PB2, when mixed according to directions, is similar to natural peanut butter.  I add an extra 1 2 tsps of water to get a fluffier creamier texture and it doesn't water down the flavor.  It's not bad as a PB substitute and I really wasn't expecting it to be identical to the real thing.  The texture and mouthfeel isn't as satisfying as the real PB, but the flavor is fantastic.  It works best when used as a flavoring agent or substitute rather than eaten as simply a spoon full of PB. I will definitely buy more but from another seller that offers it at a fair price and with very reasonable shipping fees.
