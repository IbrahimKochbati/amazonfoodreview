When a locale store started carrying Wellness products, this was one of them. I purchased a bag and my cats loved it. I went back to the store to buy more and guess what; they were sold out. This was almost a year ago!!! They still have not restocked this product because "their corporate computers do all the ordering for them" and not an actual human that knows what sells and what doesn't. Needless to say, this store is a chain pet supply store and well, they have since lost a lot of local business (from me alone) as I have found that I can purchase the same product for much less via Amazon and also get it in as little as a few days.
