I thought I would try these as a last attempt at getting my dogs to take Glucosamine willingly  It worked even for my 3 lb chihuahua who won't eat any treats!!! I have 3 chihuahuas and a doberman and they all love these!! I will warn you  they smell horrible, but I have found the worse a treat smells the more the pups like them!! lol. I will be buying these again!
