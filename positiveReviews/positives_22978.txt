The good news is that this caffeine infused death syrup works   it'll keep you up all night, every night, for the rest of what's left of your meager life. The taste is weird, but not terrible: extremely tart, extremely sweet, and the aftertaste of burning tooth enamel is actually relatively pleasant. The bad news is that if you drink this, even once, your internal organs will prolapse and or solidify, not necessarily in any specific order.          Overall: RECOMMENDED!
