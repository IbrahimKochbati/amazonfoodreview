My 15 month old has been on this for 3 months and loves it.     It is easy to make,(you do have to shake it a bit when you make it).     we add probiotics to it, for a little extra immune boosting and it     works great as a substitute for milk.     our naturalpathic doc tells us this is easier on the toddlers digestive     system and may even aid in less ear infections.     so far so good!     amazon has the best deal we could find also!
