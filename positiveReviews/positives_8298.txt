I love this tea.  I am a long time tea drinker, and purchased tea bags for longer than I want to count (or think about).  A couple of years ago I decided to go for it...make loose tea, and deal with mess of leaves.  And yes, I did know about strainers and tea balls, but I live in no man s land.  If it isn't prepackaged, it's unfit to ingest according to the natives.  Good utensils are hard to find.          I finally found a wonderful BIG mesh tea ball.  Ahhh, a tea drinker's best friend, right after a good English teapot.          The mesh ball in question is like the one sold here as a rule, by the way.          Tea is now a  eeze to make, and absolutely delicious.           The loose packaged tea put out by Lipton is wonderful.  It has a beautiful taste, unlike their teabags, which can be very iffy.  I've had some that tasted like floor sweepings.          This loose tea seems amazingly consistent in flavor.  I recommend it without reservation. And isn't Amazon just lovely...?  They'll  ing it right to your door.  How much more could you ask?          Earlier I mentioned an English teapot.  I favor Sadler's because of the excellent glaze, and the good material they use in the functional  own teapots they make.          A good teapot matters.  Get yourself one, a nice tea ball, and some Lipton Loose tea and you will likely never use teabags again.  If the tea is too strong, do it the way it's done in England; keep a very lightly boiling kettle going, and dilute with boiling water to your taste.
