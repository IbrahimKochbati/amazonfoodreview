I bought this sauce as a closeout. I thought my husband would like the spicy honey mustard. He did, but now I am addicted and trying to find a source to purchase more in my area of the mid west.      The best description is the flavor is complex with several different notes. First you get sweet, then a sour and spicey but fruity undernote followed by a nice but not too hot burn. Also the sauce has a great texture with pieces of onion complementing the flavor.       Great sauce, if I had one complaint...why so many artificial ingredients, i.e hydrolized protien, etc..??
