I have a hard time finding this up in New England   so glad to see this product here.  This is my favorite product in my spice cabinet.  I have tried many other so called "Cajun" spice blends and find that they are too salty (although this is salty too, it is not predominant on the palate) or too hot (which a true "Cajun" spice is not hot).  Laissez les bon temps rouler!
