I wasn't sure what to expect with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but I am pleased.          The Sorrento is a good medium roast.  It is a bit darker of a roast than some of the other mediums out in Keurig land, but it isn't bitter.  There's just a little of something chocolatey in the flavor.          My only complaint is that this coffee, like most of the Keurig cups that don't say "extra bold" on them, they  ew up pretty weak if you do a larger mug.  I typically  ew the 9.25 oz size, and on these guys I bumped it down to the 7.25 oz size.  If I  ew it in the larger cups, it just comes out too weak.          If you are one who feels that K cups usually make weak coffee, you will think that these are really weak, and be tempted to  ew 'em two at a time.  This coffee is not plain or unflavorvful    there's just less coffee in the K cup (or rather the normal, not extra bold amount), so it  ews up weaker.
