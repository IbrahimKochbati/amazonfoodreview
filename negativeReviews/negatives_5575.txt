We have three large dogs.  One of our English Pointers has trouble with periodontal disease.  Bright Bites are recommended by VOHC, so decided to give them a try.  I bought the spearmint and the cinnamon flavors.  Our Greyhound will eat them, but neither of our Pointers will even touch them.  For me, the expensive dental treats are a waste.     AL
