I've bought Java Chip from Costco all summer and loved it!  It is better than Starbuck's blended drinks and much cheaper!  Instead of buying ice cream, our family enjoys these blended drinks and getting our calcium too!  I think the best way to make them is to use enough of the mix. I use about 1 3 to 1 2 of the blender full of cubed ice, put in 3 4 cup of java chip, and add about 1 1 2 to 2 cups of milk and blend till very smooth  about 3 minutes or so.  I top it off with Trader Joe's light whip cream and YUM!  I know there is a lot of sugar and probably calories, however it is a lot less than ice cream and healthier, too!
