Review of any product necessarily reflects opinion.  I am not you (whoever you may be, reading this review).  Therefore, you may love this coffee.  I did not.  I gave it four stars because I felt the need to recognize that there wasn't anything wrong with it; it was coffee.  It was drinkable; there was nothing wrong with it.          I just didn't love the taste, that's all.          I don't know if this taste is a reflection of its low acid content.  Moreover, if I were to attempt to describe how I perceived the taste, my description could come off as vaguely insulting; worse yet, I should have enjoyed it.  It had a sort of harsh taste, in my opinion, of a type I enjoy in other beverages such as unsweetened tea, particularly lapsang souchong.  Don't know it?  My friends describe lapsang souchong, variously, as smelling and tasting like stinky feet, motor oil, and dirt.)          I don't know what it was with this coffee.  Therefore, I warrant that my review may be virtually worthless.  I struggled to find a way to write it such that I could impart some information; the best that I can impart is:  Try it for yourself.  Look at other reviews.  See mine as only one opinion; but honestly    I really didn't enjoy this coffee very much.          So I wouldn't exactly recommend it    but it deserves a fair shake.          Thanks for reading.
