Another over priced "plank" by Ernest.  Why do people like these?  This is the 2nd flavor I've tried and find them to be big, thick "planks" of puffed up cereal with a few almonds sprinkled in and a few dried fruit pieces.  When these are gone I'll never repurchase.  High sugar and carbs, way too much money and not worth it.  Any chewy granola bar is a better deal.  2 Servings each?  Then double the fat content to 14 grams and nearly 60 grams of carbs and 28 grams of sugar if you indulge and eat the whole thing!  Holy..  Anyway, at only 6 per box you are ransoming your mother to buy these.
