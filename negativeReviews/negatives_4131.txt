Do Not Buy Mocafe Azteca D'oro 1519 Mexican ground chocolate 3lb bag from Amazon.com. Ordered 1st time on 7 18 10 did not receive Azteca, instead received CHAI The excuse was could not stop the order in time.  2nd time received Chai again although on Amazon's website the product advertised is Mocafe Azteca 1519 ground chocolate. This time i'm told to buy from a out side vendor. SAVE YOUR SELF THE AGGREVATION AND DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON!!!   "
