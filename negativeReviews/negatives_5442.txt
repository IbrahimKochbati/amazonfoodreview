I thought the coffee had a slight bitter taste to it, not what I would call smooth or robust. Not sure on the process they use to create a low acid coffee but this could be the result of the bitterness. Honestly I didn't think there was any difference between the organic decaf coffee I drink now and this low acid coffee, neither caused any acidic build up in my body. Given the price and somewhat wasteful packaging, I'm going to stick with my organic decaf that I get from a local roaster in town. Just disappointed about the taste being sacrificed.
