Soooo glad I got three boxes of these sent to me. NOT I have one dog I am trying to please and another who will eat anything... well even she has to be coxed into eating these. I love the whole idea and ingredients of these goodies but they just wont work for my dogs. They look like little alfalfa cubes and the dogs wont even take them from my hand. I did see my one dog eat one after it set out on the porch all night but I think she was just board waiting for her morning meal. Give these a pass unless your dog is really into veggie treats.
