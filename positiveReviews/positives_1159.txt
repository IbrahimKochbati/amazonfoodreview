Licorice Jelly Beans use to be my absolute favorite in the jelly bean flavors (I no longer eat sugar).  These were bought as a gift, so I did get to try a few just to see how they  are.  I've had many over the years before giving up on sugar and honestly have never had any with this good a flavor!  Also their customer service is excellent! I needed to contact them and they were very responsive and also willing to do just about anything to make sure even ONE customer is happy   something lacking in most companies these days.     To compare   I tried a couple Jelly Belly licorice ones and to me they had a fruit flavor that was just wrong   not enough of a licorice taste.  Gimbal's is less expensive this way and superior in every aspect of a licorice jelly bean.  This is a LARGE quantity!! Keep that in mind when purchasing   either have a lot of jelly bean lovers in your life, or a large family or collection of friends to share with   unless of course your sweet tooth won't stop and then, just savor them all yourself ; )     Enjoy!
