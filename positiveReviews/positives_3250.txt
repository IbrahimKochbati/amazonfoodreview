I was so happy to find this product when it was first released! I had used regular Bisquick for years before being diagnosed with Celiac Disease. This is just as versatile as the original  pancakes, biscuits, dumplings, etc! My family's favorie is the pancakes, they are light and fluffy and have a lovely crispness to the outside.          My only reason for not awarding this 5 stars is the size of the box, it is small. My family of 4 uses the entire box for Saurday morning pancakes. The box makes approximately 3 (small) batches of pancakes, we freeze the extra in single servings for weekday  eakfasts. I'd love to see Bisquick release a larger box but until then I'll continue ordering the 3 pack!    "
