I purchased the same bag from the vet for $10.  When my dog was diagnosed with Addison's disease I concludeded that I would need to use the pill pockets for the rest of his life.  Not only do they work; he wouldn't take the prednisone in cheese or other foods, but you do not need to use the entire pill each time.  I just  eak away enough so that it covers his pill and he loves it!  Great product at a great price!
