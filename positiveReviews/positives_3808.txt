Beef sticks and honey   what a great combination! The Ole Smokies beef sticks are full of flavor. Adding honey gives them a little twist of sweetness that just puts them over the top. The Honey Stung Ole' Smokies are always a favorite with our friends; the saddlebag pack is a perfect take along to football parties.
