I had tasted this chai at a nearby coffee shop, and had to have it. I didn't know the  and they were using, but one of the employees (THANK YOU SO MUCH), shared it with me. There has not been a single person i've served this to, that has not appreciated it's rich and delicate taste... it really as amazing! : )
