These are wonderful!  So crunchy and they're made from whole spelt as well as seeds and a big helping of tasty.          I found them remarkably filling too.  They're nice and big.  It would be easy to make these the basis for a light meal adding just a few toppings.          I ordered these sight unseen and never tasted so I had no preconceived notions.  I'm very pleased and will order these again.
