I drink a ton of green tea and recently purchased this from Amazon.  I like to try new green teas every once and a while, but I think I found my new "everyday" green tea.  I was looking for an organic green tea without all the caffeine (since I drink it so much) and believe this is probably the best green tea I have ever consumed.  FYI: I only drink this green tea cold and use 5 or 6 bags to make a gallon.  Buy this green tea with confidence if you like to make a pitcher and drink it over a couple days.
