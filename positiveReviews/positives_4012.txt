Yuban makes the best cup of coffee. Either roast is never bitter, and makes a great cup of coffee. We like our coffee extra strong, and we have been using Yuban for years. The coffee is very consistent and distinctive.          This is the best canned ground coffee out there, period. We have found none to match the true dark, smooth cup of coffee. There is no bitterness or burnt taste, just silky, rich coffee. Add a dab of half n half, and you have bliss in a cup.          Don't spend your money on the expensive "designer" coffees. This is the best!          If you are persnickety about coffee, buy Yuban!
