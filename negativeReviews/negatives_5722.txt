I've tried several of the Fresh Mixer varieties, and so far this one comes in only slightly better than the Teriyaki Chicken flavor.  Although the convenience and nutrition and pluses, the flavor just leaves a lot to be desired.  To be honest this one would be better if you ate it blindfolded, as the chicken chunks and sauce really make it look like you are eating cat food.  Ignoring the visual appear, or lack thereof, the flavor still doesn't compare to the Zesty Marinara Penne, Rotini Meat Sauce and Southwestern Chicken.  I will not be reordering.
