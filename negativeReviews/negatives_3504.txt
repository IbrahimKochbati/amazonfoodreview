Watch out, we had a couple of bad tasting bags from a 40 count box from costco recently.  When opening up the third, many of the popcorn kernels inside were odd looking, inconsistent.  It is too bad, so now we are going to air popped popcorn, after using Orville's  bags nearly daily for a few years.  Eden's organic popcorn was OK so far, but harder to find.  Now will try Bob's (red mill?) popcorn kernels.  Hoping none of these are of the genetically modified type of corn.
