Overall, this is a nice, light, refreshing drink. The sweetness is a bit sweeter than Juice Squeeze, but not as sweet as Hansen's soda. I tried two flavors: this orange tangerine, and the strawberry watermelon. I preferred this orange one. The flavor was "cleaner." But, there are so many different juices in both those drinks, it kindof gets "muddied." I think I prefer Juice Squeeze because the flavor seems true er. My 10 year old daughter prefers Hansen's, because it is a bit sweeter. But, like I said, overall, this is a very nice drink. No corn syrup. Yea!
