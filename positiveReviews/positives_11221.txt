Just recently found out I have a wheat allergy and we so excited to have something fun to eat again! These were awesome, moist and chewy, I topped them off with some raspberry jam and was in heaven! These will totally be a staple in my gluten free cupboard! Don't forget to visit Pamela's website too there are tons of recipes so you don't ever feel like you're missing out again.
