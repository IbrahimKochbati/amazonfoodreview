Blah!  My baby didn't like it, then I tasted it and it was awful.  It is NOTHING like what you might expect.  It's like bland goop with a faint hint of unseasoned over boiled chicken.  What, is the theory that we should give our babies nasty food simply to take advantage of the fact that they have nothing to compare it to?  I didn't even feed it to my dog.
