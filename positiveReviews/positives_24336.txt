I so looked forward to Christmas every year, my grandmother lived in Germany and my  other and I would get a package from her with Asbach Uralt candies in it.  She would always send it to his house and when we received it he would call and tease me that he was enjoying my portion of the chocolates.  Unfortunately my grandmother passed away and the yearly packages stopped.  But then came along the internet and I was able to find these candies and have them shipped!  I was so excited when I received the chocolates the first year I ordered them, I could not wait until Christmas eve to surprise my  other with these, it was a big hit!  It doesn't matter what else I get him every year as long as I carry on the tradition of giving him Asbach Uralt Brandy chocolate!
