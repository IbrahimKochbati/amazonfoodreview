A colleague at work just gave me one of these tea bags.          I like herbal teas but this one was really unique.     There were really nice lingering flavors on my tongue with every sip.     First, a tangy orangey sensation followed by a suttle sweetness married with a spicy masala kick shortly after.     The sweetness lingers around the back of the tongue afterwords.          Nothing really Mexican about it, neither does it have any chilis. The spiciness comes from some common spices used in Masala tea.          If this sounds like something you might like, I highly recommend that you try it.
