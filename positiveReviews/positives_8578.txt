Its hard to stick to the rule of doing everything "in moderation" with these tasty snacks around. Salty, smokey, a wonderful and more nutritious alternative to potato chips. Good with cocktails, good by the handful. I've snacked on them before dinner, watching tv, having a drink, or at bedtime. And did I mention the price? The 3 pack is so much cheaper than buying singles at the grocerystore. All round great snack!
