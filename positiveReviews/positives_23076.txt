This is the best Gluten FREE  ead!!  But you do have to cook it longer than it says on the package or it will not be done in the middle.  I cook it a total  of 78 minutes. After the first 20 I cover it with tinfoil so it does not get too  own then after 50 min I uncover it and let it cook another 8 mins.  YUMMY!!!
