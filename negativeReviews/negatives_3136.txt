I bought this because the price was good and it was convenient to carry to restaurants. I have been using xylitol for several years and like that it has NO aftertaste.  This product has a bad aftertaste.  The little bit of sucralose they added to the xylitol to make the product sweeter takes over and leaves a sickening aftertaste.  If you are used to using Splenda or other sucralose based products you probably will not notice it but I really did.  Will not be buying this product again.
