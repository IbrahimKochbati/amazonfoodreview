In Europe, you find a bowl of dark flaxseeds to the side of the muesli set out on a  eakfast buffet. A great source of Omega 3 oil, you can improve your health by eating these tasty, nutty seeds. They are good for the gut and good for the heart.          The golden seeds are an attractive alternative to the nut  own seeds. They look nice in baked goods like lighter  eads. They taste the same as the dark seeds. Ground, they don't show up in white  ead, so you can bust some up in the blender and throw then into your standard  ead recipe and add needed nutrients and fiber.          We like them sprinkled on oatmeal, muesli or yogurt.
