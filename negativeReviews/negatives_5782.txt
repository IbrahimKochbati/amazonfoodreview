I grabbed a bag of this when it went on sale at the local market and, although one of my cats really likes it, I can't stand the smell!  Honestly, it smells like horse doo.  Whenever she jumps in my lap after eating this stuff, it about makes me gag!  It has to be the strangest smelling cat food I've ever used, which is why I wanted to write this review.  Just thought it was rather strange. I don't plan on buying it again because of that   the smell is Blech!  It isn't her favorite food, but it's tolerable, especially if mixed with a little meat.  The protein content isn't as high, only 30% because it's for the indoor cat.  I would recommend it for that reason because it does help with the weight factor. Just be careful,your nose will have to be made of steel to get past the smell!
