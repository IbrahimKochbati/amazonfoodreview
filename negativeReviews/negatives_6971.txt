I have tried these bars in the past but was very disappointed with this product, I ordered, went to eat the bars and they were covered with a white film and crumbled.  Amazon was great and understood my problem and sent another order.  This order was also covered with a white film and crumbled.  I wasnt going to do a 3rd time.  Kind of turned me off on ordering this kind again, not sure what the problem was   the date was 8 13 so i dont understand unless it was that batch.
