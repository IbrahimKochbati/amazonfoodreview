BEWARE!! As usual everything about the deal went great because of Amazon; prompt delivery, etc., etc. However, this coffee will expire in less then 3 months. So, clearly, this has been sitting around somewhere. I buy other Kirkland coffee's at my local Costco and they usually don't expire for 12 to 18 months. Unfortunately, the Kirkland Espresso hasn't made it to the East Coast (last year or so far this year), at least not at the Costco's around me, and I wanted to try it, since, even at this inflated price it's priced about the same as 2 pounds of Lavazza, etc.          So, hopefully it will be fine when I open it, but don't buy this expecting to use it this winter!
