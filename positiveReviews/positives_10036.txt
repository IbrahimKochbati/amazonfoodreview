In our home we prefer coffee that is smooth and not very strong. Dunkin Donuts is preferred to Starbucks. We like this coffee. Not love, but it is pretty good. We have served it to a dozen neighbors.  None commented on its taste, but when we asked they all said it was very good (these were all guys who would have no trouble complaining if they didn't like it). My  other, who prefers strong coffee, also said that he really liked it and that it was smooth.  So, with a dozen tasters reporting, all liked it, but nobody raved about it.  We would buy it again.
