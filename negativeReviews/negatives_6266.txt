My now 1 yr old babies love the rice and oatmeal versions of this cereal, but hate the multigrain version.  Pity that I tried it out     as an amzn multipack, guess it will go into my second harvest bin.  Like other reviewers mentioned, it has a slightly stale     smell to it    perhaps they don't wash the quinoa enough before processing it?  I taste everything my babies eat, and have     to mention that it does not have the melt in the mouth texture of the other two besides not tasting good.  My babies will eat quinoa for eg     when I cook it for family meals.  And amaranth in flakes from their  other's cereals.  Buy a single can from whole foods     or target etc before buying a multi pack.  They won't even eat it if I put in one tablespoon to 5 of rice cereal.  Ended up just tossing the open can.     Either of these is fantastic.    "
