These chews did indeed prove good for my dogs' teeth   one of them had severe tarter issues, and its much better now though to be fair, I used a lot of other products (like Greenies, enzymatic toothpaste etc) along with this. This does possess a choking hazard for dogs like la adors who are tempted to swallow food rather than patiently chew them, and must be given these chews only when monitored (as is the case with other chews like bully sticks).     But one major issue that I encountered with these chews is that they give a bad gas to my dogs   enough to drive the humans out of the house. Their stool is just fine, its just the extremely foul smelling gas. whenever I stop giving these for 2 3 days, the gas problem goes away, but as  soon as I start these again, the problem is back.
