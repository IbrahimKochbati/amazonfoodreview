Earth's Best Baby Food     My favorite  and of baby food by far. Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earth's Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic  ands are equal. I've tried many varieties (including store  ands and others only available through internet purchase) and found that Earth's Best is by far the best for your money.          Fruit Variety Pack     Normally I would say this is a great idea, but I wasn't a fan of this particular variety. My son would have been just fine with it, but unfortunately for us at this point my daughter is allergic to raspberries and mangos. These are both things I think she'll grown out of, but something you may want to consider when purchasing this item. I would suggest trying an individual serving of one from your local store to see if your child has an allergy, but if they don't I would say buy it! Other than that I do think it's a great variety for kids who need some changing up occasionally. Also, the subscription price on this variety is great and can be altered depending on how soon you need it. We ended up running through another subscription we had and were able to have another shipped as soon as we needed it.
