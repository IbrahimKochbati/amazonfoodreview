Ok so I love these people who created these pretty healthy spreads. They also seem relatively low in carbs and sugar. Ingredients are pure and it is exquisitely delicious!          I am trying a lower carb, higher protein approach to eating and I think this awesome spread will work as a delicious healthy, protein rich filling snack.          I also love their peanut butter mixed with white chocolate.          With all the highly processed, hydrogenated chemical induced food out there this is something I can feel good about eating!          You just gotta portion control it for weight loss.           )
