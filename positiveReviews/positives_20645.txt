Was thrilled to find this mix on Amazon.  My mom has been buying it for me when she can find it, but that's not always easy.  I add a bit of cooked ground beef or shredded chicken (I always keep some ready in the freezer for times like this), a can of diced tomatoes and a couple of undrained cans of beans (dark red kidney & pinto last night).  I cook uncovered for longer than the directions say, as it is less watery and more flavorful that way, I think.  My five year old daughter simply loves the soup and has thanked me no less than a dozen times in the fifteen hours since dinner.  We've got plenty of leftovers, with a dozen hearty one cup servings (I measured).  And to my surprise, only 3 Weight Watchers points!  Next time I'm going to try adding  occoli cut into small pieces, (maybe even shredded spinach) to add even more nutrition.  Yum!!!
