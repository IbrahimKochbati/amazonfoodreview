These Gatorade nutrition shakes are easily the best tasting energy nutrition protein shakes I've ever tasted. The consistency is nice and smooth with zero chalkiness, which most energy shakes are ruined by. This one is just perfect as far as flavor and consistency.          To other reviewers saying the shakes have too many calories and not enough protein: these are not intended specifically as protein shakes. That's why they're called "Nutrition" shakes. If you want a specific protein shake, there are many of them available. I look at these as a light meal replacement or as an after work out energy replacement.          An interesting note: The cans are made of steel not aluminum; they are much heavier and stronger than aluminum cans which means they can be stored in a gym back and not accidentally get burst open.
