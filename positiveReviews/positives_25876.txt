This was a good deal! It arrived packaged in a Bob's Red Mill box. Because I don't have a need to use it as often, I'll freeze 3 out of 4.          If you've never used spelt flour, it taste 100 times better than whole wheat flour. For instance, I've used spelt and whole wheat flour (separately) to make pancakes from scratch and spelt won by far! It gives a whole different taste to pancakes compared with white flour but with spelt, a much healthier choice.
