i guess its because i LOVE sugar that this particular item tasted only a little bit less than cardboard! YUK! sure, i will eat the entire 2 boxes i got for FREE but i wont be enjoying it though. these needed just a bit more sweetness, so i suppose i can always dip them in honey to get the flavour i want. other than that they have a lot of good stuff in them thats good for you, but i like what goes in my mouth to have some flavour to it as well
