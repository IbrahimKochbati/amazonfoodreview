I would definitely agree with others that this is not a very challenging puzzle toy.  So why do I give it 5 stars?  Well, challenging or not, this toy keeps my dog engaged and happy while eating!          When my husband and I adopted our little dachshund miniature schnauzer mix, he wasn't eating very much.  The vet told us that once he acclimated to his new owners and surroundings, his appetite would pick up.  Well, it didn't.  After two months, he still would not eat very much out of his bowl.  He would take 3 4 bites and would walk away from all his food.  My husband and I had to force our dog to eat or hand feed him   neither of which we liked.          I read up on dachshunds and found out that they are hunting dogs.  I thought that maybe if we made getting his meal a bit more of a hunt or challenge that he would like it more   and sure enough, I was right!  Ever since we bought this star toy, he eats ALL his food with no problems!  It is such a relief not to have force or hand feed our dog and to not worry if our dog is getting enough food.  The fact that he enjoys it and likes it so much is just the icing on the cake and makes us so happy!  So, for our dog, it's more of an interactive feeder than a toy or  ain game but we feel that it was well worth the money paid!          We've had it about a month now and our dog eats out of it 1 2 times a day and it's holding up just fine.  He is a big chewer and he's tried to chew this a few times but so far, has not done any damage.  We have high hopes that this will last for a while!
