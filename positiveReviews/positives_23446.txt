I absolutely enjoy this product.  I'm a HUGE fan of dark chocolate so if you want the sweet melt in your mouth type, this is not it.  This is more akin to Baker's chocolate.  Just slightly sweeter.  It is a great value for your hard earned $.  I am currently eating 8 squares of this daily for the health benefits.  A bar will last me 3 1 2 days.  I've been able to lower my BP by 12 points on average.
