I was under the impression I was getting 10 packages of the puroast low acid coffee to try but only got one.  I made it and it was ok and the gerd did not act up that night but to be honest just having enough to try and use for one day would not convince me to give up my maxwell house for this, perhaps if I had more days and more samples my opinion would be different.
