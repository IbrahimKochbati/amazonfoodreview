It's a different kind of Green Tea that one might have to an acquire a taste for. I loved it the moment I tired it. There's a pureness to Yamamotoyama unlike any other ice tea that I've tired. When drinking it, you won't feel sluggish and tired like some of the other sugary refreshments out on the market.
