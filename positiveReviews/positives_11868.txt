This is a really, really good instant oatmeal. I have a soft spot for apple cinnamon instant oatmeals and have, in the past, eaten Quaker's and McCann's versions. This one is by far the best. The flavor is nice, the apples rather generous, and it's light on the sweetness (which allows you to ratchet up the sweetness to your taste, which I appreciate).          The texture IS NOT creamy right off, and this is a thing with instant oatmeals in general. Once you add the boiling water, let it sit for 3 5 minutes. I find when I let it sit about, stirring it up now and then, it gets to a truly comforting and nice "gloopy" oatmeal texture. If you just add water and stir  it will be "pebbly" and dry. Not nice. So, remember to give it time to get to the right texture.          The ingredients list is minimal (which I like), the taste is very nice and "clean", and I tend to sweeten it just  a bit more. I also tend to use two packets, but then, I used to use two packets of Quaker, etc, as well.          Another good product from Dr. M. Hurrah!
