This is great  ead.  We recently found out my husband was allergic to wheat.  I tried finding any kind of  ead that tasted like we were used to.  This  ead is great.  My husband absolutely loves it!  I actually even like to eat this  ead even though I'm not allergic to wheat and I don't even miss the  ead I was used to.  Definately a must try!
