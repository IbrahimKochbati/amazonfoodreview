I purchased a case of this popcorn for two reasons: the rave reviews of others on Amazon and it was a lower priced alternative to Wabash Valley Farms Real Theater Popcorn.          This is what I found:            In my opinion, Great Northern Popcorn is not as tasty as Real Theater Popcorn.       While Great Northern has a 6 ounce portion compared to Wabash Valley Farms 5.5 ounce portion it exceeded the capacity on both my Whirley Pop and Stir Crazy poppers.  (Literally lifted the top off of my Stir Crazy.)  So more is not necessarily better especially when you have to clean up a mess after every popping.       Quite bit more of the Great Northern Popcorn remained unpopped.       Great Northern Popcorn had a "chewy" texture to it.
