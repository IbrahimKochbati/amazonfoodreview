well, my husband, myself and my 12 year old son sampled this drink. My husband hated it. I felt like it was OK, but nothing to write home about. The taste to me was too orangey and for a "natural" product it sure didn't taste like one. My 12 year old liked it. He also likes gummy worms and sour straws, so you can take his review for what it is.          I personally wouldn't buy this product.     2 stars
