After reading most of the reviews, I was expecting the tablet to taste gross.  It does not.  It's not yummy, but it does have a slight (tart?) flavor to it.          My first taste was of a strawberry.  It was way too sweet for me.  Almost tasted like I had put tons of sugar on the strawberry, or even sugar substitute.  Next I tried a blackberry, blueberry, pomegranate seed....they were sweeter, but I wasn't blown away by how "good" they tasted, just surprised at how my taste buds have changed.  Next up, a lemon!  Everyone has been right about the lemon, it tastes like lemonade!  I ate half of a lemon before I decided it was too sweet for me.  I put pomegranate flavored Greek yogurt over the fruit I just mentioned, and had a bite.  TOO SWEET for me!  Next up, some fermented spicy daikon (ever hear of "Dave's Gourmet Korean food"?  Everything is fermented in vinegar and it is DELICIOUS!).  The vinegar taste was gone, but the spiciness remained.  Interesting.  I actually like the regular flavor, unaltered, so I won't be having that again.  Oh, I also tried chocolate flavored coconut water  yuck!  There was a chocolate CHALKY taste to it.  It has now been 30 minutes and I just tried the other half of the lemon.  It still tastes sweet to me.  And then I had a sip of veggie  oth (from "Dave's Korean") which is the only thing that has changed in a way that was pleasing to my taste buds.          I'm giving the mberry four stars because it DOES do what it claims, it's just not my preferred way of tasting things.
