I'm not much of a juice drinker, but my daughter is so I bought this for her to try out.  I wasn't expecting much, so I was very happy when she announced that she really liked it!  It is essentially a carbonated fruit juice, but it is nice to have some different flavors for the kids.  So, it was a hit at our house and we'll definitely be buying more.
