I was really worried about giving my 11 month old chicken or really any meat products.  I really don't like trying to puree meat so I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package and it actually tasted great and wasn't lumpy.  This was one of the only meat baby foods that when I tasted   I loved it!  I felt like I was giving my child a complete meal and it was organic!
