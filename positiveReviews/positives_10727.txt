These are large biscuits that can be  oken in half easily, but are still large.  I gave a half to my 48 pound mutt and she spit it out at first not sure what to do with it.  She's used to the small peanut butter treats from Costco.  I encouraged her to eat it and she finally did.  She left quite a few crumbs along the way which eventually were eaten.  Obviously my dog liked the way the biscuits tasted but I like the neatness of smaller dog treats.  If you have a small dog, these wouldn't work unless you wanted to spend time  eaking them into smaller chunks.  If you have a large dog and are looking for an organic alternative, try these.
