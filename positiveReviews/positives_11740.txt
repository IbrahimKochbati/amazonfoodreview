These bars are a good source of dietary fiber, Omega 3 and Antioxidants that are made with Whole Grains and they are Gluten Free. If you like Chocolate, Oats and Coconut then there is a good chance that you will like these. I like to eat healthy but I am not willing to sacrifice taste for being healthy. I have tried a handful of bars that are similar to these and most of them didn't impress me. In fact most of them are downright nasty. However that is not a problem with these bars. I really like them a lot.          Here are the nutrition facts for one bar.
