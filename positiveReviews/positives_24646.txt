yes, most of the cans arrive dented, so if you are fearful of that, don't get it.  But pumpkin is hard to find in the stores other than in fall, so if you like to extend your pumpkin usage to other seasons, this is a good buy.  Definitely good quality for feeding dogs or making  ead or ....pumpkin fudge!  Yum!
