I started eating these nuts years ago, after a family member had open heart surgery. The surgeon suggested walnuts as a heart healthy food. After enjoying these for years, I could not find them at any retail location. I decided to go online and found them here at Amazon.com!!!!..We love these, and we are now receiving these on a monthly basis. Thank you so much, the quality and value are unbeatable.
