I typically get the  ownie crunch flavor, but happened to grab one of these white chocolate chip bars by accident.  It was a good accident.  These are really good.  I actually think I like them better than the  ownie crunch. I usually don't like anything white chocolate because it's overly sweet, but this isn't.  I typically buy my bars at whole foods, but they are quite expensive.  I may start buying them on amazon.  Only downside is that you can't pick and choose what you'd like in a box on amazon.          The Good:     The ingredients seem pretty good as well.  Nothing screams to me as a scary lab created chemical.  It's got a good amount of fiber, lots of protein and no added sugar or fake sugar (a big pet peeve of mine). It tastes very good in comparison to some other "healthy protein bars" out there that taste like chalk and smell like feet.          The Bad:     It does have more calories and carbs than I would like to see in this size bar. 240 calories & a whopping 27 grams of carbs.
