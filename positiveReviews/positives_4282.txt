I bought these to add to my Easter favors. I love the colors for that reason   basic and pastel   all of which are different flavors.  I didn't eat any myself but my friends who received the favors LOVED them!  I have a Prime Account so the gummies shipped very quickly so there was no melting going on (other reviews mentioned this).  Can't complain about the price for a 5 pound bag. It was a great deal and if I needed buy gummies in bulk again I would definitely buy these mini bears.
