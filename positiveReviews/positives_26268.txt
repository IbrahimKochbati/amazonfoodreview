This product is so much fun.  I made this set and the bento one with my sister.  We know a little japanese and were able to read the directions and cleared up anything we didn't get with videos online.  Even if you don't know Japanese it is easy to understand through pictures and if you use videos online.  It tastes like artificial candy and but wasn't bad.  The fish eggs by itself were pretty good and I found the rice good but with a weird texture.  However its fun and I'm glad I bought it.
