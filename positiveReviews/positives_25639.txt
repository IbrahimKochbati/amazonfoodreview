All a sudden I started to drink black coffee, and it started with the Starbucks Sumatra.          I know, you are probably thinking, "EW. Starbucks?!" Yes! I was shocked as well!!          I French press my own coffee since the bill started adding up each time I went to Starbucks and bought a cup each time ($4.11 to be exact). WOW, the taste is absolutely amazing! I do not even want to put in any cream milk sugar... NOTHING into my cup of Sumatra coffee. The taste is rich, bold, and it has a pleasant bitter kick to the end with no bad after taste. It definitely has an earthy flavor as claims to have which make this coffee even more wholesome to me.          What makes it even MORE awesome is that it tastes expensive, but the price is out of this world! I bought my own pack at my local grocery store on sale for $7.99. Can you believe how much money I have saved? I really look forward to waking up in the morning and drinking this cup o' joe.
