Excellent product, slightly different than anything available in the U.S. Digestives Biscuits (cookies)are only slightly sweet with a wheat malt kind of taste.  They are super with a cup of PG Tips tea and a biscuit I would recommend along with other McVities products for informal entertaining.  One warning! OK two.  If you use a Digestive (the name doesn't do it justice) to dunk in your coffee or tea, be QUICK!!! They are actually light and crisp and soak up liquid faster than a Bounty Paper Towel. You'll be fishing out big chunks of soggy cookie.  I've somewhat mastered the art of being a Digestives dunker, but once in a while I have to get a spoon.  The McVities come in three flavors (or flavours) plain, with milk chocolate coating and one with dark chocolate coating.  ALL ARE GOOD! Warning number two: My problem is once I open a packet of McVities, they usually don't last the whole day, even if I'm home alone. They are that good.
