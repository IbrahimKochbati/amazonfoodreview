Crystal Light's Peach Iced Tea is a little sweeter than other flavors like the Raspberry Lemonade. It has a very mild tea flavor that is pleasant and not overpowering. Since we already lug tons of bottled water from Costco it is great not to have to also buy bottled drinks. The Crystal Light packets make drinking more water a  eeze. Since I started using these packets I keep water in the refrigerator and mix up some tea for when I'm reading or out shopping. I also love to make slushies with this drink mix. Just put a bottle in the freezer for a few hours and then shake vigorously. I will say these "on the go" flavors can be a bit addictive. With so much variety in flavors these drinks really make life a little more fun.          ~The Rebecca Review
