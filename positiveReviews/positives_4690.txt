If you've never tried any of Ghirardelli's hot cocoa products you are in for a treat! Made with milk, the cocoa is far superior to any other cocoa product on the market. I don't drink coffee, but have a cup of this every morning. When made in the Froth Au Lait hot chocolate latte maker, you will get the best cup of hot cocoa you ever had.
