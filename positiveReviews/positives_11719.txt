I love coconut and chocolate, and know I love this bars. They are chewy with a wonderful flavor. The coconut comes thru but not too much. You have a nice chocolate taste in your mouth. It is a wonderful snack. I wish, they would be a little bit bigger. Nice job, Pamela's. I'm a fan anyway from your products. You make the life for gluten free, dairy free, soy free living people tasteful.
