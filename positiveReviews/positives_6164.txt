All of us like to give treats to our pets, but some of them are just too high in fat or too calorie laden.  My dog was just diagnosed with diabetes, and our vet suggested we use these chicken bits as her treats instead of the normal Milk Bone type biscuits. They are very low in fat and high in protein, very chewy and my dog just LOVES them.  I wish the treats were a bit larger for my Lab,so I end up giving her two.  If you have a smaller dog, they also make these treats in a smaller size.  Also these are just the right size to use as treats if you are training your dog.
