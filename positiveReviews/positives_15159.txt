Excellent price for this dog food  as well as prompt,easy delivery to my front doorstep!Certainly makes hauling large bags like this a lot easier.This is the only food I feed my pets  and the price is by far the best around:both locally in store here  AND thorugh other pet supply mail order services.I recommend it.
