I bought these at a local store (original flavor). The were awful. They not only didn't taste good (as is the case with lots of gf products on the market); they actually tasted nasty. I couldn't eat them. My son, who will generally eat anything, "loved" them. He kept packing them in Ziploc bags and packing those in cloth bags to take as a "picnic" item for wherever he thought we might be going. He had a lot of fun playing with them: however, he didn't eat them. That's saying a lot because he has a genetic disorder that effects his ability to determine when to stop eating and generally eats any food he can get his hands on and goes looking for more. Anyway, I finally got tired of looking at these crackers and tossed them out. I have bought other products from this company that were fine.
