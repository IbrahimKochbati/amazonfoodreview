The item itself is in a squeeze pack and that does not work very well with peanut butter. The instructions say to knead the individual package before opening... whatever that means?  I did move the content of the package around before opening.  But so much of it remained in the package when I tried to use it. Effectively I got about a spoon full out of the package and could not squeeze the rest out.  So I opened the package and licked the insides to enjoy the rest.  It got quite messy.  The taste was okay, but not great, and no funny aftertaste of anything. If I tasted it in the store, I would not have purchased it.  I will eat the rest of the squeeze packs, but I have no plans to order them again or recommend them. To others that feel the need to eat this stuff, I would recommend a bottle and specifically not the squeeze pouches.  I also believe it would be too difficult for a child to use at school, even a middle school child.  With normal items such as juice toothpaste in a squeeze pack, when you squeeze the contents move away and your fingers come very close to each other.  With peanut butter, you squeeze your fingers but the peanut butter does not move towards the top. So it just does not work well.  I wanted to love this stuff    oh well.             A month later I have come back to re rate this product.  I have about 13 packs left out of the initial 20.  I hate eating them, it makes a mess, it is hard to use, and the taste is not that great.  I will likely be throwing them out soon.  I do not recommend this product.  And I LOVE chocolate!!!!!!!!!!!
