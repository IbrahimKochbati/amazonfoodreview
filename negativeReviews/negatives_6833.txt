I ordered a case of this popcorn using the automatic re order system.  After reading some of the reviews about the quality of the popcorn, I chose to give it a chance, price being one of my primary reasons for ordering and the automatic re order feature.  Well, as they say, you get what you pay for.  Only about 2 3 of the kernels pop and of the ones that do, the popped corn is very small in size.  The product tastes really good, what you're able to get from the package.  By the time you figure the amount of unpopped kernels, you would be much better off spending a little more money for a premium product.
