MY DOGS LOVED IT FOR THE TASTE, I THINK. AND IT DID SEEM TO BE SOMETHING THAT THEY ENJOYED CHEWING ON. MY ONLY PROBLEM WAS THE TITLE SAYS EVERLASTING TREAT FOR DOGS. WHICH I TOOK TO MEAN LAST A VERY, LONG TIME, BUT IT ONLY LASTED ABOUT 1 HOUR. BUT IT WAS STILL A GREAT TREAT FOR MY DOGS. WOULD DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.
