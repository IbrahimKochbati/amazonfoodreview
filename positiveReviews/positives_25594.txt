I just received my first bag of this tea and all I can say is WOW!  This has a most delicious and comforting taste.  I  ewed about 8 leaves in a teapot of boiling water   steeped for about 6 minutes, poured it into a mug and tasted.  I was reluctant at first, but I've had the Celestial Seasonings Zinger teas, so I was somewhat familiar with hibiscus.  Well, this is so much better.  I am so happy with this organic hibiscus tea.  And, you don't even need a tea strainer.  The flowers are whole, so you just steep and pour.  I used a teapot that my aunt had given to me and it worked beautifully. The flowers just stay at the bottom of the pot. I ordered this just 3 days ago from Amazon and it arrived just over an hour ago   perfect condition and ready for me to  ew my first   not to be my last   cup of hibiscus tea!  Great product.
