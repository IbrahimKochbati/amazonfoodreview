I have tried a lot, I mean a whole lot of cat food.  My two cats are so picky and I can never really tell what they will eat.  They loved the first can of this and I thought, well, we will see what happens in a coupld days.  They go through food like Sherman through Atlanta and even though I have only had the food for a couple of days, they have eaten six cans!  Little piglets.  I love this food.  The consistency is nice and juicey and my cats appreciate that.  If you are looking for a good quality, tasty food, order this.
