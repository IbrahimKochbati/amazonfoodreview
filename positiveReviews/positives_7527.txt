Great product for the price. Only negative would be the packaging. Since I keep mine in the freezer a single package of 24 or 30 or whatever would be sufficient. I make "Chocaluah", a coffee chocolate liquor for adult use as a syrup over ice cream. These beans add additional depth to the flavor of the sauce.
