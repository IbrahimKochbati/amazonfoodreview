I was skeptical of this mix because I enjoyed the Betty Crocker version.  However, after tasting this version, I would definitely recommend it over the Betty Crocker mix.  Absolutely delicious!  The original version is not low fat, but there is a lower fat recipe on the box so I am looking forward to trying that recipe.  I can tell no difference between this and gluten filled.  All in all, a big YUM!
