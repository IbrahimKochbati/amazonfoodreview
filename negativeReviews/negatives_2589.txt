I bought this by accident, then decided to give it a chance.  Not worth it, I would rather have less real peanut butter than eat this.  It has a gritty consistency because of the sugar and tastes too sweet and not "pea nutty". It was more sugary sweet than tasting like peanut butter and the gritty texture just turned me off, maybe because it was creamy?     I would like to find a PB with less fat but still enjoy it, this was not it for me.
