I must say I love this Tropical Green tea. I really like the nylon bags, therefore I can see the tea leaves. In my opinion it is a smooth tea unlike most green teas.  I initially purchased at a local store and now it's not sold there anymore.  I decided to find it online and Thank goodness Amazon has it.  Hoooray ! Keep up the good work Amazon!
