Firstly, I buy Tinky noodles at my grocery for 3.10 package, so the price offered here is not as good.  They are the best noodles when properly cooked   I boil them for 7 minutes then drain and eat.  I like a noodle with some "chew" to it and I often reheat leftovers in the microwave (when I plan to do that I cook the noodles for 5 minutes) They will get MUSHY if you cook according to package directions (and who wants that unless you're missing teeth?).  I serve these noodles both hot and cold to family and guests and receive only compliments.  Being gluten free (choice, not celiac) I also notice they digest far better than pasta, which tends to bloat and expand.  And that means I can eat more, because I love them.  Buy them and cook them right!
