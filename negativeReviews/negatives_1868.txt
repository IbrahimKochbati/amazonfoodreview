Packaging on these leaves something to be desired   last shipment I received had 2 out of 3 boxes with the corners crushed and when I opened the first one and removed the bag, there were a lot of  oken biscotti.  I expect it will be the same for the other box that was damaged.  Given that these are fairly fragile, they should be given better protection from being crushed by the shippers.          The biscotti themselves are tasty, if a bit small.  I wish they were full sized, 3 or 4 inches long instead of an inch and a half.  But as I live in a rural area where people think "biscotti" is a kind of biscuit, these are a good second choice.
