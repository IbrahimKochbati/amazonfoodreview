When I ordered these, it was because they were a flavor of Maruchan Yakisoba I hadn't tried (they don't sell soy sauce flavor at the stores I go to) and subscribing was VERY cheap compared to buying the ones I get for $1 each at stores. I must say that Maruchan is the best  and of this type of meal of the 2  ands of similar prices in stores IMO (this and Nissin Chow Mein), and this flavor is great. To me it tastes more like a teriyaki than just soy sauce.. I think it has a very slight spiciness and sweetness.     In Maruchan Yakisoba there are always plenty of vegetables (unless you get the cheese flavored meals), and I especially like that this flavor has the wider flat noodles instead of the round ones. I tried one plain when they arrived and another one  I added cooked shrimp to. I think this would be good with added cooked beef, chicken, or pork too, but you're not missing out at all if you just make it the way it comes without adding any thing.          These would also be good to have in case of an emergency because the noodles seem to be pre cooked and only require re hydration. you could make it by just pouring boiling water (or the hottest water available) in, covering well, and letting it sit for a little while,  stirring it a couple of times while you wait to get all of the noodles and vegetables into the hot water. Cold water might work but it would probably take a long time to re hydrate every thing.          Another thing you could do if you have plain ramen noodle soup packets around the house that aren't getting eaten and you don't have quite the right shaped bowls to cook them in the microwave is save the trays from these and use them. It says on the package not to reuse the tray, but I think that is for liability reasons. I have yet to melt one from reusing it. What I like to do is put the noodle block into the bowl, add meat and or a bit of small frozen vegetables like corn and peas, fill water to just under the line and cook until the noodles are done, then add the seasoning packet. I find the full ramen soup packet is too salty for me some times though so if you do this, I would add some at a time until it suits your taste.
