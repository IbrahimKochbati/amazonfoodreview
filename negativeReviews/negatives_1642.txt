It has a nice taste.  Good for sipping.  If you drink soda or juice with your meals, this would be a decent alternative.  The tangerine taste is pronounced but not overpowering.  The carbonation is pleasant.          However, it's not a drink I would normally imbibe.  I normally drink either water or beverages sweetened with something other than sugar.  And this has a LOAD of sugar.  Yes, they say it has no added sugar.  That's probably accurate.  But the natural sugar in the apple tangerine orange juices in this drink adds up to 34 grams.  Compare that to the same amount of Coke at 27 grams!  I checked a few other tangerine flavored sodas   they all had similar amounts of sugar as Switch.  I suppose tangerines are loaded with sugar.  Anyway, that's a lot more sugar than I normally drink.          If the sugar isn't an issue, this is worth checking out.
