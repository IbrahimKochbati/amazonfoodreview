First off... I LOVE POPCORN    especially movie theater style popcorn. In fact, I've been known to go to movie theaters without buying a ticket just to buy some popcorn.          We just finished our basement and my wife bought me a popcorn machine for Christmas. We tried a couple other "recipes" and couldn't find quite the taste we were looking for. I then saw the reviews for Great Northern and bought a box. The very first batch I popped got me hooked! It's a PERFECT recipe for my movie theater style taste. Whenever I have friends over and pop it for them, they too fall in love!          Since my first order, I've set this up on repeat delivery so that I'm never out at home!
