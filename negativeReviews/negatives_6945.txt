I'll admit this product makes a great loaf in the  ead machine (use the dark setting, then let the moisture air out)... it has great texture, lightness, rises well, and has really good flavor.          However, I found this product to be almost indigestable Even one piece in the morning with  eakfast produces gastrointestinal distress all day. I've eaten many other gluten free products (and occasionally some gluten ones) and have never run across this effect with any other flour blend. Before I figured out this  ead was the culprit, I thought I had a stomach virus.          In skimming reviews here and elsewhere, I've found a good number of people have had the same issue. I wrote to the company and they said that some people have trouble with sorghum and millet flours. The sorghum flour is the first ingredient, so that may be the case. I do think this  ead dough is more glue like than gluten products, so that may be part of the trouble. The Baking & Pancake Mix and the Brownie Mix seem to be fine for me, they have different ingredients. You can also make a loaf from the Baking & Pancake Mix, there is a recipe on the Pamela's web site   it's just not as nice as the Bread Mix loaf.          Very disappointing.
