Ever since we bought our popcorn machine two years ago we've used this popcorn. Originally we had thought we'd get our own oil and save money rather than use the pre portioned packs. However we tried it once and could never go back. It's just so easy and delicious that it's worth any extra expense. We went on the auto ship program to save some money. I highly recommend this popcorn. It's actually ruined us on movie theater popcorn since we actually prefer this.
