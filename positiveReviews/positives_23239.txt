After my daughters celiac diagnosis, we had to buy the frozen gluten free  eads and the kids were NOT happy.  Although, the frozen  ead is good to eat right after toasting it, it just did not work well for sandwiches in the kids lunch box.  So, I searched the net for  ead recipes and became really frustrated because my  ead would cave in each time.  Then I found Pamela's Amazing Bread.  Let me tell you, it is truly amazing in my eyes.  Not only does it taste great, but it bakes beautifully in my  ead maker.  It has a nice crust and is soft and great for sandwiches, grilled cheese, toast, etc.  We add 1 4 cup of flaxseed to the mix.  Kids love it, so mom is really happy!
