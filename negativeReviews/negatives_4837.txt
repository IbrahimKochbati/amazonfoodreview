I don't see the size of these parchment sheets anywhere; the photo is too small to get it from that.  "Fits most every baking pan" isn't enough information for me. Won't consider purchase unless I know what I'm buying.  REVISION:  I visited another website and found out these sheets are 12.5x16"which is half sheet pan size. Now I am more inclined to try the product. Amazon, you should have included this info in the description!
