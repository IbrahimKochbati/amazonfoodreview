I use these as a training treat when I am working with my two dogs. My dogs were getting bored of the same ol' treats even though I tried to give them a wide variety. This one BY FAR is their favorite, and I like it because its all natural with no preservatives. Some of the pieces are pretty big, but easily  oken with your finger nail. If you carry some around in your pocket like I do when I'm working with them, watch out   you will have the neighborhood dogs wanting a treat too.  :) The price here is quite good also. It is definitly worth a try!
