I have been ordering Koeze nuts over 20 years now.  The quality is as good now as they were when I was given my first jar.  I gave these to my son in law the first christmas we spent together and when he opened them his comment was "these are wallhangers".  They really are the best nuts I've ever had.  Enjoy!!!
