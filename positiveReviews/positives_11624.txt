This was my first purchase of Highland Sugarworks Organic Grade A Dark Amber Maple Syrup, but I promise you that it will not be my last.  It was very flavorful, but not overpowering and a perfect addition to my French Toast this morning.  If you like real maple syrup (not the fake corn syrup garbage) you will not be disappointed with this syrup.
