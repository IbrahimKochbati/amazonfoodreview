SANS root beer has &lt;1 carb and zero calories. I have been on the hunt for good soda without sugar, aspartame or sucralose for a long time. I tried Zevia and think that the SANS root beer is much better. No weird aftertaste and it's not heavy tasting, just light and refreshing. I actually finish the entire can and I never did that with Zevia. I highly recommend SANS root beer soda!
