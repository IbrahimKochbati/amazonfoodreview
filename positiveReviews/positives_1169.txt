When my daughter was an infant, she was allergic to something in my  eastmilk and was put on Neocate which worked wonders for her allergic colitis.  For my son, we were therefore very careful when it came time to picking out a formula to supplement  eastmilk.  His stomach does react when I have accidentally had more dairy than I can tolerate so my pediatrician recommended a lactose free formula, especially given our Asian background.  I wanted something organic, not soy, lactose free, and with as clean of a label as possible and this formula fulfills all of those criteria.  My son didn't like it at first, but now he switches easily between  eastmillk and formula.  He has not been gassy nor spit up on it.  I really wish Amazon stocked it.
