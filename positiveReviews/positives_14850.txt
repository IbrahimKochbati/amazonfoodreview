As others have commented, the bergamot scent is truly impressive in this tea.  The lovely metal tin indeed has two lids    the usual one over the top, and then an inner, inset metal lid sealing the leaves in.  Opening it revealed a flood of sweet and citrus y bergamot and a view of beautiful, large, dark teak leaves.  I  ewed according to directions, and uploaded a photo above to show you the gorgeous amber tea and the huge leaves, nicely plumped from the hot water.  The tea was strongly scented with bergamot, yet I could still taste good clean black tea through it.  I highly recommend this tasty tea, which also happens to be organic and "fair trade certified."
