I have recently started buying Erin Baker's Breakfast cookies because they are a fast, easy and nutritious way for me to start my day.  This flavor is not always available as it is a limited edition flavor, but fear not, these cookies do very well when frozen and can go directly from the freezer to the microwave for about 40 seconds, and you have a nice chewy delicious cookie.          This flavor is delicious some of the major ingredients are whole grain rolled oats, raisins, dried apples, walnuts, coconut and spices (cinnamon, nutmeg and carrot cake spices).  The cookie comes in at 310 calories, 18% fiber, with 17g of sugar and 15% iron.          I was doubtful that a large cookie would sustain me, as lunch for me is about 5.5 hours away, but I have no problem, this cookie is filling and delicious.  As with any fiber filled product, make sure you do drink fluids.          If you do buy these or any of the other Breakfast cookies, be assured that you can freeze and microwave, so on the limited edition flavors, you can buy extra if you really love a particular flavor.
