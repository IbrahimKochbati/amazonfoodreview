SMELL OF DRY GROUNDS: Very strange. Different than regular coffee. A little like sweet garbage. Made me worried that the coffee would be disgusting.          SIZE OF BAG: Enough for about 5 generous scoops.          TASTE OF BREWED COFFEE: Passable. Nothing great, but nothing bad. Had a slight wang and a little bit of an aftertaste like old or cheap coffee.          ACID: A 3 ounce bag wasn't enough to really determine if it was easier to digest than regular coffee. Neither of us drinking the coffee seemed to experience any acid reflex afterward. Still, not enough to truly tell.
