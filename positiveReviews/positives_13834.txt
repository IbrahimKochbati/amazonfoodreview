I read the reviews before trying PB2 peanut butter powder and even with all of the good feedback, I was skeptical. As it turns out, it's surprising and delicious. Getting another jar today. I prepared it exactly as instructed on the jar (2 TBS PB2 powder + 1 TBS water) and it was amazing   more like natural PB without all of the oil and less sweetness than store  ands. They add just the right amount of sugar to this product. The total ingredients are peanuts, salt and sugar. 45 cals for 2 TBS. Also, I tried this in Greek yogurt (1 TBS to one container of yogurt) and it was really good and peanuty! You have to try it to believe it. I'm going to try the chocolate version next. I'd like to make a sesame noodle with this and maybe mini donuts or smoothies. I plan to experiment. A LOT.          I'll be buying a few for stocking stuffers, too. Great product!
