As a "royal watcher" since childhood, I did a double take and stopped short, walking back to where I had been, when I saw this in my periferal vision, several years ago, in the supermarket.  It was that CROWN and that ROBE that Mr. Newman was wearing that got my eye.          "Royal Tea" from Paul Newman's enterprises!  Why not?  I mean    who deserved to name his tea "Royal Tea" than this superstar whose charitable heart was as good as his acting skills, and as wonderful as his ever handsome looks?  The maverick in me has always liked the slightly cocky half smile Mr. Newman gave so often on the screen.  It was as if he had a touch    just a touch, mind you    of anger at our "esteemed" leadership, and at authority in general....just as I have?  Probably....          Anyway, I bought the tea, and found it's flavour really good.  Tasty tea    thy name is NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS ROYAL TEA, ORGANIC BLACK TEA, 100 INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED TEA BAGS, 7.05 OUNCE BOXES, (PACK OF 6).  It has a light, but very bold flavour.  And a very good flavour, too!          I have recently found I must cut down on my favourite sweetener, SPLENDA. (TOO much of anything isn't good    and too much SPLENDA, at least in my case, was beginning to affect my liver!)  I've partially solved this problem by putting TWO tea bags in a slightly larger cup, (actually a 22 ounce glass), and this allows me to cut down on my Splenda packets.  It also gives the tea a more robust taste.          The message on the back of the box, from Mr. Newman's daughter, Nell, (who appears with him in Royal roobes on the front), is funny, and a priceless view into the mind and heart of the sadly late Mr. Newman.  Who knows, but that he, (and Nell), may very well have had royal ancestors?  He was certainly handsome enough, (and Nell quite beautiful enough), to have this actually be true.  The message is delightful, and I am so glad it has been continued on the box.  (One note to Nell, thoough: a "perilous" person is one who is usually a villain(ess).  I take it that you are NOT "perilous", but "imperilled", (someone who IN danger.)  Please check     with the dictionary to be sure I am right on this!          I've been fortunate enough to be able to sample the English FORTUM & MASON's "Royal Blend Tea".  It is very tasty, too    but also imported, and thus,     very expensive.  NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS ROYAL TEA, ORGANIC BLACK TEA, is really tasty, less expensive, and truly an AMERICAN tea.  It proves, in a totally American way, that one need not be a king or queen, to enjoy the very best!  If Mr. Newman's ancestors WERE royal, he was continuing in the BEST of royal traditions, by sharing his bounty, (at a very reasonable cost), with those of us who admire all he did.  If his ancestors weren't royal....well, this truly delicious tea proves that ANYONE, no matter what their ancestry     with enough heart, backing, and expertise    can produce an exceptional tasting tea at reasonable cost.          "King Paul" remains in our hearts, and in our happiest memories.  "Queen Nell" has our respect, our love, and our admiration.  This black tea    the black tea that so many of us grew up on    is our traditional tea, upgraded to a "royal" standard by being organic.  Mr. Newman's company also produces organic green tea, which has its own great taste and health benefits.  But for we traditionalists....black tea is it.  And organic black tea that is SO tasty, truly makes anyone who drinks it,     feel quite royal, indeed!
