Okay, I'm a popchip addict, the first step is admitting there's a problem. I first tried them when they were served to me instead of chips in a deli in NYC. I kept the bag and found them on Amazon and started buying them by the case. Not as salty as regular chips, they also have considerably less grease, more of a tasty rice cake experience than a greasy Lay's chip. I have bought cases of the single serve bags, and end up giving them to friends and coworkers, who turn around and order them for themselves. Yeah, they are good.
