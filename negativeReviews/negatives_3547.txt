I was sold that this product is great for gereatric cats, but not really. My 17 yr old cat can not keep this down. Vet feels because of the unknown source of grains she may continue to vomit up this food. If your cat is real old like mine I suggest trying a grain free food. Cats are carnivores so grains are only fillers in these types of foods. 2 stars for fast shipping
