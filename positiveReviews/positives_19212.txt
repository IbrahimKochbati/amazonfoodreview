We bought this toy for our two granddogs as a Christmas present.     The larger, a boxer pit bull mix was clever enough to grab onto the     yellow cups & just lift & easily found the treats. However, the     beagle was unable to grab onto the cups thus making him work harder     for the treats. Its quite entertaining to watch him go crazy trying     to figure it out. It keeps him occupied for about ten minutes.
