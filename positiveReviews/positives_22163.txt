This is a good quality oil and a nice, tasty  and.  The label of the bottle shows it is 1 liter   slightly more than 1 quart   of  oil.  We like to use this type of oil because it seems so natural, and we have allergies to soy in our home.  So much oil in the grocery stores is canola (popular with producers because birds and animals will not touch the plants), or "vegetable" which is always a soy blend, and usually a GMO product.  Try it, and enjoy.
