Bought this because i didnt want to pay 100 plus for the alternative. Found it to be extremely reliable. Very crisp sound with little to no background noise. Before i bought it other reviews stated it seemed a bit cheap. I disagree, though i do find it to be a bit bulky for it's function. I did drop and  eak it once, but it  was completely my fault. After  eaking it, i contacted customer service, and it was replaced very rapidly. The company's website was easy to navigate, and rather amusing.
