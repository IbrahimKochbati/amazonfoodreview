We frequent Whole Foods and love to buy the larger "Pop Chips" that they make. They are about 7 inches across and so unbelievable crispy! We like to eat them more for fun than anything.          So when I was offered a chance to try these PopChips, I was excited. The size of each chip is about that of a potato chip. The bag is 100 calories (3 Weight Watchers +Points if you are calculating).          The first thing I noticed is the sweet, followed by salty of the chip. Second is the crunch that is oh so satisfying! My 5 year old just loved them while my 8 year old wasn't so hip to the flavor.          There is a distinct sweet potato flavor, where the sweet comes in. There are also some other spices that I can't place, but the taste is not spicy hot, is considerably salty. I like them a lot and will continue to buy them to satisfy that late night or mid afternoon need for a crispy, salty snack.
