I ordered this sampler pack since my husband and I have been on a low carb diet.  Use it to make  eakfast shakes with almond milk and ice.  They work well for this and have been used WAY more quickly than I thought.  Will have to reorder soon. I would like different choices in sampler packs though.  Not crazy about irish cream flavor.
