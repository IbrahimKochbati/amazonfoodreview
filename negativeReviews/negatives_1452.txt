I have to add that I've not baked with this yet. But when I received this I was aghast at the ingredients. Perhaps I didn't read it well because the ingredient list is right there... I guess I simply expected alcohol & vanilla beans, maybe sugar, in an "ol' timey" product.          I'll update this once I use it.
