Yum. Just yum. I've eaten a lot of energy bars, granola bars, various cereal and other bars. Overall I enjoy most of them, so I'm a pretty good target audience. I'm predisposed to being okay with pretty much anything that uses chocolate, so when it's nutritious, too, that's a pretty big bonus.          I loved the texture of these, the feel of them in my mouth. And I love oats. Wonderful, wonderful oats. The combination of the satisfying texture and tastes blended well and were very tasty.          And, as I wrote in the title, even my kids enjoyed them, and none of them is a fan of coconut. They're a pretty picky crew. The energy bars I eat revolt them. Granola bars? Those are great because they're loaded with sugar. Who doesn't love sugar? So when I handed them these bars I had no idea what to expect. The verdict: not only no complaints, but some raised, appreciative eye ows!          Definitely, no doubt, if I find these in the grocery store I'll buy them. They're great to keep around for those times you're running from activity to activity, meeting to meeting and don't have time for anything resembling a real meal. And it's a lot more nutritious than a candy bar. Good stuff. I'd buy other products by Pamela's, too. And looks like they have a good selection. We're fans!
