I have given my dogs every expensive dog food there is, Orijin, Blu, Merrick...you name it, and even though they were good this one is the best.  No upset tummies during the switch to this dog food either.  Even my senior dog who always has loose stool now has a firm healthy stool. Plus, Newman's Own gives all their profits to charity so it really is the best as far as I'm concerned.
