I loved everything about this oatmeal. It is fast and easy to prepare, just add hot water or milk. The serving size is just right for and is convenient to just throw in my purse for  eakfast or lunch away from home. The maple  own sugar blend is just right; neither one overpowers the other and its not too sweet.     Great for a fast and healthy  eakfast.     Oh, and my kids will eat it too!
