I eat these tuna cups (or the salmon cups) almost daily.          If you're looking for a nutritious snack, these cups really can't be beat.  If you're a bodybuilder or athlete trying to increase your daily protein intake, these are awesome.  If you're a parent trying to get your kid to eat healthy, getting them to like fish is a great idea.  If you're trying to eat 5 7 meals a day to lose weight, make one of these cups one of your meals, the protein fills you up and makes you feel good.  It also requires a bit of chewing to complete the eating experience.          Why eat a nutritionally empty "100 calorie pack" of goldfish crackers or potato chips when you could have something like this that has only 80 calories and infinitely more nutritional benefit??          I'll eat these alone, straight from the cup, basically anywhere since you don't need to refridgerate and you don't need a can opener.  I'll dump them onto salad, or mix with rice, quinoa, or beans.          Here's the nutrition data off the back (for 1 2.7oz cup) at the time of writing:          Calories 80 (10 from fat)     Total Fat 1g     Cholesterol 35mg     Sodium 15mg     Total Carb 0g     Protein 18g     Omega 3 EPA DHA 200mg          You really can't beat this for something so portable that requires no preparation or refridgeration.  The package says "in water" but there's a little bit of  oth in the cup, and if you squeeze this out or just leave it at the bottom of the cup, you probably cut the sodium down to 10mg.          I highly recommend these tuna cups and the salmon cups as well.  But, avoid the tuna salad, or the flavored varieties if you are looking to get the maximum nutritional benefit.  Those salads and flavorings just add salt, sugar, carbs.
