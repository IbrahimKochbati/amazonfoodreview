This is a basic, good green tea.  I use enough for a 4 cup batch, but use only water for 1 cup.  In this way, I can drink a condensed form of it at my work desk all day long.  This keeps me from sneaking into the coffee room and getting my caffeine only from coffee sources.  Not that this is bad (my company gets the best coffee in the world), but all too often there are high calorie or high salt snacks lurking in the coffee room, just waiting for you to bounce in there!  Yikes!!  And you always fall for it:  I don't care who you are or how steeled your thoughts are against taking any "free" coffee room snacks.          Getting back to the tea.  This gunpowder green tea tastes great and it is entertaining too.  The "gunpowder" is rolled up little balls of tea leaves, and if you make this in clear glass you can watch them unroll (explode, like gunpowder).  This isn't the highest quality, but the price is right and it tastes good.  Perfect for your average normal day.  For that, I give it 5 stars.
