We switched or dog to the canned All Ages food. She has had diarrhea and vomiting for 2 days. She has never been ill and is a very healthy dog   19 years old.          Look online and investigate this product via consumer affairs. The story is very common, some dogs even dying from GI tract infections, siezures and horrible allergies.          We'll be switching her back to the old standby, SOJO's. She's kind of tired of it, but we know it is good for her and won't hurt her.
