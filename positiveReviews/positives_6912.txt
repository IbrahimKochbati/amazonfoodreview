I really enjoy Wolfgang Puck's K Cups, so far all the ones I've tried haven't left my stomach churning..and,          this was my first time trying out the Sorrento Fair Trade Roast and purchased it on a Warehouse Amazon price deal.  I am really happy with my purchase.  The taste of the Sorrento is what I would expect of a Medium Roast   A good, smooth blend.  No bitter, acidic after taste, and leaves you wanting for more after that first cup!  (At least, it left me)! :p  It's doesn't leave you with the "shhhakes" either, it has that right "balance" you need with your daily cup of coffee.          Yes, I will be getting another 24 Count of this when I am finished with this pack!          5 Stars!
