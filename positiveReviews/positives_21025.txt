For decades, Gatorade is synonomous with sports, athletes, performance,  health, hydration and nutrients and vitamins.  If your intention is to use it as a higher level like sports training, performance, endurance, energy, etc.,  then this is the product for you.  If your level is for just fitness and exercise, then this can only be a great enhancement.          The shakes provided by Gatorade are not thick, so it's not quite the "shake" feel, athough it is very tasty being that it is specially made for athletes, etc.          For me, interested in only fitness and exercise, I will maximize with the protein benefit as a quick meal enhancement.  I like the low gram of fat, and no trans fat.  For others who need the specified amount of nutrients, this is sufficient.  This is tasty!!  Rizzo
