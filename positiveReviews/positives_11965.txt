Though they might be a bit pricey for just the average dog owner like myself (as opposed to say someone in a profession working with dogs), they're great treats.     Perfect size for the quick little snack on the run.     And yeah... my dog loves these. At 13, she's getting pretty finicky, and these will gather her full attention.     Recommended.
