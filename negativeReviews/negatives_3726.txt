The beef, chicken, and turkey and gravy foods are disgusting. They are so disgusting, I didn't have the heart to feed this to my child. When I popped the lid to these the first thing I noticed was the foul smell. It made me gag. I can't even describe how bad this smelled. It was like rotten meat flavored jello. I didn't have the heart to make my daughters eat it so I gave it to my cats. None of them would go near it except for one who ate about 1 4 of it and walked away. Don't torture your child with this.
