I tasted this snack at my local pub and found it tasty... much better than chips or other mixes. I was told it was sold in Sam's club and Wegman's for $18 per 30 0z container. Bought it from Utz in a 4 pack for $41.00.     Each piece has a different taste and texture...Could not ask for a more delicious snack or a better price. Thank you Utz!
