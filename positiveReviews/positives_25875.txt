My favorite cracker to serve with a fine cheese like Brie is table water crackers, particularly by Carr. The long box is filled with a single round of packaged crackers. Each cracker has a taste that is bland and subtly crisp.          Carr's also offers a variety of its water crackers: bite sized, with cracked pepper (another favorite), golden, a mixed assortment, and, of course, wheat.          So in review: a plate of water crackers, Brie slices, grapes (red or green), and a bottle of merlot. I love a red wine with my cheese and crackers. Sometimes a loaf of fresh French  ead is great to smear a nicely mellowed  ie over it, bite by bite.
