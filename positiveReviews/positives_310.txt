I ordered these after a fair bit of searching online   even ordering the smaller 1 3oz bags. I will admit, I was a bit sceptical when I ordered this since it was not cheap and had no idea how good (or bad) the cashews would be...          The order came in pretty fast   like 3 days. The cashews were fresh and whole   with like 10  oken pieces. They were in 2 5lb bags sealed with clear tape.. first I found it odd but then it turned out to be a good deal; considering the second pack stayed fresh till I opened them. The trick is to actually keep them in an air tight box so that they stay fresh longer.          The only negative I can think of is that the price went up abt $5.00 for the 10lb since I bought them.
