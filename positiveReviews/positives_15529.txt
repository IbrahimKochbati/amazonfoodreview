I purchased this tree for my daughter who is a landscape designer.  She said it came in perfect condition, in creative packaging and that the tree was not a baby tree.  It was actually as shown   a 4 year old tree.  She was very surprised by the quality of the tree.  It came in a short amount of time and had a little booklet with it to help take care of it.  Highly recommend this.
