I had very high expectations once I opened the box.  There was one problem that may have affected the taste, the seal was open when I unscrewed the lid but I was hungry at the time and didn't really care.  So I mixed up some peanut butter and gave it a try.  It is truly very peanutty and the texture is somewhat strange, not quite creamy or chunky.  I find that it is best mixed with the real stuff, or when it is mixed using milk instead of water.  Overall it is a good healthy product, just not addictive like the real stuff is.
