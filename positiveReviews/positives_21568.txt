I love this stuff. It's a quick, easy  eakfast and stays with me long then dry cereal. The sweetness is just right. We always have it in the house, and it is great when traveling  camping, hotels, etc. Especially camping. Heat the water on the fire (or propane stove) and you've got a yummy hot  eakfast to get you going. Love this stuff!
