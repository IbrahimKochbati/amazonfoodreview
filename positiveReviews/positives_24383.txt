I purchased these for my dog and my sisters 2.  They are all large dogs (46 lbs. and up)  Until these they were running around, getting in each others face   JUST DOING WHAT DOGS DO.  I gave them the "EVERLASTING TREAT'  and they went to seperate places and did not move for over an hour.          There is only one thing   with these dogs   NOTHING IS EVERLASTING.  They loved them and I will definitely buy more.          As usual   You can go wrong   when you go AMAZON
