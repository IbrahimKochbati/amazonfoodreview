I'd never heard of this sauce (or this  and) before but I found some discussion about it on the Web, so we tried it. Hands down, this is the BEST pizza sauce you can buy in a can. You can literally eat it out of the can with a spoon, it's that good. It's the only  and my family buys anymore. We've been using it for several years now on homemade pizza.
