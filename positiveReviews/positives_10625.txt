These are the typical red bags of premium beef jerky you see at the store, only...you get FOUR of them! These four bags of delicious, mouth watering beef nuggets are a tasty and healthy snack, and I don't feel bad about eating a whole bag throughout the day at my desk.          I love all of the varieties Jack Link's has to offer. I've been a die hard Teriyaki fan myself, so I'm hesitant to sway away from my typical "go to" bag.          If you're looking for a satisfying feel good snack to take on road trips, sporting events, at your desk, or what have you ' you do NOT want to pass this up.
