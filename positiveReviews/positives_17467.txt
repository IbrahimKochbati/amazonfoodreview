I had this spice on my rice years ago at a Persian restaurant in Tyson's Corner, VA called Shamshiry.  I looked for it in the international section of every local grocery store and some asian groceries with no luck when I found it on Amazon and ordered it.  It is lemony but more complex then lemon juice and has a wonderful color.  It is amazing on fish, eggs, salad, avacado, even popcorn instead of salt.  I'm going to try it on everything, and then I'm going to order some more.
