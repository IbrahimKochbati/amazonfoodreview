I have been buying  new Morning Graham Crackers since Fe uary of 2010. Never had a Problem with damage of the crackers in shipping .     Why Did Amazon Remove the Graham Crackers From Subscribe and Save?????  Why Did Amazon Remove The Graham Crackers From Prime ???The Crackers are a much Higher Price From a Third Party Seller. I will Purchase the Crackers From Whole Foods . Not Fair of Amazon to Take Away the Connivence of Ordering a Case
