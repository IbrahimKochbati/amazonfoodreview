I bought Crunchies Freeze Dried Organic Peas and some other Crunchies products in hopes they would be a satisfying, healthy snack for my children.  Both of my kids (ages 5 and 8) gave me the thumbs down on taste, though.  Same reaction to the other dried veggies and even the dried fruits. So, my desk at work is now full of Crunchies products, and they are a nice quick snack to keep me going between meals. I recommend them for this purpose, but I think most kids will probably say no to these products given the flavor of the snacks is OK, not great.
