My dog is about 70lbs, 11 years old and diabetic. We couldn't completely cut her off from all treats once she became diabetic, so we needed something healthier. She loves Greenies and they're healthy enough for us to feel comfortable. Yeah, they are pricey but if you buy them on Amazon with the free shipping they are alot cheaper than buying them in stores! For all she gives us, the treats are still a bargain!
