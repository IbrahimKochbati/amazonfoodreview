Was looking for something that was healthy & That they may like well I've found it! Great ingredients & packaging and made in the USA! They also like Taste of the Wild :Bison & Venison flavor, I either mix these together or alternate the food. They don't eat as much probably because it more filling & better for them than chain store junk. Coats are shiny & they have more energy. They're happy so I'm happy this stuff is GREAT!
