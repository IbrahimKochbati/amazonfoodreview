I of course prefer freshly made espresso but sometimes instant is good in a pinch.  I travel around Europe extensively and there are several  ands available there which aren't at all bad.  This  and is OK for using it as a coffee flavoring in custards, etc., but as a beverage, it rates rock bottom in my book.
