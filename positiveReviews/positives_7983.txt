I thought it might not be a great idea to buy meat through the mail but it turned out Great.  I love Gyros and thought why not order from Amazon, at least that would make me feel better about the whole idea.  My order was delivered in 3 days   it would have been 2 but we had a storm and the driver couldn't get here.  It was fabulaously packed with ice packs that we could reuse. The gyros taste great and are pretty conveniet; it makes a great and easy lunch. I will definatly order this again and again.
