I am writing this review to see if anyone else's dogs have gotten sick after eating this treat.  Please be aware, right away, that I am not 100% positive that this treat was the cause of my dog becoming seriously ill, but I did not introduce anything new into his diet before he became so ill, I thought we would lose him.  After purchasing for a friend, and soon after giving my 10 year old dachshund at his "free sample" from Kmart online on a Saturday morning a few weeks ago, and by Saturday night, he became violently ill.  My vet kept asking if I gave him anything different, and this treat was the only thing I gave him.  I gave this treat to my dog, because he LOVES to chew, and I guess I really lost my mind by not reading the ingredients before giving this to him.  I did believe the package when it said, "easily digestible," but I didn't read the other ingredients closely enough.          I told my family member, who I gave the bag from Amazon, not to feed his dog this product until I hear if this has happened to others.  It is difficult not to associate what happened to my dog with this product now!          I also have to wonder how something man made can be safer and healthier than a pig ear, which is all natural?  I don't get it.          Stick to high quality bully sticks and raw bones (NEVER cooked!) people!  I know after a hospitalization due to an enlarged spleen, pancreatitis, and dehydration, weeks of watching my dog suffer in pain, and seeing that look in his eyes as if he is going to leave us at any time, giving him five different meds, trips back and forth to the vet, and finally, an ultra sound to rule out a cancerous mass, I will!  One thousand dollars later, you can bet I will!  :(          I am interested in hearing from others.  Wish I could put my email here, because I have to know if his illness was related to this product or just some very strange coincidence.
