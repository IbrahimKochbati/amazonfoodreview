My daughter had been enjoying this hot chocolate while she was in California, and wanted to find it locally when she got home.  We weren't able to find it in any of the stores, so ordered it here.  It arrived quickly, was well packed, and the product was fresh.  This Mexican hot chocolate is much more flavorful than the regular kinds, and we're looking forward to enjoying it all winter!
