Really do love the flavor of licorice, with this tea I can get that without the  sugar.  It is naturally sweet. The licorice flavor doesn't intensify with longer steeping time so if you want tht flavor to be more intense you have to use two bags.  My husband hates this tea though, he is Japanese and it reminds him of the herbal tonics they made him drink as a kid! More for me...!     I also like the Yogi Throat Cure tea, similar flavor but has cherry bark.
