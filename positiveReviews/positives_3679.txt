One of my dogs had irritable bowel syndrome which we tried to address with food from the vet, raw food, and every kind of dog food in a pet store.  A friend told me about Newmans and how it cleared up her dog's stomach problems.  One day later   firm stools, no gas, happy dog, ecstatic dog parents!  My other dog is 10 and is often mistaken for a puppy due to her good energy and coat.  I am so glad we found this food!
