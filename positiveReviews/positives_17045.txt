This is possibly one of my German Shepherd Border Collie pups FAVORITE toys ever...that being said she did manage to do it in. She is an aggressive chewer and managed to chew off the rubber around the top of the jug  which made it unsafe for her to keep playing with. It did keep her busy for hours trying to get her food or treats out of it.          If you do have an aggressive chewer check out the squirrel dude...same concept of a treat to eat toy  not as much room inside and easier to do so it doesn't last as long at least for my dog  but it has stayed in one piece!
