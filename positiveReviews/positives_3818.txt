This is my 6th kit I have made and as usual it is simply amazing!!! I am truly hooked on all Amazon's wine kits as they have all turned out better then I have ever imagined for the price. i couldn't be happier with the results and will continue to purchase these kits to add to my wine cellar. I am in the process of fermenting the Barolo and am eagerly anticipating the end results.
