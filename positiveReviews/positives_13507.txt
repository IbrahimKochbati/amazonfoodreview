From Nestle comes Abuelita an excellent hot chocolate for those Fall and Wintry days.  This is sugared dark chocolate with a hint of cinnamon.  Each box comes with six tablets.  The best way to serve is to heat four cups of milk,  eak up one tablet, put milk and chocolate in blender, and blend approximately one minute.  I have the standard powdered hot chocolate in the cupboard but my kids seem to go for the Abuelita first.  They add one  oken tablet and milk into the Cocomotion and in a few minutes they are in hot chocolate heaven.  Abuelita has a homemade dark chocolate taste that is not found in most conventional powdered  ands.  This a product that is well worth keeping on hand for those hot chocolate days.
