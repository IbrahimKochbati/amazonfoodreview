Just received this in my package today and it was already opened for me and spilled out on the box. When I opened the box up, the air protector bags were just sitting on top of all the items instead of filling in the space between so the nutella was just rocking around the whole time. I'm sure it would have been delicious, but now I'd rather just get in my car and buy this elsewhere then to have it come again in bad packaging and handling.
