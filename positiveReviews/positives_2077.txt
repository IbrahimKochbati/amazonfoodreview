Adzuki ( or Azuki) beans are ment to be used in asian sweets. You can make sweet bean paste by boiling the beans for 30 40 min, (changing the water out at least twice) draining and mashing the beans with sugar.(strain the paste if you do not like the bean skins)  What you get is a paste that can be put on ice cream, fill pasteries or stuff into Mochi Cakes.
