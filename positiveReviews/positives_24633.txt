True, the cans often have very minor dents (why they're at Amazon), but at least with the ones I bought the top rims were fine, so you can certainly still open them with a can opener.  Given that we need this for our dog who requires in his diet and there is no longer any available locally, this is wonderful to get delivered for what it cost in the stores.  Pretty tasty and good for people too!
