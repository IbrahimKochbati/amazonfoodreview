I have been using this food for 4 years since I read raving reviews on many sites. I was looking for a reasonably priced food which was better in quality than the cheap chain crap. I didn't want to pay $2 a pound for a high quality food and Canidae was just right for my budget and quality needs. My dog loves it (but you can't really judge it on that alone as he is a lab and will eat anything) however his coat is nice, his stool is the right consistency, and he is hardly ever ill. He also NEVER EVER has gas (but he does burp from time to time but not smelly like others have mentioned.) I wasn't happy when the price increased and the quality supposedly dropped a bit but I am still happy with this food overall and have continued to use it. I am always on the lookout for high quality food at a reasonable price so if anyone knows of something high quality at around the same price point please respond to this post and let me know.          On a different note, was I the only person who actually DID hear about the formula change before it was too late? When I went to purchase more food and saw that the 40lb bag was discontinued I went looking for a reason why and to make sure there weren't any other issues. Right on their website it mentioned the formula change, bag change, and the proper way to transition your dog from the old to the new food to avoid digestive issues. As I had 1 full bag of old formula left, I followed the instructions and guess what, no issues whatsoever with the transition. My dog did NOT get sick at all and has not had a single problem with this food new or old formula.
