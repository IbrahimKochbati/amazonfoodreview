I would recommend this as a good basic coffee.  It has a satisfying flavor and will make many a good cup of coffee.  I prefer drinking my coffee black and I found this to be produce a good cup.  It is not bitter and even though I had the decaffeinated coffee, it did not taste flat like so many decafs do.
