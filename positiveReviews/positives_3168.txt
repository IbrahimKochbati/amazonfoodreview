Plugged direct into windows and controlled via ustream.tv software interface   this worked well, (although we needed a little more gain   obtainable by using better software   cubase, garage band etc), as an interim setup before we could get a more pro level interface for more than one mic etc.  Nice!     It feels a bit flimsy construction wise   but we were not going to take it on the road!
