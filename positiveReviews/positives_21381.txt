This food contains all of the good stuff and none of the fillers.  Because of the limited ingredients it is one of the few foods I can feed my dog, who is allergic to many common dog food ingredients.  Unfortunately due to the cost, I only use this food on a supplemental basis.  This bag would last for about 2 days for a dog weighing 20 25 pounds.  For that reason, I only feed this food a couple of times a week on a supplemental basis.  Even the larger packages are cost prohibitive.  On a side note, I've found the frozen raw diets are generally cheaper than freeze dried, so I'm hoping to source the frozen varieties locally.
