Super Bubble is my very favorite gum, and very hard to find here.  The box I received was a real hit or miss.  More than half the gum was  ick hard   totally unchewable.  I've never run across this issue with this product and am very disappointed. I will take a chance and buy it again sometime in the future, but this particular purchase left a bad taste in my mouth.
