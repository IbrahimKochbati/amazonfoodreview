This definitely does not taste like the vegetable navrattan korma I've had from restaurants. This is kind of oily and the vegetable korma I order out is always creamy. This also has cubes of cheese, which I've never had in my vegetable korma before. However, I think it has a good flavor. If I could describe it in non Indian terms, it's a bit like a minestrone flavor, but of course it has that curry gravy. I would agree with the other reviews, I noticed maybe three pieces of cashew in this. I thought vegetable korma has raisins in it too, but this doesn't seem to have any. This is actually one of Kitchens of India's lower calorie offerings    I wondered how vegetable korma could be low calorie, but now I see it's because it's not creamy the way it is at restaurants. Still, it's decent if you don't expect the same thing you'd order out. Would go well with some basmati rice.
