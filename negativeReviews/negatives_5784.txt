Dogs got them as an alternative to beef bones which they are allergic to.  They got right into them, but you must supervise as the knobby ends  eak off and they are about the size of a large marble so could cause some trouble.  I also noticed they splintered, so they were removed at that point. I like the idea, but the safety issue was a problem.
