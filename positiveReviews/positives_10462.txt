My dogs only eat this  and of dogfood.  One of them is 10, one is 6.  JR Terrier and Rat Terrier.  Normally we make the trek to Vitamin Cottage and hope they have it in stock the day we go.  Then we pay the earth for it and lug it home.  It was a treat to get this big bag of dogfood via UPS....free Prime shipping....and about $5 cheaper than we would have paid at VC.  My dogs can not eat corn, so that eliminates most of the inexpensive dogfoods.  We are stuck with high quality dogfood at high quality prices!  But getting it at Amazon makes it much easier.
