The product was okay but the color was very different than advertised.  It was a darker pink, not red at all.          I tried to use it a couple different ways, and as a relative beginner, I did not find the product easy to use.          I tried mixing in with a little vanilla extract in order to "paint" it on (I had read this was the best way to do it).  I found that the painting was very streaked and not very consistent.  Maybe someone more experienced will be able to use it more effectively.  In the end, because the red color was important for the cake, I mixed it with red food coloring instead of vanilla extract.  the pearl dust used this way had just a little impact on the color, not a great deal.          In the end, I would have experimented more on the best way to use it if the color had been more red.  But as was, I didn't find it super useful and will be unlikely to purchase again.  I hope that other people have a better experience as I very much like the idea of the product.
