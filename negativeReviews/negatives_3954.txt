I have to agree that these are likely factory seconds    one of the cans in the pack I bought was half full and weighed only 9 ounces (including the can!). There's supposed to 15 oz of food in there, much less the weight of the can itself (full cans weigh about 17 ounces.)          If ConAgra didn't even check the weight of the cans before shipping them to Amazon, it seems to imply that they are selling lower quality product to Amazon. The rest of the cans in the pack was fine, and I'm sure Amazon will take care of my problem with this transaction, but I definitely wouldn't recommend purchasing these unless you're willing to gamble a bit.          The ravioli itself is good   I'd agree with the other reviews, it is tasty and relatively healthy for something out of a can. I wouldn't eat it every day, but it is a nice quick lunch or snack.
