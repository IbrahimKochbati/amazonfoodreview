This is a dried noodle soup that you put the seasoning in the noodles then either put water in it and microwave for three minutes or pour boiling water over it and wait for a few moments.          The flavor was spicy chicken and I admit that I felt a little of the warmth from the spices, but didn't really taste the chicken flavor. I did like that there was green onions in with the seasoning. This was better than the usual peas and carrots that are on the top of a Cup O Noodles.          I didn't like the bowl that the soup came in. When it had hot water in it, it became really flimsy. I was afraid that the edge was going to cave in and I would get burned from the hot water.          In the end, this was basically a Cup O Noodles soup. It tasted just like a Cup O Noodles except that they seasoning package was separate and you had to pour that into the soup before messing with water.          At the moment, Amazon does not have a price listed for these so I don't know how cost effective they would be. In my opinion, I would say that the noodle soup was good and filling but take a look at the Cup O Noodles selection before deciding if you really need to order the soup from Amazon.
