I have ordered the 7 pack of these Digestive Biscuits several times. They are delicious with a cup of tea, and are a slightly healthier version of a "cookie" but with more fiber and perhaps not as sweet as the traditional cookie. I agree with previous reviewers that Amazon packaging has been insufficient in the past, resulting in crumbled and crushed biscuits. However, my most recent shipment (ordered January 8, 2012)arrived in nearly perfect condition, in improved packaging, with all biscuits intact. Since this  and is difficult to find in a regular grocery store, I highly recommend purchasing from Amazon with Prime shipping!
