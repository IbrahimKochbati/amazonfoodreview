Wow!  If you enjoy Earl Grey tea   this one will knock your socks off!          The fragrance will start you salivating   or running from the room, if, like my husband, you do NOT care for this flavor scent!  Once I popped open the well sealed tin, I knew I was going to like this tea.          I use a French press to make my tea, followed the excellent instructions on the tin, and sat down to sip my way through my first cup   then another   yes, the leaves are "re usable" for a couple of cups at least.  It makes the higher price tag a little more palatable   but keep in mind this is organic and fair trade too, which always adds a little to the price tag.          It's tea that tastes great and that you can feel good about drinking.  It's now on my "must have" list!
