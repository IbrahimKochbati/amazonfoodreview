Michael Season's baked cheese snacks are in. I don't care if they may be inconsistent with the distribution of cheese on their product, big companies are inconsistent too. Your basketball players don't make every shot, your football players don't make every touch down. Are you whining at them or their coach? No. You deal with it, because despite the flaws, you like them. Natural Snacks LLC from Illinois is providing us with a healthier snack free from glutens and hydrogenated oils, and I'm thankful for that.
