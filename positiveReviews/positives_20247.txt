This is one of my favorite things to eat (I enjoy it several times a week). To add a little zing, I stir in some mixed pickle. It has a very authentic flavor that reminds me of the dal my Gujarati grandmother would make. I absolutely cannot believe something with such a subtle, delicate flavor could come out of a packet and is ready in a minute! This over white rice is the ultimate Indian comfort food. And the best part is that it's vegan, high in protein and fiber, and all natural.
