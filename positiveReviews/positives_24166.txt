This size bag is great for filling up the office candy dishes that some offices keep around for public grazing (I'm my own best customer). Mix of candy is good, no complaints from anyone. Large enough bag that it lasts for more than a few days.  Candy was fresh (I sampled several just to make sure). Price is about what I'd pay for the equivalent amount of candy if I went to the local grocery store.
