I use this for most of my cooking needs.  Started using it for yogurt, and it has made the best yogurt I've tasted.  Prefer to use whole milk since you pay more for lowfat that essentially has milk solids removed.  Having grown up on a dairy farm that makes no sense to me.  The Europeans have stricter laws on pesticides than most of the world, which is an extra benefit.
