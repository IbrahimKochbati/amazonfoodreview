I bought this for my 8 month old grandson to try.  He loves it!  I'm so pleased that I am ordering it for my infant great niece and also for part of an all organic baby shower gift.  This food is inexpensive, convenient, and organic.  Best of all . . . He likes it!  I'm setting up the recurring delivery method for my grandson.     CORRECTION!  The product I ordered two weeks ago was $7.76 a case.  Now the cost is $11.03.  That's quite a price hike.  Is there any way to be notified if the price goes back down?
