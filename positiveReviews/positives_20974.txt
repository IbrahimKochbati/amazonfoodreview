I think we bought about 8 bags of this Merrick Whole Earth Farms adult dry dog food and so far the first bag is working out well.  We have a few dogs and we usually get a couple of 35 40 lb bags but it is hard to store but this 8 lb bags are convenient and easier to store if you like to stock up.  The ingredients are good and our dogs seem to like the food and they have not had any digestive issues.  Will probably buy this again in the future.
