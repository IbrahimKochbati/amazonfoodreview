This tastes bitter and sort of...fishy? The Jesper mate I got from Argentina was VASTLY superior. I'm not sure what they do to this Eco Tea  and, but I tell you, something ain't right. I went in without expectations, I'm not really a mate snob or anything    this just really isn't very good. I'd steer clear and spring for something more authentic, unless you really just don't know any better.
