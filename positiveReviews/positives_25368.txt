C.E.T. chews are the only chews sticks that I give to our sporting  eed. They are excellent and safe for your pup. The plus to ordering from Amazon is the price  $24.95 and free shipping versus the $38+ and $39+ price on the exact bag from our vet and another local retailer vet. However, after ordering over a dozen bags through Amazon, I am very unsatisfied because the 30 count bag of of XL chews for a 51 lb+ dog are very inconsistent in size and thickness. If I wanted puny little chews for my 65lb dog, then I could save a ton of money by ordering these Virbac C.E.T. chews in much smaller sizes. I don't want to see skimpy pieces of chews in a bag labeled XL. Amazon customer service recently refunded my last bag but I had 3 in that order. If they are packing these XL chews as less than 1st quality and discounting because of that, then it needs to be clearly noted in the Amazon product description. Otherwise, fill the bag with the XL chews as labeled!
