I ordered 3 packs of 27 count greenie dog chews from Entirely Pets and have ordered this product from various sources for many years. I have now opened the 2nd pack and both were the same:  all of the greenies were stuck together in one big lump.  I had to forcibly pull them apart.  Although I didn't try them myself, it leads me to believe these are old products and probably stale.  I will not order from this vendor again, even if it is a buck or so cheaper.
