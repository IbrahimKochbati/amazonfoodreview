i bought the 8oz Roosevelt Popper originally. I tried local popcorn and other national  ands of oil and popcorn but could not get that theater taste. I then ordered a case from Discount Tommy and found his to be the taste I was looking for. Shipping is fast and the cost is very reasonable. I strongly recommend this product.
