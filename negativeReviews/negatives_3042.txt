I concur 100% with the other negative reviews.  My nuts arrived rancid and were not edible.  What more is there to say other than these Azar macadamia nuts were a huge waste of good money?  Two pounds of expensive nuts were tossed out in the back yard to feed the wild life and even the squirrels would not eat them.          I will stick with organic raw macadamias, preferably from Hawaii and a more reliable producer.
