We purchased a large table top popcorn machine with an 8oz. kettle. It is a little difficult to squeeze the oil portion into the large kettle.  The flavor of the popcorn is quite good.  The packages are easy to store.  Overall my rating was 3 stars because of the difficulty with the solidified oil. We have a family of 5 and use 2 packages to satisfy all of us.  One package can easily feed 3 4 people.
