Cannot detect any difference from other ghees.  Also, their supposed 'free' sample is not really. They ship a tiny jar in a box through the mail and it costs about $2.00 in postage, something for the box and it costs you $4.99.          Very disappointed.  They should reconsider doing that because it taints all of their offerings.
