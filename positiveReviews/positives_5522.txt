For my daughter's birthday I ordered her a Stir Crazy popcorn maker.  I was busy and knew I didn't have time to run to the grocery store.  I ordered the popcorn on line too.  We made the popcorn using organic coconut oil.  We were shocked to see almost every kernel popped.  1 2 cup and the popper was full.  The popcorn was big and fluffy.  The flavor was good.  The first time we put butter and salt on it.  The second time just salt and it was great!  We placed it in baggies and took it to the movies.  Okay   so maybe that sounds a bit cheap however our popcorn was fresh, tasty, and healthy as compared to the movie theater popcorn.
