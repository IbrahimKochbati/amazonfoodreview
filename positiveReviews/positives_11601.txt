We love this Highland Sugarworks Pure Organic Maple Syrup. The color, taste, and clarity are all excellent. It doesn't have any plastic jug taste, which I was concerned about. It's delicious. And, the price is good. The price is very good if you buy it through the Amazon Auto Ship program like we do. The jug is a #2 recyclable plastic. We highly recommend this syrup!
