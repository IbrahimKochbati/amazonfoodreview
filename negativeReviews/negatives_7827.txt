These prepackaged curries are edible but not too tasty. Even by the low standards of Indian food in foil pouches. Do not even think of telling an actual Indian person this is any good. Really the only upside is that one of these just takes a couple minutes in the microwave to heat up, so if you need to eat RIGHT NOW and you don't much care what you eat, this could theoretically work. Though, if you absolutely must have curry in a pouch, I can think of at least one well known private label grocery store  and that is far better for roughly the same price if not cheaper. If you just want very fast food out of your own kitchen, there have got to be better alternatives.
