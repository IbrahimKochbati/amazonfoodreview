Seafood ramen... I love having these sodium msg packed instant noodles every once in awhile when I'm too lazy to make lunch or dinner. I don't know if you'd actually call these "seafood" flavored, though there are little dried fish cakes and plenty of seaweed in them, but they are somehow indescribably good. I actually like the original flavor better, but since these were cheaper, I went with it.          I've seen these with cheaper prices at asian supermarkets when it's on sale, but if you "subscribe" to this on amazon, it's worth an extra dollar or two not to make a trip to the market. When I cook these, I usually add an egg, some veggies, and leftover meat (or whatever is in the fridge). The seafood flavor packet is strong so it adds lots of flavor to everything else.          When I got these delivered, none of my ramen were crushed, so it really depends on how carefully your delivery company treats the boxes. Anyway, I'd suggest buying one packet at a store first to try it before committing to a whole box.
