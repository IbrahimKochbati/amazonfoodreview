Right now I own 3 cats that I found outside, a good eight years ago, and I found another cat which I adopted also.  I have always fed them Eukanuba Adult Lamb&Rice dry cat food, and they truly LOVE IT!  When you first open the bag you can smell the savory aroma!  Of the 3 cats that I found outdoor and adopted, one turned out to be a Turkish Angora and the other has markings similar to that of a snow leopard, and the third cat I found out is part Egyptian mau.  I also feed a feral cat who has been living in my back yard for 10 years.  They all love this food, and even when they changed the formula of this food a few years ago, they still eat it and love it!  If you read the ingredients, it is excellently made, and a real plus for their diet!  They've been eating it for years now, and I have yet to see any of my cats turn up their nose to this food.          The other dry foods that my cats love is Fancy Feast Gourmet Filet Mignon Flavor with Real Seafood & Shrimp Dry Cat Food and they've just started eating Eagle Pack Natural Pet Food, Indoor Formula for Cats and a cat food  and called 'Artemis'.  I haven't any problems with them eating any of these dry foods, and I've been rescuing cats for over 30 years now, and have owned as many as 7 cats at one time.  One set of kittens were born outdoor and I  ought them indoors with their mother and kept them all until the day they passed on(they all lived to be close to 20 years of age) and they too ate Eukanuba lamb&rice and loved it!          I have had foods that they turned up their nose with like 'Chicken Soup' and 'Taste of the Wild'.  The same way we humans have our likes and dislikes is the same way that these cats have their likes and dislikes.  What's good for one cat might not be good for another.  You just have to learn your cat, and see what they like and just give it to them.  While my cats are in love with Eukanuba lamb&rice, maybe your cat will also or maybe not, but it isn't fair to not try this food because of a review where the owner says that their cat doesn't like it. As previously stated, maybe your cat will not like it or maybe your cat will love it!  I've tried cat foods based on good reviews figuring that the food will automatically be a hit and sometimes it was and sometimes it wasn't!  It's all up to the cat!
