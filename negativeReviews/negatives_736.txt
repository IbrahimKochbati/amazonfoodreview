I have a recurring shipment of this product each month.  Every month when the boxes arrive they are barely in one piece and VERY mangled.  Last month one of the cases of water had to be repackaged before it arrived and it was a day late.          I suggest using a more sturdy box for shipping.          The water product is fine ... it's just the shipping packaging I have a problem with.
