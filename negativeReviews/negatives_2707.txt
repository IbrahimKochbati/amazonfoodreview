Purchased this in hopes of flavoring coffee without sweetening it.I didn't find the flavor to be all that amazing but it was ok.If you made coffee with it then asked me to guess the flavor I wouldnt be able to.Maybe because I know its supposed to be macadamia nut that Im looking for the flavor and can find it?In the end I am still trying to find  good macadamia nut flavor.
