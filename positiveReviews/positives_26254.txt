While I am really picky when it comes to foods and their quality (not easy for a German in Amerika!), I am really happy to have found this  and on amazon a while ago. Now THIS variety must be new, because we saw it in May for the first time in a local store (for 3.99 a pack, imagine!!!) and shortly after it also appeared available here.          It is mildly spicy, very well for european taste (we don't like things toooo hot!), and I love the little Tofu dices (they call it different). The cashews are few, and yes, they are soft, not crunshy. That comes from the simmering, I guess.          We eat a pack a person, actually, over Jasmin (or Basmati) rice or Naan, when we find it locally. (I wished I could make Naan myself).          A tip for variety: I am preparing different varieties of KOI for each person, and then the plates are exchanged to share. Usually it is just Hubby and me, so I make 2 different packs and we swap the plates after having eaten an half each.          We are living on one small income in a low income state, so we have to watch the money quite much. So I was enthused when I was able to stock up for half the price in June!!! Well, compared to local supermarket stores it was even better (   less!) than half, as amazon's prices were already lower.          I have stocked up really big, my pantry is now filled up with all KOI products for probably 2 or 3 years. Inflation, you can come now, we are ready! Ha!
