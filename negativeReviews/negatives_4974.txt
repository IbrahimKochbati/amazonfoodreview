This toy has a failing if you have a dog who's too clever for it's own good. The rope is a weak point. I understand the theory that the dog is supposed to use the rope to chuck the bottle around and have the food come out, but after a couple of days our collie picked the toy up, took it across to her bed, and started determinedly chewing through the rope.          The manufacturer recommends you put the plastic practice golf balls in the jug instead of the rope, and this worked for a while, but then our dog started chewing the purple ball off the end of the bottle, and when she'd got sufficiently through that, managed to crack the neck of the bottle itself.          We got her a replacement (as it took some weeks for her to crack the first bottle) and this time the rope lasted less than two days. So, it's back to the plastic golf balls, and hopefully it will take her some while to get to the stage of cracking the bottle again, but I suspect it's only a question of time.          The manufacturers, IMO, need to implement two improvements.          1) The rope needs to be impregnated with something which tastes unpleasant.          2) The spikes on the rubber ball need to be made longer and firmer to try to protect the neck of the bottle.          Those reservations aside, our dog loves the toy, but then she has a very high food drive, probably due to her months as a stray.
