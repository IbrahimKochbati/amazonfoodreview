My local store had the product lineon close out at 77 cents a can so I bought a dozen cans of different verities. Lobster soup was very fishy for starters and the Manhattan chowder was very watered down.  The New England chowder is somehow creamy and void of flavor.  The Clam corn chowder was not enjoyable.            I am real soup eater and take soup at least once a day and always when I dine out.  Long story short... This is the most tasteless soup and just not good.  I suggest you pass on this and I am sure Cambells will be a much better choice than these soups... Sorry, I had leave an unfavorable review bit this soup is just not worth eating and 77 cents a can I would never buy this again
