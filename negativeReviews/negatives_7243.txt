I'm used to cheap tea (by the way, cheap tea isn't low quality), but this one's awful. It tastes like very spicy water.. water with Tabasco added, essentially. Although I did steep the tea bag for about four minutes, there was no depth to the flavor. I finished the cup, but I certainly wouldn't buy it.
