It's distracting to drink something that smells like pipe tobacco, so I am not giving this product a high personal rating. Also, I like my fruit drinks more authentic, with fewer mystery ingredients and preservatives added. This product is so well preserved, they recommend keeping it in the refrigerator, not the freezer.
