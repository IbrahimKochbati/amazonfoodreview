I purchased these tonight, the package says best by (Dec 2009) approximately 3 months from now...these are horrible! The aroma is offensive and the taste is even more offensive. I didn't even finish one piece of the dried peaches. I have tasted other  ands that were better, I'm looking for those! Don't waste your money! Honest!
