I bought the Gallon Jug of this about 7 months ago it is great to have on hand. This has a very fresh tasting tomato flavor and re hydrates easily. I use it to make instant tomato soup, for sauces and in salsa as well as adding to soups, stews, and every where else that one might want some tomato  flavor.  Very easy to adjust texture  can be tomato paste or juice  and is fun to experiment with I even made little tomato balls as a kind of oddball appetizer and everyone who tried them was blown away. Very light weight dry does pack down a bit but has stayed dry in the jug with no problems. This is a  great staple for both daily use and food storage.  The tomato powder hasappeal for both  old fashioned homey nostalgia and a bit of Jetsons O wow!edge too.
