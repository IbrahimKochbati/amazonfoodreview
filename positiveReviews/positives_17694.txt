Since I suffer from GERD, or acid reflux (heartburn), I was immediately interested in this product.  It's a good idea, since I (like billions of other people around the planet) love a cup of coffee in the morning.  But coffee is a big no no for those with GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disorder).          I  ewed it up in my Chemex coffee maker (all glass, no plastic parts).  My first impression was that it is a dark roast, which I'm not particularly fond of.  (The company, according to its website, offers two styles of coffee.  The dark French roast was what was sent to me.  They also offer a 'nutcracker sweet' flavor).  Secondly, the grind is very fine, which releases more flavor, but takes longer to drain through my filter.          The taste (which is the important thing, right?) is strong and slightly bitter.  When I added sugar and creamer, the taste was tamed into something more than I'd like.  The flavor is unchanged from a regular coffee flavor, which is certainly a big plus.          I could tell right off that the coffee was less acid than traditional coffees.  And it certainly didn't set off my GERD (though mine usually comes later in the day).          One caution I'd issue though.  According to the pamphlet on GERD I just picked up from the doctor's office, one reason (the principal one?) that one should avoid coffee and certain sodas is the caffeine in coffee.  I assume that the coffee has all of the 'kick' that traditional coffee has.  So it seems that one drawback to coffee (acid) has been solved, but the other (caffeine) remains.  I'll finish off this small bag and see what I think.          All in all, I'd recommend this coffee to the lover of a strong dark French roast.  I think I'd prefer the Nutcracker Sweet variety, personally.  The coffee costs about the same as regular coffee, according to a quick price survey I ran on Amazon.
