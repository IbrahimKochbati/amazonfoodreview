Not Blenheims (the gold standard in apricots :) but I have had far worse than these. The fruits are pleasantly tart sweet and have good nutritional value (vitamin A) compared to canned peaches (which are still a favorite). One or two cans were delivered with a small dent but the apricots themselves are unblemished. I am sorry the other reviewer seems to have had such a bad experience but I can honestly say that mine were not salty. And the can indicates that no salt has been added. Perhaps it was the potassium in the skins but I think they help intensify the apricot flavors of the pear juice. In short, these are all "natural" i.e. no added sugar or corn syrup which is a plus for me. A good item to have on hand for quick healthy desserts either plain or with a sprinkling of granola and a scoop of a fav sorbet sherbet ice cream.
