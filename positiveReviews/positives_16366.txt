Molly and Cocoa, our cocker  iels, said to tell you that they love these greenies and can't think of anything they would rather munch on.  They have sizes just right for them, are easy to chew and easy to digest.  The fact that they come in "lite" is a bonus as it helps us keep their calorie content down in the winter when they don't get as much exercise.  I would highly recommend greenies for a great treat that helps clean dog's teeth and eliminate bad  eath.
