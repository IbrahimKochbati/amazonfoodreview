I use this as my "secret ingredient" for pasta salad which is always a hit! I also use it in chicken, tuna and egg salad and have used it in deviled eggs too. I started using it also via Costco and was very disappointed when they stopped carrying it. I put in a request for them to start carrying it again and we'll see what happens... I'm just very happy that I can still find it somewhere!
