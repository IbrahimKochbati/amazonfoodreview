I love calypso lemonades, especially the strawberry and ocean blue but I would have to be a fool to order them for 60+ dollars when I can buy the same 12 pack at the corner gas station for $20.  I went on line hoping to find a better price than the $1.69 I was paying.  This is not a good deal unless you are paying $5.12 a bottle
