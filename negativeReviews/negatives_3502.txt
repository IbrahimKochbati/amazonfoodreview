I've subscribed to receive Pamela's GF cookie mix and after the second delivery of OLD mixes I am returning to buying them in the store.  All of the last mixes during the last several months (6 bags per order x 2   12) have been OLD    not expired, but the chocolate is dried up, light  own and crumbles to a powder.  I discovered it's not possible to return a subscribe 'n save order (for some reason) so I have to throw out the chocolate chips and use Ghiradelli instead.  Whenever I have bought Pamela's from Whole Foods the chocolate in the mix has been dark  own, fresh and never has crumbled to powder.          AVOID subscribe and save on this item.  Buy them in a store.
