My wife is an accountant so we go through a lot of coffee. And she likes her coffee strong. Her favorite, and mine, are the "Colombian" roast coffees. Colombian coffee is not really the roast, its the source. Only coffee from Colombia can be called Colombian and for whatever reason, Colombian coffee from just about everyone is a medium dark body, hearty coffee. And that is pretty much exactly what this coffee tastes like, the store  and of Colombian coffee from Kroger or Pubix, which btw also tastes close to 8 O'Clock Colombian blend. If you prefer Colombian blends of coffee, at this point, since taste is not really an issue, price should be the only deciding factor. That is pretty much the deciding factor for us since all of these Colombian labeled coffees taste almost the same.
