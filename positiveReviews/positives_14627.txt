I have eaten sport beans a bunch of times while cycling and rock climbing. I like them because they are a tasty way to get some quick energy. I eat them in circumstances when I would drink gatorade. I don't see a meteoric rise in energy which is kind of sounds like but I think they do help me keep my electrolytes in balance when I'm outside working hard all day. I think they are yummy! The combination pack is the way to go, although fruitpunch and berry might be my favorite flavors, all 4 flavors are good.
