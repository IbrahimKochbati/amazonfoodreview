I have been buying these for quite some time now   they were recommended by our vet, and our dog simply loves them. They do a fine job of keeping her teeth clean, occupying her while we eat dinner, and best of all they don't seem to have any ill effects on her digestive tract (which is always a concern of mine with rawhide products). They seem well made and thoughtfully produced. My sole gripe is, as others have mentioned, the uniformity of their size. Our puppy is only 50lbs, but I've found myself having to order the XL size package to ensure the bulk of the package is reasonably sized chews. I originally ordered the normal size package, but the ratio of S:M:L chews was definitely skewed in favor of S:M. Even with the XL size package, where the ratio is skewed M:L, we still get a number of very small chews   chews so small our dog can swallow them nearly whole after just a few minutes of chewing. This creates a serious choking hazard, and I sometimes find myself just throwing these tiny ones away. Obviously the size issue hasn't stopped me from buying the product (I'm very happy with it), but to earn a 5 star review some better size control would be required.
