I have been using Madhava coconut sugar for 6 months now, and have used it extensively in nearly every application where cane sugar is normally used.  Previously, I have used succanat sugar, raw honey, and agave sugars as well as non sugar sweeteners such as xylitol and stevia.  Of all of the sugars, this compares most favorably to cane sugar in terms of taste and performance.  As a bonus, it has the most vitamins, minerals, and trace nutrients of any sugar available.          The texture is very dry and lighter coming out of the bag.  The smell and taste is similar to succanat  as is the performance.  It works very well in any coarser baked goods    muffins,  eads, some cookies, and even  ownies.  Like unprocessed cane sugars, it will color your baking  own and leave a bit of a gritty texture, so very fine baked goods will not work.  Also in baking, I sometimes add a tad more liquid to make up for the dryness.  For drinks, it dissolves a little slower than regular sugars.  Finally, it is definitely less sweet than cane sugar cup for cup.  To me, this is not a bad thing  I often reduce the sugar a bit in recipes anyway.          Of course, we all need to eat less sugar.  This is a GREAT option for those who want a lower glycemic, more nutritious sugar to use in foods they are going to eat anyway.  Amazon has the best price anywhere on this, and I will keep buying as long as it is available.
