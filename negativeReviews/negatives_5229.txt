This is the first Stevia I ever bought.  I liked it when I got it...until I tasted other  ands.  It's OKAY.  But I prefer the stuff in the packets (dry.)  I especially LOVE the crystals that are made out of a stevia cane sugar mix  and they're only 5 calories per packet and I only put one packet in my coffee....I guess I need to find that product and review it ha!          But this is definitely worth a try.  It's cheap and lasts a LONG time.  I think it tastes much better in tea, than coffee though.
