Oh my god these shells and white cheddar cheese are glorious. You really should buy CASES of these, they are so delicious. If you have a hearty appetite, this "family size" will serve one just fine. I can't get over how amazing it tastes. Not only that, but for this recipe the shells are perfect   they hold the flavor MAGNIFICENTLY! It only takes minutes to prepare. And be ready: you may begin shedding tears of joy once you place a spoonful in your mouth   it is THAT good. Plus it's organic if that's important to you.
