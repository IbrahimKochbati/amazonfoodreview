I wasn't totally sure what to expect when I received my coconut sugar.  What I did receive was two bags of sugar, one labeled "blonde".  Both sugars were caramel in color with the blonde being a little lighter.  The smell and taste was very similar to  own sugar, however the texture was dryer.  The granules were not a consistent size as with cane sugar.  No "coconut" taste whatsoever.          I wanted to bake with this sugar to see if it was interchangeable with cane sugar.  Coconut sugar is supposed to be less calories and have a lower glycemic level compared to cane sugar.  As I understand glycemic levels, the lower the level, the easier it is for your body to metabolize, thus not creating that "sugar crash".          To compare to cane sugar, I used a 1:1 ratio as suggested by the company.  I ate it raw on cinnamon toast (blonde), and made pancakes (blonde) and Toll House cookies with it (both blonde and regular).  For the most part I found it to be completely interchangeable with cane sugar in recipes.  I noticed that the granules left "freckles" of sugar and didn't completely blend in, however, texture and taste was very close to cane sugar.  If health reasons have you making the switch, this is a great option!
