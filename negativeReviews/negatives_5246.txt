This price is a little high.  You can generally buy it in a grocery store for around $1.25 a bottle.          For some reason the seller claims they don't like the flavor.  It tastes like ORange Hi C which I think is good.  Kind of like less sugary Kool Aid.  I love the taste.  Plus, there are 2.5 servings in  each bottle   so each bottle is 125 calories.          The product is good.  I think Revive flavor is the best.
