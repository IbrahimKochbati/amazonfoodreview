The Prepara Herb Savor Pod is advertised holding asparagus. That was why I purchased it, thinking it would be good for keeping asparagus fresh. In reality the pod will hold very few spears and they would need to be quite thin and short.  The ad is misleading. I'll keep it for storing herbs, but asparagus is out of the question.
