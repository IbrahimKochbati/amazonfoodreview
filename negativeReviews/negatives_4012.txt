I'll admit I'm a coffee snob. I drink only organic, and I grind my own beans w  a burr grinder.  I only bought this coffee ground because my husband isn't quite as picky as I am and doesn't want to be bothered grinding the beans every time he wants a cup (We drink a lot of coffee   going through about 2 lbs. a week).  I love my coffee REALLY strong, but there's a difference between rich, strong coffee and bitter coffee, and this coffee unfortunately falls into the latter category.  I took a chance w  this one, and although the first time I had it, it seemed "okay," the second time, it was just bitter and with a weird aftertaste.          I'm finding it more and more difficult to get a decent coffee at a decent price. Lately, every coffee I get is either stale tasting or bitter.  I would love to find a decent, whole bean organic coffee that is freshly roasted and that doesn't cost more than $10 a lb.  Any suggestions, anyone?
