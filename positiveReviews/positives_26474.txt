I ordered these by mistake actually: I thought I was ordering the rolled tubular chewies our labs are addicted to. But what a fortunate mistake it was  all three dogs love these "chips." Like potato chips for dogs. The labs take about five minutes each to devour one; the cocker a little longer. And if our big guy dawdles a bit, one of the girls (dedicated thieves both) are off with it the minute Gunner looks away.          I'll definitely be ordering more of these treats.          Tom Carter
