I laughed at Trudi's review because I too, have a jar designated for myself (and my spoon) and buy one for company as it invariably gets eaten.  Even my self proclaimed germs don't dissuade my niece and nephew from taking mine, if more isn't available.          This is delicious, I buy it every 2 3 weeks and is my reward for exercising etc, instead of gum or candy or cake or whatever people use to motivate themselves to get to the gym.          Spread on saltines, it's delicious, I like it with toast in the morning on oat  ead with my cappuccino.  I rarely eat it as a sandwich, although its been known to happen if I stumble across cherry 100% fruit jam in the store.          I'm a chocolate lover and I've traveled to many many chocolate producing countries just to try their delicacies, but here I'm with Trudi.  This is a wonderful snack just to keep in the cupboard for yourself, and your spoon.
