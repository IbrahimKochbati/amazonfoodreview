You have to get kitty used to them, as they are kinda rubbery, and smell funny. My cat took to the treats well, after a bit of coaxing; and sometimes if she doesn't eat them, I just pinch them in half, and she gobbles them up. My cat is equally fond of both flavors, salmon and chicken; If I don't store them away properly, the next morning I find the pouch torn and chewed up.          This is a great treat if you can't don't grow cat grass.
