I sometimes prefer not to have to grind the beans! This is a good price for Starbucks Sumatra coffee, and it tastes the same as the beans. It does not lose any of the flavor that it would from being ground. I did dock it one star because you have to order something else to get the super saver free shipping because of five measly cents!!
