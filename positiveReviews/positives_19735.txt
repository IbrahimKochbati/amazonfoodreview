This is a great product, and the mushroom one, the Seitan ones and the Soy ones do, as mentioned, have their individual flavors and textures.  Each is a great treat during a long day at the office when I want something healthy and reasonably low calorie (these come in at about 75 calories for an ounce.)  I've tried and enjoyed all varieties.  Highly recommended.
