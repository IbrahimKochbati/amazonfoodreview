This is a dog treat you can feel good about giving your animals. It has a nice shape...they come in two attached squares but you can  eak them apart for smaller treats.  They have an unoffensive smell..in fact they smell pretty good for doggie treats.  They are made of a good, healthy mix of ingredients: Lamb, barley, carrots, and molasses.  I have an older golden retriever and a smaller, younger terrier.  Little hyper terrier probably didn't even taste the goodness as he gobbled the treats down.  But my retriever smelled it and played with it a little while...once he started munching, it was gone pretty quickly!  Both dogs begged for more, but after a couple we put the bag up.  Hard as it was, these are meant to be a treat.
