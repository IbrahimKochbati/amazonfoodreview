This is pretty good.  It tastes good for microwave food, doesn't take that long to make (7 8 min prep time), and is fairly healthy!  Has American Heart Association approval.  It's difficult to find easy to make microwavable foods like this that don't have tons of salt, and this one's not too bad.          390 Calories     3g Total Fat (5% daily value)     1g Sat Fat (5% daily value)     0g Trans Fat          25mg Cholesterol (8% daily value)     400mg Sodium (17% daily value)     210mg Potassium (6% daily value)     78g Total Carb (26% daily value)     5g Dietary Fiber (20% daily value)     22g Sugar     12g Protein (21% daily value)          Vitamin A: 6%     Vitamein C: 2%     Calcium: 0%     Iron: 0%
