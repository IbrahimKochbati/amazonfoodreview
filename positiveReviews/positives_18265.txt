Simply put this is a great alternative to regular potato chips.  These chips are all natural; they have no preservatives or artificial flavors and colors. Each bag  ings about 19 chips and are 100 calories (30 calories from fat).  The chips crunchy and have a very light sweet potato taste.  They also have an airy feel to them   like rice cakes. I enjoyed them.  For those that are gluten intolerant, they are also gluten free.
