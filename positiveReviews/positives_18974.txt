I have used this now for 5 years with both of my dogs.  They check out fine every time they go to the vet.  Their coats are shiny and skin is clear.  Activity is fine and overall health is perfect.  I do add fresh carrots and apples each day.  They have bits and pieces while I eat my veggies.  So all I can say is my miniature schnauzers are if peak health and very active.  They like the food but also like the veggies I give them.
