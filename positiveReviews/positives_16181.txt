In September, I adopted 2 adult border terrier mixes from The Shelter Pet project and the oldest girl had a few " eath" issues.  Heard about Greenies and have not been disappointed.  The two of them love their treat before I go to work and it is comical to see them chew and chew and chew, since that is what removes the tartar. Amazon has much better pricing then the pet centers, so I love it.  Try them for your pet, they will love it.
