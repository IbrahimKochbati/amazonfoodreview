I have always wanted a natural delivery.  My friend who's had 2 other kids told me to take red raspberry tea leaf to strengthen our uterus, birth canal, etc... I started drinking this during my whole pregnancy. 1 tea bag during the first trimester and the 2nd trimester and on my third trimester, i put 2 bags, the last two weeks, i drink 2 bags every meal...          I only had to push for 1.5 hours. didn't feel pain during contraction until 10 CM. and no epidural
