Box arrived via Fed X in it's special insulated foam mini cooler with ice pack. All were ready to put in the freezer. This shipping by Amazon is incredible. Tip: save the mini cooler for trips to Safeway, Trader Joe's etc.          I've had Nan at a lot of restaurants, Indian, Pakastani, etc. There's no discern able difference in quality. And the convenience of being able to make it "on demand" at home is really nice.          Re: preparation. I entirely agree with the other reviewer who recommended pan frying. No need to preheat an oven to 400 and bake 5 to 10 minutes or so. And here's another Tip:  use a non stick pan, and you won't have to add olive oil. Just defrost first at room temp (only 30 minutes or less), then pan fry less than a minute each side and you're ready to eat. It's hotter than you'll get at any restaurant.          If you don't want to pan fry or waste a lot of energy preheating your oven to 400 then baking 10 minutes, here's another way my Mom discovered. Just pop the Naan right from the freezer into a high quality toaster (she has a DeLonghi). It's very quick, and tastes great. She says toasting  ings out the flavor of the garlic more.          Enjoy!
