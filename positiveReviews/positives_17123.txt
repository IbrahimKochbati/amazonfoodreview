I Love the Blue Sky Energy Drink, Wild Berry Flavor, but was used to drinking the 8 oz size that I would buy at the grocery store, so I was very surprised to receive a whopping 16 oz size via Amazon. Since I was used to drinking the 8 oz size with no problem, I gave it no thought to drink the 16 oz. BOY was that a mistake. Not only did it make me VERY nervous, but it was entirely too much 'energy' for my system at once. From then on I only drank half a can at a time and I was fine. They should put a warning on this stuff. DO NOT DRINK A WHOLE CAN.
