Although I'm a big fan of International Delight's flavorful creamers,I must admit that I was unhappy with the condition the package arrived in. I received the box with at least 3 of the singles containers spilled in the box. Needless to say, the creamer carton was damaged and soaked(damp upon receipt). I also noticed that when opening the creamers for use, each single serving had a large number of tiny solidified cream pieces, which made me wonder whether they were still fresh.. Since they're still drinkable, I would give this item a little below average score...
