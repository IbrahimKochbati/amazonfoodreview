I was under the impression when I bought this at our local pet supply store (based on salesperson's advice) that this bone, while edible, would take several days of working on to be consumed.  Great.  It's a little pricey, but I have a teething 5 month old puppy who has recently been spayed; she can't get her regular course of exercise so I bought this as a nice treat to help keep her occupied in her restless state.  I took it away from her (mad dog!) after 45 minutes.  Just one end was left.  I had bought her the largest "souper" size.  After reading the other reviews, I count myself lucky that she got that much time out of it.  Yes it's a "treat", but at $6, it's a treat I cannot afford to give her very often.  Health wise it's not a treat I could make a habit of feeding often; I feel I have to give my puppy less dinner tonight to make up for the large amount of calories she just wolfed down.  I hope that it doesn't make her sick as it did another reviewer's dog.  I could take her kong, put a spoonful of kibble in it,  eak up a slice of cheese and shove it in there, stick the whole thing in the microwave for a few seconds to get the cheese melty, let it cool down, and THAT will take her a good 15 minutes to manage to get out.  All for a LOT less money.  That said, I give it 0 stars for value, 5 for "my dog loved it".  It gets a 2 overall from me and I probably would not buy again, nor would I recommend to a friend.
