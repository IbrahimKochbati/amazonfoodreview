This is much better than man made syrups. It is sweeter and has a deeper flavor than the high fructose or corn syrup varieties. I was expecting it to be thick, not runny, but that is not a problem with me. A little of this can go a long way. I was also expecting 32oz to "look" a little bigger than this jug, but it is well worth it.
