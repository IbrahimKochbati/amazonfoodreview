I highly recommend Davidson's Tea.  This is my 4th purchase from this company, and they deliver an outstanding product every time.  I have a typical stressful position in a Fortune 500 company.  Since I have been drinking this, my overall stress level has reduced significantly.  It's not easy to succinctly describe.  But, this tea keeps away heartburn, and just enables one to feel a little more relaxed, especially when under stress.          I drink it hot and cool.  You can also steep this more than once.  The most I will do is three times.  This is really good tasting tea.  I can drink it w o sugar because it has a natural slight sweet and tartness to it.
