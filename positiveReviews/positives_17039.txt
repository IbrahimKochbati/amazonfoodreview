My 1 year old Boxer mix absolutely loves this toy ~ He was trying to play with it before I could even get it out of the packaging! It seems to be durable and is holding up well so far, my only concern is replacing the rope after my dog wears it out (he destroys rope toys in about 2 weeks usually). Other than that, I would recommend this to other dog owners whose dogs like to chew and play tug of war. Just make sure you don't mind little pieces of treats all over your floor   it's surprising how much treat actually dispenses, and my dog tends to overlook some of the dispensed treats when he is feeling playful. I wouldn't recommend this for small dogs, just because it is a good sized toy, but for medium to large dogs, this is great!
