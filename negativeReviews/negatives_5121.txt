This product probably works fine at larger levels but at the small the bottle neck is too narrow to allow anything but crumbs to come through. With this sized rope and the storage available in the bottle the product would work perfectly if it had a larger opening to allow dog to pull out treats. Sadly this is not the case.          I'm hesitant to purchase a larger one as I worry the bottle neck rope width issue will be just as present as it is in the small.
