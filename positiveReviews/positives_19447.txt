I received a sample of this through House Party and my husband absolutely loved it.  He has been looking for it ever since and they don't sell it local so I am thrilled to find it here on Amazon.  Not sure what the reviewer who commented on it being hot was talking about.  It has pepper but I wouldn't say it was over hot and since I have gastritis I am extremely sensitive to hot spices and this was just fine.  I'd recommend this product.
