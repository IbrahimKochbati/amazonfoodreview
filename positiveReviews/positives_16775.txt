I bought the "Light" Agave Nector which is a thinner consistency (and dissolves faster) than honey and is also sweeter than honey.  I use the Agave in hot tea with creamer and for me it's a better flavor than using honey.  However, for coffee I prefer the strong honey flavor against the acid though I do not mind the Agave sweetener in coffee occasionally  it's still better than the flavor of plain sugar!  In foods such as oatmeal I will continue to use the 'light' Agave nector as it does not take much to get the oatmeal sweeter (whereas it does take a fair amount of honey). Additionally, another reviewer mentioned the 'Amber' tasting good in oatmeal too. Although I have not tried Agave Nector in baked goods or desserts I'm sure it would perform well.          Unfortunately, I cannot compare prices  ands of Agave Nector as this is my first time purchasing Agave Nector but it seems comparable to the price of honey.  Agave is it's own flavor and I have enjoyed switching between honey and Agave for coffee and tea; it's nice to have variety for variety's sake and I can see why some would prefer to continue purchasing Agave Nector as it is such a healthy sweetener. Since it takes less Agave liquid to sweeten things it's a good buy since one would have to add more honey to get things sweet enough.          I gave Agave Nector a 5 because I can see the creative potential in baking.  Adding the nector to whipped topping and or adding to pancakes with fruit might be good    an application you could not have attempted with honey alone!
