safe and tasty treat.i would assume these are like puffed cheetos for dogs. popeye loves them and i get a kick out of hearing him actually crunch and chew instead of woofing down his treats whole and risk getting choked...plus i think these melt in his mouth if the peices are too small for him to crunch.
