I ordered this coffee looking for something flavored and seasonal, I had no idea what vanilla nut pumpkin pie would be like together but it is very good. The coffee is good on its own and decent with creamer, I drink my coffee black usually so when I do use creamer it is flavored and in non flavored coffee. I enjoy the taste of this coffee straight and will be reordering with this company as this is my 2nd flavor from them and both have been great.
