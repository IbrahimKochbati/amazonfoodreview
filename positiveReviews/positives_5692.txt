Yeah these are very tastely and healthy, but the price here is ridculously high at $18.  Not sure I understand why since Amazon is just referring you to 180snacks.com, where you can't find the Almond Pops, but you can buy them!  So, if you search Almond Pops with Blueberries at Google it will take you to the 180 site and you can add them to your cart!  I e mailed them and they said their site is under contruction.  I'm about to try and order from them directly.  Hope it works out since it's hard to find tasty and healthy snacks.
