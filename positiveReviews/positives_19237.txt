I have 3 dogs and even though one was not interested the other 2 were. They had fun trying to figure out how to get the treats even to trying to get me to get it for them (ha!). However, once it was figured out, they had fun eating the treats. I will warn multi dog houses. You might try this on a individual basis. 2 of my dogs who normally don't fight over food at all got a bit possessive of the toy. Also, do not leave unattended so it doesn't get chewed up. Otherwise, I say go for it. It is a good thinking dog toy.
