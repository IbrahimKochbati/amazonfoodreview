I have been using canidae for 5 years now along with nuvet vitamins  and it has been a wonderful product. After the ingredients change I have not noticed any sort of change in my siberian huskies what so ever. They still have high energy, very lush coats,white teeth and great done density. I am very happy with this product i have had no problems!
