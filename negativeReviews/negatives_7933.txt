I first ordered the Chipotle flavor.  I didn't enjoy the flavor very much, but the texture was crispy and the amount of flavor was perfect.  There was plenty of flavor there but it wasn't overwhelming like some  ands are.  It was because of this that I decided to give Blair's a second chance.  I ordered the Habanero flavor next.  I was extremely disappointed.  Gone was the perfect amount of flavoring the chipotle chips had.  Instead the chips had so much seasoning it was darn near falling off the chips.  I've had a few  ands of habanero before, but this one tasted nothing like any of them.  It has almost a sweet flavor to it.  I personally didn't care for it at all.  On top of it all, the chips aren't even very hot.  I was very disappointed in how hot both chips were considering the  and is called Death Rain.  If you can find them, try Poore Brothers Habanero chips.  THOSE are some hot chips, with a fantastic flavor.
