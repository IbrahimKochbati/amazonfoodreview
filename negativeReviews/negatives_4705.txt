Hello!  We are Marissa and Lilith.  Mojosmom is our human.  She said we could write this review because we ate this and she didn't.  We like it!  We especially like the Chinese Chicken (mom said the package actually calls it "Sesame Chicken", but we can't read, so it doesn't matter).  The Pot Pie entr&eacute;e had an awful lot of  oth and not a lot of meat.  But we licked the bowl clean anyway.  Mom says she likes this because it doesn't have a strong, icky smell like some canned cat food.  But she says that it would take a lot of these cans to feed it to us all the time (1 2 cans per 2.5 lbs of our weight   she said something about how Lilith could stand to lose a a pound or two or three), so we'll just get a couple of cans along with our dry food.  Maybe if we ignore the dry food she'll get the message, but she can be pretty stubborn!
