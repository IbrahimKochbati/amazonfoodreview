I have no idea what is in these but my wire hair terrier goes wild when the box comes out.  My daughter started me on these and he just loves them.  Had to get the small chew so he does not get fat on them as they are loaded with calories.  Checked with my vet and they had no problem with them, use for own dogs.  Only problem is once you start your dog on these it will be a continuous treat and even from Amazon these are not cheap.  As quickly as they are devoured the per minute price is astronomical.  But it is hard to deprive a dog you love of such a tasty treat!
