I have only praise for this product.  I give it 4 stars and not 5 for it does not come with a bag.  It is called SHAKE N BAKE but there is no bag to shake it in!  Other than that this product is great.  It is so easy to use.  I used 4 nice thick boneless pork chops and after shaking the coating fully covered all four.  It only needs to bake for 15 minutes and the meat does not need to be turned over at all during the cooking.  I found the coating to be delicious.  It had a light seasoned taste that was very tasty without overpowering the taste of the pork.  The coating mix also kept the pork inside tender and moist without getting too crispy on the outside.  Just crispy enough.  It certainly added just the right flavor to the light taste of the pork.  I added baked potato, peas and a salad and had a very tasty meal.          I hadn't used SHAKE N BAKE since I was a kid and then tended to use the chicken more.  I will definitely use this product on a regular basis now as well as give the chicken a go again.  Highly recommended.  Very easy and quick to use providing a delicious way to cook your pork.
