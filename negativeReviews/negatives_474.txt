you won't BELIEVE how many ways this product has saved my life!  I only gave it one star because i'm so dehydrated from drinking regular water all week because i ran out of money before my penta ran out.  when i can afford another shipment, i'll jack it back up to 5 STARS!     seriously, folks   SOME waters just run through your system and you pee them all out right away.  not PENTA! it sticks to your ribs like oatmeal, restoring your body's natural tendencies to develop sympathetic electrolytic rehydration.  but it won't weigh you down!     other things i have noticed about this product:          I accidentally dropped my cell phone into a glass of it, and when i pulled it out, it had better reception!     I was going to discipline my kids after they tried to clean my computer with it, until i discovered that it IMPROVED its functionality!     I threw some jumping beans into the bottle, and the next day i had a pair of baby pogo sticks growing in my refrigerator!          hey, if you fill up your solar shower with this stuff, you won't even need soap.  it comes at a price, but it's so super!          If you are tired with the uninvigorating, boring old swill other people call "water", or are lethargic from all that unenhanced blah that's so bad they can't attach a higher market value to, and you're so over the cheap, readily available and monitored CRAP your McBurbia proffers, then look no further.
