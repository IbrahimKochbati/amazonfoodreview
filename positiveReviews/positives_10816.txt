These are really good treats for dogs.  I have a French Bulldog who will gnaw and crumble up these treats, gobble it down, and beg for more.  They are organic and an interesting thing about my sickly little pooch is she can't eat any organic foods because it gives her diarrhea.  She only gets half of one of the these treats but one day I gave her two and she got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom but it wasn't runny.  That didn't happen when I only gave her half a treat.  Now I know what to give her if she is constipated.
