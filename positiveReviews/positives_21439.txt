The 2 pound plastic bag came inside a US postal bag that was secured with an extra length of fiberglass reinforced tape strip over the sealing flap. Very considerate packaging for mailing.          I would have given 5 stars if the plastic bag from the manufacturer was more heavy duty. When trying to open the resealable package by the strips above the seal, the plastic strips tore off. When opening the bag, pull the formed seals open by grasping below the strip where the seeds are held. Then the bag might open without tearing off tabs. That's how I open the bag now that the upper flaps are gone.          I poured half the bag into an empty Swanson 1 lb bag from a previous order that is heavier packaging.          The seeds themselves are large and have a very good taste.
