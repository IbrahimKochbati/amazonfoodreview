I've only taken this product once as I recieved it two days ago. I must say that while I wasn't able to achieve lucidity just yet (I've only achieved this once and it was without the extract, several months ago  One of the reasons I was looking into this herb) my dream recall was much better. The dream was certainly more vivid, and I can see that with more practice this (Although admittedly vile tasting and smelling) herb extract will be a valuable tool for me. Thanks
