I tried one 8.3 oz of Switch in Kiwi Berry flavor. The can is very small, about the size of a Red Bull. The drink is said to be 100% juice carbonated, with no sugar added, no preservatives, no corn syrup, no artificial colors and gluten free.          Each can has 135 calories, 15mg of sodium, 34g of carbs and 33g of sugar. On Amazon, the price comes out to about $1 per can.          I like the fact that Switch is all natural, but the sugar content is still quite high (I believe a 12oz can of coke has 40g of sugar). Calories are not to be ignored either. The taste was OK, but not fantastic by any means   very sugary, not enough carbonation. In fact, the Kiwi Berry flavor did remind me of Red Bull as well, which I do not particularly enjoy. I think I'll stick to unsweetened iced tea...
