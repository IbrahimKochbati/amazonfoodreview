Had to get a tea ball for the loose tea.  This is for a true tea afficianado who can appreciate the art of making tea.  Clearly, this tea being organic, the tin being so decorative, and the purchase putatively benefiting a specific tea growing region allows certain tea afficianados to have a mental appreciation for the background of the tea while drinking it.     I drink Earl Grey as a pick me up in the afternoon.  This one is comparable in taste to other Earl Greys on the market.
