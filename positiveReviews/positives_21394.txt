At first sniff the two girls turned up their noses at the new snack. To be fair, this happens with the introduction of most new snacks to this fussy and suspicious pair. By the third and fourth and subsequent offerings, the hesitation stopped. Though the girls genuinely like these treats now, there isn't the mad excitedness for them like they show for some others or for french fries.          I like that the first ingredient of these snacks is  "real"beef ( not the undesirable artificial beef),and they are made with natural ingredients. The treats are small and chewy and are good for training, rewarding, and  ibing. For most dogs the consistency is probably perfect, just enough chew to add interest. For Piper, our shih tzu with a few missing teeth, I  eak the treats in half so as not to tax the teeth she has left.          Science Diet backs these treats with a 100% satisfaction guarantee.
