My nine year old Dingo used to get smelly after a month on IAMS.  It's been three months since his last bath (I just  ush him) and no smell with Canidae!  My 6mo old Chihuahua was on IAMS for puppies but kept sneeking the Canidae from my Dingo.  So now he eats it too.  They scaf it down like crazy.  Buzz the Dingo's weight has improved without starving him.  This is the best dog food.  The price is good here although I buy it at the pet store.
