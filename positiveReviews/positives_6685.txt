O.k., so it's not officially kosher  but this is how you make gelatin without cow's hooves, for those of you who get grossed out by Jell O if you think about it too much.          Now foods is a company that sells gluten free stuff, and this is no exception:  if you have celiac this won't make you sick.          Even better, this is powdered agar agar, not flaked agar agar.  That means this will last for months, if not years  although it's also easy to use too much. 1 tablespoon of the flakes   1 2 tsp of the powder.  The ratio most cooks call for is 1 cup liquid to 1 teaspoon flaked agar agar, which means 1 4 tsp of this powder to 1 cup liquid, with more added for more acidic things like orange juice.          However, agar agar doesn't gel as well as Jell o, so don't expect to get the same results that you would for Jell o  for that, you need Jell o or kosher gelatin.  (You can add more agar agar to add firmness; but then it starts to taste like what it is:  seaweed.)
