I may have an addiction to sour skittles. This pack of 24 would have only lasted me a week and a half if it wasn't for a sudden bet with a friend. The bags weren't defective, the skittles were indeed sour, and I found that some skittles' coating was melted. But that's more likely due to the climate here.          Overall, there's nothing like sour skittles, and I only wish these were in stores still.
