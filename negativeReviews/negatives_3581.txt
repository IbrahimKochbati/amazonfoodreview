I will never use 1800flowers again.  After paying roughly $450 for 3 arrangements for my grandmothers funeral, I felt the arrangements were poor in design with poor flower quality.  The company can blame this on the florist but I believe it shows the relationship that 1800flowers has with its florists and it's not a good one.  The card was hand printed with very poor handwriting, most of what I wanted on the card wasn't easily read and that was true for all three arrangements.  Nothing about the arrangements would even tell me which florist was responsible for fulfilling the order.  Another testament to a bad relationship with its florists.  Never again will I ever use or recommend 1800flowers.  No family member of mine, no friend I can convince, will ever use them again.
