Holy cow it didn't read the size when I ordered this. This is like having a liqueur cabinet in your coffee bar. So far we have tried and used up the hazelnut and vanilla we just started on the caramel and its ok but I think I will move on to chocolate. Great buy if you drink coffee everyday like we do and don't want to add the extra cals to your morning ritual.
