I heard about this product from Hungry Girl.  It is great to use as a lower calorie substitute for regular peanut butter in recipes.  I love to use it when I make a chocolate peanut butter milkshake using frozen yogurt, fat free chocolate syrup and some of this powdered PB...my oh my...it is delicious!  The product is 75% less fat and calories.  To be able to still have a taste of PB with so many fewer calories and a great taste...its awesome!  I can't wait to try this is other recipes!!
