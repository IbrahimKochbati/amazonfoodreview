My Tibetin Terrior is 3 years old and has been on Wellness food since birth.  I just recently found Newman's Own Organics.     The price was a bit cheaper, plus free shipping to my home!  AWESOME!  When I started to gradually change foods.  My LIVI,     would eat only the Newmans' and leave the Wellness to later when she was really hungry.  So Funny!  She is the "queen" and she knows it!!
