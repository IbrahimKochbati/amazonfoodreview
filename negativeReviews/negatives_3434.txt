This product that comes in the Amazon packaging is defective. It appears in an attempt to save cost, too little foil material is used to seal the top of the K cup.  As a result, when the K cup is punctured by the Keurig coffee maker, the foil lid separates from the side of the k cup, resulting in an explosion of coffee grounds in the coffee maker.  Only 1 of 3 k cups did not do this.  It is specifically this  and packaging, since I was making other varieties of k cup coffee in the same coffee maker in the same time and none of those  oke the seal and left grounds all in the coffee maker.     Looking at the seal on this product, compared to other K cups varieties, this seal is MUCH tighter, and since there is a larger amount of coffee grounds in this k cup, there's a lot more to make a mess!     Loved the taste of the coffee, but can't waste so much time cleaning up the coffee pot!  Don't buy in the Amazon hassle free packaging, you'll be sorry!
