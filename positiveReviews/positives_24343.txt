I am the C.E.O. and Co Founder of Sprout Foods, Inc. and Pickled Pantry is illegally selling our products online. They are also price gouging you at $3 per pouch. Our products are sold in the marketplace anywhere from $0.99 to $1.39 depending on the retailer. Please do not waste your money buying from Pickled Pantry. I am working to have them removed from Amazon.
