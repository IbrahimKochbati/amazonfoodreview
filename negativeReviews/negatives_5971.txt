I totally agree with the reviewer who said this mayo is wayyy to hot!! I bought this mayo for my boyfriend who loves pepper with his sandwiches. I was alittle skeptical because I like pepper but not alot. So I reluctantly bought this because I really like the regular olive oil mayo.     I was the first one to try this mayo. I had made me a club sandwich with turkey, turkey bacon, avocado, tomatoes, green leaf lettuce and then this mayo... The only thing I tasted was this mayo!!! It overpowered the whole sandwich. I didnt even use that much either... I was starving so I choked down this sandwich. Then I sat and drank, drank, drank some more just to get the pepper out of my mouth!! This was horrible...     Then I gave some to my boyfriend to try and he spit it out!! He was like man what are you trying to do, poison me with pepper! I told him that is the mayo you had me buy with the cracked pepper in it. He said throw that jar away and get the regular olive oil mayo. This stuff is nasty!!     I understand that everyone has their own opinion of food but this is really hot and overpowering with pepper. Like one reviewer said that it has cracked pepper in it so why would you buy it if you dont like pepper. I like pepper and my boyfriend loves pepper but this went in the trash!
