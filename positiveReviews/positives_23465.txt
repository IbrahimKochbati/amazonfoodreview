I have a cat that's 18 and has kidney problems, and one that's only 5. Was giving the older cat special cat food from the vet, and someother kind for the younger one. My older cat didn't like the special can food and was losing weight. Vet told me that I could feed both of my cats Friskies Senior. The both love the Friskies Senior Turkey & Giblets. And the older cat has gained weight.
