I am trying to feed our two new (to us)kitties healthy cat foods and have tried a few varieties.  The cats prefer Before Grain and Wellness.  They wouldn't touch Spot's Stew.  One cat prefers fishy foods and the other fowl.  We have tried the turkey and Beef (I ordered Bison, but upon looking at the ingredients listed at [...] they listed only beef and my cans arrived labeled BEEF).     I think they liked the Beef a little better.  I admit, it smells better than most cat foods.  They prefer it at room temp.     The reason I listed the lack of fiber is that one of the cats has taken to ripping up the carpet with his teeth!  I have read that it may be an indication that he needs more fiber. (The cats were declawed by their previous owners  not us.)     Both cats were a little over weight when we adopted them.  One seems a bit slimmer now, the other, I'm not sure.     I do recommend the foods.  Even with the seemingly high cost, this is MUCH cheaper per ounce than the Whiskaa pouches we used to buy for our late kitty and has no by products.
