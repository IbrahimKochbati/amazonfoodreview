I'm one of those fussy dog owners that read labels and annoy others and so I really like the ingredients in this and think this would be a 5 star product for a lot of owners. My dogs certainly liked the flavor, but they aren't a fussy crew    still, I feel good about this biscuits. The reason I'm holding back a star is because two out of three of my dogs    my greyhound and my sheltie    are seniors and this is a harder treat than is really comfortable for them and the treats are hard to  eak into pieces. (Soaking in water for a couple minutes seems to help.) Some dogs genetically have really made tartar prone teeth and that's these two and there have been extractions over the years. My dachshund also has to work to crunch through it due to the size    remember, couldn't  eak it    and the hardness, but she managed.          If you have a medium and up dog with good teeth, them this is quite highly recommended. If you're constantly looking for a softer treat, they're less ideal and might at least need a little soak.
