Why should humans get all the good stuff? I love the simple, organic ingredients in these treats. Newman's Own is a wonderful  and in that regard, so it's nice to see that they've moved into pet foods as well.          Because of the hardness of the treats, I'd say that they're best suited to bigger dogs. I'm a little nervous to offer them to small dogs or older dogs with more fragile teeth and jaws... they have no "give" at all and don't  eak apart easily (which is why they need to be scored in half). But they do seem to go over well, and it's nice to be able to feel good about what you feed your dogs.
