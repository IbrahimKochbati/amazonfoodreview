The product DESCRIPTION is what everyone needs to be sure to go by when ordering. My order came in, as described, with  dark, white, milk, hazelnut and peanut butter truffles. Although, I would have loved either product to have shown up on my doorstep for the price! Also  My shipping box was damaged but well packed but with no ice pack. They sent it to South Texas it's always warm here! When the box was opened, I found the truffles' box itself was damaged. This is a really sturdy box. Made out of bookbinding or some other hard, thick card material. The shipping company must have really been slamming it around. Well, it is Christmastime.....
