First, I readily admit this is a pricey tea, but honestly, I've come across the same quality tea in teashops that is much more expensive, and they're not organic or fair trade products.          This Earl Grey blend is smooth and delicious! I didn't use as much as the instructions said because it was too strong bitter for my taste buds. Using half of what they said produced a lighter, smoother tea. One note: Upon first sniff of the tea leaves, the citrus note is STRONG, but it's more balanced in the flavor of the tea.          The packaging is nice and keeps the tea fresh.          The size of the tea leaves is adequate. I don't end up with a lot of "tea dust" at the bottom of my cup. This "tea dust" does increase as you use the tea and get farther down in the tin (I assume this is because the smaller pieces naturally tend to settle toward the bottom of the packaging in shipment).          Overall, a nice blend! I recommend adding a little dried lavendar blossoms to create a wonderful Lavender Earl Grey.
