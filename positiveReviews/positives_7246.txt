I have two cats, one who eats wet food as a last resort (mostly she licks up the gravy), and one who has food allergies (grains) and is incredibly picky (won't eat any grain free cat treats i've found so far  greenies, the tasty junk food ones, wellness cat jerky bits, shaved salmon, etc   doesn't like catnip, and turns his nose up at anything that costs less than $1.29 a can it seems, to include spots stew; authority; organix; most flavors of avo derm, holistic select, and innova; max cat; and natural choice).          she still licks up the gravy, and eats about half her bowl. He eats his portion and finishes hers, with no vomiting or retching (so nice!). He also wakes me up in the morning if it's  eakfast time and i haven't gotten the memo yet, and looks at me like i just kicked his grandma cat when i've run out.          this has quite a bit of juice in it, which is good since most cats don't drink enough water anyway.          as for me, i love this food b c it doesn't smell to high heaven, and i haven't died from litterbox duty as of yet. ;) (get it? duty  dooty? hehe)
