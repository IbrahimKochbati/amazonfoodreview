I am into maple syrup.  I can tell the difference in different grades of syrup.  I love the sweet taste of this syrup.  Some syrups are very thin like water.  This is not, it has a nice consistency to it, but not thick.  I put syrup on everything.  I add syrup to my oatmeal, my tea, my homemade salad dressings.  I use this instead of sugar.  I would recommend this to anyone the flavor is great.  Don't hesitate to buy it.
