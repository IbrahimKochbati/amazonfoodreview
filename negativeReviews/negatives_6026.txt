I've eaten a few of these, and while they tasted interesting at first, I can't bite into one now without gagging.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I was looking for some high protein snacks so I picked these up.  A vegetarian friend of mine tried one and instantly hated them, calling the taste "disgusting" and the texture "too much like meat."  The taste is not something that grows on you and I can not recommend these to anyone, especially at this price.
