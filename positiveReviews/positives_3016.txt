These chocolates are a welcome find.  They taste the same as regular chocolate but they don't spike my blood sugar.  I treat myself to a couple at a time when I have a sweet tooth.  It's great to be able to satisfy my craving without the extra sugar.  And fortunately the Maltitol doesn't seem to bother my digestive system.          They're a little pricey but I found a great bulk deal at another online source.
