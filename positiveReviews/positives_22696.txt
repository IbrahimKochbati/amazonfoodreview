This makes Carnival Theater style popcorn and the taste and smell makes you feel you are at the Movies. I too like it because it is easy to use. All the Ingredients are there in a small package...popcorn, salt, butter, oil. I use it with a Popcorn Machine that my daughter got for Christmas. She can easily make great popcorn for her friends, parties,etc without having to measure the amount of oil,salt,popcorn. If you own a Popcorn Maker I would strongly suggest this product. No need of having to find the right popcorn oil, popcorn butter or popcorn salt because it is mixed together in the package along with the popcorn. Amazon sells this cheap as well. Only $0.71 for each package.
