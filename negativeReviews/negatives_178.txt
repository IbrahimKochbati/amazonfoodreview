Besides that mentioned in the title, the only other remarks I have about it is the price is hard to beat, the taste is akin to a Flintstone strawberry vitamin (for those of you that have tasted them), and taste lasts for not very long.  I'd say, on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 lasting an extraordinary amount of time this would be a 3.  Also, the taste really diminishes to a subdued sweet after a very short amount of time.
