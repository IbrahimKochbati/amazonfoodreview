Not sure if I'm supposed to write this but the first shipment I received was all expired.  Customer service was happy to send me a new shipment with no problems.  So make sure you check the expiration date when you get it.          Secondly, I love the fact that Back to Nature has made the attempt of an all natural pasta.  I've been looking for something to replace Hamburger Helpers since their ingredients are less favorable.  Unfortunately, the overall taste and texture of this product is not good.  It has a "tang" as an aftertaste and the texture is always bumpy and not creamy.  My kids who are 4 and 2 will not eat this.  And they are not picky eaters.  Sadly, I have 10 boxes left.  I will just use the pasta and throw out the sauce package.          I suggest you find this at the store and try it first before you buy the case.
