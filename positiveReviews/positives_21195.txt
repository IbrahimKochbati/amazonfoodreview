When Milkman stopped making full fat milk, myself and my husband were quite sad.  In fact we held onto the final packet for his recent trip to the Grand Canyon  it needed an epic place to be finished.  This is almost the same, not quite, but delicious in its own way.  It is even a little richer than Milkman was.  Am so happy to have a wonderful milky drink for backpacking.  It's a tad spendy, and you can cut it with fat free milk to save money.  But backpacking, you don't mind as much about cost, since your perspective on life changes to what matters, such as delicious creamy decadent milk! This milk fits the bill!
