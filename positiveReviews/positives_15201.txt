My son is a little foodie and at 10 months has REFUSED to eat anything other then home made food. Lately I had started to become overwhelemed because I was coolong 3 different meals and I was worried that I wasn't making my son balanced meals. Insert Happybaby Super Salmon. Oh my god, he LOVES it! He eats the entire package. Some reviewers complained about the smell and yeah it smells kind of gross but it is FISH and fish isnt known for having the best odor. I would definetly recommend.
