I have 2 large dogs, one of which is rather picky with treats.  They eat these up.  I like the fact they are organic and healthier than rangular dog treats you get at the grocery store, which you have no idea what some of the ingredients are in a lot of those.  These treats aren't very good smelling or nice to look at, dry  own squares, but I'm not the one eating them. I would definitely choose these over other crap that is on the shelves.
