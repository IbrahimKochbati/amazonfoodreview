I love full bodied, dark roast coffee, but many of the typical low acid and decaf coffees have a bland, chemical taste to them.  Not the Puroast.  While it doesn't have all the complexities of my favorite beans, it has a full taste with a bit of the tartness I associate with dark roast and none of the chemical taste of other low acid coffees. If you enjoy coffee but have difficulty with the acid, then you may enjoy the Puroast.
