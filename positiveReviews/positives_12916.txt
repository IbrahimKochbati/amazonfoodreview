I seldom drink carbonated beverages, but tried the Kiwi Berry since it sounded interesting and had no added sweeteners or preservatives.          I was sure surprised by the very light carbonation, which I enjoyed, plus the taste was really, really good.  It is not too sweet and has a very nice, fruity taste.  I more or less expected something along the lines of a flavored  Pepsi or a Coke.          I think the size of the can is just right for me.  I would not want something larger.  I believe it has a few more calories than a Coke, but the flavor is very refreshing and if I had my choice, I would drink the Switch drinks especially the Kiwi Berry.
