These taste good and are edible but I am only giving 1 star to let people know that this product tastes like Pistachios to me, not almonds. I don't know why. If I wanted Pistachios I would've bought them. I had a craving for almonds and these just don't do the trick. They also contain a weird ingredient; CORN MALODEXTRIN. WHY?! They are ALMONDS! All you need is almonds and salt, maybe oil! So much for being "All natural".
