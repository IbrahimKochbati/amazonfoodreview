Inexpensive little mat. But it's so small and doesn't help when my cat kicks litter out of anywhere other than right in front of the box. And like others have written its got little spokes poking out so my cat didn't even like to step on it so it made even more of a mess. It needed to be cleaned daily and it was just overall more hassle than the small price tag.
