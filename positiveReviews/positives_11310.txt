While I enjoy coffee, I do not roast or even grind my own beans. Until recently, I didn't even make coffee; I just went to a local coffeehouse or Starbucks and bought what sounded good. Having decided that I would rather make coffee at home if I could find a decent approximation of the flavors I enjoyed while out and about, I started with lighter roasts. Needless to say, I was finding myself teribly disappointed by the weak results. I wanted coffee that tastes like COFFEE.          When I decided to go for stronger flavors, I eventually settled on this one as my favorite. A dark roast, Black Silk has a strong flavor that goes great with milk and or creamer. It does a good job of  inging the coffee flavor front and center in a pleasing way. It isn't easily pushed aside by other flavors and works well whether I feel like a more "straight" coffee, or something with all sorts of other elements. It isn't bitter or flat, and the aroma is heady and inviting as it  ews.          For a while there, I wasn't sure that anything I made at home could be both cost effective AND as tasty as what the local barista could prepare for me. I am pleased to say that this is, and I find I have no interest in buying hot coffee as much when I have Black Silk on hand. It's just great coffee at a great price that I can make at home in a matter of minutes.
