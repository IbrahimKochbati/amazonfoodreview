I had this chai tea at a local restaurant and loved it.  After searching all over for it I finally found it here at Amazon and was quite pleased. Though I think it is a little expensive, I haven't found any quite as rich and satisfying.  One caution is that it's fairly sweet and higher in calories and saturated fat than I wish it was, but the taste makes up for it.
