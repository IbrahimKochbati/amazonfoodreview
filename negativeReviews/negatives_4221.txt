Like the other reviewers, I too have had bad luck with this  and of potting soil.  I had purchased several bags and repotted a lot of my house plants with it, and all those that I did started having gnat problems within a week.  Its been very frustrating, they get everywhere but seem to leave my plants that I didn't repot with this particular potting soil alone.
