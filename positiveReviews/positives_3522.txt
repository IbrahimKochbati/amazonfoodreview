On an untypically cool August evening we decided to try Melitta Riviera Sunset Decaf. I heaped in too much coffee and what we got was a bitter, overly heavy cup . I know others like their coffee to curl their hair with strong taste. We like it strong but not THAT  much. On our next try we used less coffee and enjoyed a delightful semi sweet cup of decaf. It was pleasing. Those who love strong, robust, full bodied taste ought to definitely buy Melitta  and coffees.
