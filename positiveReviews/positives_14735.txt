Delicious.  I had to tell you.  This is my first time I've taken time to review a product     and I felt like I HAD to, after such a bad review.  ALL of the Blue Sky Free products are     very tasty (as far as diet drinks go).  I drank diet drinks for years and gave them up     when I found out how toxic the artificial sweeteners were.          I kept wondering why someone didn't come out with a diet soda made with Stevia (since     it's totally natural and healthy).  Finally, a few makers did.  I've tried several and     Blue Sky Free tastes the best to me.          It is expensive and hardly ever goes on sale  but when it does, I grab all I can!
