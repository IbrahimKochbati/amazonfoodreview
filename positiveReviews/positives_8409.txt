I love buying these and drinking them after my workout.  You lose not just fluids but minerals vitamins and this helps replenish you.  Water is good too for you too but I just love these post workout.  They are also good for anytime when you could use a sweet but natural drink (like you don't want milk or soda or water but want something tasty and refreshing).
