this is unlike any other hot sauce out there. All hot sauce seems to taste the same, or rather not taste like anything at all, they are just trying to be as physically hot as possible. Not the Gringo Bandito hot sauce, it has a taste kinda like a cross of a hot sauce and enchilada mole sauce. great on just about anything. maybe not ice cream but you may have a flavor of ice cream that needs improving. I got 2 big bottles and am sure I will be ordering more soon.
