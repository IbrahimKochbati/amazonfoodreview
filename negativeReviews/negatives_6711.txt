My son, who is in the first grade, is having a block party at school. We were asked to buy "Giant" Pixy Stix as prizes for the game his class is sponsoring. We were quite pleased with these initially, until we saw what the other children  ought.  "Giant Pixy Stix" same  and, same label, same name, TWICE THE SIZE. These weigh 15 grams (1 2 an ounce) and are about 12 inches long. In comparison, the other, larger stix, were 30 grams (an ounce) and 24 inches long. Seems like they should have a different name. The only thing GIANT about these, was the disappointment on my son's face :(
