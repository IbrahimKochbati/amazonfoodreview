I have been using this product as a salad dressing for almost 20 years and, believe me, when I say that it is, without a doubt, tangy and absolutely delicious.  It also gives a wonderful taste to meat when used as a basting sauce when grilling or  oiling.  Give it a try, I'm certain that you'll really like it.
