I am only 12 weeks pregnant and had the worst case of heartburn indigestion. I was sick dawn till dusk. My mom found this tea and the first day I drank 3 cups and it eased my symptoms a bit, but continued using it. Day 2...No heartburn indigestion at all! I am on day 4 and still going strong and feeling better than ever! Thank God for moms and this tea!
