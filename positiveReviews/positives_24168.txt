If you've never had corn nuts the best way I can describe them is by stating that they are hard, crunchy, salty and definetly require that you eat them with a beverage. The best snack I can compare it to are the crunchy japanase peas but more dense and with a corn taste ;)          However, if this your first experience with corn nuts, I recommend the Rach flavor or original unless your into spicy. They aren't super spicy but they are tangy. I love to eat them with lime and additional chile sauce (like tapatio).
