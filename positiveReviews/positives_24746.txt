A year ago I found out I had Pneumonia, I panicked because I have never been that sick before in my life. I was given antibiotics to cure it. Well a week and a half after taking and finishing the antibiotics, my symptoms returned. I realized there would be no need to go back to the doctors because they obviously can't do anything for me. Because I am in to herbs anyways,  I decided take Beta Glucan capsules. It was working but not fast enough for me. So I decided to drink this Herbal detox tea along with the herbal capsules. It got rid of my symptoms in two day. I completed the whole box of teas and bottle of herbs capsules. I did not have anymore problems or pneumonia after that. I would highly recommend this tea to anyone who might have the same illness, or coming down with a flu. Or someone who just wants a good detox.
