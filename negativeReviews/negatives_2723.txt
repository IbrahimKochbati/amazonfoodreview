Salt tastes fine, cant say about the health claims. 3 stars is because of the packaging. The grinder top is too large for a comfortable grind. I have fairly large strong hands and have a hard time turning the grinder. For me, when the grinder is mostly vertical to 45deg, it is difficult impossible to grind directly onto food. Works fine if cap is left on & held in a horizontal position & them remove cap & use. The grind gives a nice fine grind (better than my OXO I also got at Amazon).
