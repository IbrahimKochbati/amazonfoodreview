My dog loves these. He is able to finish it, so we have no pieces of rawhide lying around. He can usually chew it completely so I do not worry about him having an intestinal blockage from the rawhide. They do not have an offensive odor, and they do not stain the carpet. I don't see any real benefit to his teeth though.
