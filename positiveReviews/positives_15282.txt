Like this product, but, wish the  ewer made the larger cup size as the higher priced one.  It is a good  ewer though.  Have had it for about a month or so.  If you want the largest mug size, I advise to pay the extra money.  I only use for a late     evening cup.  I use my regular coffee maker for mornings.  The K Cups are pricy.  You need to shop around for best price or use refillable Solofill.  See my review on that.
