I have never used this to make a hot chocolate drink, but it is my favorite chocolate to use in cookies.  Chopped into chunks and mixed in the dough, it stands in for normal chocolate chips beautifully.  The slightly grainy texture comes through the baking perfectly intact and creates a wonderful contrast with the chewy cookie.  Try it!  It's wonderful.
