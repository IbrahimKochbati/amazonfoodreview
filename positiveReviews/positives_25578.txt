Let me start out by saying this bulk tea bag comes with a lot of Hibiscus flowers.  A little bit of hibiscus goes a long way.  I've even reused the the flowers after I am done with my drink.  I recomend this product for anyone who likes hibiscus or sour drinks in general (of course it can be sweetened up too, just like lemonaide.)          Pros:     Excelent Value     Quality flowers     Great taste     A lot of product          Cons:     Some flowers are a little gritty    easily solved with tea strainer sifter
