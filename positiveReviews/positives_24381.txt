I'd have suspected that the vanilla mint wouldn't be the favorite between our four dogs, but it is with this barbecue version coming in close second! These treats fit into a variety of the everlasting treat balls. We have the large blue one that takes two 'dog hockey pucks' and two orange ones that take one each. These are about the density of bone, and are made of not particularly nutritious stuff but are excellent for cleaning teeth and giving the jaws a workout.          We have a very old, very big malamute, another pretty old pointer, a big...err...we're not sure what he is exactly, part rotty, part small bear, part cat...and a black lab puppy. Everyone loves the everlasting treats, but they really prefer this flavor and the vanilla mint. The malamute isn't much for chew toys, but he absolutely mauls this like he was 12 years younger. Everyones teeth look considerably better after a few weeks of these treats.          Update: The malamute figured out if he sawed away at one side until about 1 4" was demolished, that he could then pull the whole thing out and just eat it.  Takes him 5 minutes to eat three of them now.  Good while it lasted! :)
