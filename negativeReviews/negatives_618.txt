When I ordered this tea, I was so excited because I thought I had finally found the equal to another  and's rose tea (in individual bags). I was excited for the loose quality of the tea, along with the anticipated light delicate taste I'd hoped for.     I was sadly mistaken... When I excitedly opened it, I was hit by a very sweet, syrupy, cotton candy like smell coming from the bag. Not a good scent. Then, I thought 'the smell doesn't determine the taste' so I steeped the recommended tablespoons for the amount of time indicated and then tried a taste. The overpowering sweet smell gave was to a bitter taste, not at all reminiscent of my previous experience with rose tea. Unfortunately, I had to pour the rest of mine out.     I have a bag of Hibiscus tea coming in the mail soon from this company. I'm really hoping it's better!
