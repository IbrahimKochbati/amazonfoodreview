I usually give my kitten Catswell treats, because they are straight forward with ingredients, and use cage free chicken.  Well Petco did not have them in stock so this looked like a good alternative. He likes these just as much as the other ones.  I tried giving another cat these treats and he kind of smelled it and walked away, but ended up eating it once it was on the floor.
