We love this oatmeal! The texture is very smooth and my baby loves the taste. We didn't have any problems with any other oatmeal types that we've tried but I was impressed by the DHA + probiotic and that the product is also organic. I also prefer the can over any type in a box, much easier to mix one handed (which is a must) and much less messy. Great product.
