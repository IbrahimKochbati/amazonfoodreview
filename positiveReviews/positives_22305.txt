After trying this coffee a few months ago from my local Sprouts Market, I was hooked! I am a serious coffee connoisseur and this by far has the most smoothest taste around. It's not oily like a Starbucks and doesn't become bitter once the bag is opened like Peets and Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf coffees. It is a darker roast coffee, but I prefer those. Made with a few tablespoons (once ground) and spring water, you've got yourself one good cup of coffee. So glad to have found this on Amazon for such a great price. I will definitely be buying this again!
