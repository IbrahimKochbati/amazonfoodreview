I thought I was buying non pareil candy (like snowcaps), but instead it was a container of sprinkles. I'll find a use for them, but I was hoping for a stocking stuffer (heck maybe I'll make it stocking stuffer andyway).  I would have been better to see a picture of the container  so I knew it wasn't candy.
