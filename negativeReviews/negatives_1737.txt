All of the positive reviews led me to believe this popcorn was going to be really great. Truth is, I am disappointed. The popcorn kernels are tough, chewy and lack any great corn taste. I want popcorn that snaps when you bite into it.  I will go back to buying the premium Orville Redenbacher's  and at my local grocery.
