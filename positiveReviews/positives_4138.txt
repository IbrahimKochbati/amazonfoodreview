the extra dessert delights sugargree key lime pie flavored gum is an amazingly limey mouth party.  it has a zesty tartness tempered with enough sweetness for balance.  having a piece of gum taste so much like a food is a little disorienting and while i did not really think i would end up looking like a lime (a la violet beauregard from willy wonka and the chocolate factory movie), it was a relief that i did not.  the only problem is that the flavor does not last as long as bubble gum or mint flavors.  but that might just be too much to hope for.
