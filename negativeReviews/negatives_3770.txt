I was excited to see this 50 pack of coffee! Read all about how "if you like Dunkin Donuts, you'll love this".  Well its not good at all.  Comes out looking like tea. Has the flavor of coffee but its really just water.  Trust me, I am not a fan of the "Rocket Fuel" they serve at Starbucks but this is nothing like Dunkin.  Just cancelled subscription.
