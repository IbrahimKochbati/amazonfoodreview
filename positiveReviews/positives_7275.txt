Coconut water and its many benefits are nothing short of phenomenal and I personally was so excited to have an opportunity to purchase in bulk.          What isnt phenomenal is that every single box in my 2 shipments must have experienced some temperature changes, or, they were discounted because     of a faulty snap closure.  At any rate, almost every single carton either came with the lid  oken off (adhesive gave out) or it eventually  eaks off.     Not such a big deal, unless I want to take a carton with me.
