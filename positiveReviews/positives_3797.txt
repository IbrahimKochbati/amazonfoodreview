These snacks are very different than, say, Slim Jims. They are moist and seems less processed than many of the convenience store meat snacks out there. There was a nice hint of spice laced with honey. I would say they tasted and had a texture that I might have expected in a more expensive product. I will buy them again and will recommend them to friends and family.
