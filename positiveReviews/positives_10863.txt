What can I say about man's best friend other than he deserves the best treats possible.  It was almost as if our dog Shultz knew what was in the box and sat up begging for a treat when we opened the bag.          The treats do seem a bit hard but our Doxie just loved them.  It's nice to be able to give a healthy organic treat instead of chemically processed treats.  Your pet will not be disappointed when you hand out these little square snacks.
