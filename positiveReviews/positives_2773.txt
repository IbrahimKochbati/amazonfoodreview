DE is a very good coffee.  I ordered this as my father in law raved about it, and the whole bean aroma rood is indeed a good coffee.  It tastes like a medium coffee with a particular spice feel to it.  Very unique and very tasty.  I tend to make my coffee very bold even if it is a 'medium' coffee, and even bold this is up there with some of my favorite coffees.          If you are a coffee fan, this is worth a shot, pun intended.          Enjoy.
