I use to buy this all the time with no problems. I had  ought other soil that didn't compare to the quality of this one but the last go 'round of pots I soiled are infested with gnats. An extreme amount. Its spread to my other plants and the soap water trick is not working.          I'll have to buy bug spray for house plants now. Try something else.
