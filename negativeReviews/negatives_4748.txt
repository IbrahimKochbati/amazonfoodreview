I subscribed to this litter because I thought that it would be great, and it claims it does the same thing as the litter we were using before. I couldn't find our current litter on subscription, but I figured it would be okay to go ahead and make the switch.  No big deal, its Arm & Hammer, it will be good, it does the same thing.  WRONG!  We clean the litter box every day, once at 9am, and again at 9pm, so the odors coming from that thing are inexcusable.  Within a matter of days I've had to completely air out upstairs in the middle of winter because I cannot take the smell.  With our other litter, it always smelled like fresh scented detergent or something pleasant, even while we cleaned it.  With this litter its as if there isn't even any litter in the box.          We will be switching back to Fresh Step Premium Scoopable Scented Clumping Cat Litter Multiple Cat Strength time NOW!             "
