There are a number of health benefits with cleansing teas. I was reading recently about how effective lemon was for cleansing as well, so I did a search and found this tea on Amazon.com. Tastes SOOOO much better than the traditional cleansing tea sold by this company. I would highly recommend as it is healthy, and tastes great with a little honey! Give it a shot, it is worth it.
