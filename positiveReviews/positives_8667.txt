I have been giving these to my dogs for the past couple of years.  They love them.  Even though it is a bit pricey, the bag lasts a long time.  We have 3 dogs (spoiled dogs). They get these treats as rewards for good behavior or really for just anything.  This bag lasts a couple of weeks.  Merrick is an excellent company.  The dogs love them and really, what else matters?  This was an excellent price! Will be ready to buy more soon.
