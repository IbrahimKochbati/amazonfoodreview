Used with the Yogourmet yogurt maker, this starter has produced consistently great batches of yogurt.  One must carefully follow the directions on the package, rather that the machine's instructions, since the temperature of the milk must be allowed to cool to a lower level with the Casei Bifidus culture, as compared with the non probiotic culture.  Using this starter with 1% Organic milk from Costco and fortified with a cup of non fat instant milk powder has produced the richest tasting yogurt I have ever had.  I make a full 2 quart container, and fill a Donvier Yogurt Cheese strainer, so I have a choice of regular and Greek style yogurt.
