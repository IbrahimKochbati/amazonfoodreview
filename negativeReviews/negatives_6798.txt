I like that these packages are just the right size for 1 2 people and that there are very few unpopped kernels.  This does taste a lot like the popcorn at the movies.  If you like your popcorn very salty, this is the product for you!  However, I don't!  I like more butter flavor and only a little salt.  It's simple enough to snip off a small corner of the popcorn side of the packet and pour out most of the salt.  Unfortunately, out of the 20 packets I bought, six of them were not separated properly and the salt and kernels mixed with the oil, so I am stuck with the six overly salty bowls of popcorn.  I really wish this company made a low salt or unsalted version of these packs.  I'd definitely buy more if I didn't have to taste all that salt!
