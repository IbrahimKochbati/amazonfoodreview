I used to buy this at Target but it's cheaper at Amazon.          My cat goes crazy when I get out the bag so I know she loves it. Cheap to boot, also!          I don't really stress out about which exact ingredients are in cat or dog food. I figure it's all pretty decent so why not save a little money...
