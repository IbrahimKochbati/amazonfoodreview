We like to put this out in the office for the employees and customers to get.     For some reason, Hershey's puts a disproportionate amount of the nuggets to what people want.  I think there's about an equal likeability for the Milk Chocolate, Milk Chocolate w  Almonds, Dark Chocolate w  Almonds, but no one likes the Toffee and Almonds one.  Don't get me wrong (I love toffee), but there was just a big miss on their Toffee and Almond one.  The bits are so small that you can't even taste them.     But other than that, the rest of the nuggets are delicious (my personal favorite is the Dark Chocolate Almond).
