Would give this a zero if I could.  I spent a lot of money for crackers and I believe some production error happened.  Every single bag was sealed incorrectly.  I should say   not sealed or half way sealed   all 4 boxes only had the hermetic sealing to about 80%   rest was open.  All 4 boxes were entirely inedible.  I was shipped 4 boxes of expensive stale crap.
