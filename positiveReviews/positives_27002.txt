My daughter is 13 months old, has been eating these for a few months now and absolutely LOVES them, both flavors. I wish they made more flavors, not that my daughter cares which flavor she gets, she gobbles them both up! If she sees the bag in the cupboard she goes crazy and says more (in sign language) and literally says snack. If given the opportunity she would get the whole bag, lol. I wish I discovered them earlier then I did, I say that the package said toddler so I thought she couldn't have it, but they are just like the yogurt melts to where they are easily chewable, if your child can chew food then these will be just fine, in my opinion.
