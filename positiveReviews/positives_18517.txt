The label says they're popped, rather than fried or baked.  However they did it, these are great chips!  They're very nicely seasoned such that I don't think you'd be inclined to dip them, though they're certainly sturdy enough to.  The flavor is a nice balance sweet and salty with not too much of either. At 100 calories a bag, 3 grams of fat (no saturated, no trans fat), 16g carbohydrates and 230mg sodium per bag they're also great nutritionally.          I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes, but in this form they are terrific!  All five of us in this house from age 9 to 50 something are fans.          I wish I was better at describing flavors but you'll just need to try them for yourself.
