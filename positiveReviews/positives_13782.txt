The MOCAFE Azteca D'oro 1519 Mexican Spiced Ground Chocolate is a very interesting drink. Not knowing what to expect [I speculated that the hot chocolate would have a touch of heat], I made a cup as soon as it was delivered. To my surprise, it has a strong cinnamon [and probably nutmeg] flavor   it is a good hot chocolate.          I mix the chocolate powder with steamed frothed milk from my espresso maker   I find this makes the drink much better. It takes a couple of cups to really make an opinion, but I think it is a good hot chocolate to drink every day.
