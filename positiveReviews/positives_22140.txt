The seller of York Peppermint patties tried twice to send me their product, but due to circumstances beyond their control, the merchandise arrived in a partially melted condtion.     The seller did their best to compensate, but it did not work.     They were handsome in their actions to reemburse me, and showed a company policy that I wish would be followed by all the merchants that I do business with, Alas.          What actually arrived were partially melted patties, perfectly edible, but not fit to be served to visitors if one had company.  Opening the patties would scatter the chocelate covering, and make a mess.  Once passed the mess, the patties tasted fine.          It has been explained to me that taking extra care in the shipping, would make the cost prohibitively expensive.          Would like to thank the "Bice Wholesale" Company for the efforts they took to send me a satisfactory product.     Sorry to say, they were only partially successful.     In this particular case, one could honestly blame the summer temperatures, and or the heatwaves that pestered the Mid West and East Coast recently.          Regards          Adam B. Dijkman
