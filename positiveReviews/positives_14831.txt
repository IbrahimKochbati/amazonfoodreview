This Rishi Earl Grey seems to be better than other  ands that I have tried in the past.  (In the past, I have tried other  ands like The Coffee Bean & The Tea Leaf, Twinings, and few others easily found in my local supermarket.)  The fragrance is very nice without becoming overpowering and it tastes smooth and light.          If you want to make the  ew 'heavier', try adding 'heavier' tea like Yorkshire Tea (I think other English Breakfast Tea types should work as well), although do not add too much or it may become too strong, unless you want to also add milk.  Although I have not tried yet, I am considering mixing this Early Grey with Assam sometime in the future.  Experiment, experiment, and experiment.
