The Happy Baby Beef Stew was not much of a beef stew.  The second ingredient behind water was tomatoes and it was evident in the taste of the product.  It didn't seem to have even a trace taste of beef.  Because of the high tomato content, the stew was very acidic.  I was a bit disappointed by this product.
