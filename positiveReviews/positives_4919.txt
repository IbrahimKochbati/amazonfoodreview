As processed, mass produced jerkies go, this is one of the best I've had. It compares with King B. I don't care for all of the poisonous preservatives and processing, but that comes with eating anything these days unless you go and find a hunter you can buy from direct.     Fresh game jerky would be the next logical step if you can find it.
