Ahhh...can you say "Good Times!"? I am a big fan of jelly beans and these are now my favorite, perfect mix of flavors (good and...mysterious). I like to put them out in a little bowl, just randomly, before any company comes over...what's more enticing than a nice bowl full of  ight jelly beans sitting out, ripe for the picking! That is until your unsuspecting guests "roll the dice", grab a few and perhaps "enjoy" some toothpaste & pencil shavings!!
