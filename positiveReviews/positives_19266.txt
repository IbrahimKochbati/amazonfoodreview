My american bulldog loves this puzzle. This was his first time using a puzzle toy like this, and he was able to figure it out pretty quick. Now everytime I get it out he knows exactly what to do :D I would recommend to anyone who wants to challenge their dog a little bit. It is definatly something you would not want to let your dog use unattended b c of it being all plastic.
