This drawer is just awesome for holding the K cups when the boxes get nearly empty, and it seems pointless to store them on the shelf.  It keeps the k cups nice and dry and handy.  Best of all is that the machine can rest safely on the top, giving it it's own little area in the kitchen, kind of like a little  eak room.  We love this, and the shelf we bought to hang on the wall to hold the boxes.
