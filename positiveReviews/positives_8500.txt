What a wonderful surprise to find LUCY's on Amazon.com!  I haven't enjoyed a cookie as much as I enjoy LUCY'S since going gluten free several years ago.          They have that just right crunch.     They are just sweet enough   not too, not not.     They are just the right size.     They have just the right "mmmmm" factor.          THANK YOU DR. LUCY for sharing the "lemonade" you made from the dietary lemons life gave you too!  You've given me many appreciated "mmmmmmm", "mmmmmm", "mmmmmmm" moments!     Catsy
