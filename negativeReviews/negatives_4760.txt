I decided to try this dry food on my two dogs, because of all the great reviews.          However....Neither dog will eat it.  One dog took a couple bites, and refuses to eat it..The other dog wont even take a bite.     I tried mixing it with their favorite can food, but this only made matters worse.  They would not even touch it.          I was confused about this, since one of my dogs will eat just about anything, while the other will eat dry food mixed with cannned.     The reviews were all good, so...          I checked the package...And, I think I may have found the answer...There is a last sale date of April 11, 2012....That's only about 6 weeks away.     I would never purchase a food that was going to expire so soon, even on sale in a store.          I now have a huge bag of dog food in the kitchen..I have tried daily to give each dog a little, but no go.  They will not eat eat it!     The pieces are all the same size and color...Not appealing, and there is not even a smell that says "eat me, I am food".  Could be cardboard, judging by     the dog's reaction.          Kind of hard to return, since it is opened and is 18 pounds of dog food.     I have a feeling it is either because the food is so old, or it is tainted.  Dogs can sense when there is a problem with food!          Sorry about the bad review...But, This was money that will just end up getting poured into the rubbish.     Maybe I was only the unlucky one...Check the last sale dates on your package if any of your dogs wont eat it!          I will stick to Pedigree and Mighty Dog..less expensive, not as healthy, but both my dogs love it.     I cannot recommend this  and..I have two large dogs, mixed  eed and are not usually choosy about what they eat.     Except for the Premium Edge, which they give  a paws down to!
