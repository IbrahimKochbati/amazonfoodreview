I make my own baby food   it tastes much better than the canned baby food and introduces them to the taste of real food. The only exception is that I give them the Happy Bellies oatmeal as well as their rice and multigrain. These have extra iron formulated to be easily absorbed and also the probiotics which are probably part of the reason both babies are nice and regular. They're organic and whole grain so they're healthy and train the babies taste to like whole grain. I mix it with water and they gobble it up and love it.
