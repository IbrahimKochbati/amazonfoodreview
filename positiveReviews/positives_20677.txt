I just finished my first can of this. Delicious! I have been looking for a tuna packed in olive oil. Found this & bought it. Was $1.48 per can at meijers. The olive oil was evoo(extra virgin olive oil), & adds an enhanced flavor to the tuna. The tuna pieces were larger & not all smooshed like I usually find in tuna packed in water. It tends to be a little drier than the stuff in water as well. But I like that. I don't like drippy sandwiches & I always get that from tuna in water. No matter how long I leave the tuna in the mesh strainer. I,just had my sandwich with a light  ushing of miracle whip, put the tuna on, topped of with another slice of  ead & ate it. Sooo goood!!!!! I do not place the tuna in a bowl & mix with miracle whip because even with lightly folding in the salad dressing it still smooshes the tuna. And I like the bigger pieces. I am,going back tomorrow & get some more!
