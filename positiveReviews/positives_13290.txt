These mixes are excellent for people with gluten issues.  The Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix is by far the          best of all their products and I have been using it for 3 years.  These are superb,  even though they are          gluten free.  Add chopped pecans and they are even better.  Just make sure you follow the directions and          freeze before cutting.          The price is excellent also, much better than any store I shop in.
