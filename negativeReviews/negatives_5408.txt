The Puroast Low Acid Coffee was initially appealing to me because I suffer from acidic stomach, due in part to my love of coffee.  So, I was excited about the product.  Sure enough, true to advertising, it is not bitter.  So far, so good.  And, I'm going to take their word for it that the coffee is low in acid.  However, for a low acid coffee, it has a strangely acidic tasting quality about it.  Can't quite get a handle on it, some kind of funny after taste that is not pleasant   maybe it's actually an alkaline aftertaste that I'm not used to in a coffee.  At any rate, this has an "off" taste to it, like some type of chemical residue has been left in the coffee.          One star for taste, 4 stars for being non bitter and (presumably) low in acid.  Strange product.
