There is no better mayo than this one on the market. Also, it is the only one made without sugar (honey or other ingredients of the kind which belong in desserts not in a condiment)    a complete miracle and the way mayo should be made. It also has great spices; its tangy taste is perfect and just what you would expect from a lemon mayonnaise. The Whole Foods near my home carried it for a while but now they decided to stop, everybody is asking for it so I decided to buy it on Amazon by the box. We don't use any other mayo and now my daughter's friends got a taste for it as well. I plan to buy only the Lemonaise not the duo.
