I bought Fireworks Wisconsin white birch popcorn 64oz seeking the perfect popcorn for my Whirleypop popper, but I wrecked the batches simply by cooking them too hot. Now I've discovered on my own how to do it RIGHT.            If you want perfect popcorn, here's my secret:       Add 2 3 ounces of oil in popper + 3 kernels;       On electric stove (yeah, I know) set burner between 8 and 9 on scale of 1 to 10. (If you set it for 10, you'll have small, lousy, and even unpopped results. Who knew!)       When the 3 kernels pop, add 1 3 cup of kernels (any more than this and they'll spill over)       Meanwhile, melt 1 4 to 1 3 of ONE cube of butter in microwave for 35 seconds.       When popped, (turn the whirley handle to prevent popped corn from overheating   or shake your pot (the one on the stove) if you lack this popper) and pour into your favorite bowl, (don't put butter into your popcorn cooker) drizzling butter and sprinkling a smidgen of salt.            The very best you've ever had . . . true?          Another Tip: I deliberately make extra, putting the rest into a FoodSaver airtight canister. It stays genuinely fresh throughout the week.            P.S. I'm just a happy customer. I don't sell popcorn. (But now I eat too much of it.)
