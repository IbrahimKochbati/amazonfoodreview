I bought these for my cat and if I give them to him, he'll eat them, but it's not the type of treat he'll do tricks for or run over to eat. It's a healthier alternative to other treats, but I wouldn't buy them again because my main point of buying treats is to train my cat to do tricks or reward him for good behavior. These treats simply don't entice him enough to really be a treat.
