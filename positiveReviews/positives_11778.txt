Great, whole grain, filling pancakes and waffles.  Since it's simple just add water, we were able to take it with us to vacation in Hawaii.  The kids love it and it's healthier than most  ands found in supermarkets, a total win win.  It fills you up quickly so a box lasts longer. I've also tried the Kodiak Frontier mix   it was also good, but we like this Buttermilk version better (and smells so good).  The only thing is, I can only find it here in Amazon and nowhere else, great price though $13 for 3 boxes, will buy again.  The Frontier version is easier to find   Safeway and local supermarkets.  Hope Amazon doesn't stop selling the Buttermilk version.
