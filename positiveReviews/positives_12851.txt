This could be a nice beverage alternate to sodas, but with 33 grams of natural sugar it is worse than a soda pop.  The taste was unique and refreshing and not too sweet consider the amount of sugars.  Maybe it's the natural fruit juices that add to the sugar content.          One thing that is not good is that the first and second ingredients are not kiwi or berry juice but apple and grape juice concentrates.  This add loads of sugar and calories, and, the 135 in this small can might be better spent elsewhere for us dieting officinados. But, the taste is fairly undefined and could be confused with others, like the cherry which I also got.
