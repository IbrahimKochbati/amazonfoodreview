I recently started eating healthier and needed a low calorie chip to eat with lunches at work. I usually love anything ranch flavored and was excited to try the new Southwest Ranch cracker chips. Their flavor was actually TERRIBLE! I literally thought they tasted like poo. I could only force myself to eat two or three chips. I then had my friend taste them (hoping I could give away the box) and he hated them too. Now I have almost a whole box of these  that I will be throwing away. The texture wasn't very appealing either so I'm not sure if I will ever try another flavor.
