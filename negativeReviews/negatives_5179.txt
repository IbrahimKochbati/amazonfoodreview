I was so excited when I bought this toy, imagining the hours my dog would spend entertaining herself with this toy. Unfortunately my mutt took two seconds to size it up and decide that the best way to get the treats out was to chew the rope off, which she did promptly. She was right, and I could hardly be upset with her, but I was disappointed that such an expensive toy was so easily destroyed.
