This was my favorite candy as a child; thus, I remember it well. The present product isn't the same. The flavor is very artificial, in comparison to the rich vanilla taste that the original had. Today's manufacturer is likely using a lot of cheap, synthetic flavors, synthetic components, and a rapid manufacturing turnover process, all of which make it the end result inferior to the original.          Those hoping for the real thing will have to continue hoping. New tasters will wonder what the [harsh artificial tasting] fuss is all about.
