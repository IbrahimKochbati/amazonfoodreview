Five of my five dogs agree   they'd rather munch liver biscotti than almost anything else.  I pull out a treat and they come running.  It cheers 'em up, encourages them to obey, lets 'em know I love 'em, and got me over some really rough training spots with my 90 pound puppy!!!  And in a few instances when I've been slow producing the goodie, they've cornered me and dug in my pocket themselves!  I think it's a hit!
