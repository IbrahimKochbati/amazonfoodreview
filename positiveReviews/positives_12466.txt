My little one loves this a lot. It tastes and smells really good.          The reason I don't give it 5 star rating is that these don't come with bigger size like 4 oz.     Not many B&M stores sell them.          There are several types such as Beef & gravy,chicken & gravy, turkey & gravy and ham & gravy.
