Don't want to over hype this mix but it is very tasty and very simple.  We have two active kids in sports and other activities.  One of our biggest gluten free challenges has been pot lucks, team dinners, picnics... Lots of tasty things to eat, but nothing my kids can eat.  We've started baking up a batch of these to take with us.  Everybody gets something now.  Highly recommended.
