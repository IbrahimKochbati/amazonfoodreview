I don't know about you but I usually like to chew the head off mine first.  Can't really stand it looking at you while you are eating them you know.  The ones sold here at Amazon are fresh enough that you can get a clean teeth cut.  Imagine a thick green apple gumminese intense in flavor floating on top of a soft white pillow of mashmallow.  Glad that you can get it next day for $3.99 more don't you?
