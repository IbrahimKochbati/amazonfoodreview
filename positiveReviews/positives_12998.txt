I ordered on a Wednesday and USPS tried to deliver on Saturday but I wasn't home.  Picked them up on Monday morning from the post office, and except for one of the pitchers being slightly crumpled, everything is still alive and looks exactly like the picture! I got 4 chutes with a 5th growing in.  Overall a good purchase.
