These are the first Gluten Free crackers I found that actually taste like crackers! I don't mean they remind me of "real" crackers but that they are really excellent GF or not. The cost at our local hippie health food store is about twice what Amazon sells them for so I'm ordering a case or two. These are plain flavored and good with cheese. Great comfort food!
