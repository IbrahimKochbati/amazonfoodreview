Wasa has a great line of 'crackers', but these have become my favorite. They are light but not wimpy. Their flavor is fairly neutral so they don't conflict with whatever you choose to put on them. And for me, the calorie count was the final winner...only 20 calories per cracker and low sodium. A winner all the way around and Amazon has the absolute best price!
