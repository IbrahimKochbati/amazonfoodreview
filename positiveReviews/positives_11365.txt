I'm new to eating GF and have lost so many other foods from my diet because of migraines.......I'm trying this now. Have read much about how we can become Gluten Sensitive later in life; also, studies have shown that gluten can be a migraine trigger for many and is an inherited tendency, which would figure into my family history of migraines.     Eating Gluten Free isn't nearly as difficult as I'd expected.  There are so many wonderful foods on the market for us.  My first impression of this cookie....Heavenly! Big chunks of chocolate, walnuts scattered throughout, delicate but not crumbly, not overpoweringly sweet.  I got them on subscribe and save, and my only issue will be not eating them all before the next shipment arrives. I'm saving my daily cookie for mornings with my Toasted Nut Brulee tea.  Ummmmm!
