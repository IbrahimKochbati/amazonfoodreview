tastes great, good price. i use for iced coffees and  tastes just like the mcchain drive thrus that cost about 3 bucks.     recipe: steep 2.5 cups ground espresso coffee in 1 gal tap water at room temp for 8 hours, strain (with towel in sieve) and pour in a gal jug. Makes near a gallon. Large glass of ice, strained coffee, 4 sqirts of hazelnut syrup (using the squirt dispenser to fit Torani's bottles), top w half n half. yummy. recipe may be doubled.
