I first tried it about seven years. Trader Joe's use to sell it in their stores and at the best price ever!  I am a hot cocoa fanatic AND I'm Mexican.  Per my qualifications, I say this is a great blend.  The ingredients are fresher than Abuelita and the sugar isn't as gritty.  I only wish I could find it wholesale.  Price is a bit steep at Amazon...     16 oz. (3 pack)   34 cents oz     14 oz. (4 pack)   43 cents oz.          The 3 pack is the best deal (just over $1.00 per 8 oz. serving).  You can get 69 servings for $32.67.          I have yet found a better prepared Mexican hot cocoa, seven years later.
