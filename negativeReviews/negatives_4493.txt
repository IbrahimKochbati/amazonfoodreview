I purchased the Turkey pouches because my 8 month old loved the Chick Chick.  This is nothing like the Chick Chick.  This looks like a dry paste and it smells bad too.  Currently I'm mixing them with a jar of the Earth's Best Organics 2oz veggie jar in order to give it some texture other than cat food.  This is absolutely nothing like the Chick Chick with is a hearty puree with actual pieces of chicken and pasta.  I would not recommend it.
