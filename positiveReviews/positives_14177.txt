This makes delicious hot tea in winter and iced in the warm months...I used to buy the Aveda licorice mint tea, but was so happy to discover this much more affordable option. Amazon has a great price with subscribe and save. I have a hard time finding it in our local stores so I'm very happy to buy from Amazon.
