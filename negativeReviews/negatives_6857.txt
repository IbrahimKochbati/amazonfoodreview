I just bought a new Great Northern 8 ounce Popcorn Machine and I bought the 6 ounce packs and 8 ounce and both taste chewy. This popcorn seems to have a lot of moisture in it because all the windows tend to steam up really good. I also tried leaving the doors slightly open and metal try completely open which helps with the steam but the popcorn still comes out chewy. I'll try ordering a different  and.
