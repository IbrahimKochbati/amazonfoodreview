The ever growing line of snack foods from Nabisco now includes a Wheat Thin with a zesty tomato kick.  Each little canary yellow box of Sundried Tomato & Basil crackers is filled with 9.5 ounces of the tastiest Wheat Thins yet.  These inch and a quarter squares have been generously sprinkled with a zippy, zingy Italian style flavoring that will remind your taste buds of a freshly baked pizza, or a delicious spaghetti dinner.  They're very light, very thin, and very crisp and crunchy.  If you've got the willpower to limit yourself to a single serving of fifteen crackers, you'll be consuming 140 calories; 240 milligrams of sodium; 6 grams of fat; zero grams of trans fat (whatever that is); zero cholesterol; and 5 grams of...drum roll please... "WHOLE GRAIN" (whole grain is all the rage these days, as you've probably noticed).  If you're growing weary of those boring old saltines, you oughtta try these new Wheat Thins.  And don't forget, they're BAKED...not fried.
