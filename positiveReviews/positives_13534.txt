My husband recently stopped smoking (yay!) and this tea has really helped him clear all that junk out of his chest.  It has a pleasant taste and aroma, being neither too strong or too weak, and we both find ourselves drinking it simply for the flavor. This tea is great to drink during and after having any type of chest cold.  Good way to get fluids and soothe a cough related to illness.          Yogi Tea products are the very best out there and buying them here at Amazon is way cheaper than buying them in a store ($4 $6 per box.)  We subscribed to a couple flavors so they arrive without having to specifically order them.  I love this feature!  Thanks Amazon!
