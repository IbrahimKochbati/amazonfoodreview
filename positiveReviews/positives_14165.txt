Im up early at 5a.m. getting ready for class..i dont have time to make a big  eakfast so these oatmeal packets are very convinient for me. Ofcourse the fiber in the oatmeal keeps you full for awhile wich is a good thing because i dont get to get a real meal until about 10:30 a.m. and this helps to suppress the hunger. Plus these are original so NO SUGAR ADDED...just oatmeal. I highly recommend this product for anybody whos up early and on the move and needs a quick meal to keep your hunger down.
