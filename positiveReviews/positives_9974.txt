The product I received includes 3 packages of ice cream, 2 space food sticks, 2 drink mixes, and 2 packages dried fruit.  The food is tasty. My main complaint is that the ice cream packages are small  they only hold one serving each, and I have bought astronaut ice cream before that contained at least 2 servings per package.  This product is worth the sale price ($20), but I don't think it's large enough to be worth $30. Also, the product description is misleading  I only received 2 drink mixes and 2 food sticks  also, no poster. The product contains less than you are led to believe.
