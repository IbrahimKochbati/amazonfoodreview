I have an easily upset stomach which is why I generally drink green tea instead of coffee.  I prefer the taste and aroma of coffee but it does often cause discomfort.  This coffee tasted good but not great and it did not have the wonderful smell of good fresh coffee.  But it did not upset my stomach.  The taste was not bad but there was a bit of plastic undertones in there.  It was almost good enough to buy more of but I'm not sure if I will.  I like being able to drink real coffee without regrets but the flavor, it isn't quite good enough.
