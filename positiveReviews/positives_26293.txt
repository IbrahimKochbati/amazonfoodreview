I purchased Walden Farms Calorie Free Ranch Dressing when I decided change the way I eat. At first, I wasn't too sure about the dressing, as it tasted nothing like regular Ranch dressings at all. By the third time I used it though, I decided it was great. Once you give up the real stuff, this does grow on you. I now love this dressing and will eat it for the rest of my life!
