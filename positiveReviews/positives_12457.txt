I tried this for the first time recently and found it to be simply fantastic.  Ever since the early 1990's I have looked for a replacement for my old standby, black cherry flavored Clearly Canadian that has long since disappeared.  This is by far the closest I have found and in the flavor department, this stuff is much better; no lack of cherry here.  The only wish I have is that it had a little more fizz.  While it is a little pricey here, the cost does include shipping, which is undoubtedly expensive for such a heavy and bulky item.  For those of us without a Trader Joe's around, this is a great way to get your hands on this wonderful drink.
