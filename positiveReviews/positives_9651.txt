I have 3 mature cats, each has had some type of chronic problem ranging from obesity to chronic constipation.  I have tried a variety of canned diets with little to no success. Two weeks ago I switched them over to BG and I'm amazed in the change already.  The cat with chronic constipation has not had any problems, the one with chronic "itchy" skin has already shown improvement in her coat and is not frantically chewing and scratching.  My fat baby...that will take more than 2 weeks to determine any real improvement.     Over all THEY are happier, healthier and more active.  Oh, the Quail is a BIG hit!
