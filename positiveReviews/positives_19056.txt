I have only tried one recipe so far and will re review after I try a pancake recipe. I tried pizza crust (mix+water) and I thought it tasted fine till the aftertaste. I've been eating organic for about a year and maybe its just my taste buds. A lot of processed foods have weird tastes to me now. Anyways, I wanted some more low carb variety in my diet and I thought why not try this. I have to say that I was disappointed. I ended up scraping off the sauce onto some organic low carb  ead I have. I will try a pancake recipe since that seems to be popular.           Tried pancakes and they tasted a lot better. I think that, for me, this mix can not be eaten alone. I have to mix with a few other ingredients to get the taste that I like. Also, I used stevia to sweeten the mix and that worked just fine in place of splenda. Bumped up to four stars.
