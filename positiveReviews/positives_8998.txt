I got this at a GREAT PRICE. I paid $8.67 ($10.20 without Subscribe and save) for 3 boxes that contain 4 separate 24oz bags. So you see, is a whole bunch of cookies. I'm a oad but I hear that my stepson's reaction was WOW, they'll all be gone tomorrow (teenager   resembles a bottomless pit) but it was a very good price. Cookies are fresh and packaging as appropriate. Will buy again.     Btw, i just saw that the price on this was $29.95(My favorite things LLC), refresh a couple of times till you see $10.20, (fulfilled by amazon.com)
