I tried this at Starbucks and loved it (even though theirs is different), so I  ew up a container and mix it with decaf green tea and it is very refreshing and fruity. Healthy for your too, give it a try instead of sugary fruit punch for kids,  ew up use your favorite sweetner and lots of ice. Really good.   "
