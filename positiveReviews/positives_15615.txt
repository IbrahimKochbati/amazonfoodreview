This is a high quality seafood based sampler pack of wet cat food. I have two cats that primarily eat dry food, yet every once in a while they get a can of something. I tried this  and and was impressed. The meat is visible and appears minimally processed (looks like canned tuna, for example). The cats just love it and are awaiting their next turn!
