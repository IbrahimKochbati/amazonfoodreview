I recently found Wild Planet and purchased both the Wild Sardines and their Tuna.  The taste is amazing in both the sardines and tuna.  It simply can't be beaten and, they use BPA free cans which is very rare in this country.  Thanks to another review on Amazon, I discovered that many of the canned goods I was buying for my family that were organic, were also packed in cans coated in a lining that includes BPA.  I did some research and discovered Wild Planet.  Their tuna and sardines are more expensive but it's worth it because all of their products are sustainably caught, and packaged responsibly.  They're good for our planet and great for my family.  The only reason I'm not rating them 5 stars is because the sardines are processed in Vietnam and not the US.  The tuna is processed here. The sardines are not, and while I'm sure the canneries used are monitored by Wild Planet, I would much rather serve my family something that was packaged in this country giving fellow Americans much needed jobs.  I also think that with the price of the sardines, they should be packaged here.          Anyway, if taste is your only concern, buy these sardines.  They're the best I've tasted.  If you care where your food is processed, these might not be for you  altho, no sardines are processed in this country anymore so I guess we're just out of luck. For some reason, we Americans don't seem to care that we now make very little in our own country.  Go figure.
