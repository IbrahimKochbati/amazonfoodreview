My sister turned me on to White Popcorn over yellow popcorn.          She said it was more tender however did not pop as large.          Guess she had some store bought stuff.          I put the same amount in as Walley World yellow popcorn and it blew the lid off the pot!          I'm a convert to this  and of white popcorn!
