I have eaten oatmeal for years and found Coaches Oats 3 years ago.  It's now the ONLY oatmeal I'll eat! Since the oats are cracked rather than rolled, they have a slight crunch and definitely more texture.  Regular oatmeal is just too blah.  The Kona Costco still has Coaches Oats, but I haven't been able to find it at Costco's on the mainland.  Now that Amazon carries Coaches Oats, I'll never be without!
