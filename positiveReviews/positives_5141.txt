I'm not sure what I expected   maybe something thin and bubbly   but Switch delivers a rich, full orange tangerine flavor.     It's got a lot more flavor, and good flavor at that, and a bit less carbonation than other carbonated fruit drinks.     An 8 ounce can has 140 calories, no fat, 15mg of sodium, 35 grams of carbs, 34 grams of sugar (they claim no sugar added), and no protein. It also contains 100% of your daily requirement of Vitamin C and 20% mdr of Vitamin A.     I tried it chilled with  eakfast and thoroughly enjoyed it.
