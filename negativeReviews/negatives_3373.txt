I like these crackers.  Or, at least I'd like to like these crackers.  They taste like "normal" crackers, and they crunch like "normal" crackers.  But they aren't "normal" crackers.  They're very fragile, and it doesn't help that they are packed in a foil bag rather than the sleeve type packet common to "normal" crackers.  Most of these will be  oken before they ever get to you.  My all time high is four completely un oken crackers in one box. A few are just  oken in half but most are  oken in many pieces.  Don't count on finding enough un oken crackers to serve to guests.  It's a shame.  They could be good crackers, but this is too much to pay for cracker crumbs and pieces.
