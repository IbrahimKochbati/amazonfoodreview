Before I say anything else, I am mindful of differing tastes, as well as differences in processing from one batch of coffee to another. That said, I found the Coffee Bean Direct Hazelnut coffee to be evenly roasted (medium) and bearing a robust and rich hazelnut flavor from the first to the last cup. Since this is my first bag of hazelnut coffee from CBD, with which I am very pleased, I will update my comments, specifically addressing the consistency of the roasting flavoring process from batch to batch with my next purchase. If my other CBD purchases are any indication, I anticipate a consistent product.
