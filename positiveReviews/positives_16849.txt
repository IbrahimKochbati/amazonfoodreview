My 7 year old yellow lab figured this out in minutes and loves it.  My 2 year old chocolate lab just doesn't get it.  My only reason for giving it 4 stars is that Buster (yellow lab) carries it by the rope when empty and drops it at my feet on the tile.  After about 3 drops the screw on bottom  eaks.  After he  oke the first one, we ordered another and sprayed the bottom with rubberized coating.  That made it last a good six months.  We are ordering another one for his Christmas present.  It would be the BEST if the manufacturer would put an un eakable bottom on it.
