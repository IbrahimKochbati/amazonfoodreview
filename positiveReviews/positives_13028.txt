This is undoubtedly the best canned ravioli I have ever tasted. And I am not usually a big fan of canned ravioli except for a quick lunch sort of thing. I just recently came across this variety in the market here and gave it a try.  Not only is the ravioli truly overstuffed, but the sausage they use is very tasty without being hot and spicy.  I have actually baked these with Parmesan cheese and some added garlic and onion for 15 min and had people rave about them being home made.  If you can't find this in your market, its a good deal here on Amazon by the case, and with free shipping.  Excellent home made flavor, and highly recommended... : )
