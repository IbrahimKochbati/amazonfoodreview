Pepsi original          Pepsi is an amazing soda! The taste is like Coca Cola, but theres a diffrence.       To be on the right page, it was the first caffeine soda I ever had. At first I didn't know if I would like it. Then the first drink hit me. I had never ever tried something like it. At last I had my first caffeine soda. For a month the only caffeine soda I had was pepsi.       My parents decided I needed to try something new! So my mom went shopping. Instead of  inging home pepsi she  ought home Dr. Pepper. They told me I needed to try something new.       The very first drink of Dr. Pepper I didn't like. I'm not saying Dr. Pepper is nasty, I'm just not into it. Later on in the month my mom went back to get pepsi. I was so happy I did a happy dance. I love the colors of the pepsi  and! They are red, white and blue. Just like the colors of the flag.       9 out of 10 of my friends like pepsi. They have some problems and so do I.       The taste, well lets put it that you can't really tell someone the taste. It's just difficult to describe the taste. You would take a sip and if someone asked what it taste like you wouldn't be able to tell them.       Now this is the important part! If you like Dr. Pepper then you won't like pepsi, but if you like Coca Cola then you will like pepsi! I want everyone to try it. It's an enjoyable drink and I hope you think so too!
