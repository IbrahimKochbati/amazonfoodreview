This is the coffee that our friends, who are originally from Italy, use every day.  They highly recommend it.  They also use  Lavazza Crema e Aroma Coffee Beans, 2.2 Pound Bag.  I have had both of these at their house and both kinds are excellent.  We get it using the Subscription  option which gives you a great discount AND free shipping.
