I make Coconut Water Kefir with O.N.E. 100% Coconut Water.  I've tried using Zico  and.  I do not like to discredit any  and, but for some reason my coconut water kefir goes bad much too quickly when using Zico (sometimes within 1 2 days   should last 7 days).  I do not presume to know why.  The taste of Zico is not as good as O.N.E.  Maybe they overheat process it?  O.N.E.'s package says it is "gently pasteurized."          If you'd like more information on why Coconut Water Kefir is so great for you go to [...](No, I am not connected with Body Ecology.)          If you'd like to learn how to make Coconut Water Kefir go to [..]          There's also milk (cow's and goat's) kefir that are extremely good for you.  Kefirs are used all over the world for health and nutrition    just not common in America ... go figure.
