These Sweetleaf "flavored" products are only for people who want something really sweet with just the very barest whiff of some flavor (you probably won't even be able to tell which one it is). If you're looking for a product that's about half sweetness and half flavor, THIS ISN'T IT. I urge you to save your money and look for another solution.
