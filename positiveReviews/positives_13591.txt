Little  Duck Organic products are the best finger food. I am so happy I found them for my daughter. I was looking for organic freeze dried fruit for my daughter and just couldn't find anything that wasn't overly crunchy and hard to chew or that didn't get stuck to my daughters teeth when she ate it. Then I found the Little Duck products, the answer to all my freeze dried fruit problems. All 3 Little Duck flavors are so good. I usually share a bag with my daughter! They are the perfect snack for outings when fresh fruit is not an option to  ing along. Way to go Little Duck Organics...I recommend your products to all my friends!!!!
