I only recently started cooking steaks on a cast iron skillet and I'm not sure I want to cook future steaks any other way!          Well, when you go down this road, you will quickly learn that olive oil, canola oil, have relatively low smoke points.  A smoke point is the highest temperature you can heat your oil before your smoke detector goes off. ; )          Olive oil is around 325 deg.F.  Avocado oil is the highest at 520 deg.F. !          Now I still produce smoke, but nothing like before.  The only downside of searing steaks in a super heated cast iron skillet was the smoke produced, now I can lessen the smoke and enjoy some amazing steaks.  Win Win! Oh and as I understand it, avocado oil has less saturated fats than even olive oil, but I'm sure eating all this extra red meat doesn't really help. : P
