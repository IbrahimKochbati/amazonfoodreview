Tricky Marketing     (Look up "True (sic) Blue" dig deep into their site or study the vague label.)          "100% Cranberry Juice" is false labeling; "100% Juice Cranberry" passes...; has other juices for sweetening (apple, grape, pear) and for attractiveness: anything goes.     Just no sugar or high fructose corn syrup. Hence 100% juice.     With sugar is called "natural sweetening." "Blend" might not be 100% juices. Juice "Cocktail" is invariably with high fructose corn syrup.          I found real Ocean Spray 100% Cranberry Juice in quarts at a "Grocery Outlet" market once a few years ago. Undrinkably tart, but perfect for making my own less than sweet blends and thirst aides using fresh berries and fruits with water, and for extending store shelf juices too sweet for me. 100% C.J. is not a consumer product, but for food & beverage product makers.          Cranberry Juice Concentrate is also very handy & 100% CJ.
