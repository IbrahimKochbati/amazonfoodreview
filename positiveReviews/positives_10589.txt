The package arrived on time and in good condition. It's deceptive because a 1 lb. bag of uncooked pork rinds is considerably smaller than a bag of cooked pork rinds from the store. But this bag goes a long way. These nuggets are great! I've had the microwave pork rinds in a bag and these are far superior. Cooking a few or a lot is an easy task. They really cook up nice and tender. The first time I cooked these I thought the ends were burning so I stopped the microwave. Actually, the ends had not cooked. Allowing more cooking time (about 90 sec.) produces delicious, hot pork rinds. Highly recommended if you like pork rinds.
