The current product, "Certified Organic Raw Cacao Powder from Ecuador, sold by SAAQIN", is of terrible quality. Somehow, reviews for a similar item, produced by "Alive and Aware", were associated with this product. The cocoa I received when ordering through this page is made by "Organic Herbal Essence". Alive and Aware is delicious; Organic Herbal Essence is not. Another warning: After receiving the 5lb bag of Organic Herbal Essence and hating it, I ordered "Alive and Aware Certified Organic Raw Cacao Powder from Ecuador   2 Pounds", shipped by Halaleveryday. I thought for sure I'd get Alive and Aware, given it's in the product title, but Halaleveryday actually shipped me "Organic Herbal Essence". Grr.
