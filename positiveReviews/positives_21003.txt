Everything it claims to be and the kind of coffee that will likely please the majority of coffee drinkers. I find that a coffee press is the best way to appreciate freshly ground quality coffee beans, but this is very good using an automatic drip maker as well. It has a well rounded full flavor, nice aroma and without being too acidic. The shipping was very prompt arriving two days earlier than the earliest estimated time of arrival. It came well packaged and the beans were of top quality freshness. "I only wish that I could afford it more often." I highly recommend giving this one a try.
