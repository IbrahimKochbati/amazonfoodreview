I am amazed at this product.  I didn't really expect it to be as good as it is.  Now, if they could only come up with a way for it to be crunchy, it would be perfect!  It's good as is (blended with water) and also as an addition to recipes calling for peanut butter.  This is an excellent product and a great way to enjoy peanut butter without the fat.
