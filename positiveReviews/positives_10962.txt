My daughter loves these crackers with some peanut butter on them. They do come in two small packages inside the box. These crackers are good for poeple who can't eat wheat or gluten but not if you have other allergies. This product does contain soy,eggs, milk and sesame.  Great cracker at least according to my 4 year old ( she has never really had wheat so doen't know what products that contain wheat should taste like).
