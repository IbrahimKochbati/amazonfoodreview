I drink a LOT of water.  I have my Thermos Intak bottle with me 24 7, even on my bedstand at night.  I've began referring to it as my security blanket.  But as people do, I wanted something a little different, natural, and portable.  ENTER CRYSTAL LIGHT PURE!          This stuff is delicious!  A better alternative to sports drinks, better for the environment (cutting back on waste), and I'm assuming more cost effective.  The Tropical Blend is my favorite.  It's complex, sweet, but not too sweet, with a little tartness.  There's also the flexibility with these packets to make it as strong or as weak as you want it.          I've even started mixing it with iced tea at restaurants!  Arnie Palmers, eat your heart out!          All in all, great bang for your buck, go ahead and try it.  You know you're getting sick of all that high fructose stuff you put in your body anyway!
