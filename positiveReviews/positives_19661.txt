My daughter wanted to try these because she used to love jerky type snacks prior to becoming vegetarian. I have tried other  ands of veggie snacks similar to these so I did not have high expectations. I was pleasantly surprised! These are yummy! Great texture & flavor. Great ingredients too! We will be stocking up on these as a healthy, convenient protein packed snack.
