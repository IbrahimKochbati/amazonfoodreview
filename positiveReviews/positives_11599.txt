I have to say, I have not tasted maple syrup anywhere that is this good.  We used to get another  and also put in the same type of bottle, but I never could figure out why I would develop sores in my mouth after eating it, so I tended to stay away from the real thing.  Well, with this  and, I am able to enjoy maple syrup again.  It is so rich, warm bodied, strong in flavor, and sweet.  Just my kind of syrup!
