This particular  and and type of food was recommended by my veterinarian to combat some potential allergic reaction in my Rhodesian mix. One week later and I'm not disappointed. Both of my dogs enjoy the food, the transition from Hill's Science Diet was fairly seamless, with no apparent ill effects. As inexact as canine dietary allergies is, time will tell if this is a better blend for my doggies ears. Price and selection on amazon matched or exceeded that of the local store, and with Prime arrived at my house on a Monday after the saturday I ordered, extremely fast!
