My 1 year old LOVES carrots.  Raw, cooked, mushy, firm, it doesn't matter.  This tray has cooked carrots that can be heated up to make warm, slightly firm carrot chunks that she can pick up by herself.  She also loves to feed herself and this is perfect to just give to her.          We love the Gerber Graduates.  They smell great and taste great, yes I have eaten them too.  These are just plain cooked carrots in water.  I haven't found anything from this line that she will not eat.
