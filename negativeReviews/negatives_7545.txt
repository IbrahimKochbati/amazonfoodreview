I took a chance and ordered these even though I couldn't find out where they were manufactured. I only by Made in the USA products for my dog because items made in Mexico and other countries sometimes use arsenic as a preservative even though that is not disclosed on the ingredients. Treats made in the USA are subject to stricter rules and do not contain that preservative. I tried to see the back of the bag or read where the items were made or processed, so I took a chance and ordered them. That should have been my clue.  I received the item and found out these are made in Mexico, so I returned them. From now on I will not order anything unless I find that this information is included in the product description. I share this as a heads up to other consumers. Talk to your vet, do some research, make up your own mind. And the next time you go to the store to buy treats for your pups, take a look at the label, you'll be surprised how many are made outside the USA.
