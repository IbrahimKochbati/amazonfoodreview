Having only eaten instant oatmeal, I was looking for a whole grain oatmeal that would offer more health benefits. I came Coach's Oats at Costco and I'm glad I did. Easy and quick to cook. It tastes good enough on it's own, but I usually add a banana, raisins, berries or dried fruit. It also makes a healthy and filling snack   adding a bit to yogurt or sprinkling it on other foods. Sometimes I'll even eat a tablespoon or so dry or with a half teaspoon of jam or jelly. I'm going to use this to make some super healthy snack bars (there are many recipes online) to replace the sugar laden and expensive granola bars or energy bars I usually buy.
