As I've found with most worthington products, they don't come anywhere near having the correct texture and taste of meat. I also thought it was too salty. But I don't think I've been vegetarian long enough to forget what meat tastes like entirely. (been veg for 3 years) My fiance however loves it (raised vegetarian) The flavor of the actual chili was okay, (kind of bland) so I needed to add more chili powder, onion, garlic, and hot sauce to make it better. Cheese and sour cream were good additions to help what it lacks in flavor.
