I am surprised at  a lot of the negative comments on Canidae. I have a 2 year old German Shepherd who is a picky eater and has sensitive skin.  I tired 4 other  ands of food: Innova, Natural Balance, Taste of the Wild and Evo....all of which she scratches and bites herself constant.  With Canidae, she has a beautiful shinny coat, doesn't itch and she loves it!  It's amazing the difference.  Her stools sometimes are loose, but nothing to complain about or worry.  I'm not putting down those other foods, I'm just saying that this Canidae food has down wonders for her!  I've gotten wuite a few comments on her shinny coat.  Every dog is different and you just need to find a perfect dog food like I did for her.  We use the Chicken version on her.  If you on dog food analysis, you will notice it has a 5 star rating.  Jetta and I are both very happy with Candiae!!
