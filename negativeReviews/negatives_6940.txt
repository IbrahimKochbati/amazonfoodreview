I made two loves in my Zoji, and they both came out flat and wet (moist). Blah! I even cut back the water 1 2 cup and still the same. I used the basic settings on my machine. I followed Zoji directions and then Pamela's on the second loaf. If anyone out there has a Zoji and thier  ead is coming out great, please respond back. I would love to know your secrets. I have 4 more times to try, and if they do no turn out, I will not be purchasing the product again.
