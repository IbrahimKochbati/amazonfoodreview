I was a little disappointed that the sprouts didn't have the protected seal on them   hoping these are ones that Rita didn't get to cause the one alfalfa I received before these had a protective seal on it so I decided to purchase based on that one. Hope in the future all of them will have a seal on them. All arrived in good shape and in a timely matter.
