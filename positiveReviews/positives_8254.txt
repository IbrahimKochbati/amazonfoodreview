I love salted and smoked almonds. I had never even heard of Butter Toffee almonds before.  But, wow, I'm glad I tried them.  They are just sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth without overwhelming you with a sugar taste.     Another reviewer was right, they taste a lot like french toast.  I'm definately buying these again.
