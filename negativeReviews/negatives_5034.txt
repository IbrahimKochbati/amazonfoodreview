Have a border collie that I was hoping would love this toy.  It is sturdy enough and well made but I can't find any kibble that fits.  Anything I have put in the jar is too large for the dog to successfully get out.  Right now she just walks around with the rope in her mouth and the jar dangling.  Just be aware that it takes a very small treat to go in the jar.
