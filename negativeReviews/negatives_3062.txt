I do not love that they arrived in many small  oken pieces. Rather difficult to spread something on crumbs, wouldn't you say?          Might I suggest that this item is marked FRAGILE in the future?          I was well pleased when DH found these on line as it's a constant search trying to find this particular cracker and seemed a more logical answer than going from one grocery to another in attempts to locate them.  However, all these  oken crackers will have me out looking again before the weekend and I ordered 2 boxes cases.
