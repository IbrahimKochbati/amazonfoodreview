I first tried these Newman Ginger Mints from a local grocery store. They were packaged in an Altoid like tin and were the same size, shape and texture as Altoids.          I wanted to find a cheaper place to purchase, so I came to Amazon and found these. I assumed they would be the same   just in a roll.          They are not the same! The flavor is spot on, but the texture is very chalky and they are as big as life savers.          I would purchase again, but I think I will try to do some more research and find the ones in the tin.
