The peanut butter and honey ones are like a candy bar, as state previously.  I can't resist them sometimes when I'm not even working out.  They're delicious.     Plus, the company is a really great, which is a bonus.     AND I can pronounce and recognize all the ingredients on the back of the bar.     Not the most carbs, not the most protein, but it's a good all around training bar....          ...or a delicious afternoon snack!
