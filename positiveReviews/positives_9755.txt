I don't usually like hot sauce because all they do is burn my mouth but I am now literally hooked on GB. I don't know what they put in it but there is so much flavor and it's so perfectly balanced that it makes pretty much everything taste better, from eggs to steak to pizza. I can't eat anything without it. The smell alone will get your juices going and you can actually taste it before it kicks, and when it does, it's pleasant and just hard enough.          Another thing I love is that it isn't just a spicy red watery liquid as most other sauces. You can see the peppers and the spices there, all ground into a paste and it looks, feels and tastes natural and fresh.          I urge everyone to try it. I almost wish that it was not associated with Dexter Holland so that people wouldn't think of it as some famous musician's side project (although, then it wouldn't have the most awesome packaging of any hot sauce). He quite obviously takes this seriously though and so should you. Don't dismiss it, get it and you won't regret it.
