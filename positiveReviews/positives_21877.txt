This is my favorite tea.  I like it because it is caffeine free and I like the taste.  I do add a packet of Splenda.  If you want to make iced tea, my advice is to first  ew it in a mug, then add the Splenda, then pour it over ice.  If you  ew it directly over ice, then add Splenda, the Splenda doesn't mix as well.     I paid $16 for 24 k cups through Amazon.  This is about what I used to pay when I ordered from Keurig, except that I also either had to pay shipping, or order several boxes in order to get free shipping.  The Amazon Prime membership is a great deal.  It is worth the yearly fee, especially at Christmastime.
