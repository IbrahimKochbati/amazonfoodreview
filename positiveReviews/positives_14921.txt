My husband has been "Decaf" for 20 years.  So for 20 years he has searched for a Decaf that tastes like REAL coffee.  We use a Senseo Supreme (chrome look) coffee pod machine with 16 strength settings depending on pod holder, LED  ew strenth, and cup size selections you use on the machine.          After a 20 year search the Baronet 100% Columbian medium roast  ought a smile back to his face.  I use regular full roasts and I prefer the Baronet Izzy medium roast and also like the Baronet French Vannila pods. (more of a 'chick' blend)  But do not let that fool you.  If you want a bold coffee the dark or bold Baronet  ands that our younger friends prefer are 'truck driver' approved.  We keep them on hand for guests so buy the variety pack or a simple Dark Roast.          These pods will work in your Senseo however if you buy the pods in the foil packs that come in the box (stay fresher) they are larger and you may need to use the 2 pod holder with a single pod if you have the black machine.  However, one pod will 'mash' down ok in the one pod holder of the Supreme Senseo machine.  Yes, that wonderfull foam froth is still there. Pods that come loose, 18 to a package, are the same size as the Senseo pods.
