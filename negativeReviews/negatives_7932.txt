I consider myself able to consume very spicy foods.  These chips are excessively spicy and can't be enjoyed after approx 4 chips as your mouth is on fire.  What's the point?  I wouldn't recommend a 14 pack as it will take a while to finish them.  On the upside, they have a great flavor, just toooooo spicy.
