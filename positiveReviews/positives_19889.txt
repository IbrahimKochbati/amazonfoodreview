I actually didn't buy this through Amazon, but from a local general store in SC. I don't know when the original was out, but I'd never had it before now, so I have nothing to compare it to. I just finished my first ever piece and it was WONDERFUL! I guess if you're being nostalgic,  ace yourself. But, if you're trying it for the first time, DIG IN! Just be warned, they are addictive.
