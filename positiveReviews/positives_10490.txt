I have found the flavor of numerous green teas to have an oily or fishy undertone. Not this tea!!  Genmai cha tea has an amazing nutty savory flavor.  Highly recommend this tea   I have found it to be an excellent tasting green tea.  With all of the potential benefits of green tea, this has been a pleasurable way to up my intake!
