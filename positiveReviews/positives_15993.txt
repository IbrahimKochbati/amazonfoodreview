I have purchased this  and of Lavazza, as well as the Super Crema and Gran Riserva.  I use them in my Alex Duetto Espresso Machine (which I couldn't recommend more).  Of these three options, most of which I've tried from several orders, I find the Top Class and Tierra to be the best.  The Super Crema has been the least enjoyable for me, mostly it has been bland.  It's possible I have always received stale Super Crema beans.  I usually make Latte's. I have also had Chris Black Pearl espresso beans and they are quite good for a nice change.
