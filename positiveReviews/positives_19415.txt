I love Drostes cocoa. We have many food allergies and cannot use the prepared baking chocolate, so I bake with cocoa. There is a huge difference between Drostes and the other  ands. When I take baked items (usually  ownies that are out of this world) to events, I label them to let others with food allergies what the ingredients are. Some people won't try them because there are no milk, no eggs, etc in my  ownies. However, those who do try them keep coming back for more and say mine are the best. I have to agree, and I give the credit to Drostes.
