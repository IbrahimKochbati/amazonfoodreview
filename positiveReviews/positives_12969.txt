One of my friends and her daughter are big fans of The Switch line of drinks because it feels like drinking Hi C or Koolaid etc, without the sugar or high fructose corn syrup that is in just about every prepackaged drink.          While it is encouraging to make something out of 100% juice, I find this to be too sweet. I can taste the kiwi and strawberry, but overall am put off by its sweet taste. I would suggest buying a single or smaller pack before investing in a case of 24. Having said this, the 8.3 ounce can would be perfect for lunches without the problems of the bottle version.
