My Chesapeake Bay Retriever has a ton of fun with her tug a jug, but not as much fun as I have watching her play with it.  Her tail wags like crazy when I give it to her loaded with her favorite treats.  I have even used it for training as it is easy to give a food reward for compliance.  It has held up well and has kept her interest from day one.  I highly recommend this toy for any dog.
