Wow. I had bought it wondering what turkish delight was after watching narnia of course. I ordered it through a turkish grocery website but figured the review here would be more helpful as it's the same  and. I love the smell because I like rose scented things, and the texture i thought was good, but the taste? It was, like other reviewers have said, eating rose potpourri. I just can't get past it. I'm sure it's an acquired taste but I don't think I'll ever get used to it. Even an hour later I could still taste it faintly and I keep shuddering lol. My 4 year old wants to eat the whole box. But then again, she's positive she's a princess so she should be eating flowery stuff. :P Maybe sometime I'll be  ave enough to try a different flavor, but I'm afraid the lemon will taste like a lemon peel.
