Uncle Lee's Green Tea is about on par with Tazo Green Tea.  They are the two best green teas I've had.  I agree with the other reviewer that it isn't bitter or stale like many green teas.          I gave some to my mother and it has quickly become her favorite.  Now she knows that there are differences in teas.  She won't go back to Lipton and other big names.  Tazo green tea might just edge it out, but Uncle Lee's is considerably less expensive.
