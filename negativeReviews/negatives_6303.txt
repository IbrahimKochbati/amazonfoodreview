I learned today that this product and the previous bag I bought were recalled due to Salmonella. I just happened to stumble across the article on MSNBC. No notification was sent. Now the household's mysterious stomach flu isn't so mysterious. Also if you don't have your receipt they will only offer a coupon for replacement in 6 weeks.Why would I want another bag?!? Diamond just lost a customer. As did the Amazon seller.
