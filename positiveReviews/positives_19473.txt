I love these almonds!!  They taste just like a snickerdoodle cookie, but make for a much healthier snack!  One of my favorites of the Blue Diamond Oven Roasted varieties.  Buying them in a 6 pack is more cost effective for me, especially now that I can't find them in my grocery store. I wish they came in the large resealable bag like some of the other flavors, but for now I'll stick with the 6 container pack.
