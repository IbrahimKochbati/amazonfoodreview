This isn't the kind of fiber you're used to thinking about. You know the stuff that you have to choke down because you know it's good for you. This stuff is EXCELLENT. Much like a kid whose parents give her gummy vitamins, I look forward to getting my fiber now. I put it on yogurt after exercise. I eat it as a television snack. I'll make up excuses to have it.
