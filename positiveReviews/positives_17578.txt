I dont have a drip coffee machine so I am putting this into the espresso machine for 2 shots. Tastes about same. I guess it's good for stomach? But don't we use milk to sooth the stomach anyways? cream? and sugar. I guess this means we are going to let go of our sugar and creme that we are so used to from strong coffee taste? Less coffee is answer I suppose. This is great idea for low acid coffee but I just add water on half the amount of regular coffee and add normal amount of creme or sugar and milk and add water to the regular coffee's half portion to make it diluted. That helped so far. You are also supposed to drink this with coffee cake or something to help pass it. Not straight without anything in it unless you love that. I suppose you dont like to put any creme or milk in it then, it would make sense. This didn't make sense to me even while trying it. It just wasn't tasting right for me to drink it without any other sugar and creme I am used to drinking with. So I would say I wouldn't try it again without my condiments. But, I would definitely recommend to my mother who drinks straight black coffee. But she stopped drinking suggesting coffee is bad even weak coffee. She gets these ideas from her friends. She said it was good until last year and she's 60 years old. Now she says all coffee is evil. Dad still drinks black straight coffee from drip coffee machine (they are Koreans as I am). All their friends all drink straight black coffee without milk because they are all lactose intolerant. My younger  other is too. I guess this coffee is for those who has lactose intolerant condition and also loves to drink straight black coffee. Where coffee like this is served? Church. All dad's friends are also going to Roman Catholic Church. That's where it'd be best served. They  ew like 5 gallons of these stuff every day. Straight black. Just wasn't for me but it's great idea for my parents who lives 1400 miles away so I couldnt just have them try it.
