This is a great  desert , it is a rich, dense and moist pound cake  with the wonderful taste of amaretto liqueur infused within.  The only problem is availability, every year I find this product at one store but the following year at a different store, till this year.  I couldn't find it at all, thank God for Amazon, I got my fix. I will look here 1st next year instead of the retail stores!
