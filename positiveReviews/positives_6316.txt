If you like Triscuit crackers, then this is the healthy version with the same great taste and texture. Amazingly there is not much of a price difference (12 9.5oz for 33.36 vs. 12 8.5 oz. for 29.83)to purchase the better quality cracker. If the coupon offer is in effect, then these crackers are also the price winner! The only disadvantage is since I think these are healthy, I eat more of them at one time than I would normally of the other  and. They are sooooo tasty w  melted cheddar cheese on top or warmed crab dip. Enjoy!
