I received this product for free and was quite excited to try it out.  I have a child who has a variety of food intolerances and Namaste  and products have been a Godsend to our family.  Unfortunately this "Say Cheez" product is terrible and my child wouldn't touch it.  Normally, this isn't a problem when my child tries new foods, but I couldn't even stomach it!  It is NOTHING like mac & cheese.  The sauce isn't even creamy?!?!  Very disappointing.
