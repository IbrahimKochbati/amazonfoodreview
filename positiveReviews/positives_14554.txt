If I had to point out a flaw in this variety pack, it would be that there's no light flavor (i.e. green tea) to round out the mix. Short of that, I can't imagine anything I'd complain about with this mix.          English Breakfast: Strong, dark, and goes well with a dash of milk if that's your thing. A solid way to wake up, any day.          Irish Breakfast: It's hard to say this blend tastes lighter than the English, but it makes you feel lighter. Great with a full Irish  eakfast, the Irish blend really makes you happy to meet the day.          Earl Grey: Twinings  and actually bears the seal of the (or, an) Earl of Grey, and it is probably the best Earl you can get from a bag. Great for any occasion, especially for Star Trek nerds like me who can't help but chuckle and mumble "Earl Grey  hot" with every mug.          Lady Grey: A remarkable inclusion, Lady Grey is based on the Earl flavor. Whereas the Earl tastes of deep orange, the Lady has a very light dash of lemon. Lady Grey is an excellent and complex treat, good for relaxing or just plain enjoying your tea. Lady Grey is light and aromatic, without being a gimmick tea like so many other  ands are willing to push. This is a serious tea, and yet it still has a sense of fun.          This mix has it all. You've got your strong standby flavors that are great in the morning (English and Irish), you've got a great anytime flavor (the Earl), and a superb treat flavor (the Lady). Short of making the jump to looseleaf tea, you just can't find better flavors than this.
