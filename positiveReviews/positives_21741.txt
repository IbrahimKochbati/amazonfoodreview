I have a picky middle aged poodle who simply will not chew most chewy treats, no matter how high quality or palatable they apparently are. He is 18 lbs; these treats say "for dogs up to 20 lbs" on the package. The treats are rather thin, about as large around as a pencil. They look like they are perfectly appropriate for small toy  eed dogs. Prince consumes each chew in around 30 minutes. For value, you should probably buy a larger width stick. But since my dog will only chew thin bully sticks these are great for him! For heavy chewers, get the regular size.
