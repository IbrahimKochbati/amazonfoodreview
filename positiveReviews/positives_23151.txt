This is by far the best Gluten Free, milk free  ead I've had since going GF. It's easiest to bake in a  ead maker; however, I have been very successful baking it in an oven (I had never made  ead before).          This  ead does NOT need to be toasted!          This is so good that I serve it to friends and family. In fact, I now make it for my church and they serve it to everyone for Communion. We tried many different kinds for Communion and this is the only one that has received approval from the congregation.          Tip: use warm or hot water.          Note: The way I make it, the  ead is free from seven of the eight major allergens (gluten, milk, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish). In theory it can be egg free also if you use an egg replacer, but I haven't tried that. To get it soy free, I use canola oil.
