I love this product. More importantly my dog loves it.  He is definitely a chewer so this helps his teeth, he loves the taste, and it satifies his urge to chew.  As with any product..please know your dog.  If your dog does not chew this product and just gulps it down, then it won't be beneficial to his oral care.  Also, as with ANY product that can be chewed or ingested, please monitor your pet while they are eating chewing this product.  Overall this is a great product, I will continue to order it for my dog.  This product does not replace routine dental care, but it is part of a dental care routine.  The reason I sound so "informercial" is becasue I actually work in the animal care field.  The practice that I used to work for stopped carrying this  and and switched to a cheaper  and. ICK.  I hate it.  So now I just go online to find the real CET chews.  Don't accept a poor substitute.  Especially those cheap ones sold over the counter in places like Walmart or grocery stores.  All rawhide like chews are NOT the same.
