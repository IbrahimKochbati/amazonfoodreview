I tried this product after Switch's Watermelon Strawberry drink, and while I thought that drink was decent, I was not a big fan of the Orange Tangerine flavor.  The taste was an obvious blend of a number of different flavors in addition to orange and tangerine, and for me that made it taste more Orange ish than Orange.  As others have noted, the amount of calories and sugar are not that different from a cola, so it's not really clear that it's THAT much healthier than other sodas.          Personally though, I'd rather just grab a glass of orange juice or eat an orange instead.  I guess it depends on what you are deciding to "switch" from: for people looking for an alternative to cola, I guess this might be an attractive product.  But as someone who prefers water or tea and rarely drinks sodas, this product isn't close to making me want to "switch".
