I thought I would like this more than I do. Maybe it's my palate, but my first taste impression was pineapple, not orange or tangerine. The small portion size may be acceptable for an energy drink, but is not what I would call thirst quenching. Not a good choice for anyone trying to control calories or carbs. On the plus side, it is sweet, but not too sweet and the level of carbonation is well balanced.
