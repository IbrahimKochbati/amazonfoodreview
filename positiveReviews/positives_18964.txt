This stuff just works great!  I don't usually review things but I couldn't sit by with the clueless reviews.  After a nice lunch sometimes I get a little groggy at work and this wipes it right out. I am also a full time student. Every semester I get at least one professor that lectures a little to long. I take my little 5 hour energy shot and it helps me to focus, listen, and take great notes. I also find that I am sharper on exams. Not being a big berry fan the flavor on the lemon lime suits me great.          I have tried other products, most based on B 12 supplements, and this is a totally different product. The B 12 shots do NOTHING for me.
