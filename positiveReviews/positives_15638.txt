The main reason I tried the Petite Cuisine cat food is that it does not have by products.  This food actually smells like good food; there are no bad odors (this is stated on the label blurb but I didn't actually believe it) and my cat loves it.          The only criticism I have is the price.  Almost $1 per can for the small 3oz size is pretty steep.  There are other choices out there in canned cat food without by products for much less.  And choosing the larger 5.5 oz cans in any  and, while not as convenient, will save a lot of money.
