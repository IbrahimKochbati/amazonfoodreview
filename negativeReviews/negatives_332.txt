I have purchased locally many other flavors of Da Vinci syrups, and ordered blueberry online to try it, because it isnt available locally  and I love blueberry! Well, this was a disappointment to me  very very sugary sweet with little blueberry flavor; not to mention I paid 4x what I would pay locally.     #very disappointed
