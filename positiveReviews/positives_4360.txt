This Crackers are so good. They have very little calories, very little fat and still they are crunchy and creamy. I'm on a diet right now and these really help me on my craving moments. Depending on my caving I can eat them plain or with turkey or a spread. My kids and their friends love them too and eat them with cream cheese which makes a very healthy snack. Buying them on Amazon was a great idea because they cost less, they are fresher than in stores and I don't even have to go to the store to get them.
