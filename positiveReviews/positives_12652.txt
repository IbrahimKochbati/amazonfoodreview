I just recently got my Keurig, and I've been trying the sample pack of coffee that came with it.  So far this is by far my favorite.  I nice mild coffee taste to enjoy in the morning or anytime.  I actually wish they made this coffee in a decaf version also so I could enjoy the great flavor of this one anytime!  I think this will be the main coffee in this house; I've tried some of the others and liked some of them more than others, but this is the runaway favorite.  I tend to put a good bit of cream and sugar in my coffee (can't stand it black!) but the nice flavor of this one comes through the cream and sugar.  (I've found that cream and sugar can't cover up the taste of coffee I don't like!)  I don't care for the bolder coffees at all (I don't feel like getting slapped in the face by my coffee in the morning!)          I'd encourage everyone to give this a try if you like a light roast coffee with a mild, pleasant taste in the morning    you won't be disappointed!!!
