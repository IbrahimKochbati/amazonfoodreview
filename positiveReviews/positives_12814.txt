Kiwi Berry is the fourth Switch flavor I've tried.  Only one of the flavors (tangerine) tasted like the fruit on the label; the others (Black Cherry and Watermelon Strawberry) tasted like carbonated apple juice to me.  So, when I opened this, I wasn't quite sure what I'd get.  I'm happy to report that this tastes like fresh kiwis and berries.  It's sweet enough, without being too sweet, and it has plenty of carbonation.  This, along with the tangerine flavor, will be a favorite of mine.
