We own an Australian Shepard who WAS getting ear infections frequently and always scratching. This started about two years ago. I finally took her to a new vet, (my old vet NEVER mentioned food allergies, hmmmm). Vet said chronic ear infections are usually due to food allergies and that we could try their food at $100.00 a 20lb bag. YIKES! We found NL Lamaderm at Wal mart. We noticed after just a few days that Sheila stopped scratching. Needless to say really, the change of food,(which, by the way, she gobbled up),caused really bad gas. But after a few weeks that stopped too. No ear infections, no scratching. We are thrilled with this product. We pay less than $25.00 for a 20lb bag at Wal Mart. Thank you NLPP for providing us with the key to a healthier dog.
