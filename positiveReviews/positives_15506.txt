I was looking for something more nutritional and tastier than rice.  This is it!  It has a nutty, chewy taste and lots of flavor.  I am at high altitude and have to add more water and cook longer, but that is common with grains up here.  I have added loads of Porcini (Boletus edulis) to it and it stands alone by itself.  I have also served it with a chicken curry and it compliments it wonderfully.          The only drawback is that there is no nutrition information on it   the label is blank.  I have written them and hopefully the next batches will have it updated.
