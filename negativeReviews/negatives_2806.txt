The product is a known value to us and is fresh. The physical condition of the  product leaves something to be desired. The individual wafers are often  oken up, to the extent of 30% of the contents of the package. This indicates careless packing for the rigors of package shipment. The use of a somewhat larger outside box with the air bag padding on all sides should be better for the physical care of the contents. My wife eats the thins for lunch very often with meat, cheese or fish and finds the  oken ones unsatisfactory.
