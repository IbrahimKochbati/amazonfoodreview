This product is great!!!  Makes you drink water more often.  Walgreens was selling the 50 pk for $5.00 but discontinued selling.  WHY?!  The 8pk can be purchased for $1.00.  So why is this retailer selling a 12 count for $32.50 or $2.70 per 8 pk box?  You can buy 12 boxes yourself and pay $12.00.  The math isn't adding up.     Anywho....Still I think this an innovative product designed to make water good to drink with only 5 calories.
