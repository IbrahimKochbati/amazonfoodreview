I like them as a midmorning snack with a cup of coffee.  They are also great for those mornings you really aren't in the mood for  eakfast, but know you'll be hungry later.  They seem to keep you satisfied for an hour or two.  They do taste great   not too sweet and not overly cake like.  Buy a bunch and keep them in the freezer until you need more.
