I bought these thinking they were individually wrapped.  Should have taken more time to look at the reviews and the user submitted pictures.  The beef sticks taste alright, but I find myself not wanting to eat them because they are so inconveniently packaged.  I would need to use a clip to reseal the bulk package after one or two beef sticks.  A lot of the reviews mention that they aren't individually wrapped, but don't really make a big deal about it.  When I want a quick snack I don't want to go grab a utensil or a napkin just for a beef stick.  Maybe if I was dying of hunger, I would grab them by the handful and swallow them whole.
