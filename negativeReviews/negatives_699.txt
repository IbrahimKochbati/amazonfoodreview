I made cupcakes with the vanilla cake mix.  They were just ok.  They were dense, but not overly so.  So that wasn't too bad. The flavor, however, is where I was disappointed.  The vanilla flavor was so subtle that I missed it entirely, and I felt like there needed to be a little more sweetness (which probably would have also made them a bit more moist). The child I made them for only ate a few bites.
