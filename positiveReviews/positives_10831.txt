There's such a range with dog treats   you can find those fake bacon treats that are filled with chemicals and then you can find these treats that contain only organic ingredients   no strange chemicals that you can't pronounce. If you want to give your dog healthy organic treats that they'll like, these treats are it.          These treats are about 2 inches by 1 inch, scored in the middle so that you can  eak them in half (even scored, it can be difficult to  eak them in half). These treats are very hard   so if you have a dog with dental problems (like a senior dog), they will have problems eating these treats. If you have a dog that leaves crumbs and doesn't vacuum the floor for every morsel, you'll find plenty of crumbs after your dog eats these treats.          Taste wise, my dogs loved these treats. I have 2 large dogs (Labs) who, granted, love all treats. I decided to try a taste test   since my dogs will eat their favorite treat first, I was curious to see how these treats fared with some of their other treats. I gave my dogs these treats, a lite doggie treat, and a bacon cheddar treat (both of these treats are made by Old Mother Hubbard). Of the three times I tried this test, one Lab consistently preferred the Old Mother Hubbard (OMH) bacon cheddar treat (and would eat this treat a quick second), the other Lab preferred the Newman's Own treats. Considering that the Lab who ate the OMH treats first, tried to eat these at almost the same time, I'll say he liked these treats a lot too.          For the amount of treats and with Amazon's current price, I think this is great deal for a healthy doggie treat.
