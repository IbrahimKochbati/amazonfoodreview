I will admit to being a relatively picky drinker when it comes to coffee.  I don't make coffee very much at home and when I do, I tend to buy whole beans to grind at home from independent coffee shops and stores.  Because of this I will admit to having a biased opinion of ground vs. whole bean coffee.  My experience has always been that that the preground coffee is never quite as full flavored and generally doesn't taste as good as the coffee house experience.          This experience carried through here.  The coffee was good, certainly better than what I've had at a lot of restaurants, but it wasn't great.  I could see this being a good everyday drinking coffee if you're looking for something middle of the road for a caffeine fix, but since I drink coffee at home more rarely and more as a treat, I think I'll continue to splurge on whole bean coffees.
