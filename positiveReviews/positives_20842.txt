My two cats simply love this product and consume more of it than they probably should.  But, still, when you love them, you want to please them.  Unfortunately, purchasing this product through Amazon is sometimes a bit of a problem because it's not always immediately available.  I found a Petsmart Store which carries it, but the store is twenty miles away and the product is not all that inexpensive there either.  Let's hope Amazon can get more of the Friskies Indoor Adventures Crunchy Chicken, and the canister format is the more desired.
