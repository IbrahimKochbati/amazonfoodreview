I use these vanilla beans to make my infamous Creamy Vanilla Caramel ice pops, a fan favorite for my small gourmet popsicle business @FrontPorchPops. It's tough to find these locally for a reasonable price so I ordered these from Amazon instead as a time saver. I was dubious about ordering product online (what chef doesn't what to taste, touch and smell it before they decide if it's worthy of their customers?), but I was pleasantly surprised to receive moist, flavorul vanilla beans that were exactly what I wanted. I just wish they offered this as a subscription so I could have them automatically sent every month.
