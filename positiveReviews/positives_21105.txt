This is wonderful food. I feed my lab a raw meat diet but you could easily add cooked beef or chicken as well. It's easy to make up a batch for the day or to make freeze  in advance in case you'll be away or super busy for awhile. My black lab Ally has been thriving on this food for over three years. She has  no skin irritations, appears to be allergy free and has never had any kind of digestive problem. And her coat is really lovely...soft and glossy. This way of feeding is so much better than kibble. Hope you give it a try.....
