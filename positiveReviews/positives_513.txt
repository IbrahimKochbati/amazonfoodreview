If you want to find a good flavor substitute for maple syrup, barley malt, or  own rice syrup, this will do nicely. I use Madhava's agave nectar in my baked goods all the time, and am always pleased with the results. At the time I'm writing this, Amazon was out of stock as a vendor. However, when it was in stock, it was priced well for the 2 pack.          Other than baking, I've used it to top waffles, pancakes, and in small doses (1 2 teaspoon) added it to oatmeal. A little goes a long way.          Using agave nectar: Use 1 3 to 1 2 less agave nectar than you would another sweetener (depending on your taste and the recipe. Recipes with dried fruit need much less), cut the heat in the oven by 25 degrees F; if there is oil in the recipe, cut it by 1 3 (alternately, use a tablespoon or two of sifted coconut flour to absorb more of the liquid    just don't use too much or your recipe will be dry). Additionally, when baking, make sure to mix it with the wet ingredients prior to adding it to the dry. Most bakers might already know this, but remember to read recipes first because sugar is typically added with dry ingredients (unless beaten with butter first).          Agave nectar does not crystalize like other sugars do, so you won't be able to substitute it for corn syrup in making hard candy. However, I highly recommend it for baking. It makes everything moister.          If you are looking for less caramel flavor, you'll need to use the light version of this product (equally good in all applications).
