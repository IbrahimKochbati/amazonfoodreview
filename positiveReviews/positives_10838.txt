Our retriever, Elvis, tried to open the package himself.  After a little assistance from opposable thumbs, he stuck his snout into the bag and retrieved one.  It didn't last long.          This is indeed an all organic product, according to the label, and this company has enough integrity that it's not in doubt.  Barley, lamb, carrots, apples, palm oil, and molasses, all listed as certified organic by Oregon Tilth.  Low fat (4%), crunchy, about the size and shape of a Fig Newton.          I used to joke about organic foods.  Having read up on the subject, I find that it's verifiably (not just anecdotally) healthier for humans to avoid preservatives and other artificial additives.  Natural foods are more easily and fully digested, and don't tax the system as much as the cheaper products with long lists of additives.  It stands to reason your dog's system is the same.          Elvis will have a hunk o' hunk o' organic Newman treats, please.  While he WILL eat anything but okra (no joke), he's not always this enthusiastic about it.  Mr. Newman, keep up the good work.
