We just got the Great Northern Princeton popper a few weeks ago and also sent a 24 count prepackaged case of the Great Northern 8oz pop corn. The kids (11 and 6) really love it... They actually do the popping themselves. I have just ordered the auto buy shipping option for having them delivered every 3 months. Got a 15% discount to do it and makes it really convenient and saved a bit also. The kids have raved about the popcorn and the popper also,,,so its been a rally good deal for us. This popcorn is very healthy for the kids (Check out the actual info about the product with Coconut oil). If there are any problems in the future I will amend this rating. Hears hoping that this works out well.
