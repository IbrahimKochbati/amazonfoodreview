We have tried many of the different hot cocoa k cups...everything always tasted so watered down, even when using the smallest setting on the machine.  However, this  and...even at the medium cup setting, tasted fantastic.  I highly recommend Grove Square.  I haven't tried any of their other products, but I would be inclined to now based on this cocoa.
