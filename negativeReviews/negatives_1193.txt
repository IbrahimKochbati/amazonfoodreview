The consistency of the grain free chicken, turkey, lamb and fish formula was like     baby poop.  There was so much water in this cat food that two cats went through a     full case in a short time.  I can put the water in the cat food.  It is misleading     and a poor value for the manufacturer to water down a product, call it a 13 oz can     and provide nothing like I have come to know and expect from other  ands the same     size.
