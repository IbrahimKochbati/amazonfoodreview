I am a huge fan of Amazon and I order all the time (at least weekly) and this is the FIRST time I've ever written a review (that's how strongly I feel about these).          I am a big walnut lover but these things are absolutely GROSS.  I opened the first can and ate the first one and thought I was going to throw up.  I spit it out and washed out my mouth thinking they were rotten or poisoned or something.  I opened up two other cans and they're the same way.  They are absolutely disgusting.  They taste stale and rotten at the same time.  I threw all six cans in the trash as I wouldn't even give those to our squirrels.  I would look elsewhere.
