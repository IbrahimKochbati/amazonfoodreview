This cereal is not so sugar blasted as many kids' cereals are, but it has a nice level of sweetness, with a few sugar crystals on the outside of each piece of cereal, and the cinnamon flavor is also nice. It's a pretty good cereal, I enjoyed it as a kid and still enjoy it as an adult. It has a decent shelf life in milk, staying crunchy for a while and even after getting soaked, it still has a bit of firmness around it.
