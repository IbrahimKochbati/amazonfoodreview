Of all the K Cup flavors that are out there, and there are many very good ones, this is one of my least favorites, and I have tried almost all of them.  Not much flavor to this one, even if you add various types of creamers.  Of course, it is all a matter of taste, but this one doesn't taste all that good.  It is not bad   it is just kind of there   like a generic coffee.  Try something else instead.
