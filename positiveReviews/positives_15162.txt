My dogs have always been on a high quality diet and recently I decided to give this food a try. I was a little hesitant at first due to the price but figured my dogs were worth it. Since making the switch my rescue yellow lab has made vast improvements. No matter what she ate before, she was always itching and scratching. Especially at the base of her tail. She used to get so sore at times that she would actually bleed. Her coat and skin now are perfect!!! No more itching, scratching and chewing. All of my dogs are also eating less and maintaining their weight nicely. Less food means less waste in the yard. All in all I couldn't be happier with this food and my dogs will stay on it as long as they continue making it. I also just switched my cat over to their grain free Salmon cat food.
