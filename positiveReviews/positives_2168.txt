It's high quality and the price is right, especially with subscribe and save via Prime, but after months of trying to keep up with my subscription, I had to put it on hold.  I'm not a big water drinker, but this stuff has a distinct flavor and when you're using it as a work out beverage four or five times a weak it eventually wears on you.  Or me, at least. I'd still recommend it, just don't OD the way I did.
