My cat, who is of average pickiness, loved both of the chicken varieties.          The Sesame Chicken looks and smells appealing, even to humans.  It's very recognizable as shredded white meat chicken, finely diced carrots, and  oth.  No chopped and formed meat by products here!          The Chicken Pot Pie variety is a little smellier, but not as bad as typical cat food.  It is fairly soupy, but my cat lapped it right up.  She even ate the carrots, which I would not have anticipated.          Both products list high quality ingredients on the label.  There is no wheat gluten, so hopefully this product is less susceptible to the melamine poisonings that have occurred with other  ands.  It is made in Thailand, and I don't know what that means in terms of pet food safety.          I like the size of the mini cans, as they are just right for one meal for one cat.  I hate keeping smelly half open cans of pet food in the refrigerator!
