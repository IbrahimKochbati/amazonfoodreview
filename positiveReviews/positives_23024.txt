My mother is on a very limited budget and complained to me that coffee was too expensive.  I just stumbled on this while searching on Amazon for coffee to send to her.  She has been a Folgers fan for many years.  The price is great, much better than purchasing at the store.  Thanks Folgers and Amazon!
