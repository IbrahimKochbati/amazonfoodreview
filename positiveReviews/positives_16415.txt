Great bargain , Amazons price is at least $10 cheaper the petco & petsmart .Our Jack Russell loves his nightly greenie.  I know we should be  ushing his teeth but he turns into a Tasmanian devil every time we try. I like to think the greenies are the reason for his white teeth + he doesn't have doggie  eath.
