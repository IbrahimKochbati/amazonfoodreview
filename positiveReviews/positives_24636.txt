After reading all the reviews and comments on the dented cans, I wasn't sure I should order the pumpkin on Amazon. However I took the chance. Amazon is my favorite place to shop.  This is the  pumpkin that I buy at our grocery store.  It is for my 18 yr old cat and it keeps her regular. This is her favorite  and. Also I'm hearing that there is a possibility that canned pumpkin might be hard to find on the shelves after Thanksgiving because of the rains. So I wanted to stock up. I remember a couple of months ago  it was hard to find in some areas.          I received the order yesterday and was a little scared to open it up.  But it was fine!! The cans arrived in great condition.  There was a tiny dent on maybe 2 or 3 cans (just like I might find on the grocery shelf). I was very happy with my order.  Maybe it has something to do with the warehouse it is shipping from.  I live in CA and Ontrac delivered it. I've been so impressed with Ontrac. Amazon has been using them alot lately.          I went ahead and ordered 2 more cases and hope they arrive in the same condition.  The date on the cans is 6 2012. The price per can on Amazon is $2.36. In our store it is $2.99 and when on sale, maybe $2.50.          I received 2 more cases that I ordered and they were in perfect condition.  Now I'm all stocked up in case it is hard to find pumpkin on the shelf next year.          12 08 09 UPDATE:  I believe it matters on who is delivering the order.  I ordered one more case. For some reason this case was delivered by UPS (the others were all delivered by Ontrac) and some of the cans were VERY  badly dented and cannot be used. I asked for a refund.  No matter who is delivering these cans, Amazon needs  to put some protective packing around the cans so they don't get dented. I will no longer take a chance and order similar products on Amazon.
