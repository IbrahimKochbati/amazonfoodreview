I was shocked when I opened a can of this and saw what it looked like. It is VERY dry in the can.  Of course I was stuck with 6 cans so I've been using it to add to homemade soups and it works fine for that.  I never did eat it as a bowl of corn chowder.  So it is edible but it is way over priced and if I had only bought one can, I would never have bought more.
