I have been looking for Amazon to start carrying the Van Houtte K cups. I have been spending more just to get these flavors and now I just hope Amazon adds some of them to the subscribe and save program. Creme Brulee tastes just like having a Creme Brulee with a nice cup of coffee. I am impressed with how these k cups taste exactly like the name. This coffee is not over whelmingly sweet and has just a hint of flavor. It is a medium bodied, smooth coffee. If you like Creme Brulee and you like coffee, you have to try this. You will not be disapointed.
