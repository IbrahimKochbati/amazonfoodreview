I read a lot of reviews about creamers bursting during shipping. I went ahead and took a chance on this purchase anyway and I was surprised. They have changed their packaging since some of these reviews. They no longer arrive loose and now have padding. My creamers arrived in perfect condition. Not one  oken one. This is such a great deal! International delight is the best creamer. Nice flavor and creamy! Definitely worth the buy!
