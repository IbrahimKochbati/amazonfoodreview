I always enjoyed the apple cinnamon the best, but if I had to pick a second flavor   this was it.  To me the flavor was more similar to maple syrup when I was a kid, but not overly sweet.  Now it seems like the sweetness is still there but it tastes more like just sugar not the maple.  In fact the opening of the packet didn't even smell that much like maple making me think I accidentally picked up the wrong kind.  But overall the healthy side is still there and the taste is plenty good, just wished it reminded me a little more of the Maple & Brown Sugar I remember.  For the money, I really shouldn't complain   and I would use the maple comments to deter me from buying this again.  There aren't very many fast, healthy, cheap foods out there   thank goodness this one is.
