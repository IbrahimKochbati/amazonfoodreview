Thank goodness Bisquick finally went Gluten  Free!  I have been 3 years diagnosed with Celiac, and besides pillsbury rolls, pancakes have been few and far between as have good biscuits!  We have eaten many pancakes since this product came out.  Way to go Betty Crocker!  Only negative is that this is actually cheaper in my local stores.
