Popchips are really, really good! Don't expect a regular old, greasy potato chip, but DO expect something equally AWESOME that stands on its own. Popchips don't leave any funny residue in your mouth like some other "diet" chips, and they don't have a lot of fat and calories   only 100 cal. per single serve bag! I got the variety pack, and liked every one of the six flavors   some better than others (because I'm not a big fan of cheddar chips by ANY maker, so these were as good as any), but all were good, most were GREAT. Even non dieters who tried them liked them. It seems like they cost a bit more than the average bag of chips, but maybe that's because I had to buy a case. Even so, they're worth it if you're fighting the battle of the bulge and want a lo cal indulgence you wouldn't otherwise be able to enjoy. My recommendation: EAT POPCHIPS!
