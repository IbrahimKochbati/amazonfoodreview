These chips are some of the best I've tasted. They are not filled with chemicals. You taste the tangy vinegar as well as the potato. Not greasy. Perfectly crispy. If you don't like salt and vinegar tanginess, don't even bother to try. These definitely have zip. I love them. My children and their friends love them. Even my 4 year old loves them!
