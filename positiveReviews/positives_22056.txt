I love the hot, spicy taste of Wasabi peas and decided to try my luck ordering them on Amazon. Well, I wasn't disappointed. These peas are HOT and crunchy, just what I want in this snack. The shipping was lightening fast, too. I was paying $2.50 (plus sales tax) for a 7 oz. pack of these little things at Target and decided there had to be a better price somewhere. Well, I found what I was looking for!          As soon as I finish up this 5 lb. bag, I'll be back ordering more!
