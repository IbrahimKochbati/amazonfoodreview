I expected from the extremely positive reviews on the site for full flavor healty chips. In reality I get an OKAY taste with a strange aftertaste on basically all of the flavors. Chedder and Salt&Pepper honestly being some of the worst tasting chips I've ever had. If you're just looking for a great tasting  and of chips with health as a #2 on the list there are much much better  ands out there. In the end I compare these chips to diet soda vs regular; Some won't tell the difference while some will immediately sense it and hate it.
