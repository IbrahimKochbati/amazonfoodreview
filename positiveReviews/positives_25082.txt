I really enjoy using "Mrs. Dash Original Blend".  Great to find in institutional size because I always use more than the recommended serving size of 1 4 teaspoon. It seems I always have this on my grocery list in the 2.5oz size so I purchased two bottles hoping it would last a while.  Mrs. Dash is a marvelous product for those who are on a low sodium diet because it adds a lot of flavor to meals.  When I run out I will definitely purchase the large size again.          I am very happy with my purchase.  I am also beholden to the reviewer who stated this product comes in a bottle.
