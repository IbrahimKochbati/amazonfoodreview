I love real Dr. Pepper and I enjoy Diet Dr. Pepper.  On a Friday night some people will relax with a glass of wine or beer, I drink a Dr. Pepper.  I was really excited to try the Soda Stream versions but I was so disappointed.  I tried them in the sample pack and wasn't impressed but thought I might be able to acquire a taste for them.  I really like the ingredients in the SodaStream syrups so I wanted to give it a try.  We actually ended up pouring out  most of the Diet Dr. Pete because no one liked it.  Maybe it's just my taste buds because the only SodaStream flavor I really like is the diet cranberry raspberry.  My husband enjoys several flavors but I mostly drink seltzer.          If you are looking for a Dr. Pepper double you'll be disappointed.
