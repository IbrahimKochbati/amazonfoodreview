I purchased a Keurig single cup  ewer for my elderly Mom and with that I sent her a large sample pack.  She pick the Breakfast Blend as her favorite.  This was a great deal so I sent it to her direct.  The K Cups were all dumped in one box with not much packing protection.  I was sent an email from the company ahead of the delivery so I was aware and all was fine.
