I keep these in the freezer when unexpected guests drop in, or if one of the staff has guests.  What we do prefer is to slaughter the fatted calf, but that is not always practical due to anticipating aging times.  Having just said that, I realize that I must institute a detailed and precise slaughtering schedule to insure always having quality beef on hand.          I may have given these Kobe steaks four stars if that were my only gripe, but I have a problem with  the size.  First off, these cuts are only one inch thick, which is ghastly offensive.  I steak should be, at the bare minimum, two inches thick.  I do not even associate with proletarians, and can only imagine the horrors that these "people" committ against decent food.  Can't these people just eat sensibly, or not at all.  Please don't get me started, for I wanted to include sterility drugs in all fast food, particularly the bargain menu, but that is merely a hope and dream for another day.          Secondly, isn't there a law somewhere about a steak less that  two pounds?  My heavens, this fourteen ouncer is a mere sampler, a tease.  I suppose these cuts are intended to be given away at those offensive stores that the yuppies flock to as lemmings to a cliff.          Lastly, I must close this review before I become too distraught.
