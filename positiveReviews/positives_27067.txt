Out of all the snacks out there and all the ones my daughter has tried, these are her all time favorite.  Even if she's full, even if she won't eat anything else, she will never say no to these.          They smell great, although admittedly I've never tried them to see what they taste like.  They melt very easily in her mouth, don't crumble or leave a mess.  They're also just the perfect bite size for my 14 month old.          I prefer the tropic version over the berry version because it's colorless.  The berry version, once wet, can stain chairs clothes.  It comes out but now you have to spend your night cleaning the stains out.  A few time my daughter ended up sitting on them after dropping them and the colored stained her stroller.  And once she somehow managed to get her water on them, perhaps it dripped, and that was a huge mess.  So I learned to stick with the tropical, and she doesn't mind.          The price here is much higher than the grocery store though.  I usually get them for 2.99 a pack and there's quite a few in the package.
