As with many of the flavors we have tried, this one falls into the middle of the road.  We do not drink more than a cup of coffee in a given day, but some of us do like frou frou coffee now and then.  However, this is not really that type of coffee. I actually prefer my coffee served black, with no sugar, creamer milk, so I am probably a little more biased.  I think this flavor suits my basic taste range for coffee overall, although I've tasted better.
