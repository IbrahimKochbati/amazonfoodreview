I bought 3 lbs on sale for about half off. The thickness and dryness was nearly perfect for how I like my jerky.  The flavor was good however it is loaded with garlic.  I don't mind the flavor of garlic in moderation, but this has so much it sticks with you all day.  I went through one bag and gave away the other two.  If I was a big fan of garlic I would have given it a 4 5 star rating, but since the type was labeled "original" and not "garlic" it was an un welcomed surprise.
