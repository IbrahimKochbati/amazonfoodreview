I have an Old English Sheepdog puppy who was developing inflamed gums and awful dog  eath way younger than he should have been.  I started feeding him these, and within a very short time (weeks?  Maybe even less), the inflammation had gone away and his  eath was much better.  I buy a size smaller than recommended for his size, and that way he can have more than one    it  eaks the treat up.  Since he loves these, I can use them as a reward.  Next box, I'm going to buy an even smaller size so I can divide the treat up even more throughout the day.
