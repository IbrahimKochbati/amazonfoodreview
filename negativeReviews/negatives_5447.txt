Normally, if it's got the word "gourmet" in it, my back stiffens up. It's a label often slapped onto an over priced product to attract the those that will eat drink anything with the word on "gourmet" because they think it makes them look cool and hip. And it usually doesn't taste what I would consider "gourmet." So, I confess, I started reviewing this with a bias against it   high price and labeled "gourmet".          With only a "one pot" sample to work with, I didn't have a chance to try differing  ewing methods. I went with my typical coffee making method, drip  ew. It smelled nice, looked pretty dark. The taste is very hard to explain. While it has a full flavor, that flavor is of...weak coffee. I thought I'd botched the  ew, but when I compared the color and opacity against my normal stuff, the Puroast looked identical. It just tasted like the same near see through stuff one gets at a greasy spoon restaurant, gas station,IHOP, etc. While not vile, it wasn't for me. I prefer a darker, richer taste.          That being said, the big deal about Puroast is that it's low acid. That I will say I definitely noticed. Not even a hint of tummy twisting, even though I intentionally drank it on an empty stomach. For those that have problems with acid, and don't mind (or maybe even like) the taste of weak coffee, it's worth a try at least. Given the price, I'd suggest you get as little as possible to try though.
