My 12 year old daughter and I have just found tea flowers, and wanted to try a tea that wasn't heavy with black tea leaves.  This tea is very refreshing and lovely tasting.  The strawberry flavor is truly delicious without being overpowering.  We did use some honey to sweeten it a bit, but the second cup I drank was unsweetened, and it was nice too.  The flower opened up nicely and was attractive, which is important when you buy tea flowers, as the visual is part of the ceremony.  I would buy this tea flower again, and will.  I recommend this as an afternoon tea with cookies or a morning tea with a light  eakfast.  It won't be strong enough to stand against a heavy meal. It is also good as just a tea without a side at all.
