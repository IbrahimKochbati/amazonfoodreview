We absolutely love this seasoning. I worked years ago in a restaurant, and this is the seasoning they would put on fish, chicken and beef. It adds a lot of flavor, without adding a lot of fat and calories. We use it for veggies, soups, fish, you name it.     We can't seem to keep it in the house, and at approx $5.00 for a small bottle from the market, this large canister is a much better deal. It should last us a good long time.
