I've yet to find any of the dogs I know that love it.  I still have my allergic dog eating it, but she has to be hungry to eat this without doctoring.  My vet doesn't want me feeding her people food so I add some of Newman's or Happy Hips canned to it.          I've talked to a couple of vets about prescription diet and they all push the big company  and names.  The common objection appears to be the soy used in Newman's to increase the protein count.          I am willing to put a little flavor in this to feed may dog high quality, social responsible food.          I may be the only person who has made the following mistake but, assuming you catch the Amazon sales, make sure you are ordering the bag size you want.  I thought I was getting a good price on one order until the food came and it was the seven instead of twelve pound bag.
