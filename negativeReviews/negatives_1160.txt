This product was a big disappointment.  The picture on the box is misleading.  These bars aren't chunky, the dough isn't flaky (more like cardboardy), they aren't filled with pieces of fruit, and if you didn't read the label (which claims about 30 items down the ingredient list that "yogurt powder" is added), you wouldn't have any idea you were eating yogurt at all.  The bars probably contain MSGs, with all of the "natural flavorings," etc.  Whatever calcium and other vitamins might be present have probably been added in what the ingredients list calls a "vitamin blend"    there's too little food in the bar to give you much nutrition, anyway.  The experience is very much like eating a long, thin fig bar    only not as tasty.  The fig bars I buy at my neighborhood grocery contain sugar, but also real fruit, whole wheat, no MSGs, and no trans fats. I'd rather eat one of them. I won't be purchasing this product again.
