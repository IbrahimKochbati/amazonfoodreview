I took a chance seeing the variation experienced by others.  The shipment that we received has such a minimal taste of cinnamon that I wouldn't say they're cinnamon if given a sample.  We opened each of the packs to see if any were a strong cinnamon taste but no luck.  I definitely won't reorder these.
