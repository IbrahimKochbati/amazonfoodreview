OMG These taste so fantastic! They are dark, dark chocolate and sweetened with organic maple syrup which is one of my favorite sweeteners; maple syrup is not raw but very nutritious for a sweetener and is probably one of my favorites second only to fresh stevia grown in my garden. This product has raw oils and was dehydrated on low termperatures. It is certified gluten free, certified vegan, and has no refined sugar or emulsifiers. Whole Paycheck sells these for $7 2 or $3.50each so I'll buy them there until Amazon can offer a better price. The big downside to Merry's Choco Macaroons (Pack of 8) is that I can not eat just one they are sooooooooooooooo delish!
