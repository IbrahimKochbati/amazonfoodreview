I usually hate the taste of prepackaged cookies but these were amazingly yummy. I got the chocolate lovers cookies and they were LOADED with chocolate chips and chunks. In my opinion these easily rivaled store bought unbaked cookie dough cookies once they've been baked and cooled when it came to taste and texture. I loved them and will be buying them on a regular basis.          The Keebler elves really got their act together with these cookies. These are WAY better than Chips Ahoy by a long shot.
