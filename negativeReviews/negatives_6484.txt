Lindt Lindor Truffles are one of my favorite chocolate candies and I buy them often.  I thought it would be great to have a larger quantity on hand. But the box of 60 that I received from Amazon was evidently not stored properly. The truffles arrived quickly but in bad shape   almost every one is misshapen (dented, flattened) and almost every one has chocolate on the outside of the wrapper, indicating that they melted sometime. They're unattractive and a mess to eat because of this. They also don't have that characteristic Lindt "snap" of the shell; it's like one big, misshapen, sticky lump of chocolate instead of the usual truffle   again, I believe this indicates that they melted during storage. I'm very disappointed and will not be ordering these from Amazon again.
