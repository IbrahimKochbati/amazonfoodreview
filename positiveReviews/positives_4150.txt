This is the best Cajun spice my wife and I have found anywhere, ever.  We have been using it for more than ten years.  It goes great on all sorts of things    chicken, beef, pork, fish, eggs (hard boiled, scrambled, or fried), baked potato, etc.  Not only is it a very good combination of spices, it is also ground fine and mixed well.  Whenever we fry something in batter or  eading, Luzianne's Cajun Seasoning usually finds its way into the mix.          We've tried "Slap Ya Momma" and other cajun spices, but those tend to be too coarse.  Instead of tasting a blend of spices, you tend to bite down on a nugget of salt, filling your mouth with the taste of salt, then a nugget of pepper, filling your mouth with the taste of pepper, etc.  Luzianne's is definitely the superior implementation.          We recently ran out of it, and to our dismay Safeway has stopped carrying this product, which is why we have tried other  ands.  None have measured up, which is why I was searching for it online.  We're very happy to have found it again on Amazon.
