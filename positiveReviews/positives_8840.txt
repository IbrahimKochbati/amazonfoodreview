I ordered this product as my previous paprika supply was nearing exhaustion.  My previous supply was the same  and and also in the 18 ounce package.  For some reason these large containers are no longer available in my local grocery stores so I turned to the internet for help.  To date I have not used any of this paprika but well when my current supply of homemade BBQ sauce is exhausted.          I had not previously purchased from this supplier however the shipment delivery was prompt and it was well packaged.  I am very satisfied with the supplier and would not hesitate to purchase from them again.
