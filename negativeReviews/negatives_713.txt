These  ownies bake up very nicely.  I would call their consistency "cake like".  However my husband called them Healthy Brownies.  He said he could taste the flax seed.  I tend to agree.  In my opinion, if I'm going to eat chocolate, I don't want it to have that "healthy" taste.  On the other hand I love the Blueberry Muffins that Hodgson Mill makes.
