Having just successfully grown two kinds of seeds, using the same technique, these immediately mildewed. They came with no instructions, except to look on the Web. On his site it said instructions are expensive, and would be posted in a few days. I.e., there are no instructions for this mix as far as I could see. I have news for you Todd, in the last company I worked with we provided BOTH written instructions with the product and a Web site. Instructions are for a customer's convenience, not yours, Todd, and are not omitted so that you can save a few cents.
