My dog enjoys these treats in moderation.  Because they are dried, he seems to enjoy them less the more he eats them.  With water, the treats may be much more flavorful.  After having a fair amount, he starts to lose interest in them until he can drink.          This  ings me to a question regarding serving size.  The container recommends 2 3 cubes per day for a medium  eed.  The issue I'm having is that the size of the cubes is so very inconsistent.  Some bits are the size of a pea while others of a grape.  The rest are a variety of sizes in between.  Some consistency would be preferred.          Also, this product comes highly recommended for training because it is low in fat.  My dog certainly won't learn anything with just 2 3 of these per day.  Like most dogs, he is highly motivated by food so 20 30 treats is more accurate.  To make this possible, I have to dice them up into smaller pieces or shift through to find the little bits.          At least these treats are natural and thus healthier than some of the other options.  I just didn't expect to have to prepare them first.
