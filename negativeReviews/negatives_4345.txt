I bought this product thinking it would be a great substitute for lemon peel  . I also wanted to save time from grating lemons . I put the product in lukewarm water to reconstitute it . It smelled like chemicals and tasted even worse . I make lemon  ead to give as gifts ,this product was totally unacceptable to put in my  ead.
