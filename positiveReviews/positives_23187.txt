For the first time in almost 5 years since my mother was diagnosed with Celiac Disease, she looks forward to  eakfast.  She had become so discouraged with the Gluten Free Breads available that she didn't even want to try this one.  Finally, she can eat  ead that actually tastes like real  ead and toasts like real  ead.  I give it 4 stars only because Mom says that it still is missing the air pockets in regular  ead.  It freezes great.  Thank you Pamela for letting my mother enjoy  ead once again.
