It is hard to describe what these bars actually are.  First I am always on the look out for a candy bar that has nuts, no chocolate and is not sickeningly sweet.  TA DA!  Enter the KIND BAR company.  These work as  candy bars.  YUMMY.  These work as a nice under 200 calorie snack to tide you over in between meals.  These definitely are nutrition bars.  Packed with good natural ingredients, these bars are great to keep in your desk or pop into your purse for any emergency hunger attacks.
