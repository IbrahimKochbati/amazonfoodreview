This drink was sickeningly sweet (and I am a Mountain Dew addict, so I usually have no problem with sweet).  It was much like drinking snow cone flavoring straight from the bottle.  While it is all natural with no added sugar, it still has 140 calories in an 8.3 oz can.  A 16 oz can of Mountain Dew has 170 calories.  Definitely not a "diet" drink.  The only way I would recommend it is to keep away from high fructose corn syrup, but even then, at the price, it almost too expensive of an option.
