makes excellent yogurt. after several tries, my directions are one bag per liter of milk (best to use whole milk), and let it be 18 24h to get solid yogurt. the yogurt is a bit more acid than I would like, but I think that can be still optimized.          remember to use highest quality of milk. I tried once with cheap milk and the yogurt tasted terrible.
