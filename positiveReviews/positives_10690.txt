We have a little Pekinese Shitzu mix, mixed with something else too but we're not sure what. My dog is a bit of a finicky eater there are dog biscuits that's she's refused to eat and dog food that she's raised her nose at. But she really likes these treats, she had a couple then sat by her snack drawer until she got another one. Yes, we spoil her but good healthy treats like these are much better then most of those name products that you get in a grocery store.     Two woofs!
