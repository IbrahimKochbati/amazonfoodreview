I bought this  and of French Vanilla creamer because it was cheaper than my usual  and (Coffee Mate French Vanilla Single Serve Creamers) but, I don't think I'll buy these again unless there's a significant difference in price. In comparison to the Coffee Mate (in my opinion) the French Vanilla flavor feels more artificial and has a very slight aftertaste....nothing too bothersome though. Overall, it is still a good creamer, I just prefer the Coffee Mate version. However, for the hazelnut flavor, I do prefer the International Delight version over all everything else.     As for the packaging, like the other reviewers, there seemed to have been a leak in one of the cups and so a few of them were sticky and had a crust like thing on them. But for me, it wasn't a big mess (it really did seem like just ONE cup leaked) and so it wasn't a big deal for me.
