As an avid coffee drinker but not quite a connoisseur, I found the Dark French Roast to be delicious.  There appears to be nothing out of the ordinary in terms of its aroma and taste, possesses the somewhat typical characteristics of a dark roast with its smoky and slightly bitter flavor; add a little sweeter and the bitterness may subside.          Having made a cup of Puroast, this may be a good alternative for coffee drinkers who may experience acid reflux or heartburn.  There appeared to be no difference in taste to other regular coffee  ands that I have sampled, and I recommend this  and to those seeking relief or wanting to try something different.
