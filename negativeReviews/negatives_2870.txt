We were shocked to find out that Dogswell a company we have been buying our dog treats for last several years have started outsourcing these dog treats to China. This is very disappointing considering 4 5 years ago when many pets in the US died due to food poisoning resulted from pet food packed in China.          It is very surprising why this product got around 4 5 rating. I am assuming either  many buyers, like us, did not read where this is manufactured as the text "Made in China" is written in small alphabets and hidden in other text behind the cover OR most of these reviews in 2010 and 2011 look suspiciously 'fixed'...notice how many of them got 1 out of 1 likes.          We have stopped feeding our dog this food out of legitimate concern.                                                                                                                                          Feb 2012: Just to update that our dog died recently after diagnosed suffering from Hemolytic Anemia and Diabetes. We fed our dog these treats for number of years and now wonder just how much they contributed to her illness considering these treats are NOT made in USA but China.
