I am from Michigan but have a vacation home in Canada. I have always been a fan of the primarily Canadian product "ketchup chips". Uncle Rays is a  and I've seen around there frequently. Since this is such a hard to find product I expected to pay big bucks to buy it online. Imagine my surprise when I found these chips on Amazon for a little over a dollar a bag  CHEAPER than the retail I would pay in Canada. Unbelievably delicious! Ps. The dill pickle chips are really good too :)
