Since getting my Keurig machine I have been experimenting with variety of K cups.  I didn't get this on amazon but caught it on sale at the local market.  It's a good basic cup of coffee.  While trying to figure out flavor preferences (with things like caramel, blueberry, etc.) it's nice to have a basic that you can rely on.  Some of the flavors aren't strong enough and some of the other  ands or roasts are way too strong.  Nantucket blend is a happy medium.
