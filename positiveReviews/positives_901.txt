These are the best canned tomatoes I have tasted. They have a fresh flavor, similar to home canned. This is my second time buying a set. They are a little more acidic  ight, and have a rounder flavor than other tomatoes. Comes with a basil leaf in each can. Note, the 28 oz tins are a better value than the 14 oz ones.
