It's classic Chef Boyardee ravioli, just stuffed with a very decent mild sausage instead of the beef we're all used to.  It also has chunks of the same sausage, exactly like boxed pizza toppings, mixed in with the sauce.  All in all, it's a great quickie lunch as is or a very decent dinner when prepared with the right sides.  A trick I learned as a youth when eating the classic ravioli for lunch most days, mix in a single slice of good quality American or Swiss sandwich cheese and carefully stir it into the sauce as it melts.  It adds another level of creaminess to the sauce and it makes it "done".  Serve it with some crusty  ead.
