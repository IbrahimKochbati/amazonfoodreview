I grew up in an exclusively diet cola home.  I got to nearly hate diet soda... uhg..  Even now, I would rather drink water to "real" OR diet soda.  I loved to sneak sugary grape soda as a child, however.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think diet grape soda even existed when I was a youngster.          This stuff takes me back to the forbidden treat of my past.  It even smells the same.  If you grew up, like me, loving grape soda, try this product.  You won't be disappointed!
