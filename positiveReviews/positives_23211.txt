We have tried several gluten free packaged  ead and  ead mixes. All the packaged  eads taste like cardboard this mix actually has the consistency of sandwich  ead. We use it for sandwiches and to make garlic  ead when we have gluten free spaghetti( ush melted butter with garlic powder on one side at a time and  own in a frying pan).
