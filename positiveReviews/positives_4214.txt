We just started using these and my 7 month old daughter really likes them. I've tried a couple of bites and they are tasty with good flavor combinations. I love that they are organic. My only complaint not specifically related to the product is that when I got mine in the mail, one of the jars was  oken and I had to clean the food off of the other bottles.
