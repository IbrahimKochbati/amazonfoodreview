This chili is pretty good, seems to have a slight tomato taste to it which actually works well.          Unfortunatly, it tries to fake it like it has ground beef, which makes it sort of strange to get used to.  If you know what i'm talking about here and are ok with that, I'd guess this is something you would enjoy.
