While I'm a big coffee drinker, I'm no fan of Starbucks in home  ews. That being said, I work at a firm where they order Starbucks' French and Breakfast blends, but I order in my own instant NesCafe Clasico. I ordered Puroast's this time, but it tastes the same as the bitter ones, seems a bit acidic for being "Low Acid," and leaves a bitter aftertaste.          I actually had to mix it in with some creamers (Coffeemate's French and regular). To me, it's as though I were drinking Starbucks' versions, so I see no difference.
