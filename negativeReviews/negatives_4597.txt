Olive oil in large bold print on the front of the bag is misleading!!  Olive oil is NOT the main oil the chips are cooked in.  The product has more sunflower, corn and canola oils than it does olive oil!! The ingredients are NOT listed in the description.  I should have known better.     There are other, much better "Olive Oil" potato chips on the market that use ONLY olive oil. I was quite disappointed in this  and.
