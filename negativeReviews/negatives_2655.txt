These almonds had an unbelievable amount of salt on them. I love salt but this was over the top. I've bought this  and from other stores and they have never been this salty.  Maybe the machine went wacko when processing these. ???     I can't eat these unless I take the time to try and wipe off the salt, which talks forever!!
