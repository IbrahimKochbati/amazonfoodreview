These are tasty enough.  Indeed, if you mix in a tablespoon of raspberry jam or a half teaspoon of cinnamon, these are QUITE tasty.  But they have no cohesion.  We try to cut them, and they crumble in the pan.  I know gluten free baked goods tend to be more crumbly than the conventional stuff, but we made Betty Crocker, and they held together just fine.  As tasty as these are, I can't arrange them on a platter and serve them to my friends.  So I'll stick with Betty for a while, but thanks anyway.
