Over the years I have tried making iced tea out of dozens of different herbal teas and most just end up tasting like lightly flavored water.  This Yogi Sweet Thai Delight tea is the first I've tried that I will make again.  As a matter of fact, I intend to have a jug of it in the refrigerator all summer!  The taste is amazingly sweet (but not in a sugary way) and a little nutty (actually "coconut ty.")  I don't use sweeteners or milk in my tea as a rule, but even if I did I wouldn't want to add sugar to this tea, it's perfectly sweet as it is.          Since there's no recipe for iced tea on the box, I just winged it and put 8 tea bags into a gallon of boiling water, then turned it down and let it steep covered for about twenty minutes.  You could probably also make it the way my Mom made tea in the summer, by putting the bags in a gallon jar, adding room temperature water, sealing it and setting it in the sunniest place in the yard for the day.          However you make it, you really should try this tea iced.  I'm not a huge tea drinker normally, but I'm completely hooked on this one.
