Not only is this a convenient, less messy way for me to incorporate peanut butter in my diet...it's absolutely delicious. I use it yogurt parfaits, on fruit, in smoothies.          And I love that it's lower in fat and sugar than traditional peanut butter. So glad I found this, don't think I'll ever go back to the other stuff.
