Did not meet expectations.  I really, really love tea. Even when using 2 bags, there was very little chocolate flavor, if any at all.  The Hot Cinnamon Spice and the Earl Grey Supreme is a different story. I've tried most of the H&S teas, most of which are wonderful. This is among my least favorites as I enjoy most of their varieties however this one was disappointing. If you ever try the Green tea with coconut you must add honey and lemon and WOW major flavor explosion...without those condiments its very mild. Just a tip.
