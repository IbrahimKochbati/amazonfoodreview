I am set on my favorite cereal now for as long as Amazon offers the subscribe and save deal, can't beat that.  I used to not eat Lucky Charms that often because my local grocery stores charge$6 a box for it.  So I get 3 boxes (same size) for almost the price of one), not sure how Amazon does it, but I love Amazon.
