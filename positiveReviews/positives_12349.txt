I bought these for my 2008 Oktoberfest and because I was in beautiful Munich, Bamberg, and Nuernberg in Fe uary of 2008 and had plenty of these little Ritter Sport jewels.  You can find these packages of mini Ritters all over Germany they are so popular, but I have only seen their larger individually wrapped cousins here on the shelves.  As with any variety pack, you get much more of a choice of experiences  some old, some new.  I think the biggest advantage to ordering this package was that I got to try so many of the Ritter Sports that I had not ever tried before.  The only disadvantage I can think of is that the chocolates were not as fresh, of course, as they are in Deutschland.  But I guess you'll have to go there to know what I mean!
