I've been using these for my puppy with training and he absolutely loves them.          The only inconvenience I find is that, while each piece varies greatly in size, they are pretty large.  So, I cut them up into pieces appropriate to the size practical for training.  Each time he gets one it is just a little piece, and that works great.          Since I do cut them up, I don't find these to be expensive at all because they really go a long way.          The other important thing is the list of ingredients.  They are not full of junk.  In fact, there is NO junk in them.  Just beef liver.  I like that, as I really try to know that I'm giving him good quality foods and treats.
