Coombs Family Farms grade B maple syrup is our favorite maple syrup. It has a more intense maple flavor than grade A, in our opinion. We use it in recipes such as  oiled salmon, stir fried foods, cookie recipes, and homemade ice cream. Compared to the grocery store prices, Coombs Family Farms maple syrup is a bargain even with shipping costs. And it comes in cute little jugs that pour neatly.
