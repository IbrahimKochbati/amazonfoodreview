This specific Ghee product has a wonderful flavor!  It is great added to scrambled eggs and makes for the best popcorn (along with powdered sea salt).  Add a couple of spoonfuls to a saut&eacute; pan and try lightly  owning asparagus tips!  Very convenient to use... Just keep the jar handy... does not have to be refrigerated.  I bought two jars, for free shipping!
