I'm a self proclaimed popcorn junkie, so when I saw this "Real Theater" popcorn, I knew it would be the perfect compliment to my Whirley Pop.          Not so, unfortunately.  Yes, the product is well packaged and easy to pop.  And yes, almost 100% of the kernels do pop.  Sadly, this ease of use and good popping characteristics don't add up to great tasting popcorn.  It's hard to articulate what is "bad" about this popcorn, and perhaps it comes down to personal preference.          For one, the aroma of this popcorn is simply not pleasing.  It certainly does smell when it's cooking, but I wouldn't associate the smell with movie theater popcorn.  It's a sort of sickly, sweet smell that sticks to the back of your throat.  It's also a smell that lingers in your house for hours after cooking this popcorn.          The finished product isn't much better.  The popped corn is very yellow, I suppose to give the impression of "real" butter.  The taste, however, is not what I'd call butter.  The best way I could put it would be "artificial" and "thick".  "Thick", as in, a thick taste that sticks in your mouth and leaves a funky aftertaste.  The end result is a chemically, over processed taste.  Now, granted, I don't frequent "real theaters" but about once every decade, so it's possible this is what passes as popcorn these days.  Personally, I think you can achieve much better results with your Whirley Pop using one of the many *real* popping corns available on this site, and then adding your own *real* butter, to your taste.
