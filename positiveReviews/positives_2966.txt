My mom has the Hamilton Beach single cup coffee maker and was using Senseo pods in it. They were too strong   bitter for her and I was searching for something else.  Found these and Wolfgang Puck's and decided to get both for her.  These Melitta Breakfast Blend pods are her favorite! She says they have a smooth taste and great flavor. Granted, neither of us would ever be mistaken for a coffee judge by anyone (I don't even drink coffee so my opinion means nothing), but she really likes these and is happy to have them.
