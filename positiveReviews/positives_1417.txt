I picked up a few bags of these at my local HEB and couldnt help but consume half of a bag in a day. The entire stock didnt last even a week for me.          Many chips say they have a bold flavor but they never deliver. These, however, do. I tried the Garlic Parmessan chips and the first things I thought was how strong and delicious the parmessan was.. shortly followed by a garlic flavor. Combined with a sharp crunch, I cannot have enough of these chips. I'm almost afraid to buy a 24 pack because I know they won't last a month.          It also helps that these things are pretty healthy for you. I mean, they are a potato crisp so you can't be entirely guilt free... but I don't knock myself for going to town. I just avoid the potato chip aisle these are on when I need to lay low on the snack foods ;)
