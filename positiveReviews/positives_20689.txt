I ordered these not knowing how good or bad they really were. They are amazing, incredible, delicious, and pretty good as well. The amaretto is injected by needle into two distinct bands that run the length of the cake, so the distribution is even and balanced. The cake itself is very good, reminiscent of a handmade pound cake of many years ago, before that horrible mess the grocery stores sell as 'pound cake' became the norm. Excellent flavor, texture, and moistness. Recommended without hesitation, UNLESS you are on a diet, in which case ordering this is akin to total surrender.
