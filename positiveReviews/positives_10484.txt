I am not sure how to review tea, I don't know the vocabulary and I'm no expert but I have long been a fan of the Genmai Cha after marrying into a Japanese family. I prefer the loose product over the bags but for convenience I choose to try to the bags, I'm happy with it. If you are careful to not boil the water or let the tea steep too long it will not disappoint you.
