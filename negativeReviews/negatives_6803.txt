I recently purchased this popcorn and less than half of the popcorn popped.  And those that did pop were tough. I believe these were old.  I've purchased other  ands and they all have an expiration date printed on back each pack.  These had no expiration dates printed, therefore there was no way of knowing how old these were or how long they have been in their stock. I popped the jolly time  and and it popped perfectly.  I also find that this is on the list of things that can't be returned per Amazon.com policy.  I'm going to purchase the Jolly time popcorn at Smart & Finals. Cheaper and there fresh!!!  What a rip off!!!
