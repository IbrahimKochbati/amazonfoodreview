I highly recommend these chews for your dog. They do exactly what they say that they will do; freshen your dog's  eath!          I found them to be significantly cheaper to buy them at Amazon compared to the chain pet stores; at least $10 cheaper as of Sept. 2011.          I have read that some dogs do not chew them well enough and have choked. I have not had that happen to my dog but it is probably something you need to take into consideration.          My advice is to buy a smaller bag at a pet store first and see if they work for your animal. Then come back and buy them here!
