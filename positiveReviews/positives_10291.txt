These are flexible but also sturdy. I liked it so much in using to freeze portions of baby food, I picked up another. It is great to make your portions and then throw this in the freezer. Once frozen I pop out the portions with ease and bag them for later use. If there is anything you need to freeze (such as portions of stock, or soup) these are perfect for that. A great multi use product.
