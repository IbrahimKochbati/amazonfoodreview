This is the second purchase of Kettle Potato Chips and we love them just as much as the first time we tried them. We bought them by the a carton of 24 bags. The Kettle chips were in a 2oz bag which is just enough for a single size serving snack or with a meal. The chips are so delicious, baked not fried and lightly salted with Sea Salt. They have 0 fat, no preservatives, nothing artificial and they only use real food ingredients. What more could you ask for in a great tasting chip!
