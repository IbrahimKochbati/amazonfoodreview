This sprouter is awesome. Its small and inconspicuous, works very effectively and is extremely easy to use. I tend to forget about my sprouts on day two, so far i have only sprouted various beans and wheat berries, some cashews and sunflower seeds. I have tried quinoa, and the quinoa is so small it just got stuck in the holes of the sprouter. Other than that, this is an awesome little system. I have sprouted in jars and this is more convenient. I like that I can add onto it when I get more adventurous with my sprouting, and that this is still small enough to take camping.
