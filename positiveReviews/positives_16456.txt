My dog really enjoys these as a daily treat. However, until she has her next physical I really can't evaluate these properly. I will try to remember to update after her physical so I can report back if her tartar build up has been reduced or eliminated. Our vet said they work IF your dog chews them slowly. Our dog goes through them pretty fast, so I am not sure if they are going to be effective. We decided to give them a year and see what happens.
