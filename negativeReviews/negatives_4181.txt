This tea was a major disappointment. I had been used to drinking the Assam from Teaism in DC and was looking forward to buying this variety of Assam in bulk to save money but it ended up being a waste of money. There is no flavor no matter how long you steep it or how much you use. It gets two stars because it does not taste bad, there just is no taste.
