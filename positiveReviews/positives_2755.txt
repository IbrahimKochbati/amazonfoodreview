My husband refuses to eat fish, but he LOVES this. It only takes 10 12 minutes to make, and is way better than any other kind of Tuna Helper I've tried.          Besides the box itself, you'll need:             1 can of tuna (6 oz., or I use 8 oz.)        1 tablespoon of butter        1 cup of milk          It's a  eeze to prepare, just DON'T leave it alone before you put the tuna and pasta in. Because of the milk, it likes to boil over. Just keep an eye on it and reduce the heat right after it starts boiling.
