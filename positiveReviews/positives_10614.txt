I bought a small bottle in Chapel Hill, NC, but didn't pop it open for a taste until I got to VA.  Big mistake!  It was so good and it was too late to backtrack.  Then my 3 young men got hold of it.  All gone.     It's hard to believe how flavorful this sauce is.  The sweet potatoes and peppers give it a rich potency that is worthy of a thousand recipes.  I love hot  sauce, but I would gladly use this in foods for people who don't share that taste.     Cackalacky is a place where all tongues may come together in mutual cele ation.
