This is a great tasting coffee   just so you'll know what I usually drink for a "taste" comparison, I've usually drink the Donut Shop coffee and Emeril's Big Easy Bold.  This one has a taste somewhere in between, and is nice and smooth.  No bad after taste that lingers long after you've had your cup.  I actually like this version of Folgers vs. the Black Silk KCup you can also purchase here on Amazon.          One thing to look out for on these, and all KCup coffee sold here on Amazon, is to carefully check the cost per cup by taking the total price and dividing by the number of cups you get.  The pricing for this variety seems to be fairly dynamic, and many times the large packages like this 80 count package may cost more per cup than the ones with a smaller number of servings.  Then, the next time you're ready to order, the pricing for all has changed and you're going through the math again.
