I bought this based on my liking chai tea and the other reviews. Although it is not caffeine free, (I am not sure why amazon has it listed as 99% caffeine free, because it says it contains 65mg per 8oz serving right on the can) it is very good and on a cold morning, it is great to sit and sip. Just boil some water and add a scoop to your cup, it is rich and satisfying! I offer this to all my guests and get great response! I have tried other  ands and this is one of the best.
