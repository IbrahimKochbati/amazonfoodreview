I bought this for my one year old sheltie for Christmas and he LOVES it.  I put the Premier buddy berrys inside and they work quite well, as he can smell them through the holes in the toy. He's learned to stand it up and knock it over to get the treats to come out.  It's his new favorite toy and he drags it around everywhere.  It keeps him occupied for quite a while.
