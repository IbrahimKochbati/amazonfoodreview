I was SO excited to have found tea that tastes like aveda tea without the price. Based on the high reviews, I figured I would give this tea a try... I just received this tea and it tastes NOTHING like Aveda tea. It does not that that great licorice after taste that makes you want to have another sip like Aveda tea. This tea also has cinnamon which is not in the Aveda tea at all. Overall, I would NOT recommend this tea to anyone who is looking for Aveda tea. It is very minty and has cinnamon in it.
