My two year old Havapoo (half Havanese, half Poodle) loves this toy! She is food motivated and she is smart so I thought this would be a good challenge for her. It took her five minutes to figure out how to remove the yellow cup. In the beginning, she was pawing at it. Finally she figured out a way to remove the cup with her mouth. Within ten minutes she was able to find all the hidden treats. After this exercise, she was a bit tired from all the mental stimulation, she took a nap for a couple hours. LOL. It was just the right level of difficulty for her. There was a tiny bit of frustration but any more frustration, she would have given up. Now, this is the only way she has dinner. She is getting more and more efficient at removing the cups. I didn't know if this would be too big for her mouth, but she has no problems. This is a great toy and a fun way to keep your dog stimulated and active.
