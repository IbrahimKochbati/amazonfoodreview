These look good, and while they are soft, they were not very flavorful.  My wife who really loves chocolate, gave these a B , and would not buy them again.  Each cookie is sealed in a separate package, the package was easy to open, and each cookie is about 3 1 4 inches in diameter     a good size for a cookie, but huge, but not too small.  See the pictures above (I scanned in the Nutrition facts for these, and I've scanned in a picture of one cookie in it's package (6 cookies come in a box of these).
