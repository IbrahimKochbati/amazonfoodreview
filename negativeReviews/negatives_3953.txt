I saw that some folks had problems with damaged cans but many more gave good reviews so I took the risk.  Turns out that 5 out of the 12 cans were dented...and I mean severely dented.  And those were all packed in the center of the shrink wrapped flat so as to hide the dents unless the can was unpacked.  I haven't tried the good product; I'm sure it's fine tasting since I like Chef Boyardee products.  I am very disappointed in Amazon's attempt to hide the damaged cans though.  There is no way those cans were damaged in shipping...the box was perfect.  This was deliberate concealment of damaged goods.
