This makes a good pot of decaf.  Nothing remarkable   we have served this to many guests to no comments.  Nobody asked us what it was, but nobody spit it out, either : ).  It is smooth and not too strong, which is our preference.  We wouldn't hesitate to buy it again, but wouldn't go out of our way either.
