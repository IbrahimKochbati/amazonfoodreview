I am a true coffee lover  and it is my favorite beverage morning or night.  I enjoy  ewing coffee at home and buy a variety of  ands in varying price points.  After reading the description of the Melitta Cafe Collection I was excited to  ew it.  I was extremely disappointed by how stale the coffee smelled when I opened the bag and was not impressed by the flavor after I  ewed it.  It tasted like a pouch of hotel coffee, no flavor, stale and bad aroma.  The packaging looks upscale and is a great price but unfortunately the coffee was not good, I had to throw it away.
