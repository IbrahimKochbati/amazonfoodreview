This is one of the most popular flavors of drink mix around this house. It has good flavor and is quick and easy to make. I like the new packaging much better. And shopping here on Amazon is great as it is cheaper than Crystal Light at Walmart, but not cheaper than the GV  and (which is probably the same stuff).
