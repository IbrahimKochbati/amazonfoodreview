According to my pups' discerning palates, "Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Fish Formula Dog Treats" are the only ones they've tried, that they'll sit up and beg for more!  Since both of the pups are only fed GRAIN FREE diets, I was determined to find a comparable biscuit treat formula that would not interfere with the benefits they've enjoyed since becoming members of the high protein, low carb community.  Viola! This superior dog biscuit recipe contains only 7 primary ingredients and when you open the bag, the aroma of smoked salmon lets them know to come a'runnin!  Now, they're eager to try the other flavor combos created by Dick Van Patten's company.  Thanks to the Van Patten company of dog lovers who want only the best nutrition and taste for their canine companions.  Applause!
