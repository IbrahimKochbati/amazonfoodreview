Most of the time, you want crackers because you want to get the dip or whatever topping into your mouth! With these, you can have those snacks again without having to worry about the calorie content of your crackers!          They're only 17 calories a slice, and each slice is about the size of a 3 x 5 notecard. They're delicate and have a nice easy "crunch." These ones in particular have a lower sodium content as well, versus the pesto and garlic ones (they're a bit higher in sodium content, over 200 mg per 3 slices).          It's an excellent addition, no matter what diet you are on...or if you're not even on a diet! I  ing them to parties and everyone always asks what they are and where can they get them.
