These are really good and very convenient. This is probably my favorite flavor. Not too sweet and doesn't have aftertaste. These packets are really convenient. I carry them everywhere. On my pocket, backpack and car. I try to have them everywhere I can to prevent drinking soda. So far so good. These were recommended from my nutritionist. I had a bad soda habit. I would drink way too much soda in one day. She recommended to drink lots of water but if I had an urge to drink something sweet then to drink a crystal light drink. I haven't had a soda for a few months now. Now I drink lots of water and have about one to two of these packets everyday.
