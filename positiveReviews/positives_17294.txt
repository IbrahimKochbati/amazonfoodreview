Bein an avid Pho indulger I had to try Annie Chun's version. I'm in the middle of no where, no local Pho restaurants here.          Being freeze dried and not fresh I have to say it came a little close to the smell and taste of authentic pho. It was however missing the thin strips of steak, all the veggies, and of course the fresh noodles. It definitely quenched my desire for Pho. I would buy this again in a heartbeat. It's a good substitute, but would never truly be the real deal. I say go for it!
