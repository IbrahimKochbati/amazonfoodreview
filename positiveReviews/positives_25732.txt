Quaker Oatmeal cookies are very tastey.  They make an easy snack for at work because they are individually wrapped so I can put it my bag. The cookie itself is soft, with nice bits of nuts and chocolate.  They are a little dry by themselves, but they are perfect with some milk.          These are a no  ainer: a good cookie, individually wrapped for on the go living.
