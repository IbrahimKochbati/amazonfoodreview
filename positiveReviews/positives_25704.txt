I purchased because I like  an muffins and have been unable to buy them locally since they're available only some of the time. Easy recipe on the bag with few additional ingredients needed. I prefer to add some apple sauce to provide additional moisture and a few raisins for texture and flavor. Further (independent) research on the product reveals that this product is very healthy in that it contains whole grains and unbleached flower. I prefer to sweeten with Agave Nectar which is also billed as a healthy choice. I like it because it tastes good...
