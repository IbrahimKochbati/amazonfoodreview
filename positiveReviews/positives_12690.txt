Not only are these very hard to find in the states, it is nearly impossible to find any sort of coconut creme cookie in any major supermarket. So if you like this taste, good luck.  Let me know if you find another one; until then I will buy these from Amazon.  Thanks, guys.  :)          They remind me a lot of a cookie that was around when I was a kid in the late 60s   early 70s.  They were square and they were called Orbits.
