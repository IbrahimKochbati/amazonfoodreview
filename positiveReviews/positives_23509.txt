Nice seeds. Didn't give it 5 stars only because there were too many shells in each bag, which gets to be a pain. However, the price and wonderful taste of the seeds make the shells tolerable.          Oh, if you're used to getting refrigerated, bulk, raw sunflower seeds, these are different. Since they aren't refrigerated, they are drier. I eat these like they are, but they're really good if soaked in water or other liquid for a couple of hours or so (I do this when cooking or baking with them.) The seeds are easier to digest when they're soaked anyway.
