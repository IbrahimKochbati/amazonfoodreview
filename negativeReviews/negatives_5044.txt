I don't know.  Maybe I'm just not putting the right "yummy goodness" inside.  This toy, though durable and a novel idea, doesn't hold either of my dogs' interest.  Not even our beagle (who tells everyone she's STARVING and we NEVER feed her... EVER!) seems to be interested in this for any length of time.
