A gift basket should be a fun indulgence; something one usually would not purchase for oneself but would be happy to receive or give to another.  This basket might fill the bill for one whose tastes run towards the familiar and comforting rather than the exotic or gourmet and who doesn't object to artificial ingredients. This is the kind of basket one might give a boss, a client, or someone who might be appreciated but is not a close friend.          The product selection is not likely to offend an omnivore, is ordinary enough to not send any unintended messages, and is nicely packaged.  Of course, Amazon Prime sweetens the deal with the added convenience of free 2 day or $3.99 next day shipping. It is truly a nearly effortless last minute gift.  It gets 3 stars because the product selection is just a bit too ordinary for my tastes and the quality of the items is not on a par with the price (no real gourmet items). For a description of what was in my basket, read on.  As you'll see, the products are mainly from the USA.  I was suprised there was only one product from Europe and nothing at all from Spain or Italy.          Basket Contents          1 3.5 oz. box of Water Wheel Fine Wafer Crackers (Tuscan).
