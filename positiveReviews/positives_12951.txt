Switch certainly lives up to its name   it is definitely a switch from your normal drinks. Packaged like an energy drink, the Kiwi Berry Switch almost has the texture of a soda, and almost tastes like a sweetened fruit juice. Its a little of both, and actually manages to pull it off.          Some people might find the drink a bit too sweet, but I found that the excessive sweetness wasn't accompanied by a lingering aftertaste, or a sticky, sugary residue that just makes you thirstier. It actually is quite refreshing, which is remarkable for a drink which almost tastes like liquid candy.          The kiwi part of this kiwi berry drink it almost nonexistent, but the berry flavor almost makes you forget this. The size of the can is the perfect portion size for a drink of this nature; you wouldn't want to drink too much of this in one sitting. But the serving size is perfect for a taste of something sweet and refreshing.
