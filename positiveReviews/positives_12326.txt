I was out of town when I purchased this item. I can purchase the 4 pak at Wal Mart for $1.48 but it's never in stock. That is all my cats will eat so I just purchased it on Amazon cause I've always saved, especially for free shipping. I paid $30.11 for the 12 4 paks. This is the one time I didn't save, in fact it was outrageous what I paid on Amazon. I will continue to shop Amazon but I need to be more careful.
