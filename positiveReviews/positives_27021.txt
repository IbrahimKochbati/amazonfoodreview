Decafs can be so Blah!  Not Lavazza. I love the aroma and taste of coffee, particularly after a meal. I have tried many products and this one is such a favorite at my home that I signed up for delivery every few months.  There are three bags in each order, so the price is certainly a bargain and the flavor is rich, so no need to use large amounts. The whole beans are our favorite.
