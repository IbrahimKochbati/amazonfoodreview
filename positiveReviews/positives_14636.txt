I've been using another type of ant gel for a couple of years now.          It worked OK, but it has some less than desirable qualities that are improved on by this product.          First the Hot Shot really attracts the ants much better.  Secondly that it works much much faster.  Before I'd put the bait down and have to wait a day or two to really see the results.  NOT SO WITH THE HOT SHOT!!  Put the bait across the ant line and the ants go for it right away and in a few minutes to a half hour or so the infestation is dramatically reduced.          This clear gel is much thicker than the Combat product.  A small line as close to the entry point as you can get is all you will need.          The only downside to this product that I've come across is that the gel seems to set up in the tip between uses.  A couple of times I've pushed so hard to get it started, that when the tip cleared a big squirt came out all at once (made a bit of a mess and wasted some of the gel).  In the future I'm going to use a toothpick to open the tip before each use.          Another nice advantage is that the gel is clear.  The other product is honey colored and after application would sort of dry up like pitch, an amber color.  At times hard to clean out from under a metal carpet seam or in tight corner.  This product is less noticeable.          The tip is long enough to be able to push the product into crevices.          Hope this helps.
