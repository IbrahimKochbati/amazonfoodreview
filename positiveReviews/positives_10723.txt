My english bulldog loves these little morsels! They have all natural, good for her ingredients. There are only 6 simple ingredients: barley, lamb, carrots, apples, palm oil, and molasses. They are in a easy to re close zip lock bag. It is a rather large size for my dog, but has a indentation, so easy to snap in half.
