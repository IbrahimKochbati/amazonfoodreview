The title says it all, but seriously this stuff is great. I've tried other high fiber cereals, like Kashi, that just taste like leaves and twigs. This cereal tastes great and it's high in fiber. That's usually a difficult combo to find. The subscribe & save price also beats my local grocery store, so get yourself a bowl and get poopin'! : )
