Thanks to thoughtful packaging my bonsai arrived 100% intact. Not even a leaf got knocked off during shipping. It's very healthy, came in a pretty ceramic pot and dark gravel that complements the leathery green leaves. The instructions were very thorough and helpful. I can't wait for the flowers to show up!
