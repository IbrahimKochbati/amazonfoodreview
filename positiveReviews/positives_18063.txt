I make a great Watergate Salad (from the Jell O website)with this product, and it is all sugar free.  I leave out the marshmallows, and I use pineapple packed in its own juice and sugar free Cool Whip.  My diabetic friends rave over this dessert and the non diabetic friends love it also!  The pudding mixes easily with the liquids and is never pasty.  This is really a great product.
