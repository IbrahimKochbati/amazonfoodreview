To me, these are nothing like the regular Altoids and are not  eath mints. They are pleasant tasting little candies in a cute convenient tin, and that's as far as it goes. The mintiness is just not strong, and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis. I'm not a dragon  eath person, but still, one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my  eath. Four or five will freshen my  eath for a short while   maybe 15 minutes. At this point, I think the Ice eakers Frost mints are the best as sugar free  eath mints.
