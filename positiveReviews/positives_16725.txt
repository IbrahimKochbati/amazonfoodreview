Maybe its only my feeling, but tough this Agave Nectar tastes great, I have the feeling this isnt as sweet then the other blue agave sirups i tried. It dissolves fine in even cold drinks, but as said, I need more for a similar result then with the other Agave nectars. I will most likely fall back to the other ones.
