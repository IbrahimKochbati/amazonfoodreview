Out of 4 cats, one simply wouldn't go near it, one liked the  oth and played with the food and the remaining 2  liked it immensely (nom nom nom). The cans are a good single serving size and it really smells like human food. Literally, they smell like cold leftovers. The food is in a  oth and very wet, which your cat may or may not like. They only similarity in cats is that they are all different.          To be fair, the one that didn't like it is insanely picky.  The food is not overly processed and I am happy to feed this to my cats. When I saw that it was made in Thailand, I was a bit wary as we all have heard about the melamine in, well, everything, in China. Then reading further, I saw the company addresses this and says that the food doesn't use Chinese products.  They seem a thoughtful company at the least, which when it comes to pets, goes a long way with me.          As good as the food may seem to me, they are the ones that have to eat it.  It's a little more expensive, but not prohibitively so, especially if your cat likes it.
