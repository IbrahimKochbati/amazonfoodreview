My baby does not like this kind. I do not like it either, it tastes fishy. Salmon is good for baby  ain development. I tried to put butter or some seasoning to cover the fishy taste, but my son still does not want to eat it. He like other happy baby product like spinah, mango and pear, blue berries, banana and beet and  occoli, pear and peas. This one needs seasoning or I will not eat it either.
