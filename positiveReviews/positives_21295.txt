I'm so glad I purchased this cutting board. I'm glad I was able to support something relatively local (U.S. made) and it's the perfect size for someone who cooks for 1 2 people. It doesn't take up too much space in my cabinet or on my counter when I'm cutting. Also, it's a good looking cutting board.
