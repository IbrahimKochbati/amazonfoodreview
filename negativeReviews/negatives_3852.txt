This stuff tastes awesome! And for once in a kiwi berry drink you can taste the kiwi, I'd be very hard pressed to tell the difference between this and a traditional soda.          I also like the fact that it's in a tall and slender can, fits in the fridge better and you can't mistake it for that pesky regular soda... :)          However I would not say that this would be a better alternative to soda based on the fact that it still has a solid 33g of sugar. Yes it is better for you because it is made with 100% real juice instead of corn syrup, which I definitely like, but it's no different then drinking the 100% frozen juice from concentrate.          Overall I really like the product and will probably buy some to have as an alternative to soda (for those few times a year).          Pros:     You can actually taste the kiwi and the berries.     100% REAL juice, no artificial flavoring.     Very carbonated, not the least bit flat.     Quenches your thirst and is refreshing.     NO CORN SYRUP!!!          Cons:     Spendy.     Although it is all natural, still contains 33g of sugar...     135 calories a can (ouch!).
