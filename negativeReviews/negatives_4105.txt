I purchased this product based on my research on the internet and the reviews on Amazon regarding this product's lack of aftertaste, low glycemic response, and mainly because people stated it had no gastric effects as Xylitol does.  I used it this morning in a banana  ead recipe.  This afternoon I began paying the price and a few minutes later everybody near me began paying the price with me.  This impacted my gut exactly the way all sugar alcohols do.  I'll be passing this item on to my sister with diabetes.  Her meds already tear up her gut so she probably won't notice as much.  Back to the drawing board for me.
