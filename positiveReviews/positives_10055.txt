Melitta Cafe Collection Classique Supreme Ground Coffee is a mid priced coffee; it's not truly expensive, but it costs more than many coffee drinkers normally pay.  So the major question that arises is, is it worth it?          And the answer all depends on what you want.  It's richer. more mellow, and far better tasting than the economy  ands, but it's not as full bodied, nuanced, or enjoyable as the premium  ands.          It is neither Tiffany nor WalMart.          But is is good.  And in my opinion (which surely is what taste truly is), it's worth the $$$.          Five stars:  good value for the money.
