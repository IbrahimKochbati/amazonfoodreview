I have tried numerous boxed gluten free flours, and I never get the consistent results I get from Bisquick's GF Mix. It's also more economical than making your own (who wants to buy 5+ flours just to make a cake??). And this one never has that strange metallic smell others like Bob's have. I find myself making pancakes, biscuits, cupcakes again after years of going  ead free due to a wheat allergy.          My one complaint is that I can't seem to find this in any local store; I have my fingers crossed that Amazon continues to carry this!
