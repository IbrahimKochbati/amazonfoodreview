I just got a case of these in the mail which I ordered on S&S a few days ago and I must say that are delicious.  I have tried the traditional cheddar puffs as well as spicy curls and I enjoyed both flavor so this is a nice combination of the two.  The flavor is just slightly spicy with a nice cheddar taste.  At 130 calories serving and only .5 grams of saturated fat these are a great snack for anyone watching their intake.
