I tried this product because I love Pamela's baking and pancake for making chocolate chip cookies (and pancakes), and I was hoping this cookie would be good.  Well, the "good" is it has some decent ingredients (some fiber, aguave, rice blend flour   no high frucose corn syrup) but the "bad" is it tastes terrible.  I couldn't even finish the one cookie (it comes in a small rectangular bar, maybe 2 and a half inches long by an inch plus wide and 1 2 inch thick.  I'm usually pretty good with words, but although I like the texture, moist part of this cookie, the flavor is indescribably dreadful; I wish I could be more precise, it negatively tickles the taste buds.  You don't feel you would get sick eating it, but you might consider using it as a torture on someone. I would ask my wife to try it, but I want to live.  There are other better products on the market that taste much better, power bars, etc.  Some people may question aguave being "good," but I think it is better than staight sugar or corn syrup  correction  there is some evaporated cane sugar in the product as well as coconut sugar. It has 180 calories, so keep that in mind.
