Jack links are my family's favorite! They are great for snacking, lunchbox or anytime. i only wish they had come individually wrap to stay fresher longer. a container of some sort would have been ideal. they still taste great. i'd buy them again and again. worth the price and no hassles  well maybe the constant e mails to buy more and other products is a bit annoying!
