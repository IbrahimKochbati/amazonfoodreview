Love this tea, and have ordered it multiple times. You could just say I'm hooked on it. Typically very deep flavors and very fresh. We take ours and keep it in a closed lid sealed container while we work thru the whole 100 bags of a box. The remaining boxes we keep factory sealed until we need to open. Also keep the sealed boxes out of direct light and in a cool food pantry. Hot water out of our Bunn coffee maker (it keeps hot water ready and can make a new pot of water or coffee within a minute or so) works very well & is the method I use the most often, but it can add some extra flavor to use water heated right to boil on the stove top, but takes a bit longer. We have other teas, but I always seem to drift back to this one. The volume pricing on Amazon makes it well worth ordering on line    we cannot find the same prices if we get it in the local stores, even if I factor in the shipping.
