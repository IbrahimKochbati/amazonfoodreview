I have a two year old Jack Russell Terrier and she loves Newman's Own Dog Food! She ate Beneful for a year before switching. This goes down much easier. She doesn't each eat it "just because she's hungry"; she actually likes it! I highly recommend this product and would consider giving any dog nothing less!
