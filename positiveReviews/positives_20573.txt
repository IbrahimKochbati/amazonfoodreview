I drink a giant mug of this almost nightly. Peppermint is very soothing and relaxing, and it's great for settling an upset stomach. It's up there with ginger for homemade remedies. The aroma is too good to resist and the taste is just as good. It's minty and a little sweet, but not too sweet. It's much healthier than soda (barely different from warm water), so if you're trying to  eak a soda habit this tea is a must. It's a great thing to drink any time of day. Great for settling out a large meal, relaxing calming down during a hectic day, and great for unwinding before bed. Celestial Seasonings always has the best teas, and this is no exception. It's great to find it at such a bargain online.
