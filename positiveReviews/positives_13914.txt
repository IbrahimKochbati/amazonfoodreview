I have read other reviews on here, and thought I would throw in my thoughts.  I have been eating PB2 for a couple of years now.  What I have read from other users is that 2 tbsp of powder shrinks down to 2 tsp when mixed.  I have NEVER had this happen.  I mix 2 tbsp with 1 (plus a little extra) water and have a large amount (I'm talking 2 full tbsp) of "peanut butter" for my sandwich.  I would never put as much real peanut butter on a sandwich as I do this.  So, I don't know if I am doing it wrong, but I find this product to be great for sandwiches, especially if you are watching calorie intake.     The price is a little high, but I find it to be worth it.
