This tea has a completely different taste than ALL the other black teas out there....  It is reddish orange in color, which is odd too....as most black teas are uniformly "dark".  It has, what I characterize, as a "burnt tea" flavor, even though I only steep it for 5 minutes max.          I once bought an off  and Chinese tea and it too was "red" in color and had the same "burnt" taste.          I think everyone here is confused.  Black tea should be black, not red.  This tea was also quite cheap at Whole Foods, only $3.99 for organic tea.  I have paid twice that for better tasting, BLACK, organic black tea.          I'm pissed at the burnt flavor and red color.  I can barely stand it iced.  Will likely have to buy something else.
