I am so grateful that DisposKups exist  and are now in use in my home!          No other type of device for  ewing bagged coffee in my Keurig (k cup)or any other way to recycle K cups has worked well for me. The standard device made by Keurig is so difficult to clean each time, that I just choose to never use it.          DisposaKups are the perfect item for  ewing my favorite coffees that are not available in K cup form.  The pieces fit together perfectly, and with a "snap"    I'm able to  ew a cup of coffee and still have the disposable feature of regular k cups (and no clean up!) Plus, you can assemble however many custom K cups ahead of time with disposaKups, so they are very helpful to have for holiday gatherings and parties.          Thank you thank you!  I will be purchasing a big supply soon, so I will be well stocked for the holidays!
