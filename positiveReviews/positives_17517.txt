So as part of making Duck Confit, I was worried about rendering enough duck fat on my own, so I took a look and made my purchase, and it worked out perfectly. The shipping was quick, I was able to track it and time the rest of my cooking, and just as I was worried about I couldnt quite render enough on my own, which made the 1.5 oz size useful, I used a container just to top off what I needed and didnt have to cut my confit with a different fat.     So, quick, well tracked, and the right size.
