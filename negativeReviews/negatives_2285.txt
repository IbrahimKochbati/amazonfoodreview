People watch out if you are buying this product online. I've ordered 12 bottles of the O.N.E, I was expecting this to be same as what I bought from store but this seller disappointed me, The bottles have the seal  oken and the taste of the coconut water is not what I expected, I'm sure that this seller  the person who packaged the bottles added water by  eaking the seal. I've wasted my money on this product, I'll never buy this online for a few bucks cheap rather than go to the nearby store and buy it.          my rating for this product is 0 5.          In short, Seal  oken, Diluted and Not comparable with the one that I bought from store.
