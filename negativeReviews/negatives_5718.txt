If I were going to make  eaded chicken my first thought would be to use generic  eadcrumbs.  Shake N Bake does have a few pros   it's finely ground so it sticks to every surface of the chicken, and it does leave the chicken moist.  However, it's more expensive than generic  eadcrumbs and is less flavorful.  The whole shake and bake concept could also be used with  eadcrumbs... I am a little baffled as to why anyone would spend the extra money for Shake N Bake.
