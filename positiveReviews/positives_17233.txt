I am making the swich from other no calorie sweeteners and bought this to use in my coffee in the morning. They recomend 6 drops as a serving and I find this to sweet so use 4 for a large cup of coffee and find it is just right! At first I found all stevia products to be a little bitter after taste but after using for a couple of weeks I am now used to it, so if you want to make the swich, just think of it as good for you and try to get used to it. It is worth the effort and you will be doing your body good!
