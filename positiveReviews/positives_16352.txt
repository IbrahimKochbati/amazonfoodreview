All greenies are overpriced.  But, since my critters love 'em so, I watch the price and get a bunch when it drops to a more reasonable level.  Still too high, but.....          Since I'm buying something, I think is way overpriced...  yet I still buy it, should say it all.  My gang loves the darn things.  I prefer tendons or pizzles, since they last awhile.  But, they love Greenies.  So, I get em.          You probably will too...  we got our pets, right where THEY want us......
