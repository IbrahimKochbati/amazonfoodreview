I can only get this cat food at PETCO and the closest one is over an hour away. I was so relived to find it here on amazon and at a great price. Thank you amazon!     We chose this food because they don't dangerously test on animals like some companies (IAMS) do. Also this food does not contain any bi products. It does contain some rice fillers but it is so hard to avoid with the budget we are on. This is the best we can afford. Our cats are very happy and healthy!
