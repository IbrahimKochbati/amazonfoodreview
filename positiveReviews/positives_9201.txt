When trying to find a descent Bonsai that was relatively inexpensive, I happened upon this little kit. When it arrived the plant was in great shape and nothing was  oken or missing. The only thing I am doing different is using sphagnum moss instead of soil. If this kit is for a gift or just for you, It is a good choice.
