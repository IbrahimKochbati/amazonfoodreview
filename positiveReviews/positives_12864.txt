I don't generally drink anything but water, coffee and tea, do not like soda, and only use juice in smoothies, so was surprised that I like the Switch juice drink as much as I do. I've only tried two flavors, the Kiwi Berry and the Black Cherry (Note: I did this review on that flavor also). They are pretty similar but I slightly prefer the Black Cherry. The fruit names are silly anyway as they use a blend of several fruits.          The carbonation is very light and the mixed fruit concentrate they use has a very pleasant flavor. There is no added sugar or fake sweeteners which seem to be in so many prepared beverages these days. Because it is juice only and a slight amount of carbonation, there is no after taste.          Unlike many other reviewers, I did not find these drinks to be too sweet at all, and I fully expected to considering all juice usually tastes pretty darn sweet to me. I think the carbonation may tone down the sweetness of the juice?          For me this is a "special" once in awhile treat so I don't mind the price.  I like the 8.3oz amount; it is just the right amount    forgot to mention in my other review on the Black Cherry flavor that this amount fits perfectly into a wine glass which really adds to the ambiance!
