I am writing this just after finishing off the last two slices of a delicious, crispy and flavorful gluten free pizza! This one is a winner.          I was worried about the few bad reviews that said it had a weird taste, but with all the additional spices we added it was even better than the delivery kind! I was so impressed, I can't wait to make another. We only used 1 2 of a bag and it will feed about 2 or 3 people. So at $2 + sauce, cheese and toppings   it's a steal!          Next up, slowly rising in my  ead oven is my first gluten free loaf of white  ead. I can't wait. Going gluten free has never been easier, and I am not a chef! Just someone who is looking for some natural healing without the sacrifice of good taste.          PS. I ordered this on Sunday, and it arrived on Tuesday. How is THAT for customer service!!!
