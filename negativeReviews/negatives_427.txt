This fruit would be fine if it were not for the soft slimey textured watermelon and some other fruit that is in this can that is just slimey and icky. There are certain fruit that shouldn't be canned, and otherwise the crunchy pieces are fine. Much of the soft fruit I had to discard. Albeit, this item is good frozen and added to other fruit to make smoothie's then you don't have to taste the slime.
