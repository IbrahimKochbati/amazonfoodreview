My dog really likes this toy, and it occupies him for quite a while. The big problem is that the plastic cracks at the top where the lid screws on if it dropped on the floor. My dog is Jack Russell, so he's not dropping it from a very high height, yet it still  eaks, so I can't imagine it with a larger dog. We have returned this toy twice, and already the third on is pretty much unusable.
