These are easy to make and surprisingly good.  Reading the back list tells you they are low in fat, low in carbs...much healthier than pop corn or chips.  Just great for dipping in your fave dip or sprinkled with hot sauce and lime.  Not for the low salt diets, tho.          Try a case...at these rates you can give a few away.  The perfect Birthday Gift for your Beer drinking Buddy.
