Pomegranate molasses is my mother's "secret" recipe for great meatballs. She adds a couple teaspoon of molasses to the meat and the taste comes out incredible.          Once I set up my own household she gave me a present   Pomegranate Molasses of my own. I learned to use it in variety of recipes from deserts to meat sauces. It has a wonderful taste both tart and sweet at the same time. It has deep red color, and looks very appealing.          It keeps almost indefinitely in the refrigerator. It blends well with walnuts, adds a unique flavor to beans, adds wonderful flavor to poultry, gives a nice taste to fish, gives an astringent edge to salads and vegetables, and is a great tenderizer for lamb and pork.          I like its flavor even just diluted with cold water as a drink or adding tart flavor (and beautiful color) to sorbets.          Ali Julia review
