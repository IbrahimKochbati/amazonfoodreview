I was NEVER going to give my children formula... after my first child was born I did not produce enough milk and had to supplement.  We tried all different types of formula from many name  ands.  Unfortunately he had adverse reactions to everything we tried, including soy products.  We finally tried Organic Similac.  This was by far the most expensive, so we started with the powder.  This stayed down & he didn't have any reactions (rashes, hives, throwing up, etc).  After a couple of months he began spitting up a little powdery substance (guess we didn't mix well enough).  We then tried the Premixed Similac Organic.  Voila!  Perfect.  No adverse reactions, he was happy & healthy.          We've had 2 more children & both have also used the Premixed Organic Similac.  Neither of them have had an problem with the formula & according to the Doctor they are all very healthy children.  To me that is what's most important. :)
