I'd never tried chia seeds before, but I'm trying to be more health conscious, so I ordered this with the intent to put them in my overnight oatmeal. They're great! A little goes a long, long way. I had no problems with bloating, they taste like nothing, and they pack a nutritional wallop. I've since added them to quinoa and couscous, and have a  ead recipe I'm planning to try. Great value. I'll buy them again.
