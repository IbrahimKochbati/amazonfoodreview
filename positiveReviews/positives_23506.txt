I've only recently started eating granola because it was available at my office for free.  But now that I'm addicted to it, I want to buy some.          At first I tried the Sweet Home Farm French vanilla Granola, that was such a disappointment I didn't think I'll find yummy granola again.  Then I came across Peace.  I was skeptical since it only had one good review.  But I figured I'll give it a try anyways.          WooWEE!!! It's delicious.  The flavor is fantastic and the texture is perfect!          The vanilla flavour is not overpowering but it's there to help enhance the flavor.  I seriously recommend that you give this one a try!!
