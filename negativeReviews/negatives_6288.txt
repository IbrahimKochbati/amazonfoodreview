One of the main reasons I purchased this specific product was because it says it has red in it.  The package, itself, states "red" as one of the colors.  Of the 36, there was not a single red.  The majority of the package was pink.  Very disappointing.          So unless you are looking for pink, I would shop elsewhere.
