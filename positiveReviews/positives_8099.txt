This is a great product! The label said it was packaged at the end on January, so it was very fresh. These are really good out of the bag, but I prefer to toast them by just putting some in a pan medium pan for a couple of minutes. I have been adding different things to my low carb diet and this is one of my favorites because of the low carbs. About 2 net carbs per 3 tablespoons.
