What a wonderful product!     I can drink it all times of the day, so obviously the original Sleepytime Tea causes no real drowsiness.          I start my day with the tea and end it with the tea.     It makes me so relaxed and it's healthier then smoking..lol          It's also made me a fan of sugarless tea.     Never again will I go back to sweet tea or terriable diet sodas!          Try some Sleepytime Tea if you love tea! The flavor is amazing and very smooth as well as unique. It's great hot or cold!     You will not be dissappointed.
