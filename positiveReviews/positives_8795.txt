I seem to have a love affair with roses.  I've always admired their beauty and fragrance. and then few years ago, I discovered they are edible.  The first time I tasted rose jam, I was in Vancouver, BC.  It was served on buttery vanilla scones.  I knew I had to take some home with me.  Since then, I've tried 2 other  ands.  The Kafka is quite good and actually has real bits of rose petals in it which really boosts that sweet flowery flavor in your mouth.  It has just the right amount of sweetness too.  My only beef is, I found them at my local imports store for only $3.89.  I spent nearly $15 ordering them from Amazon.
