I had tried Wabash Vally Farms popcorn before and sought out a place where I could purchase it online.  I can sometimes find it in my area and but only in small quantities.  This is by far the best popcorn with few unpopped kernels, less husks and a great flavor.  I highly recommend this product.  Fantastic!!
