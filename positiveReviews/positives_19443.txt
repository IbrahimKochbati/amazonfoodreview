Disregard that bad review.  This has pepper in it and it's a bit spicy but so worth it.  I mean, if you don't like pepper, why would you buy it?  This is great for anyone watching calories or on Weight Watchers since it's 1 2 the calories of regular mayo but still it's all natural and much better than regular.  Use to make chicken salad, put some on chicken and  oil or pan "fry."  A little goes a long way so you get all the pleasure of mayo with none of the guilt.          I want to marry this product I love it so much!
