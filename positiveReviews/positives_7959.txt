These were local during Halloween and then we couldn't find them. Of course they were here at Amazon. They look like they were made in your kitchen as they are not uniform in shape or size, but they are amazingly good. It's like going to the fair and getting a tart green apple covered in yummy caramel. They last a really long time which is good as they are 60 calories each, but they stop me from wanting a 300+ calorie desert so they're a good deal. I do find myself smiling while I have one; they make you feel like a kid.   "
