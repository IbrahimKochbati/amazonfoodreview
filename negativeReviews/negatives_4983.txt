I cannot get my dog to use this no matter how hard I try.  My dog is the most food motivated dog I've ever known.  She will do ANYTHING for carrots, lettuce, ice cubes... even her own kibble.  But regardless of what I put in this thing, I cannot get her interested in this toy to save either of our lives.  I even tried clicker training her on it!  She doesn't associate it with food no matter what I do.
