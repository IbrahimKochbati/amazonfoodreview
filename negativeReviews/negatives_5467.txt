Normally I wouldn't buy French Roast because it's too strong of a flavor for me. But because this was a low acid coffee, I wasn't as concerned. I don't suffer from heartburn, acid reflux or mild stomach irritation, but I enjoy decaf coffee the majority of the time. This coffee looked fine, but it didn't smell good. To me, the smell of the coffee  ewing is almost as good as drinking it. There just wasn't much of an aroma while  ewing or after pouring in the cup. I added cream and the taste was ok. The aftertaste stayed with me long after drinking the coffee. I'll stick with decaf.
