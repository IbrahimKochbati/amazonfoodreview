I was so excited to find these dairy free white chocolate chips on Amazon.  Thanks Amazon!!!  I received the shipment yesterday and this morning for  eakfast I made oatmeal, cranberry and white chocolate chip cookies.  They were so good! The white chocolate chips melted into the cookie making each mouthful a wonderful treat. These chips were everything I was hoping for.  I will most definitely be keeping my pantry stocked with these chips.
