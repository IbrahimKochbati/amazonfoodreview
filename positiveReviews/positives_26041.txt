These Made In Nature Organic Dried Mangoes are really very tasty, maybe the best I've tried so far but I was surprised to see how small these packages really are. That is entirely my own fault for not paying closer attention to the weight ~ these bags are only 3 ounces each, hardly two servings worth of dried mango per package. Considering the price, they aren't the best value in dried fruit but nevertheless they are still yummy. The pieces are quite small and rather bite sized. The fruit is very sweet, soft and moist ~ not hard and shoe leathery like some other dried mango products. They have been organically grown (although it states nowhere on the package that they are unsulphured like other Made In Nature fruits) and they are a product of Mexico or Ecuador.          So I give Made In Nature Organic Dried Mangoes, 3 Ounce Bags an overall 4 stars ~ 5 stars for quality, 3 stars for value.
