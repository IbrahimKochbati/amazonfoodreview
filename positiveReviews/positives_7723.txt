I bought these years ago at Walmart     and then they stopped carrying them.  I was searching the internet and found them at Amazon.  We ordered a box of each.  I like the spicy and my husband likes the orginal.  A learning process will be a sure thing until you figure out how many minutes for your microwave.  They are great and we love them.
