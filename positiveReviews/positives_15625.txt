I did not hold out much hope for this product. We have two pedigree Persian cats, and they are as finicky eaters as any cats alive. My wife and I have tried all kinds of different wet and dry foods, but our cats usually just turn up their noses and look at us like we're stupid, until we give them something we know they like. So, when this arrived and I opened the chicken pot pie to see it was full of chunks of chicken and carrot (and something else, potato maybe) in what looked like chicken soup, I  aced myself for packing up the remainder and donating it to the local animal shelter...but, NO! Both of our cats dug right in. Both ate up all the soup, and one cleared his bowl. The other left the larger chunks of chicken and all the veggies (he never eats veggies). For our cats, that's a rave review. The second kind, shredded chicken in sesame sauce, they didn't like as much, but they still cleared out all the liquid and a good portion of the chicken. Honestly, I was very pleasantly surprised they ate as much of the new stuff as they did. It must be good. For us, these single serving size cans are perfect, because we can split one between the two cats (they don't eat much), or give half in the morning and half in the evening, so it comes in quantities our pets are comfortable with. Also, packaging two kinds in one box is helpful, as our cats also thrive on variety. Because our cats did not eat it down to the bowl like they would their current favorites, I can't give the product five stars, but I do give this product a hearty four and half stars, and I think we are likely to buy this  and in the future if its price is competitive with our cats' current favorites.
