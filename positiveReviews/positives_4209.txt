I am a strong believer in giving my baby organic foods as much as possible. We used many of the Earth's Best flavors and baby really enjoyed most of them. What I found irritating though was how runny many of the flavors were; I often had to add oatmeal or rice just to keep the food on the spoon.  Water is added to many if not most of the flavors. I wondered if that was a necessity however "Plum" "Ella's Kitchen" and "Happy Baby"  ands (also organic) do not have water as an added ingredient. We definitely used these, but to be honest, I prefered the other  ands because I felt we were getting a better value considering we weren't paying for water in those packages.
