Received a Keurig  ewer for Christmas and also received a pack of this hot "chocolate" with it.  We made some after sledding one day for myself, my husband and 2 kids (6 and 10) all thought it was terrible.  We almost returned the Keurig  ewer because of it.  I have found that I am enjoying black coffee with my Keurig, but we will never buy any type of hot chocolate k cups again.
