This was the first time I'd bought any Torani syrups, so I wanted to have some variety to see what I liked.  I was actually really surprised that I liked so many of the syrup flavors!  My personal favorites are hazelnut and irish cream, but there's only 1 flavor that I don't like.  I love that it's low on calories, made with Splenda, and the tastes are really very good.  Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to spice up their coffee routine!
