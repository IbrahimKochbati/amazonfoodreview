The price on this product was quite good.  I was aware before I bought it that it has more fructose than high fructose corn syrup, which I avoid like the plague because it increases one's triglycerides.  But then so does honey.  Agave nectar doesn't solidify as honey does, so it is more convenient to store and use up slowly in applications where a liquid sweetener is desirable.  I use it sparingly.
