Switch is a fun alternative to traditional soft drinks.  It's 100% juice and all natural; it contains no added sugar, no corn syrup, no preservatives and no artificial color.  What makes it fun is it's carbonated.  And just the right amount.          The first sip is perhaps a little tart or bitter, but that's because most of us are used to soft drinks with added sugar, corn syrup and a bunch of largely unpronounceable chemical compounds.  Switch has none of that and, although different from traditional soft drinks, the taste is very refreshing.  The carbonation makes it a "fun" drink that you can feel good about consuming (it has 100% of the recommended allowance of vitamin C).          Should Coke and Pepsi be worried?  Probably not, but it does taste good and it's actually good for you.  You should try it!
