I don't understand how other people are able to tolerate this, but it taste worse than store  and diet coke. Both coke zero and pepsi one are diet, but they don't taste like it, whereas this one definitely, unabashedly, taste like diet. I don't know what I'm going to do with the rest of the bottles other than maybe tolerate the taste and finish it. I wonder if the sugared version is better, I might order one to try, but the sugar free one had way more reviews I thought I was safe.     So if you don't like the taste of aspartame, stay far far far away from this variety pack.
