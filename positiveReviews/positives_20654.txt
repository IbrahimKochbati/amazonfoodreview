I've been a fan of Blue Diamond's almond milk for a while now, and have tried their coconut milk, but when I first tasted this stuff, I was blown away. It has a flavor that is *much* better than either almond or coconut milk individually, and has a light, smooth, even texture that feels like you're drinking liquid silk. Pure am osia!
