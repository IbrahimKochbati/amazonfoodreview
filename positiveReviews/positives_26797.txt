I usually look for cheaper products that can offer a filling meal, and this is one of the more perfect examples where lower price doesn't mean lower quality. I found the Maruchan Yakisoba Savory Soy to be quite delicious and filling; definitely one of my favorites. Was pleasantly surprised at how well the vegetables tasted as well; way better than the smaller, typical cups of ramen. It's a product both my wife & I plan on ordering time and time again. The only problem I had with the product is not enough soy flavor for my personal taste, but this was easily remedied with a single left over soy packet from the last time we ordered Chinese delivery.
