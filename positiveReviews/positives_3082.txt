Sardines are rising in popularity as people discover more about their health benefits... and that they aren't so stinky after all (especially less so after cooking!).          I've used numerous varieties of the Roland sardines: olive oil, s&b in olive oil, tomato sauce, etc.  The S&B version with low sodium and packed in water is my best recommendation preference: a great value for the money, and practically a steal when you compare  per ounce  the price with other  ands.  Then, consider the discount(s) when purchasing through Amazon, and it'll be tough to choose another.  Why?  Many other  ands charge the same price as  or more than Roland  with only a 3.5 oz tin, whereas Roland includes more fish in the tin.  The quality is consistent, and the sardines themselves are quite succulent and versatile enough to be included in stir fries, salads, pasta dishes, etc. without overpowering the other flavors.          Oddly enough, I was half mindful when perusing a semi local dollar store which is renowned for carrying a ton of food items in my city.  I was looking to make some lower cost and healthier choices in my diet at the time (not expecting to find these, of course, but rather turning my nose up at the usual crud I saw stocked there) when I accidentally stumbled across them.  At $1 per tin, it was a huge buy, so I tried a few.  The rest, as they say, is history as aforementioned.
