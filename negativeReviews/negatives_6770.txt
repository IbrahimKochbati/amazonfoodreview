This stuff burned my mouth for about an hour, literally singing my lips. I drank approx. 15 cups of water through the ordeal. I didn't know that you're not supposed to 'spread' this on the bun of a sandwich. I knew it was hot, I didnt use much, but I did not know ghost pepper was known for being the hottest pepper. After settling down, I only discovered a few hours later that the fun was not over, as I felt a similar burning joy on the other end of my body (read: my anus). I can't say I recommend this sauce, unless you plan on throwing it in the eyes of your biggest enemy (in which case it would be really effective). Could've spent the money on another lap dance.. 2 stars for really being spicy though..
