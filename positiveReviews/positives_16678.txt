My name is Duncan, and I'm a mommy's boy, and she and Dad love me so much that they give me one of these every day after supper.  They taste great and clean my teeth at the same time.  All my friends love them, too! They buy them from Amazon because the price is good.  I'm going to have them get on the automatic sending list, so I'll never run out!
