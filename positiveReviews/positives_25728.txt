I love to bake, but it is nice to have some foods on hand for a snack in a pinch. My kids loved these soft chocolate almond oatmeal cookies! They are individually wrapped for freshness and would be great for packing in a school lunch. They were a wee bit skimpy on the chocolate part, but they still tasted pretty good. I liked how they didn't crumble all over the place.          You only get six in a box, but they are meant to be a treat afterall. I will probably buy again.
