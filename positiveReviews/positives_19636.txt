These chips were formerly offered at Gelson's Market but are now only available online...at half the cost of retail stores :) :) :).  If you want to cut back on unnecessary calories but still like to munch on tortilla chips then Guiltless Gourmet is for you !  They are baked and not fried in oil which more than doubles the calories.  I prefer the Mucho Nacho flavor but they also have Chili Lime, Yellow Corn, Blue Corn, and other flavors.
