Just received my order yesterday. Four bags of tea, all with a "Best used by" date of Jan. 8, 2012. That's less than three weeks from now.          According to Yamamotoyama's quality assurance department (I called them), the tea is 1 1 2 years old.          This is old tea and it's going back to Amazon.          UPDATE: Tried to return it and Amazon has a "no returns" policy for this item.          Thanks Amazon!          UPDATE: I contacted Amazon customer service and they issued a refund to me. Upped the rating to 3 stars for the prompt customer service.
