This is easily THE best  ownie mix for gluten free diets.  We've been GF since 2005 and have tried EVERYTHING: Namaste (ick), Pamela's (meh), Bob's Red Mill (not bad), and so on.  Arrowhead Mills' mix is moist, easy to make, and my picky 8 and [...] absolutely love these  ownies.  Even better, my [...], non GF nephew ADORES these  and doesn't know they're not made with wheat.  I normally buy these mixes for [..] at an organic outlet 25 minutes away, and these boxes run [..] at larger stores, so this is a GREAT price.
