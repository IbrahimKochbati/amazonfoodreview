I find the gluten free Bisquick pancake mix to be just as easy to use as the original Bisquick, and I like the flavor just fine (not much different than regular Bisquick).  It's easy to make the pancakes, just add milk, oil, an egg, mix, and pour on the griddle.  Cooking time seems to be about the same, and the consistency of the pancakes is just like regular pancakes.  I would definitely recommend this mix to anyone needing gluten free products.
