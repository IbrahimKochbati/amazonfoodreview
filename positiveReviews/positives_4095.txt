I have tried a few kona coffees from different vendors, and I can say that this one is a very special coffee. I made an order last year and had some issues with one of the two bags I've bought. The coffee lost it's freshness in the 2nd bag and it was very old, dry and tasteless. I was very disappointed by how the same coffee could taste so different in each bag. I wasn't sure what was the problem, cause the 1st bag tasted very pleasant and aromatic. The freshness, texture and delicacy of the coffee took me to nirvana. I was very pleased with the organic taste and smoothness of the coffee. Immediately I knew that this was a very special gourmet coffee.          I've tried different regional coffees including, papa new guinea, Kenya AA, Sumatra beans, Jamaican blue mountain ... and others. I have to say that Kona is my favorite by far. The shipping bag comes oxygen free when it's being shipped from the vendor. The air is sucked dry to vacuum seal it. Sometimes they get damaged or punctured during shipping. I guess that's what happened to one of the bags. As you know, coffee and oxygen don't go well together, cause once the coffee is oxidized; it starts losing its freshness and it doesn't taste the way it's supposed to taste.          I've made a recent purchase again and I'm very happy with the results. Give this coffee a try before deciding to make a bulk shipment. You have got nothing to lose. Well done Hawaii Roasters. You guys have outdone yourselves.
