Bought these for car sickness.  I read the reviews and people said they have worked.     They do nothing for me I still get car sick.  I should have bought a smaller pack of them to try out.          I don't like the flavor that much either.  It is not bad but i will never find myself wanting to have a gin gin.          Maybe they changed how they make these i noticed all the other reviews to be older.          So in the end they don't fix motion sickness and they don't taste good.     My wife doesn't like how they taste much either FYI, neither do some kids that tried a few.
