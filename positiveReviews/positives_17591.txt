This is a vine review, I love coffee, coffee does not love me!, aghhh. I have had some traders joes no acid coffee that was good.(but not the dark roast.)But the one I liked, is no longer.     So I tried this from vine. praying for the beat     first I only recieved one pack, this is not a whine, just it hard to see if the coffee is workable more than once.     The one micro pot was great and tasted wonderful, no stomache ache. I may buy some more to see if its more than a one pot wonder.
