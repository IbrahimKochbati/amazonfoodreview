I always keep one of these in my bag  if you love crunchy natural snacks, this is a wonderful snack to have on hand. When I travel, I keep one or two in the car, my luggage, my gym bag, etc. For a light and sweet (yet slightly tart) snack, one of these apple treats is hard to beat! With only 70 calories per pouch, it really hits the spot, especially if you eat it while consuming a bottle of water thermos of water to step up the hydration. They are not expensive, if you put them on auto ship with amazon prime  well worth the money. My entire family eats them, young and old, so I always have a full box on hand. Great Deal!
