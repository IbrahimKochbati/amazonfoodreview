Great tea. I've had it on Subscribe and Save for about three months now, and the strength and quality has been consistently good. I enjoy the whole leaves, use a stainless coffee strainer in a latte mug, steep and sip away! I  ew it on the strong side, but it has a cranberry tartness to it. With all the health benefits it has (lowered blood pressure) it's good to drink as an alternative to all of the other junk sodas and sugary juices.
