These pretzels are pretty good. By accident I ordered 2 boxes and had a ton of them. The expiration date was June and I got them in March and was kinda nervous, but we are down to out last 2 bags...many of our friends have enjoyed them! They are very crunchy because they are very thin. They are not like a snyders if that's what your looking for.
