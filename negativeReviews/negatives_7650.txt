I love cookies. And anyone who loves cookies knows that homemade is always best.  Store bought will always taste...store bought  just a little too much like chemicals and flour and a little less like...fresh.          Comparing these with, say, Chips Ahoy  you get a big cookie, rather soft, and a generous portion, that tastes a bit softer. Compare to the ultra decadent Pepperidge Farm big cookies? this is just bland by itself. With coffee, the flavors perked considerably.          Me, if I need a big cookie for lunch packing, I'll spring for the Pepperidge Farm and get total indulgence. However moms and dads with kids might like the fact that each of these is individually wrapped and that Quaker is a good quality company.
