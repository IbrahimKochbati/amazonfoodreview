I am totally allergic to Avocado's.  Before I knew it I had ordered this for a dish.  So since I couldnt use it for the food, I knew it was good for the skin...so I used it...OHHHHHH, it felt so good.          I used it hot in my hair, used it in my lotion and used it also after a shower.  Multi   Use and very nice product.
