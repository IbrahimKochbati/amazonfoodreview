Nice kit and fermenation went well and the wine finished nice and dry, but it has not so subtle anise charater that is not suited to a patio white wine. Not sure if this is a charaterisic of this appellation or what, but I will order the New Zealand kit next time. I keg, rather than bottle, the wine so I have the flexibility of pouring one glass or one liter and it does mix nicely, so I see a lot of sangrias this summer.
