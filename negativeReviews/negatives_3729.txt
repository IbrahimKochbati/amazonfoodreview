My husband, who never suffers from any allergies, went into anaphylactic shock after consuming this tea.  The ingredients show many other herbs and flowers other than tea and flavoring.  He remembered that his fingertips were itchy seconds after handling the bag.  So if you have never tried this product, handle the bag in your hand for a few minutes before steeping in water.  If your going to have a severe reaction you'll soon see some irritation on your skin.
