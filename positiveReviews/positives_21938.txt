If you can't eat wheat pasta, Tinkyada is the  and to buy.  The white rice pasta I bought at the store was mushy and didn't hold its shape.  It was a pale imitation of the "real thing" (i.e. wheat pasta)  But Tinkyada's pasta I can enjoy eating.  As long as you cook according to the directions, you can't tell it's not "normal" pasta. I usually add a bit of oil to the water with the pasta to discourage sticking, because I don't do a very good job remembering to stir it!  It's also  own rice based, so it's healthier for you.  One warning, if you put plain pasta in the fridge, it will be hardened when you pull it out.  But, heat it with some sauce, or reheat it in a pan of water on the stove, and it's nice and soft again.  If you store it with sauce, then this problem is avoided.          I've tried four shapes of Tinkyada pasta, and this is definitely my favorite.  The fusilli is like a hollow spaghetti, with a slight twist to it.  With the interesting shape of spiral rotini pasta, but without the bulkiness.  It seems very fancy, but doesn't really cost a whole lot more.  This is the shape we use most often.  We use it with marinara sauce, meat sauce, chicken parmesan, chicken noodle soup, etc.  Very versatile.  Highly recommended to anyone who can't eat wheat gluten.
