We used to use Shake 'n Bake more often a few years ago, and I was curious as to why SnB was being offered for review. Had it changed or improved? By all appearances, no, but it had new packaging. Still, I ordered it and followed the package directions very carefully, maybe using only a slightly thinner cut of chop than pictured on the packaging.          What came out of the oven was what we always had after using SnB: A chop with good flavor, but kind of mushy  eading. The only place where the  eading crisped up was around fat. But, considering that this is how SnB always worked for us before, I wasn't surprised.          The spices used in the mix are the same as the past, and they flavor a chop well. The mushy  eading isn't a big deal   what matters to us is how the food tastes. Boneless pork chops need a lot of help in the flavor department and Shake 'n Bake is one quick and cheap way to dress them up. Three stars means SnB isn't bad, but it's not a taste revelation, either.
