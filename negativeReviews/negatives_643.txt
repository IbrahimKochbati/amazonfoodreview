I can only go as low as 1 star on the review, though I'd like to rate it a "0"  this item still shows in stock, but clearly isn't, which is why my order was canceled from Amazon today. Amazon suggested I search out the item again, and in doing so I see that this same vendor states the item is available. Not so.          Technically this review does not relate to the quality of the product, just the ability to be able to ship it. Good luck!
