My dog won't eat these things. I can offer her nothing else to eat all day and she still will literally turn her back and walk away from these things. I tried gifting them to another small dog owner, only to find they are warned against as a choking hazard. Turns out they are so gummy that they sometimes get stuck in a dog's throat and choke the poor thing to death. Maybe my dog knew something I didn't... or maybe they just don't taste or smell that good to some dogs. Buyer beware. (Message me if you want an almost full 96 count box for just the cost of shipping, since if you are going to buy them, I hate to throw away something someone else can use.)
