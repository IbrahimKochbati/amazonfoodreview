I love this coffee and when I bought it, I also bought another  and. The price, around $20.00 was for two boxes of the other  and. I thought it was a pretty good deal although you can sometimes find it for $9.95 each at Target.  When they arrived, I discovered that I had paid for only one box of Breakfast Blend   a complete rip off.  Even directly from Keurig, it's cheaper.  Will never buy this again.
