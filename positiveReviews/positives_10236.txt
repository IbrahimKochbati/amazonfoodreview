I bought this oil after having the most amazing parmesan truffle fries at a restaurant and wanted to recreate them at home. This oil does not disappoint! I also like that you get two smaller bottles, since truffle oil doesn't have a very long shelf life after opening it. I've been keeping mine in the fridge. Amazing drizzled over roasted potatoes!
