My dogs enjoy any type of "puppy cookie", they're not picky at all. But I noticed that in feeding them this product they started to prefer this  and over all others! I am happy knowing they enjoy it, but I'm even happier knowing that it is filled with all sorts of good "real" food   not by products and what not. I would highly recommend these!
