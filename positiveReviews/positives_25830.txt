I recently bought a 50 pack of the Tully's Italian Roast K cups and could not be more pleased w  my purchased...all of the cups were intact, none were damaged and I have yet to experience any of them exploding in the Keurig machine.          Shipping was rather quick and yes, they did come in a box, they were not in any type of holder inside the box but that was not an issue.          For the $$$ I paid I found this purchase to be a very good value.          My recommendation, buy this and enjoy great tasting coffee from your Keurig.
