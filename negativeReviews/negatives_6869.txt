I was concerned when I received it because of the oil being solidified.  I looked for a date on it to see if it was old product, but did not find any dates.  I tried one package to see how it tasted.  It tasted normal.  It was a little more difficult to get out of the package since I had to do just the oil first to let it melt before putting the popcorn and seasoning parts of the package in.  It would be nice if the packages were dated so that I know how long I have to use them for best results, and I'm really not sure of how old they are to begin with.          So bottom line, I was happy with the taste, but convenience is somewhat diminished because the oil is solid.          Added 11 28 11   I do prefer to use less of the seasoned salt.  It's pretty salty for me, so I just don't use it all and it tastes fine still.
