This is the best chocolate drink I have tasted in a long time. And it's caffeine free! The cinnamon adds a wonderful taste to it! I make it almost every night. I add 2 cups of milk, 1 cup of water and  ing it to a boil. Then add the tablet and let it boil again. It makes about 4 servings. Excellent product!
