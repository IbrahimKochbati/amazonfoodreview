A must have if you are looking for an alternative to a raw food diet.  Both of my pugs LOVE IT!  It is a little pricey, but you only use a tiny scoop for each portion for a small dog. WORD OF CAUTION: after using ZiwiPeak for several months, I noticed my dogs were gaining A LOT of weight.  You really have to stick to the manufacturers directions.  This is dehydrated food and a little goes a long way. I love too that they use ranch raised animals with no hormones or antibiotics or fresh fish not from farms.          From the Raw Food Diet to ZiwiPeak:     After much research and debate with both my husband and my veterinarian, I decided to try a raw food diet.  Well, the raw meat was just nasty and my pug would go for several days without eating.  Proponents of the raw food diet say this is normal because the raw meat bones took longer to digest, but truly, my dog just seemed ravenous.  Normally she was very polite when we ate, now she was begging and even jumping up trying to get food off of the table.  I just couldn't take any more.  Yes, her teeth were gorgeous and her digestion seemed better, but the poor dog seemed very unhappy with her food.  We tried to the frozen food that you thaw out and that worked okay for a while, a nice treat now and then...but then we found ZiwiPeak!
