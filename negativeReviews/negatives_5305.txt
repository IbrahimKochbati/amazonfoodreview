I was looking forward to this mix remembering wonderful Swedish pancakes we used to have in VA. Unfortunately, this mix didn't produce anything close to that   they turned out to be a tasteless version of French crepes. The pancakes also had a vague smell of fish. Considering that now I am stuck with 6 boxes, I am quite disappointed.
