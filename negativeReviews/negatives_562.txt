I received a single 8.5 once container of ONE Coconut water with a splash of Pineapple as part of the Amazon Vine program for review.          It would have been nice if it had come with a straw, especially considering the price of the product. Now as to the "Splash of Pineapple", well it must not have been a very big splash, because I never did taste any pineapple. So what did I taste? It is hard to describe. It doesn't taste like coconut or cane sugar or any "Natural Fruit flavor".          To be honest, it tastes like water,...sort of. Like water with an odd, undefinable extra flavor. It's not a bad flavor or a good flavor, it's just Meh! flavor. I don't care how "healthy" this drink is supposed to be, for it's price, it should have a better flavor, or just have a flavor.          And as a "thirst quencher", it doesn't equal up to Gatorade or even a Lemonade. I feel a glass of tap water would do just as good as job to quench your thirst.
