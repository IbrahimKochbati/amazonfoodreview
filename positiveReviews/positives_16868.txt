My dog Sawyer even as a puppy took right to it.  He drains it pretty quickly, but we fill it with kibble thats different than his standard so its not too many treats.  Its fun to watch him play with it as well, since you can see him focus and think about it.  I recommend this to someone with a puppy that loves to think and do things.
