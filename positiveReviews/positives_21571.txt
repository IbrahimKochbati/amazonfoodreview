Quaker Instant Maple Brown Sugar oatmeal is a hearty dish for  eakfast.  It's tasty, filling, and easy to prepare.  The ease of preparation is important for working folks who don't want to rush to work with an empty stomach.  Combined with a cup of coffee or a glass of orange juice, the oatmeal will definitely hold and fortify you until lunch.          It also makes for a good snack, instead of overly salty and sugar rich foods.  I know many people put sugar and milk in their oatmeal, but I'm a purest.  I enjoy it just plain.  It's sweet enough to tingle one's taste buds, but not so sweet as to make it feel as if you're eating candy.  Instant foods suffer a generally bad reputation.  When "ease of preparation" is a primary consideration, often flavor suffers.  Not so here.  There was plenty of maple flavor.          There are two options for preparing the instant oatmeal, one involving boiling water, the other tap water and the microwave.  I combined the two, because I like really hot oatmeal.  First I added boiling water, as directed, and let the oatmeal stand for a minute or so.  Then I gave it a 15 second nuke in the microwave.  The result was perfect for me.  If this sounds like too much preparation, stick with one of the prescribed methods, listed on the box.          I'm not a really devoted oatmeal eater, so I may not be the ultimate authority on this product.  My review is based on the flavor (quite pleasant), preparation time (swift), and texture (just right, not too watery, not lumpy).  As with any food, individual taste is a major factor.
