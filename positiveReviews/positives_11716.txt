The Pamela's Products Whenever Bars in Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut flavor are a great snack.  The bar has a oatmeal cookie flavor and consistency.  They are not low in fat, so one is more than enough.  I highly recommend for those who love chocolate and coconut and are looking for a somewhat healthy snack.
