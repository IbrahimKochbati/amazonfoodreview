I rescued my dog a year ago. Ever since then, I've been feeding him Newman's. I like that the main ingredient is a form of meat and there isn't a lot of grain type of ingredients. All of the ingredients are organic, so it's really good for my dog. I've tried several other  ands with my dog. But I don't think he's really allergic to anything or has a distaste for anything in particular. And since this is one of the cheaper  ands out there that is still nutritious, I decided to stick to this  and. Ordering it on Amazon is very convenient because I can use the Subscribe & Save feature and set the schedule of when I want the dog food delivered. I never have to worry about running out of dog food!
