Growing up, Shake'N Bake was a primary staple in our household. I can still remember the anticipation knowing that my mom was using this product to complete our dinner.          Fast forward thirty, okay, forty years and when I realized I hadn't used Shake'N Bake in more years than I wanted to admit, I jumped at the chance to try this out.          It was exactly as I remembered.  The 2.05 ounce pouch holds just enough seasoning for an entire cut up chicken.  I used five  easts and they were coated perfectly.  It was just that easy.  And just that tasty!          I would definitely use this product again.  The spices are just right without being overpowering and the mixture coats the chicken just as intended.
