Received this order promptly, but am very disappointed in it.  Over half of the k cups have exploded in our Keurig.  When this happens it makes a huge mess.  The machine has to be totally cleaned each time.  It appears that the seal at the top of the kcups is not properly attached.  The ones that do survive make excellent tasting coffee, but I will not reorder them online again.  Very disappointed, makes some of the best tasting coffee we have tried, but only got to drink a little of it.
