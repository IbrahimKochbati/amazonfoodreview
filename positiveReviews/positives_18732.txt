Some people may put Shake N Bake anything in the same category as Ramen Noodles, but I don't really care about all that. This little pouch is a life saver, not to mention time saver. I have an 18 month old and sometimes attempting to cook anything is impossible. I need something quick and easy. Well, this is it. Literally, just shake and bake. Anybody can do this, it requires zero skill. And it actually is tasty. I leave mine in the oven a couple minutes longer than the suggested time, because I like my chicken somewhat on the crispy side. Pair it with anything you want, for you can't go wrong!
