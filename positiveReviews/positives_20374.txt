This cereal is great.  It is very light and fluffy in the container and mixes to a nice smooth consistency.  My daughter enjoys this much more than other  ands she has tried.  She opens her mouth and grabs the spoon to help.  She has not had any problems with constipation.  Would have been five stars, but the container is only 2 3 full.  Either provide more cereal in each container or put the cereal into smaller containers.  I want healthy products that are earth friendly, as well.
