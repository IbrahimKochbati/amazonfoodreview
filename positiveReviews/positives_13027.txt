I've tried a number of Chef Boyardee products sold through Amazon.  I buy them because they're cheap and convenient. I don't buy them in the expectation of great pasta dishes although it's always nice if one of these products is better than my expectations. The overstuffed Italian sausage ravioli was one that was better than my expectations. Currently, this is my ranking for the products I have actually sampled:          1. Overstuffed Italian sausage ravioli     2. Jumbo spaghetti and meatballs     3. Overstuffed beef ravioli     4. Beefaroni with whole grain pasta          This product distinguishes itself from things like the Beefaroni by having real identifiable neat. It is better than the beef ravioli because the sausage is actually flavorful and tasty whereas the beef ravioli is bland. it is roughly on a par with the spaghetti except that I like the texture and taste better than the spaghetti (but my girlfriend prefers the spaghetti, which she gobbles up in no time).          This ravioli is about as good as we're going to get in a can. Canning pasta faces one major chalkenge: it tastes like pasta stored in a can. Chef Boyardee hasn't found a way around this, and I'm not sure there is one.          If you buy this product, be aware that each can has two servings, and each serving has plenty of sodium. Eating one full can will leave little leeway for more during the day if you have high blood pressure.          However, I think this product is tasty enough that I will be buying more. That isn't true of the overstuffed beef ravioli.          PS: Some reviewers claim that Amazon is selling seconds because some cans were dented. This is a very infrequent occurrence for me, and I tend to doubt that Amazon is selling something graded this way. Besides, I often see supermarkets selling dented cans  even more often than Amazon.
