One of my two male Shih tzus absolutely LIVES for his Greenie which he knows he gets to have after our morning walk, so they are an item that I cannot run out of! I haven't tasted the myself, not being a dog, and they do not smell good to me, either, but I buy these regularly and the ones I purchased here are the best price I have seen!
