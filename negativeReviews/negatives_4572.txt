If you read the product description for the listed Keurig, it states:          "Keurig B60 Single Cup Coffee Maker The Keurig B60 Single Cup Brewer is the mid luxury home  ewing system in the Keurig line, and offers a blend of styling and convenient features. This Special Edition features chrome accents, a blue backlit LCD and three  ew size options. Programmable features include a digital clock, adjustable temperature, and auto on off. The 48 oz. removable water reservoir holds up to eight cups before refilling, and the removable drip tray allows for easy cleaning and the use of travel mugs. # Convenient single cup  ewing # Includes 12 count K Cup variety pack # Fast and easy with no mess # 3 cup size options (6, 8, and 10 ounces) # Removable 48 oz. reservoir # Programmable LCD message center # Blue backlit LCD and reservoir # Stylish chrome accents"          I'm not sure if anyone else picked up on this but the description is for the "better quality" Keurig model. No chrome, no backlit LCD, no programmable features and it only has two  ew sizes not one. When I ordered this I knew which product I was getting based on the picture but others might be a bit disappointed. Something you might want to fix Amazon!          I can't review the actual product as I haven't tried it yet. Update soon.
