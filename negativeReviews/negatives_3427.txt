The flavor of the Big Easy Bold is good. But, about every third cup overflows out the top of the cup making a huge mess. It's as if the hole on the bottom gets plugged and the remaining coffee has nowhere to go but out the top...and all over the place. If this happened two or three times I'd give it four stars.
