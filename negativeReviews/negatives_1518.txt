On the plus side, they get the flavor and carbonation right here.  One fears a Tang taste, but it's more subtle than that and the bubbles are likewise discrete enough that it's no Fizzy Lifting Drink.          On the downside though, one would prefer a sharper after taste to the sort of syrupy way it stays on the tongue.
