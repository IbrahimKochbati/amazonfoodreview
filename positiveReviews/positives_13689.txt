This is the way the local shops get their Haribo Gummy goods, and now you can too. You will never buy the little retail packs again when you realize how HUGE a five pound bag is for such an incredibly low priced.          With Amazon Prime, every time my son (a Gummy Frog ADDICT) does something kudos worthy, it's virtually an overnight process    and not much more expensive    to say "Good going on acing your finals" in a much more highly appreciated way than with just a card.
