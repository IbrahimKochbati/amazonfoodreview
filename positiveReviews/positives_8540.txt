These are fabulous! I saw in an online review of Dr. Lucy's cookies someone complaining about  oken cookies when they arrived. Yes, some of the cookies will be  oken, though not a lot. I think they  eak because of their unusual texture. I wish I knew the trick of making a cookie like this. They taste great, but a big part of what I just love about these cookies is their texture    it's that airyness and crispness. Personally, they are addictive. I finished my first two boxes (I had bought, as a test, one of the 16 pack boxes in Cinnamon and one in Sugar) and sadly after a month or so I had eaten them all. I tried baking something simliar and couldn't do it    though when I have mroe time, I'll give it many more tries. So just a couple days ago, I ordered a 16 pack box or cinnamon, sugar, and now I'm trying for the first time the oatmeal. I do recommend these cookies; they are my afternoon treat    one pack of cookies (only 120 calories) and a good cup of decaf coffee and I'm fine till dinner!
