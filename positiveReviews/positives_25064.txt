My dog loves these and they are the perfect size so he can have a few a day. One of my favorite things about fruitables is that they smell good! They don't make my dog's  eath smell weird or my hands after I give them to him. This was my first time buying this flavor and my dog loves them. I also recommend the apple bacon (same skinny mini size) and pumpkin apple (larger sized treats).
