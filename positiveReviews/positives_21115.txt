I agree with the other reviewer "Ian" that THIS IS THE BEST canned coffee out there. I have tried Starbucks, and the Illy Cafe'  and and it's good, but not as good (In my humble opinion) as this Singapore distributed; Pokka Milk Coffee.            I first discovered this coffee when I was at Epcot Center, in Disney World Orlando. My wife and daughter were shopping in Japan Land and there was a refreshment kiosk with a huge barrel bucket of Pokka Canned Coffee on ice.     I neede a quick caffine hit as Epcot is huge (Walking forever!) and was more than pleasantly surprised at the flavor of Pokka. It tastes great and gives you that boost of caffine to keep you rolling along. I conquered Epcot and went back for another can of Pokka before the drive home to Tampa!!            Now, I keep them in the fridge at home for a wake me up on my drive to work. You have to at least try it and see.     I think you'll be a happy camper!          Jim, Tampa Fla.
