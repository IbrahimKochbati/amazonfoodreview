Having recently turned Vegan, I had to buy my mandatory supply of tofu. This stuff is the bomb! I haven't done a lot of exotic things with it thus far, but I LOVE to use it as a salad dressing potato topper. I crack open a  ick, dump it into the blender, add a little vinegar, a little soy milk, onion power, dill weed, chives, tiny bit of celery seed & a generous dose of nutritional yeast. I blend all that up till it's smooth, and then store it in a GLAD container in the icebox. Stays fresh for about 4 days. I like to just dump this stuff all over my meal of baked potatoes & romaine lettuce.          I can't wait to explore ALL the options with this stuff. Banana pudding may be next!
