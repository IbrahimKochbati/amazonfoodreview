I feel good about giving these to my dog because of the organics bit. I have one of those dogs who will eat almost anything.  She sits pretty for these, then takes them.  She doesn't devour them immediately or swallow whole like she does a lot of other snacks I give her.  She drops, sniffs and then carries it off to eat slowly under the bed.  That's probably not a bad thing.  It also may have something to do with the shape.  They are rectangular, about 1"x 2" and about 1 8 of an inch thick.  They are scored so you can  eak them into squares. They are very dry, crunchy treats.  I believe that is the reason she drops them and picks them up is because of the flat wide long shape; she has to get them situated in her mouth.  She is an 8 year old, 21 lbs mutt...looks like a miniature Chow Chow or a really large Pom...meaning she has a normal snout, not like a pug or peke. Anyway, these are slightly too large for her mouth, so if your dog is smaller, they may not work so well.
