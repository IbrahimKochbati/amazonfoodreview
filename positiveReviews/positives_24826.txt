This is no meal replacement for an adult, but it hits all the right spots.          It's a decent size, it cooks perfectly in the microwave in just 1 minute, and it's not unhealthy.          If your kids want a quick, easy to prepare snack meal this is it. Or... if you're like me, and you want a quick snack... here it is :)
