6 of 6 cans received damaged   Product Outstanding.     Quality of product for the price paid is a good bang for the buck.     Unable to use one of the cans because of extreem damage.     Product was well packaged with no sign of damage on box.     I expect product was shipped dammaged, however no     bubble rapp was used.
