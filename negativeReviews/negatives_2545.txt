Is this hot chocolate....yes     Is this good hot chocolate....um, sorta     Is this gourmet hot chocolate....not a chance.          In my opinion, the only advantage you get but using the Green Mountain K cups of hot chocolate is the simplicity of using your Keurig machine to heat the water instead of using the microwave or stove top. Other than that the finished product is comparable to any Swiss Miss or other  and of powdered instant cocoa. It actually may be worse if you use the largest setting on your machine. The largest setting makes it much too watery.          Green Mountain needs to go back to the drawing board on this.          3 stars because it does make hot chocolate in your Keurig without having to dirty dishes and tear open pouches, but if you're looking for good hot chocolate, keep shopping.
