Last year I tasted several of the Izze fruit drinks for the first time and became addicted.  I have an affinity for fruity foods and beverages, and that fact combined with my positive experiences with Izze prompted me to try THE SWITCH.          I'll say it right off the bat   THE SWITCH was okay, but it doesn't really compare in taste to Izze.  If I had never tasted Izze, I might enjoy THE SWITCH more.  As it is, I thought it was tasty enough, but I wouldn't drive out of my way to get it.  If I were in the convenience store looking for a refreshing fruity beverage, I might buy it again.          I tried two different flavors of THE SWITCH, and the Kiwi Berry was my least favorite of the two flavors (the other was Black Cherry).  The kiwi berry flavor was nice, but a little bit muddled for me.  However, the fruit flavors did taste natural   I just think I would have preferred a simple Kiwi flavor instead of the blend.          To sum up, I think THE SWITCH is a nice alternative to sodas, although a little pricier than colas are.  It is a refreshing fruit beverage, but there are other  ands that have a tastier flavor.          If Amazon allowed half star ratings, I would give this 3.5 stars.
