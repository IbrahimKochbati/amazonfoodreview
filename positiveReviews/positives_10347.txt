These are my favorite flavor of pop tart.  No doubt about it, low fat pop tarts just taste better.  I find that they toast better, taste better, and I feel less guilty after I eat two. Win, Win, Win. I will mention this for some of those sillies out there:  Don't think this counts as your daily serving of fruit. Yes, it does say "made with real fruit" however, it is so miniscule that it doesn't count. Sorry.
