These are so nice and creamy!  Usually I don't justify buying k cups for things like cocoa that you can get cheaper in a packet, but this is so convenient and very good tasting .. way better than most powdered cocoa packets I've tried.  As far as price comparison, it is equivalent to gourmet types of cocoa that would easily cost $1+ per packet.  I also like that it comes in a variety pack with 3 flavor options.  Highly recommend
