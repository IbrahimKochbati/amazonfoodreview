This is pretty decent coffee, for pre ground decaf.  Here's how a coffee snob reviews it:          * Unpacking *     This coffee had to travel a long way to reach my house, and it was hot out.  Heat and time are enemies of fresh coffee.  The package was pretty hard to open, I resorted to scissors.  The grind is very uniform with no detectible dust.  The smell is stale compared to the local fresh roasted, non decaf, beans I usually buy.          * Brewing *     I busted out my cone and loaded two servings into a Melitta filter.  I poured two cups of 200F water through.  The uniform grind is apparent in that the coffee didn't clog as it does with blade ground coffee (due to dust).  I drank the coffee black...          * Tasting *     The smell is of decaf and or instant coffee.  Pretty stale but the decaf process is partly to blame.  Overall I enjoyed it as much as any drip decaf I've had recently.  There was no biting bitterness.  I drank two cups black without much of a gut ache.          Pros:       Tight packaging with little air helps maintain freshness.       Excellent grind uniformity.       Low bitterness          Cons:       Not locally roasted.       Not fresh. Best by date is a year in advance.          Verdict: For mail order, pre ground decaf, this coffee lived up to expectations and was drinkable.  3 or 4 stars.
