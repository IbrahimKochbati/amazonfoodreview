my pug misty is 7 years old i have given her greenies seince she was 4 months old. i give her 1 a day as a treat. i give them on the second time she goes out side in the morning and she loves them more than anything else that she gets and she knows what time it is. her teeth have been cleaned once the vet said her teeth are perfect. i buy greenies from amazon beacause the service and the price is the best there is.  billy j.  alabama.
