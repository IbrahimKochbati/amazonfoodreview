But don't take my word for it.  Read those of a serious chocolate lover and reviewer:          [...]          I think he's  illiant, but then maybe that's because I agree wholeheartedly with him that Callebaut Bittersweet chocolate is simply the best.  Whether making a ganache for a triple layer devil's food chocolate cake or eating straight (after cutting with a very big knife), nothing else comes close.
