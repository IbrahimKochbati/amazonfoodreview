The Good:          Walker short ead cookies are my favorite, I love them.  I bought the highlanders and each set of cookies came individually wrapped with two cookies each.  If this were the end of it, a five star review.          The Bad:          Unfortunately, Amazon shipped them in a box that was about the same size as the container they came in from the Walkers cookie company.  After UPS was through with the shipment, my cookies were reduced to crumbs.  I contacted Amazon about this problem without ever receiving a response.  Since I bought these "Shipped and Sold by Amazon", I won't be purchasing these cookies from Amazon again.
