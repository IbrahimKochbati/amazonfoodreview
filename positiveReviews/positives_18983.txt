I have 7 cats, ranging in age from 15 years, down to 2 years & they ALL LOVE THIS!  I used to feed them another  and of food (they're all indoor cats) & when I introduced them to this food, they couldn't get enough of it!  They've been eating this food EXCLUSIVELY for at LEAST 7 years now (obviously, the younger ones have been eating it for less time) & NONE of them has EVER been sick from it!
