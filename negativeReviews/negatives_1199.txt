I was drinking Yuban Organic medium roast coffee until I could not find it anymore at my local grocery store so I tried this instead.  What a let down after drinking the organic coffee.  This just tastes like average grocery store coffee comparable to Folgers but the organic stuff, now that's a different story. That stuff is good. Tastes damn near as good as the fresh stuff you can buy at Dunn Bros or Caribou coffee houses.  Don't believe me try both this and the organic version side by side.  You won't go back to this again I promise you that if you have any coffee sense at all.
