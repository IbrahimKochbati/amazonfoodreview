Carbquik delivers exactly what it says: a way to make your food significantly lower in carbohydrates without compromising the taste. They provide some basic recipes, but as we all know, the fun of it is experimenting and tweaking a recipe to fit ones taste or develop your own.  I would highly recommend this product for those on a low carb diet or anyone who is diabetic. It will only enhance your quality of life ;o)  That being said, it would be beyond foolish to buy this product from Amazon's site. Bear in mind, I'm a HUGE Amazon.com fan and order primarily from them; usually 2 3 times a week as I am disabled and not able to leave the house very often.  I would give Carbquik a 5 star rating, BUT do NOT buy from here as this price is ridiculously high. You will be paying around twice as much here as you can get it on Netrition.com and that is with shipping costs. Currently this costs $11.99 with a flat rate of shipping of $4.95 for all you order. Significant savings. Hope this helps all that is considering this product.  And Amazon??? Let's quit with the underhanded gouging.
