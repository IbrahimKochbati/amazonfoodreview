I've ordered from this company before and they haven't failed me. Well, I was a bit disappointed in the craftsmanship of the little planter vase it came in. The panda is poorly painted. But all in all, the bamboo is in tact and because of an easy transaction and speedy delivery (faster than usual for regular shipping), I am glad that my friend will have it in time as a Christmas gift.
