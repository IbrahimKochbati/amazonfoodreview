This product is quite delicious. I'm eating a bowl as I type this review!          The noodles come in a circular disc, like most ramen. There are two little packets included. One has dried "vegetables." This packet includes seaweed, what looks like kimche, and a whole load of circular processed fish discs. The second packet is seafood flavoring.          The noodles are of good quality, and the veggies are very good too! There is a very very mild hint of spice to it, but not enough for me! (I added hot sauce, mmm mmmm delicious!)          There is a catch however. Your ramen will most likely come in  oken pieces. The one I am eating now was  oken into 3 4 pieces. The one I had before this was also  oken into 2 3 pieces. The one before that wasn;t  oken at all. (Out of a pack of 20 packages...) No big deal, I usually crush the heck out of them before I add to the water anyways.          5 stars. I have Amazon shipping me 1 of these every other month. Mmmmmm! (The whole house smells like lobster!!!)
