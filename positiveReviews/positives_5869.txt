My little girl (6 months) can't stomach any formula.  Even Nutramigen, at $35 per can made her colicky and sick (accompanied with the worst smelling spit up).  The expensive formulas smelled bad, and tasted worse, I hated giving them to her.  Goats milk was recommended to me.  Her doctor's only objection was that it was low in Folic Acid and tended to dehydrate babies.  Well, Meyenberg Powdered Milk  is fortified with Folic Acid, so dilute it with a little extra water and you're in business!  I now have the happiest infant you've ever seen.  Enfamil can take that nasty chemical soup they call formula and shove it, I'll never go back.          You can get the formula Recipe at:     [...]          There have been concerns about arsenic in rice syrup lately, so I have been using Lyle's Golden Syrup, and she likes it fine (Also it's the best pancake syrup you'll ever have).  I am going to try barley malt syrup next, it is chemically more similar to rice syrup.
