Earth's Best Turkey Vegetable Dinner hits the spot with apples with turkey. You can add cranberries if you want to take it to the next level.  I just can't find non sweetened and non dried cranberries even at the better food stores.          Apples, carrots and turkey taste good to my 10 month old growing twin girls.  Babies love carrots since they're sweet to their taste, so that made a great addition.  The whole barley flour absorbs the water to give it an acceptable consistency.          The ingredients per the label: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, mechanically separated organic turkey, organic whole barley flour.          In addition to 12% protein and 50% vitamin A, it has 6% calcium and 4% iron.          I'm very pleased my babies like this food and are being introduced to so many foods through Earth's Best.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.
