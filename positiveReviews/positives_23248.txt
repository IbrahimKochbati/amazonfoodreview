This is the best all around GF  ead I've found. The taste and texture are good. It stays moist and soft even after refrigeration or sitting in a lunch box for a few hours. To save money I bake mostly from scratch, but I can't find a  ead recipe that matches the all the wonderful qualities of this  ead. No microwaving necessary with this  ead. The only dowside I've found, is that its a little dense.
