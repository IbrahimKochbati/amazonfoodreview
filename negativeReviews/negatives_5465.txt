On a scale of one to ten, Maxwell House being a one and Gevalia being a ten this coffee tastes somewhere around three or maybe four at best. It claims to be a gourmet coffee but it sure doesn't taste that way to me. As for the acid level of the coffee since I'm on meds for the acid reflux there's no way for me to tell if it works or not. It claims to have less then 50% of the acid levels of regular coffee. For me 50% wouldn't do it. It would have to be acid free.
