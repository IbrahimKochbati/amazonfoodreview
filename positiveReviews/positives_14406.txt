What can you say about Zukes PB Hip Action treats that hasn't been said already? My dog loves peanut butter and these treats are full of peanut butter as well as 300 mg of glucosamine and 50 mg of chondroitin which keep her 6 year old joints flexible for those long hikes and swims.          And Zukes donates a portion of its proceeds to the dog & cat cancer fund every year and makes all its products wheat,corn and soy free who ever heard of a vegan dog?
