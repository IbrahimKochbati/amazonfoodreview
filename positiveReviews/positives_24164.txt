Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.          Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile. I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some  ands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.          I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.          Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.          If you really, truly like chamomile tea, or own a restaurant, this ginormous box of 1,000 single serving tea bags is a good choice.
