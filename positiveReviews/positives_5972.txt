Great product!          I purchased this product from our local Fresh Market. I am a vegan and am always looking for different "meat" substitutes to try. I used this mix to make some taco mince. This stuff was perfect! I even got my non veg. father to try a bite of the tacos and he thought they were good as well. That right there is saying something, because my father is really iffy about mock meats.          I have another packet in which I am going to cook up today!
