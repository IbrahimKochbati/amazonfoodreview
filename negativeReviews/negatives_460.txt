I bought the mix at the same time as the Oster 3874 waffle maker and have been pleased with the results: light, well baked waffles that tasted good.  My problems with the mix were first the expense, secondly that the mix is very finely ground and flies around when poured and there may some sort of perfume added to it.  It simply smells too good.          I am happy with the product but will probably not reorder it.
