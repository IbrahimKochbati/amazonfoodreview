I use this as iced tea and have been using large amounts of this product for some time.  It is $3.39 box localy.  I use a box every 4 days.  It adds up to allot of money.  Buying this on subscription, I am paying about $2.50 box (no shipping fee for Prime members).  That is a substantial difference in price.     Next....  This is a delightful iced tea.  To make 1 gallon I steep 10 bags in a about 2 cups water, and then steep them a second time.  Wring them out and add all to pitcher.  I then add 40 tabs equal and 2 individual packets lemonade (the kind intended for bottled water) and get a wonderful beverage that everyone loves.  Enjoy!!!!
