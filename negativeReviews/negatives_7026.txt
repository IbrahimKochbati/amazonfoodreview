I will not buy this again. This tasted more like milk chocolate than dark chocolate to me. It was way to sweet! It is not "quality" chocolate in my opinion. It tasted like that cheap chocolate they put in those colorful dots that come thin plastic holders. Actually, I prefer that chocolate to this. If you are looking for real dark chocolate this is not for you.
