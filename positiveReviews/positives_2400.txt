I must admit when I first ordered this  ead for my new Panasonic  ead maker, I was not expecting anything other than potato  ead such as I buy at a nearby store. However, was I ever surprised! It was absolutely the best stuff and with some organic butter piled high and properly melted it was on a par with am osia. I just could not believe how good it was and is. Since the first loaf, I have made other  eads which have been generally excellent but none are quite at the level of this potato  ead. It is REALLY good! Perhaps the credit goes to my new  ead machine! Highly recommended!!!  GENERAL INFO: The package makes a 1.5 pound loaf. On my machine the recommended setting is BASIC and the loaf bakes in 4 hours. Also, the flour is NON GMO Verified as labelled.
