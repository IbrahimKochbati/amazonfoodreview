this candy is made with 100% wisconsin american ginseng.  sugar and glucose are the first two ingredients, so you can expect it to be sweet.  as you suck on the candy and it dissolves, there are pieces of ginseng imbedded in the candy.  20 calories, and carbs 2%.  there's around 25 round pieces of candy in the tin, lightly powdered white sugar on them.  it does have a ginseng flavor, but not real strong or rooty.  not bad, inexpensive candy in a round tin.  i'll probably buy more once this runs out.
