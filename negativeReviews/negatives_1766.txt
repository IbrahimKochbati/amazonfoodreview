Zero stars for this item.  I couldn't even confirm that the wrinkled little animal offal sort of thing is a truffle.  This lacks any aromatic attraction at all.  I'd be afraid to put it in anything I planned to eat for fear it would ruin the entire item.          As for the famous JR service, my complaints about this product have been ignored.
