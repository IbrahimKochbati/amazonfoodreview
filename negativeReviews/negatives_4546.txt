We love Happy Baby products   cereals, puffs, yogurt melts, all the baby food   EXCEPT Gobble Gobble. Even my 3 year old choked on this. It really ticked me off when my 1 year old choked too! It is EXTREMELY dry and thick and lumpy. I cannot believe Happy Baby manufacturers and sells this stuff, and I can't believe retailers stock it. DO NOT BUY!
