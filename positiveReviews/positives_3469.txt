I love coffee and admit that I am particular when it comes to good coffee.  I was not expecting much from this coffee and was pleasantly surprised to discover it was quite good.  It falls into the likes of Starbucks and other shade grown coffee  ands    deep, rich flavor.          Though I enjoyed it, I am not sure I would purchase this unless it was on sale.  I do find it a bit overpriced.  If you don't mind spending the money, you will be happy with this coffee.  Otherwise, I would suggest purchasing this on sale for a special occasion.
