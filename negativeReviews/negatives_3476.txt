I thought this sounded like the perfect solution for taking nutritious wholesome food with us for our 8 month old baby on our vacation out of the country where I am worried we won't have very many fruit and vegetable options.  I have been making my own baby food with organic ingredients for the last 2 months.  I was excited to get the package today and ripped open the sweet potatoes, one of my daughter's homemade favorites.  I was extremely disgusted by the smell of the powder but decided to put some water in and give it a try anyway (hoping that the hydration would somehow help the mixture).  I tried a bite and these don't even taste anything like sweet potatoes.  They are very dark  own and tasted like minerals and quite unnatural.  My daughter ate the two bites I gave her but I felt too guilty feeding her anymore and dumped out the bowl...and my garbage smells terrible now.
