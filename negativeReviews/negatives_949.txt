I had this product for literally only a week, and had only used it one time. When trying to use it again I found that it wasn't sending the sound through. When I plug it into my PC, it recognizes it and the icicle lights up, and i select it as my recording device, but then when i actually try to record, it makes no sound at all (and i have tried moving the gain knob around so it's not that) This was a complete waste of money, unless there's an easy fix that i'm missing...
