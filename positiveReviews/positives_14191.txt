I had been drinking 3 4 16 oz mugs of Yogi Egyptian Licorice tea for a couple years. Six or more months ago I tried the Yogi Egyptian MINT Herbal tea, which is even better.  The mint is soothing to the digestive system .  It is especially calming to drink at night before bed...But then again it is great in the morning after  my usual cup of coffee.  Now I give it to friends when they have digestive problems.  You can't go wrong if you like licorice and mint..its the best combination     ENJOY a mug full
