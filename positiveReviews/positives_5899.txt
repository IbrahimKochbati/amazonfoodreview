This is a great price for powdered goat milk. At the local health food store (the only place in town that carries goat milk), I buy just one of these cans for $15. $20 for three cans is the best price I've found!          I use goat milk for my children, when they are in the process of weaning, and as long as they want it. It is so much healthier than formula because, well, it's not soy or dairy based, and has no chemicals and added vitamins that try to mimic  eastmilk. Goat milk is more similar to  eastmilk than dairy, so is much easier for humans to digest than cow milk. I find it to be a great alternative for babies as they adjust, or for those who cannot tolerate dairy.          For warm bottles for my 14 month old, I just heat water on the stove, then pour it into her glass bottle with a scoop of goat milk. Shake it up and she has her favorite drink (Other than momma's milk, of course)!
