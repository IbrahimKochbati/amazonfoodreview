I have a 12 year old Corgi that has been having problems going up and down stairs, has had no interest in playing with toys over the last year.  Went to the Vet and they gave him Rimadyl.  This helped some but still was having issues, and having to carry him up and down stairs.          Started giving him the Zukes on a whim after seeing it in the local pet store.  This stuff WORKS I am sold.  He is playing with other dogs now, goes up and down the stairs,  ings toys for us to play with him again.  He is like his old self again.
