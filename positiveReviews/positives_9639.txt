I love coffee. Usually I would not recommend Maxwell House as I consider it a "supermarket  and". I was very surprised with the quality of this cappuccino. My wife loves it too!          Contrary to instructions, we  ew milk first then the espresso, this makes it look very nice, especially on a transparent cup. The taste is smooth and velvety, with low acidity and aftertaste. You can buy extra espresso T Discs separately and  ew an extra shot if you really like your coffee bold (like I do).          In about a minute, you have a cappuccino that is as good as that of many coffee shops. Yes, it is not nearly close to making my personal list of best coffees I have tested, but you can't beat the convenience and cost. We also use it a lot to entertain guests at our house. Works great with any dessert.          Instead of buying them one box for 6 coffees at a time, this 5 pack from Amazon really saves us money. Each set comes with 16 T Discs: 8 espresso and 8 milk. So this 5 pack will be good for 40 cappuccinos.
