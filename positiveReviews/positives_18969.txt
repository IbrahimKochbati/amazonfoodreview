I could not find this soup at my local grocer so was very relieved to find it here in cases.          You cannot beat the price because a single can runs over $3.  I am on the Subscriber Savings plan but do not          plan to purchase another 12 cans until these are gone so am happy that I was able to lock in a good deal ($29.00)          Also try the tomato soup.  Very tasty!
