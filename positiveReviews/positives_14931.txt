Can't find this dressing here in S.FL, but my folks got it in N.C. and I used it up so fast!! Didn't want to wait until next summer to get more, found it here on Amazon. Priced much higher than they pay, but it's worth it! This is the best Ceasar dressing made. Delivery was fast and now I have enough to get me through the winter!!!!
