I'm always looking for new flavors for my cooking. Supposedly, sumac gives a lemon flavor. I tried using it in rice and with fish, but I can't tell that it's even there. I'm not even sure if it is supposed to be cooked. Maybe it should be just sprinkled on after cooking. I've used it in tandem with preserved lemons, but I think it was the lemons that gave the dish such a strong lemon flavor.
