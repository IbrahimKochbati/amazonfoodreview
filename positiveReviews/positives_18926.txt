Being on a strict diet of NO gluten I have had to give up a lot of great tasting food.  It's the simple things that you miss the most and take for granted.  I wanted yougurt with granola really bad, and you just can't have any granola.  I came across Bakery on Main Triple Berry and fell in love.  I could eat it plain or mixed in something like yougurt.  I was wonderful.  The best thing...no rasins.  Whether you are looking for a great complimentary item for something else or a granola you can eat plain, this is wonderful.  I highly recommend it.
