These are better than the usual canned fish filets, tastier, and not dry.  There are no bones or skins.  I worried about Mackerel but they are much nicer than, say, kippered herring filets or sardines in oil.  It's easy to pour off the olive oil if that is a worry, but you'd be losing something that is also tasty.
