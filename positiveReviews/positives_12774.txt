This is the same Turkish tea you can drink in kebab establishments in Europe. It's typically served in tiny, tulip shaped glasses on small saucers. On a cold day, it's really warming, and it's even refreshing in summer.          This tea is  ewed in a two part teapot, typically stainless steel with a big pitcher below for hot water and a smaller teapot on top for  ewing a strong infusion of the tea. You set the teapot on top of the hot water to  ew, then use the hot water to dilute the tea to desired strength. This is similar to the way Russian tea is  ewed in a samovar.          One thing about this tea; there is a lot of tea leaf dust in the package. To avoid a sort of off flavor contributed by the dust, it's easy to wash the leaves before  ewing. I put the tea into a tea strainer, pour hot water over the leaves and discard the water. The leaves go into the pot for  ewing. This really improves the flavor. It's not unusual to "wash" tea leaves; in China, tea is often made by throwing off the first water infusion and quickly re infusing the wet leaves.          The flavor of this tea is more like Russian or China black tea  less snappy and tannic than Assam or Darjeeling.
