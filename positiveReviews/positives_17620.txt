I received a trial packet that made one pot of this coffee. I think it's a good product to try if you like coffee but have to limit your consumption because too much coffee can irritate your stomach.  The aroma is nice and the flavor is good. It still has that little tanginess that makes coffee taste good   without the stomach discomfort that sometimes follows. I didn't add sugar or cream. It's worth a try.
