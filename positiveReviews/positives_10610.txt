Don't care for creamy cappuccinos.  And you won't find me sipping a double mocha cinnamon latte that costs half a paycheck.  As far as I'm concerned espressos are for those shoppers with ten items or less.  Just pour me a cup of rich, hot coffee,  ewed in a Mr. Coffee or a Bunn.  And if the coffee being  ewed is FOLGERS CLASSIC ROAST GROUND COFFEE, I know I'm going to enjoy every drop.          Folgers, an American fixture in kitchen pantries for generations, boasts about its mountain grown coffees.  I know this because Mrs. Olsen told me (and you oldtimers will know what I'm talking about).  Thing is, there's nothing better in the morning than waking up to the rich aroma of Folgers Classic Roast  ewing in the coffee maker; it's one of the most recognizable aromas to stir the olfactories.  Folgers makes a variety of blends, but I prefer the Classic Roast; as a lifelong Folgers drinker the classic is the same  and I enjoyed as a young whippersnapper.  Yet on the high tech side, Folgers has the unique interlocking AromaSeal that preserves freshness. . .sans can openers.  The easy grip handles are pretty. . .handy, too.          So pay through the noggin for lima bean espresso if that floats your boat; I'll take my can of FOLGERS CLASSIC ROAST GROUND COFFEE, thank you very much.  This stuff is good  good to the last drop.  Where have I heard that before?       D. Mikels, Esq.
