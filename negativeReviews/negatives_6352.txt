I have bought these twice now. The first order was great, great flavor, crunchy, very fresh tasting. I was so impressed I quickly ordered a second batch. Since the first were so fresh, I figured they'd last awhile.          The second batch was bad. Stale and not very crisp with a sort of mild chemical taste rather then that nice cheesy flavor. I had a hard time believing they were even the same product. I'm eating them slowly because I generally don't believe in wasting food that is edible, but I hesitate now to try other things.
