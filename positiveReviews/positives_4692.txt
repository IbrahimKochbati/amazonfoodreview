I usually buy this from Starbucks, but after buying this item on sale I will be making my coffee at home. I am not a heavy coffee drinker but sometimes when I have to study I need a quick pick me up and this will do it. I love all their product. Sometimes I add a little cinnamon grade AA and it really gives it a boost. I would definitely buy this product again and I think it is a good price. I saw it for a lot more in the store.
