We have been following Primal Blueprint for almost two months, and it was recommended by Mark to get grass fed butter and ghee.  My husband and I had never had ghee, and are extremely pleased with this product!  Smells and tastes delicious, like move theater butter, and is so good for us too.  Only problem is we ran out  too fast...great product.
