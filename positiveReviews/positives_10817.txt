My dog really likes these treats.  They come in a domino like biscuit that can be  oken into two pieces that are roughly 1" square.  I found it interesting that these appear to be hand cut as the biscuits are not all exactly the same size.  They look like a fig newton but with a scoring in the middle.          These are very hard treats.  My dog is 5 months and is just getting her permanent teeth and I was worried that they might be too hard, but she absolutely loves them and had no trouble chewing. She likes most treats, but she seems to be especially fond of these. They will be perfect for pocket treats as they will neither stink up my pocket (the barley makes them smell like a good  ead) or crumble like milk bone treats.          Although they are called lamb and barley treats, the ingredients include carrots and apples, two of her favorites.          I will definitely buy more of these, but due to the price I will also continue to use fresh carrots and apples for at home treats and use these for training or special treats.
