I usually make my popcorn on the stove but when I got a popcorn machine I quickly noticed you can't use the same methods and decided to buy these packets.  The popcorn doesn't come out the same as when I make it on the stove but it is good nonetheless (a diff type of good) plus much less hassle.  I was worried when I read other reviews about the "stale" taste and oil...I didn't have any of that.  When the box came some of the oil was liquid and other packets were solid, it worried me but I found out that the oil had just hardened (it happens according to the temp of my house) which is quickly fixed when you pour the stuff into your hot popcorn maker.  No complaints here!
