My dog loves sweet potatoes.  She has sweet potato dog food and her hands down favorite treats ever are duck and sweet potatoes with a close second and third being salmon and sweet potatoes and frozen blueberries.  The  eeder encouraged both as well as other great natural foods for my sweetheart of a dog.          I am glad that Amazon carries these treats because, as with the Salmon and Sweet Potato treats, I could not remember where I'd bought them.  I did eventually find out, but the vendor was sold out of the Salmon, and, as luck would have it, the Duck and Salmon are cheaper on Amazon!  That's one reason I love shopping on Amazon.  Great prices along with free delivery if the item is an Amazon Prime item.  Both products are!  The Smokehouse Natural Duck and Sweet Potato Dog Treats come in a resealable bag and would last forever if my dog didn't love them so much.  She got into an open bag that my nephew left out one day, only about a 1 4 of the bag was left, and ate all the rest!  : )  No need for dinner!          These treats are great for training purposes and even for just a "good dog!" moment.  I would definitely recommend them.
