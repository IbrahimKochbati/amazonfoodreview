These radiation treated dinners that don't need freezing are a great convenience.  I've tried quite a few of the Hormel Compleats and this is one of my favorites.  Home cookin', it ain't, and it's a bit too salty, but for a satisfying meal in 90 seconds, it's hard to beat.  The only reason I've given this flavorful, decently chicken filled dish 4 stars instead of 5 is because the rice is white.  We all know by now that whole grains are healthier, so, until these companies start making their dishes with whole wheat pasta and  own rice, I'll mark them down.
