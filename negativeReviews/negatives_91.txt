I agree with the other review, these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums. The chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt vinegar combo. Unfortunately, every bag I received in that case was over cooked! They were very dark and only a few golden  own chips in each bag. They definitely need to improve that!
