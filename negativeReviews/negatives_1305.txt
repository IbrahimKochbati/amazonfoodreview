I received my vanilla beans exactly a month ago today. As soon as I opened the package I LOVED them. They were very moist and I was very pleased at the quality of the beans. I immediately used 18 of the 50+ to make homemade vanilla extract. The beans did not come with storage instructions so I googled it and read that I needed to store them in an airtight container. I've used them a few times over the past month for cooking but I still had over half the package left. Well, when I opened them this evening they were MOLDED. I am so very disappointed that I will be unable to use the rest of my beans. :( If you're able to use all 50 as soon as you get them, then I highly recommend these beans. If not, then I would look elsewhere, or order a smaller quantity.
