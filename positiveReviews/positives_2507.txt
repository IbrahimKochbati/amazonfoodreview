A pleasant surprise awaited me when I first ordered Grove Square milk chocolate Hot Cocoa cups. Not a coffee drinker,     I use our Keurig K cup  ewer mostly to make cocoa, and a few other  ands I tried simply did not hit the mark. Grove Square cocoa tasted full flavored, with just enough chocolate essence to make it a perfect drink. The first experience made me anticipate (with pleasure) the next time I popped a Grove Square K cup into the machine!
