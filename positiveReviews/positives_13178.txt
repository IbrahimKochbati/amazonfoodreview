Let me keep it short and to the point.  This rice is wonderful and I highly recommend it.  I use an automatic rice cooker so there is no work or guessing involved.  Put in 3 cups of rice, add water to the line, and 45 minutes later it is done perfectly.  I think what I like best about this rice is the texture.  It has a lot of "crunch" left in it after cooking.  The Soft Wheat & Rye Berries add to that crunchy texture as does the wild rice.  And this rice has a lot more flavor than plain, white rice.  We also know that this whole grain product is much more healthy for you than the plain white variety.  I have occasionally found this rice in some of the stores where I shop but far too often I search for it in vain.  Thankfully, I can count on Amazon to have this in stock!!!          I also like the Rice Select Royal Blend with Brown & Red Rice with Pearled Barley & Rye Berries.  I alternate between these two varieties to keep things interesting.
