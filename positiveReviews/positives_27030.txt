I like coffee and I love using my plunger. In Australia there is a version of Lavazza ground decaf coffee in an aqua coloured packet. I was really hoping that this coffee would taste like that one. It doesn't.          This coffee is really quite nice and better than most you get in Safeway or Giant. But, it isn't a complex flavor. So, it is good for afternoons but that wonderful "morning coffee" taste that really gets me going isn't there.          I was an idiot and didn't realise that this is three bags of coffee beans not pre ground coffee. Wish i had been more careful as it is a hassle to grind it all the time.
