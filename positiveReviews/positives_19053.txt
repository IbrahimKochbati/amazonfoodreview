I regularly use low carb bake mix.  I have for years.  Sometimes I use it on its own, sometimes I'll do half real flour half lc bake mix.  I've tried Atkins, Bob's Redmill, and Carbquick.  Carbquick is by far the best tasting mix.  It has a lighter less wheaty taste than flour but it's also much more buttery tasting.  Like some reviews have said, it does have a slightly salty taste.  I just reduce the amount of salt called for by 1 2 to 1 3 and that takes care of it.  Bob's Redmill is good but a lot higher in carbs and Atkins tastes too much like soy and the cooked products taste bland and empty.          As far as being healthy, I wouldn't necessarily equate Carbquick to a health food but when you're on a low carb diet and use it in moderation it is perfect for what it's meant to be, a low carb substitute for foods you shouldn't be eating a ton of anyway. Every recipe I've made off the box comes out great.  For the drop biscuits I add about 2 T of heavy cream and subtract that amount of water.  Its great as a light  eading for Chicken Parm or fish and of course, the pancakes or waffles are great.          I highly recommend this product and will keep using it as long as they make it.          Oh, and like others have said, it's ridiculously overpriced on Amazon.  Get it from Netrition instead.
