I decided to use this flavor to test the Krups Nescafe's "iced" option    room temp water pressure as opposed to hot    because every once in a while I like a decaf iced coffee, which means buying an iced decaf Americano (I know this isn't decaf) in most shops.          This is the Krups Nescafe "equivalent" (I use that term loosely) to an Americano if you use a larger volume of water than for the Lungo.          In short, I could barely swallow this stuff.  Cold pressed, it tastes like end of the day convenience store coffee that has been watered down.  Absolutely terrible.          Trying it hot only yields marginally better results.          The only reason it got 2 stars from me is because I'm impressed with the Krups process.  However, I still cannot fathom why a great manufacturer, Krups, chose to partner up on this project with an instant coffee company (Nescafe).  This flavor is the worst so far BY far.
