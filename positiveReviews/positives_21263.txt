Great flavor, much stronger flavor than an extract. Only need a drop or two to flavor an entire cup of coffee. But I had no idea how little a dram is. It's less than a teaspoon. I'm ordering it again in a larger quantity. I use a drop or two in coffee. Yum, yum! (and no natural or artifical sweetener to worry about.)
