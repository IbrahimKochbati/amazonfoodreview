We tried this for the first time this week. I made it in my crock pot, even though that isn't how the directions read. It worked out great. We had it with sour cream and onions one night, in a baked potato another night and tonight mixed with whole wheat pasta. Yummy! Women's bean project is a worthwhile cause, too!!
