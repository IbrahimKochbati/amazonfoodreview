My partner and I tried this coffee this morning. I'm usually skeptical about most advertising claims, so I wasn't expecting much from this coffee, but I have to say it's great.  We both suffer from acid reflux, and had put the coffee maker away because we just couldn't drink it anymore. So we were both thrilled with this coffee.  No acid reflux, and the taste was wonderful.  Very pleased, and the coffee maker will stay out on the counter from now on!
