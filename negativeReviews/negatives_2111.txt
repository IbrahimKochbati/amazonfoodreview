My first time having Curry Rice.          But boy, I cooked this stuff exactly how you're supposed to.          Taste...wasn't bad, I guess, a little "Strong" though.          IT was thick, like ice slush...it was over bearing and the spice was pretty intense.          I don't think I'll get it again...I guess it's good stuff, seen it in some curry making videos...used often, but...not for me, as it it is way to thick.          I had potatoes, onions, and pork prepared to perfection mixed with it...and I could not taste them, at all. I could not taste the pork, or anything. Only the Sauce.
