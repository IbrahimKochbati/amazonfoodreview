I'm not a coffee snob.  I can tell that there is a difference between Kenyan and Columbian, but I can't tell you which is which without a label.  This decaf tastes good.  I like mine with lots of fake sugar and cream; the coffee flavor isn't subdued by these additions.  The bag ultimately required scissors to open.  The blurb for this says "(pack of 3)"; I only got one bag.  Not sure why that is; it's happened before with other products.  Would I buy this again?  Sure, if it was on sale . . . that's how I buy my coffee most of the time.
