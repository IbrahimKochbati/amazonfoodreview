Mueslix has been my favorite cereal since it came out years ago.  HOWEVER, they have (improved????) it by adding more raisins and nuts to the point of making it too rich!  I simply add about half of a grain cereal, such as cornflakes which also reduces the high price.  Stores keep discontinuing Mueslix to the point that it is hard to find!  Thank you Amazon!
