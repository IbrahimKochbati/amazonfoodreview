I really liked the taste of both this and one other flavor that we were able to order.  So I went on line to see what kind of pricing there was on it.  At only 8.3 oz. for about a dollar, that's roughly the equivalent of $1.50 for a single can if it was a full 12 oz. soft drink.  Our budget isn't going to justify ongoing purchases of this product.  If we had more discretionary money, we might do it, but it'd be more of a treat than a regularly used product (partly because of the small size).  So the taste was at least 4 stars, but the price  ought it down considerably   even recognizing the fact that the ingredients are far better than what is in most other soft drinks.
