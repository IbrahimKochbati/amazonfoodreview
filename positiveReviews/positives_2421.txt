I continue to buy this water (as well as the larger size bottle) for a number of reasons:     1) The taste of the water is just plain good, refreshing, crisp and clean   it's not easy describing water that doesn't actually offend!     2) Our filtered municipal water still sucks and this is an excellent alternative for someone with health issues     3) The UPS guy does all the heavy work for me   all I have to do is put it away     4) I never have to run out of bottled water by availing of the discounted subscribe and save program     If I had any complaint at all it would be that the plastic bottle itself is quite heavy and can be a real pain in your backpack.     Bottom line for me, the taste and convenience are worth the price and I'll continue to buy it as long as my budget allows.**UPDATED note** I've been drinking this water for four months now and had an interesting experience that bears sharing: my local Kroger had Ozarka Spring Water on sale so I picked up a case   wow was that ever a mistake. Even though the Ozarka bottles are very light weight, the taste of the water is so different from TalkingRain Spring Water in that there is a distinct "plasticy" flavor. I've alway enjoyed the Ozarka in the past but had no idea I was settling for drinking "plastic" water...my goodness how my taste buds and senses have changed since drinking the pure goodness on TalkingRain Spring Water...I am totally convinced it is worth the extra cost now.
