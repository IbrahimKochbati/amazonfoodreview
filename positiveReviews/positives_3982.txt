I love tea, hot or cold, and am always looking to try new ones. This tea  ews up a wonderful cup   just opening the bag to scoop some out is a joy. The smell alone is captivating. I tried a cup to relieve a stomach ache and it relieved my discomfort immediately. It really does taste just like good quality licorice and it's naturally sweet. When my urge for sweets hits, I can now reach for this tea instead and it really does satisfy my cravings. This tea will be a staple in my pantry.
