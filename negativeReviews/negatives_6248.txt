I found this product at my local Whole Foods for significantly less, which is shocking considering Whole Foods isn't exactly known for low prices   and I purchased in bulk on Amazon so the per unit price definitely should have been better.  Also, infant cereal is supposed to be 1 4 cup of dry cereal to 2 oz. of liquid, which is what it says on this container, but the cereal is way too thick when you make it like that.  The instructions say that 1 4 cup is 14 grams of cereal, which is not true; I weighed it myself and came up with about double that in grams.  So I have no idea whether the nutrition facts apply to the 14g or the 1 4 cup.  My daughter seems to like the cereal, though she definitely prefers the multigrain and oatmeal from this  and.
