I had been offering my housecats the Fancy Feast canned foods with the Fancy Feast kibble always available.  My black Coonie mix cat would regularly vomit up the clearly identifiable, undigested, highly dyed, cutesy shaped, Fancy Feast bits (usually on my cream colored carpet!)  This cat also had already had to have one tooth extracted and I wanted to try to feed him something that would set better on his tummy.  After doing some web researching, I ordered our first bag of Royal Canin Indoor Mature Cat 27 a month ago.  We went through the gradual change over thing but I don't think it was really needed as the new food was readily accepted.  The first bag has been eaten and joy, and the upchucking has ceased!!! Even his  hairball "gifts" are getting smaller and much more infrequent.          My other Maine Coon is 12 and oddly enough, hairballs never seemed to bother her but, she was eating less and less.  She was becoming less active and just didn't seem to be interested in eating kibble or canned and she was noticably loosing weight! Her vet said she could be heading towards a thyroid problem but he wasn't ready to put her on medication yet.  I am happy to report that my sweet girl has really taken to this Indoor Mature Cat 27 diet.  It is helping her get back to her normal, Maine Coon size and she does seem to be feeling much better, even joining in on some playtime with the young'uns!          Who knew a change of diet could work such wonders?  Clearly, the attitude of "kibble is kibble" is out the window.  How could I ever return to feeding my cats a food that would make them vomit?!
