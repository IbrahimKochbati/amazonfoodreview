My cat is 12 years old and very finicky about what she eats...she has never eaten dry food..she will starve before touching dry food. But..mostly she just meows as loud as she can and gets into mischief if she doesn't have what she wants to eat.... She loves this type of cat food, though. I don't know whether it is the cheese she likes, or the over all taste...but she devours it every time....I wish it was smooth instead of strips, as she seems to have trouble chewing it...I wish the grocery stores would stock more of it, as i usually buy for a month at a time...
