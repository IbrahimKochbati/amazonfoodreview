I was told by a professional baker to use powdered food coloring as it was the only way to go when making colored cakes and french macarons. What a disappointment. I ended up adding almost a tablespoon to my french macaron batter and it was such a pale color, that it wasn't worth adding a whole canister at the price. This isn't the way to go if you want  ight vi ant colors.
