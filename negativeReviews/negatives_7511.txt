Just to give this drink a good chance, I stuck it in the fridge for a couple of days, shook it really well, and tried it straight, without ice.  The color was okay, the consistency was okay, not much of a smell.          Then I tasted it, and the first thing that came to mind was, it's salty.  I had my wife try it as well, and she had the same feeling.  I looked at the product info, and it states that it has 5% of the USRDA for sodium, which is too much for a drink, in my opinion, especially a "Coconut Water".  Something like Gatorade, which is for electrolyte replenishment, I can forgive, but not for this.          I then thought more about the taste, besides the saltiness, and what I really had to conclude was that the the mix of flavors didn't do anything for me.  No real sweetness from the coconut, no sourness from the guava.          Overall, Not crazy about it.          Now, I do have something positive to say about the container, it held up well, and it's relatively easy to open, although I'd add a ring to the aluminum foil like pull tab.  But at least the container's mostly paper and potentially better for the environment?
