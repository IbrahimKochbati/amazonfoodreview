Taste in coffee is subjective.  In fact, it's so subjective that it may well be meaningless to discuss it.          Nevertheless, my judgement of this coffee is that it's pretty good, but it's really nothing special.  I thought the taste was on the same level as Seattle's Best, Tully's, or Starbucks bagged ground coffee.  It was better than lower tier bagged ground coffee, but not outstanding.  This is pretty pricey coffee, too.  I can't judge the low acid aspect of the  ew, because I generally don't have trouble with acid in coffee.          In my admittedly subjective view, this coffee at this price just isn't any better than a three star buy.
