Great cup of morning coffee.  This is a very rich, flavorful coffee.  I am a tea drinker, but like my coffee on a chillier day, and since we've been plagued with cold weather here in the Northeast, I've been enjoying alot of coffee in the mornings!  That being said, I usually  ew up a Keurig K Cup of Donut people coffee (great coffee as well), but decided to go a full week with Caffe Lungo.  I'm happy to report that it is great!  Tastes like fresh  ewed coffee from the pot or from the store.  I loved the flavor as much as my beloved Donut people coffee.  Very nice cup of coffee indeed.  My only problem is that Nescafe isn't easy to find where I am and therefore I have to order on Amazon.  Not that it is a problem to order, but I would like to be able to pick one up localy when I run out.
