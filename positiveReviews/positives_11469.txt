After searching unsuccessfully in many grocery stores for whole wheat orzo, I was delighted to find this product at Amazon.  Although you have to buy a lot, the shelf life is excellent, and the price is quite reasonable.  I prefer the taste and texture to regular orzo, and the health benefit of whole grains is a plus.  Although the directions tell you to boil and drain it like pasta, I cook it like rice.  Simmer 1 cup orzo in 2 cups liquid stirring occassionally until liquid is absorbed and pasta is tender.
