This cake is absolutely FABULOUS...moist, with a double whammy of both amaretto and marzipan.  I actually get 10 slices out of a loaf (cuts the usual 300 cal. to 150), then top with vanilla bean ice cream, fresh pineapple pieces "flambeed" (w  butter,rum and  own sugar) and sprinkled with chopped salted macadamias.  Have stashed a few of these loaves in our freezer to await fresh strawberry season...topped with sliced, blood red NW strawberries and a dollop of heavy cream...HEAVEN!!!          Do the same treatment to the rum cake w  apples (sauteed and flambeed) or even bananas.  Haven't tried the tiramisu, or limoncella, but am sure they'd be just as fun to play with!
