I've had a plain coconut drink that was too bland. This guava flavor taste the best of all the flavors I have tried, is quite refreshing to me, not diluted with regular water, and not full of sugar like some other flavored water products. Looking to buy more when I can get it and especially if I can get it on sale. This guava flavor seems to only be sold by ONE. I have also tried Vita Coco and Naked Coconut water with peach and Mango flavor. I like these too but all their prices are higher on Amazon than some of my neighborhood health food stores. I have also used it in a home made vegetable smoothie with delicious results. I would love to see O.N.E offer their coconut water in a larger juice box like 11.2oz. After an intense work out I could use a bit more. It's worth giving it a try!
