I wanted to find the same popcorn used in bars & at the movie theater and THIS IS IT! This is the best tasting popcorn I have ever had! I have a kettle style corn popper and this is the only popcorn I'll ever buy again. I even popped the popcorn on the stove to see if it would taste the same and it did! This is the only popcorn you should buy!
