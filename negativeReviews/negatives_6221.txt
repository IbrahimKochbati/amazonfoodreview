....and I lived there for 20 years.  I used the  ead machine for this mix.  Don't expect this  ead to rise as high as your typical American white  ead.  Like my homemade rye  ead, this mix also produces a dense, heavy  ead.  I like it that way as I'm not very fond of the American fluff.     The flavor was quite disappointing.  It's difficult to describe....it's too bitter and way too sourdough ish.  My trash can now smells of beer from the the sourdough packet.  If you like a bitter beer that you need to chew then by all means go for this mix.  The aftertaste is indescribable.....very bitter and medicinal.     At $5 per loaf this is way overpriced.          My advice:  Keep a jar of sourdough and make your own.
