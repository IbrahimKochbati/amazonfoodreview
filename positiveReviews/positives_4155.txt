I have been using Luzianne Cajun Seasonings for years.  I find it best on Beef and fish seafood.  Like one of the other reviewers, I like the fineness and the blend of the seasoning.  The combination of the two gives it it's unique flavor.          When I have friends and family over for steaks, they always say these are the best, what's your secret.  I first tell them it's an old family secret, but then I tell them about Luzianne.  I am not sure they are listning, because the next time over we have to go through the same conversation.  Oh well, more praise for me!          Thanks Luzianne for all the pats on the back.
