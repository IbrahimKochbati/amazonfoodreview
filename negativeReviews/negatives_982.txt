I will first say that I have only tried making pancakes with GF Bisquick. My family's experience with these pancakes, however, was very disappointing, and I will not be trying any other recipe. I have tried Betty Crocker's GF Brownies, and loved them, so when I decided to spend a little extra and try GF Bisquick I was greatly let down by the result. We couldn't even finish them, we just threw them out. If you can tolerate tree nuts and milk products, I recommend trying Pamela's Pancake Mix. Otherwise, if you are looking for great GF pancakes, look elsewhere   GF Bisquick is not worth it, in our opinion.
