For my coffee preferences, this is my favorite of all of the K Cups I've tried. It's bold without being so acidic that my stomach aches if I have 2 cups. It has a rich, more complex flavor than other bold cups that I have tried. There are some cocoa undertones to this coffee, in my opinion.  Maybe that's why I like it, too.
