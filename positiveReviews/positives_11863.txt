It was nice to find an organic instant oatmeal with way less added sugar than the others on the market, with about 6g of total sugars compared to the others at about 13g. Those other "healthy" organic oatmeals tasted like candy to me.          As expected, McDougall's tastes noticeably less sweet. Instead, you taste the oats and the apples. I'm very pleased with this product.
