These chews do a great job! My nine year old yellow lab used to be prone to getting tartar build up, especially on her back teeth.I have always  ushed her teeth frequently with enzymatic toothpaste,but it wasn't enough.Now her teeth are tartar free, and her gums are healthy too.           I had to train her to hold the treat under her paw, to keep her from gulping it down and then gagging it up. She was easy to train because she adores the taste,and would do anything to have her chewy delight.          Amazon.com has the best price of any vendor for this product, and with their FREE SHIPPING for orders over $25,I save over 50% per bag, compared to what my vet charges.          My only criticism of the product is that the chews in the Large Dog bag vary considerably in size. It would be nice if the pieces were more uniform in size, but this is a minor drawback when you consider how well the product works!
