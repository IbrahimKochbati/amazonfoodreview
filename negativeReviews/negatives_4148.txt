I really like the taste of this powder.  It is great in a protein shake, especially with 1 2 banana blended in.  My issue is with the shelf life of the product.  A 6.5 oz container lasts a long time, but the container that I purchased from Amazon expired in less than a month from the purchase date.  I noticed that the date of production was exactly a year ago.  Most protein powders have a shelf life of a couple of years.
