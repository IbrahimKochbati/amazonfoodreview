I purchased this product for a couple of reasons.  First, with the cost of k cups, this offered a lower price option.  Second, this allows me to used the coffee of my choice (decaf, organic, water processed).          The first couple of times I used these, the coffee was very weak.  I opened a regular k cup that I had to see if there was a difference in grind size from what I was using; there was not.  Then I poured the contents of the k cup into my disposable k cup and it would not fit.  Apparently, the disposable cups hold less coffee, which could account for the weakness.  I also noticed that the disposable cups leak around the rim, and I often get grounds in my cup.          I started packing as much coffee as I could into the cups, to where I could barely get the top on.  This made a much better cup of coffee.  However, they still leaked, there were still grounds in my coffee, and it make my Keurig run MUCH slower.  Not to mention the cleanup...          My business uses a Keurig so that all of us can  ew the coffee of our choice, and we also have a couple of tea and hot chocolate drinkers.  Everytime I use the disposable cups, I have to wipe down the machine, drip tray & my cup.  I also have to clean out the interior of the cup recepticle so that the next person doesn't have to put up with my leftovers.  All in all, these were a nice idea, but the amount of work they require makes paying a little exta for the convenience of regular k cups more attractive.  I will probably use up what I have and then go back to the regular k cups or find a more landfill friendly solution.
