These "Whenever Bars" taste like soft chocolate chip cookies. The coconut flavor is very good and natural tasting.          Don't be deceived by the size of the package. The wrapper is much larger than the bar. Still, it is a satisfying snack and comes in at a respectable 180 calories.          I eat them around mid morning or as a late night snack. I do not avoid gluten, wheat, or dairy (these bars are wheat free, gluten free, and non dairy) but do enjoy organic foods and was pleased to see healthy ingredients including oats, agave, chia seeds,  own rice flour, etc.          Once these become available in the Subscribe and Save program I feel certain I will subscribe. They are great to have around for a low calorie, sweet treat.
