I loved this French vanilla coffee   it was really flavorful but also smooth and delicious!  I don't usually drink flavored coffees because they tend to taste sort of "fake" or chemically, but I decided to try Aloha Island's French Vanilla coffee after I tried their French Vanilla Pods in my Senseo Machine.  My mother in law is still living in the "dark ages" and still uses a drip  ewer, so I took this coffee over to her house this past weekend.  Everybody loved the coffee (we have a big family)!  My mother in law was so happy that we finally  ought her something she can use and that she likes.  I'm just happy that we no longer have to drink the bad coffee she usually  ews!  I'm an Aloha Island convert   we've been spoiled and now we can't drink anything else!
