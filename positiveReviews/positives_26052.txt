We have a 13 year old beagle, and I noticed that he no longer chews his older toys.  I was worried about his developing dental problems in old age, so we decided to try out Petrodex dental chews.  I think these chews are a great price, and the beagle loves them! He can't wait each evening for his after dinner treat!
