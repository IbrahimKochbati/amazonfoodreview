I have used Petrodex dental chews for many years now. I have 3 shihzhu poodle mixed  eed dogs each about 15 18 lbs. I have tried various other products before staying with this one:          Greenies   made them intermittently vomit green particles almost pea soup or gazpacho.          Merrick bull twists   the dogs loved them, but they smelled and the dogs eventually smelled of them as well.          Nylabone   they didnt like these as much, but sometimes they really did chew on them a lot. They last a looooong time, but when the dogs chew them, they make a lot of crunching noises.          Petrodex they love them like a treat, eat the full stick in 1 3 minutes (depending on how much they want to tease the fast eater when his  other still has his), they dont smell, dont leave a mess and causes no ill effect on the animal. Their teeth and  eath are fresher with them and need for tooth cleaning is almost nonexistent when given daily.          Vendor Pet Food Direct is EXCELLENT to work with. Never a problem.
