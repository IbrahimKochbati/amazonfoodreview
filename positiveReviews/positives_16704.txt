Greenies are a great product that dogs love and while they are enjoying their daily treat, they are actually keeping their teeth  and gums clean.  I always share the information on Greenies when people ask how I keep my 6 year old Yellow La adors teeth so clean.  I'd always thought they were a bit expensive but Amazon has  ought them to us at a more affordable price.  We have chosen the lite variety to keep our lab a bit trimmer in weight.  A good product at a reasonable price....Thanks
