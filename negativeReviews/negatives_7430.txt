I had bought this product last year my dog loved them, but... I subscribe to a couple of Bichon Frise newsgroup and they are saying not to feed these to your dog as they come from China I threw out what I had left for the outside critters in the forest.  I called Dogswell today and they verified that even though they say U.S. on them they are still coming from China.
