As someone who has been actively involved in improving my health over the past few years, my research has shown the positive effects of sea and other high quality salts in a healthy diet (Suzanne Somers, health experts and Doctors have written about the benefits in many of their books).  I have tried many products and most are very good however I find the salts from "Salts of the 7 Seas" to be the best I have ever tried!!  The quality is evident in each of the different flavors.  Who knew I needed 6 different salts in my pantry? Growing up with regular table salt, a gourmet salt never crossed my mind.  Once I tried these products, I found different uses for them on almost a daily basis with incredible results.  I will continue to buy these fantastic salts for many years to come.  Thank you, for such an excellent product.        "
