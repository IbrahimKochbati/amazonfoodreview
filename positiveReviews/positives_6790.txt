I buy Lavazza regular espresso in the black can pretty regularly, as I consider it the smoothest tasting of all in the supermarket.     This decaf in the green can is just as good, but lacks the kick of caffeine.          One reviewer loves Bustelo; well it's a matter of taste. I found Bustelo to be harsh and unpleasant.     C'est la vie.
