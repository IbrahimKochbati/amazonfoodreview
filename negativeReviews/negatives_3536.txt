I think if I had received fresh crackers this rating would have been a five.  Purchased off the discount deal last month and the Sell By date was June 2012.  Got a case of 6 and got rid of 3 due to opening the first box and the oil was going rancid. I was really disappointed because the cracker was, even with the off taste, one of the best I have had Gluten Free.  So now I open the package and leave it open two days and then the taste is not bad with cheese or some topping.  So I am going to try some fresh ones when I have some extra cash or can buy them at the local Whole Foods to see if they are better.
