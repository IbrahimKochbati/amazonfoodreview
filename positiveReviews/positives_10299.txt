I love these trays!          Yes, they're expensive... but worth it to me.          They stack VERY neatly in the freezer, the lids seal tightly and keep everything fresh, and the food is easily removed for use (or, storage in a baggie so I can use the same tray again for more food).          If you have any trouble getting the food cubes out just leave the lid on and run the bottom under a little warm water... the cubes will slide right out.  :)
