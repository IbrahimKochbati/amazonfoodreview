I like these peas for having nothing but the pea in the can. Read the sodium levels on a can of beans these days, might as well drink sea water. Yes these are bland, no bacon, salt or artificial flavors, simply peas. A pinch of salt, some spices, rice & hot sauce or mayo like my granddad adds and I can make lunch or dinner from a can of these puppies. I keep these to wolf down on days I have gone too long without food and need something fast. Stock trading does not lend itself to eating healthy or at all most days. Canned blackeyes are fast, filling and healthy but will not rock your world flavor wise. For me they fill the nutrition hole and keep junk food from finding my mouth, that alone makes them 5 star.
