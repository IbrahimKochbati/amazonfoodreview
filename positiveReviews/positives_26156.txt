I drank 3 cups  ewed with 2 tea bags each of this tea for the last few months of my pregnancy.  The amount of time I spent pushing my son out totaled 5 minutes.  My midwife had said there were lots of anecdotal reports of raspberry leaf tea causing easier labors but I was skeptical.  Obviously, my experience made me a believer!          I found this tea's taste to be no different from the more expensive  ands.  And I appreciate that the design of these teabags is less wasteful by not using strings, tags, or staples like most teas.
