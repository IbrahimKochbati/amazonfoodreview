As I am a decaf drinker, I was amazed that this regular coffee did not upset me.  Drinking this wonderful coffee is like eating chocolate covered raspberry candy.  It is not bitter as some coffees are, and it doesn't leave an aftertaste as some coffees do.          My guests also enjoy it.          All I can say is that I am very pleasantly pleased with this great tasting coffee.  A great pick me up.
