We got 4 of them to store food for my son. They work nicely in general, but we have several complains:     1) food gets a freezer burn unless you put the train in a freezer bag     2) the food that gets takes a while to blend (like  occoli) and gets a bit of air blended in is harder to get out of the tray.     Other than that we love the trays.Wish they came also in 1oz portions (we try to give a great variety of veggies to my son at every meal, so having option of a smaller portion that takes less space in the freezer) would be great!
