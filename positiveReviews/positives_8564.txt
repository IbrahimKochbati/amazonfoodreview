I love almonds in general, and this particular  and is quite good.  They taste great, with just the right amount of salt and oil (for me, anyway).          They're individually packaged in 6 oz. cans, which makes them an easy and portable snack.  Portion control is also easier with the small can size.          I've ordered a few packs of these almonds, and while there is some slight variation in the taste from batch to batch (some are roasted a bit darker than others), I have always found them fresh and tasty.          Almonds are relatively healthy too   high in protein, a good source of magnesium, calcium, and manganese, and full of unsaturated fats.          I haven't seen organic roasted, salted almonds from this company, but I hope they offer them eventually at a decent price.  One thing I would also like to see is some kind of assurance that the can liner is free of BPA.
