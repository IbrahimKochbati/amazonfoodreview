Wow.  So far, two two star reviews.  One obviously had no idea what they were ordering; the other wants crispy cookies.  Hey, I'm sorry; but these reviews do nobody any good beyond reminding us to look  before ordering.          These are chocolate oatmeal cookies.  If you don't like that combination, don't order this type of cookie.  I find the combo quite nice, really.  The oatmeal sort of "calms" the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconut type consistency.  Now let's also remember that tastes differ; so, I've given my opinion.          Then, these are soft, chewy cookies    as advertised.  They are not "crispy" cookies, or the blurb would say "crispy," rather than "chewy."  I happen to like raw cookie dough; however, I don't see where these taste like raw cookie dough.  Both are soft, however, so is this the confusion?  And, yes, they stick together.  Soft cookies tend to do that.  They aren't individually wrapped, which would add to the cost.  Oh yeah, chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweet.          So, if you want something hard and crisp, I suggest Nabiso's Ginger Snaps.  If you want a cookie that's soft, chewy and tastes like a combination of chocolate and oatmeal, give these a try.  I'm here to place my second order.
