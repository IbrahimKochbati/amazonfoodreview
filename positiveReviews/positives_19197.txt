Not as good as fresh ground, but this is the best K Cup I've had.  Kona is definitely a treat, though I may grind my own and make my own K Cup in future.          If you don't like Kona, I wouldn't spend the money.  There are lots of blends out there that work.          Service and shipping were very acceptable.
