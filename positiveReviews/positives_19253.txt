Highly entertaining to watch.  Both of my dogs LOVE it.  The older one has a little more trouble with it,but he can do it!  He hasn't quit figured out that he has to move the yellow cups before the wheel will turn.  On the other hand my younger dog thought that removing the yellow cups WAS the game.  Had to show him that there was something inside.  Does very well removing the cups now.  Timing him he is down to a little over 2 minutes.  You do have to show them how it works a few times if you don't have a super smart dog.
