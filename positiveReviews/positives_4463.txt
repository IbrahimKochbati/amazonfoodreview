The first thing you notice when you open up your package is the intensely delicious smell of vanilla.  The package is vacuum sealed, but the smell still leaks out.  These beans are a great deal!  I think I got about 28 32 pods in my bag and was able to make good use of them.  They (as previously mentioned) have a wonderful smell and great flavor.  It is really hard to find a better deal out there.
