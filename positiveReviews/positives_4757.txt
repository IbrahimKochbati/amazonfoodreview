I make a lot of  ead.  My family's favorite is my focaccia.  I had been purchasing a very "well known" flour prior to trying this.  I am so happy I did try it.  I thought my italian  eads could not get any better, but this  ing it up a notch.  I am comparing this to all the other 00 flours.  If you are a  ead maker I urge you to include in your next order. maria domenica
