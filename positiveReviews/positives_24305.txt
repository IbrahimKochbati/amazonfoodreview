I love this  and of chai, they used to use it at a local coffee shop where I worked as a barista when I was younger and I have never forgotten it. I order it now to save on coffee shop prices. It is a bit tricky to get the mix to fully dissolve, but works fine if you start with a few ml's of hot water.
