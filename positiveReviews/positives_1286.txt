Saw these in Whole Foods and thought they looked interesting. Didn't care for them instantly, but by the time the first bag as gone (I have a husband and kids), I was hooked. Wanted to try other flavors and this is a great way to do it. Personally, I like the plain and also the salt pepper. My kids love all of them though and, while these aren't fruit veggies, I feel better about giving these to them as opposed to standard chips.
