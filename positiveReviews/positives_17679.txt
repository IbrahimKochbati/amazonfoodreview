Ok...for all you out there like me that like coffee or even love coffee but hate the bitterness and acidity of it, THIS is a great coffee! I love drinking my coffee black, no cream, no sugar, and enjoy the actual taste of the beans. I was worried about the flavor since it's French Roast, I thought it might be strong and therefore still a little bitter...no worries, it's wonderful. Still full bodied, smooth, and easy on the stomach :)          Highly Recommended
