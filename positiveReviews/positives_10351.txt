If you have 96 people to serve, this would be an excellent purchase. Before serving, however, it would be important to inform each guest that they would only receive one Pop Tart, and that seconds would not be possible. Unless, of course, one person decided against eating their Pop Tart. In this case, one person could have seconds, and so on. I would advise against this, however, as it would be rude to the other guests to provide seconds to one and deny the others.
