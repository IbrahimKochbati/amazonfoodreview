What I received from this webpage was small black lentils, not Beluga.  Instead of belugas,I received Vegetarian organic black lentils.  Not that I'm sorry about it; the can label has a wonderful recipe for soup, and a vegetarian diet pyramid for nutrition.  These small black organic lentils are delicious and nourishing.  I recommend them to you to try, and I'd like an opportunity to order and try the Heirloom Beluga lentils as well sometime.  You'll like the small organic black lentils, many ways to serve them.
