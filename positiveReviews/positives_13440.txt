Obviously, one's preference for coffee is a personal thing. I happen to like this particular coffee very much. It is strong enough, but not bitter. I bought two boxes on sale, but the regular price of the K cups has been rising beyond the point that I will spend for a homemade cup of coffee. Instead, I have been using pods for the Senseo machines. I got an adaptor for the Keureg, and they work fine for less than half the price. I also have an adaptor for ground coffee, the cheapest alternative, so I always have lots of choices for coffee flavors.
