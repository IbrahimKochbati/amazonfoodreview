Like others have mentioned, yogurt made with this is much tastier than store bought.          Be sure to use the right temperatures   heat to 180 degrees, the cool to 113 degrees     to add the starter. The high temperature changes the protein in the milk so the yogurt     sets better, just like when making custard from scratch.          I use a yogoutmet model T yogurt maker, which is cool. and run it for 10 hours. This     converts most of the sugar, making the resulting yogurt nice and sour, the way I like it.     At this point you can use it in place of sour cream, and it will also stay intact better at     higher temperatures. If you thicken it bit more, by removing some of the whey, you     will have the thickness of Greek style yogurt. You can also thicken it more to use in     place of cream cheese.
