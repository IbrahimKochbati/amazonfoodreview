Let's be honest, most of us buy this for the heat itself   out of curiosity or stupidity.     After trying blair's ultra death (i think it was at 1 million scoville), i can tell you that this is much hotter as advertised.     1.5 million is not a joke so use one drop per serving.          I would give it a 4 5 because of the lack of flavor and taste. There's barely anything to enjoy or to look forward to when you use this hot sauce, but that's expected. I simply use it to make things "hot", not to enhance taste or for flavor, and it never fails me.     Being that hot, it can last you a long time, worth the $23 dollars.
