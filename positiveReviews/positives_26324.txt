I'm a young adult staying in shape, going to the gym, and eating healthy. I don't stop myself from having a big spoon a day of Simon Fischer's Lekvar Prune Butter, replacing all the tempted junk food around the house or the isles at your local convenient store. It actually replaces my Dark Chocolate addiction too. Prune Butter is used for many snacks, but I like it just the way it is. And its not only for Grandma's and Grandpa's!!
