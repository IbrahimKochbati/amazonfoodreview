My white and cream Havanese had bad tear stains as a puppy, so the  eeder switched him to this specific flavor of Natural Balance dog food.  His tear stains cleared up quickly without any need for any other special additives to his diet.  I'm only giving it four stars because I cannot find this flavor, which he likes better than some of the others I've tried, in the small  eed size so it's easier for him to eat.
