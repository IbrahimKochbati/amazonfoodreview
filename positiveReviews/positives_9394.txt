I have used this in many different ways and I like its ease of use and the fact that its a pantry item.          That said, it doesnt have the texture of fresh cooked chicken and Ive found it best in things where its either mixed with something   like a chicken salad   or added into soup.          I dont think it works well where a genuine chicken texture would be wanted (ie a stir fry or a chunky item where the chicken is in large peices)          I think this is a very good item and worth having; just be aware that it isnt a perfect substitute for fresh cooked.
