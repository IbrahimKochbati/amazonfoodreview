We put together the cups.  Everything went well with t he coffee into the cups along with a filter.     When putting the kcup into the coffee machine it would only drip.  I checked everything and it was put together correctly. I took the made up cups to my son's coffee maker keurig  and also, it did the same thing.  It starts out ok only made drips of coffee.     We tried it with two different modes of Keurig and both did not work.It did make holes in right places.
