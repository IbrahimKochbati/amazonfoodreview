I love the peach flavored iced tea.  It is just right flavor wise, which is not the case with some of the other CL flavors.  For example, the raspberry is sooo sweet and pretty unbearable.  But, the tea is a good mix and buying it here is cheaper that at the grocery.  The price keeps going up locally, and now they are up to over $2.50 a box for a pack of 10, which is ridiculous.  You used to be able to get this stuff for about .15 to .19 each.  That may not be a big deal for one pack, but when you drink as much of this as I do (probably 2 boxes a week), it starts to add up.          I recommend the Peach Tea.  It's one of the few flavors that CL has not messed with in regards to taste.  It seems they have revamped most of the other flavors, but not this one.
