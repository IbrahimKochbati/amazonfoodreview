I am a fan of several of the Mio liquids (i especially like the lemonade) and I use the Mio Energy Black Cherry almost daily. I thought that it wouldn't be too much of a reach to try the "Green Thunder" Mio Energy. I really, really did not like it. While I appreciate the caffeine and the B vitamins I greatly prefer the Black Cherry flavor. To me "green Thunder" tastes like green apple flavored medicine... very bad medicine.          So of the flavors that I have tried          Lemonade (Mio Liquid)   Very good   it has become one of my preferred drinks   easily 5 stars          Fruit Punch (Mio Liquid)   Good but not great flavor   a little too artificial tasting   4 stars          Black Cherry  (Mio Energy)   I like it but I have had better tasting cherry drinks   I prefer it over "Vitamin Squeeze" 4 1 2 Stars          Green Thunder   (Mio Energy)   Tastes like medicine   easily my least favorite flavor   2 stars (I added a star because of the caffeine)
