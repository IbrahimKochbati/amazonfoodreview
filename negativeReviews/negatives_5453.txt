I liked it but I didn't love it. It didn't have a strong flavor and it didn't seem rich. I usually drink Starbucks decaf French Roast and compared to this it seemed somewhat bland. But it wasn't bitter, and I could definitely tell it was low acid, which is a great idea. I hope this company will keep trying to make some improvements to the formula, to give it more flavor. I very much appreciate their efforts. Mary Lee Moser, author, There and Back: A Journal Companion for Special Needs Parents.
