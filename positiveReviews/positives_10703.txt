I have four Chihuahuas. They seemed very interested in the treats, but didn't seem to know quite what to do with them. At first they licked them and then walked away. Finally one of them managed to crunch one. After that they ate them. The next day, the same thing. I think they like them, but these treats would be better suited for larger dogs.
