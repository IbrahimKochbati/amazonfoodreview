I bought this for the first time on Amazon a few weeks ago  the variety package and it was great (5 Stars)  powder was fresh and vi ant looking. Ran out of the peas  so thought I'd purchase it again  but without the variety pack  just the peas. This time  got a package that expires in May and the packaging was a bit different  which was fine  since it's only end of March right now  but when I opened it  the powder was stale looking (like sand)  whitish in color not the vi ant green and powder flew up in the air (like sawdust)  whereas it's usually more dense.  Too bad  my baby really liked the peas in the variety pack.
