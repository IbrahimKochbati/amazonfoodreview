No, these aren't as good as "real" fresh mashed potatoes, but they are about as quick and easy to make as it gets and they do taste pretty good for instant.  I'm no fan of instant mashed potatoes, but these are good enough to do in a pinch.  When I'm making a quick solitary meal, these will be a welcome addition from time to time.
