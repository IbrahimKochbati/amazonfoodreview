I first remember Martinelli"s Apple Juice from the days when we used to use Martinelli's Sparkling apple juice as a non alcoholic toast at Thanksgiving dinners. It was  ight, fresh tasting and delicious. More recently, my wife bought a case of the 10 ounce bottles at our local warehouse store. We found out that our toddler loved the stuff. My wife wanted to pick up another case, but it was gone and hasn't returned as yet. So what are you gonna do? Well, it's available in other sizes, so today she came home with a couple 1.5 liter bottles. It's not as handy as the small bottles, but we'll make do. The important thing is the juice. She regards the bottle as important in that it is PBA free and that's important for the little one. She also likes fruit juices that are pure juice, especially if they are not from concentrate and have no added ingredients. Martinelli's Apple Juice fits her requirements. Plus, it's delicious.          Gary Peterson
