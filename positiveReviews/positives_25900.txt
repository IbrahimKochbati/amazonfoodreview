I LOVE this product.  I love the taste of peanut butter and chocolate.  Our local coffee shop has a peanut butter cup mocha.  You can imagine the calories in it.  I put a serving of this (2 tbsp) and a hot chocolate packet in coffee and i have a peanut butter cup mocha without all the calories of the local coffee shop.  It is delicious.
