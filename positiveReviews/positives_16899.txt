Our dog loves her Bad CUZ, but this toy she loves more than any other.  She's a VERY tough chewer, and it's survived for quite some time with no damage.  One thing   protect your toes with this toy   it's pretty heavy and does get swung around a bit.  I wouldn't recommend this toy if you have low tables with knick knacks, sensitive shins or teeny kids that may get bonked with it.  Ours has gotten thrown (by the dog) repeatedly down the stairs onto a hard floor and hasn't  oken yet.     As far as treats to go into it   remember that the rope is knotted inside the jug, so don't put anything into the jug that's soft or the rope will end up smelling REALLY nasty...
