I have gradually come to realize good coffee doesn't have to bite your head off. People have been convinced that the more your socks curl, the better it is. This is a pretty mellow but substantial  ew. It doesn't have the hardcore after taste and isn't bitter. No fruity or whatever else descriptors. It's just a good basic cup of coffee for the average person. Basic is what I'm looking for in the morning.
