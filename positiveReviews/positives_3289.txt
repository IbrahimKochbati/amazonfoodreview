We cant say enought about the Gluten Free Bisquick.. My husband and all three kids are allergic to Wheat and we are on a strick Gluten Free diet in our house.. I have tried every product out there to make pancakes, waffles, biscuits and even chicken fingers and was so pleasantly suprised that this little box does it all and does it all WONDERFUL... Pancakes are wonderful, Waffles are Great, Chicken Fingers are the best Ive made and the biscuits are delish.. Cant ask for anything better.. I only wish you could buy it ina bigger box and it was a little cheaper but we are a HUGE fan...
