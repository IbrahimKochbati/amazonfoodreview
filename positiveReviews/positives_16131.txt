I love this tea, I have been drinking this Decaf Mandarin Orange Green Tea for a few years now.  It is a good substute for coffee.  This tea has a good orange flavor that is not overpowering.  It can be hard to find in local stores, even though I live just a hour away from the Celestial Seasonings plant.  It is nice to be able to purchase a case and have it delivered in a couple of days.
