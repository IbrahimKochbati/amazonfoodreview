This is the only one that Hawaiian Punch makes that does not have the red or yellow dyes in it. It is great for kids, or anyone, with ADD or ADHD. However, it is very hard to find in stock. I try to get it at Wal mart, because there it is $.94 cents a box, 8 packets per box, and it is sugar free. Compared to Crystal Light that have 10 per box at $1.50 and not all are sugar free. The price on here is kind of high, but it is well worth it if you can't get it anywhere else.
