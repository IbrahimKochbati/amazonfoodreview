I bought one of these thinking I would try it out and go back for more if it worked out.  They are cute, but I won't be buying more.  The Stay Fresh Baby Food containers are MUCH better and cheaper.  The Stay Fresh containers each hold 2 ounces and can go straight in the microwave.  Once the food is frozen I find it difficult sometimes to get the portion of food out of the Beaba container.  Not the best design and totally overpriced.
