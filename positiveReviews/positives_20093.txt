This is not an instant tea mix.  This actually powdered green tea leaves. Hence the cloudiness.  This product is convenient to mix into my water bottle that I take to the gym.  The finest green tea from an antioxidant perspective is Matcha green tea. It's the tea used in scientific studies that touts green tea's antioxidant properties.  It's very expensive but is grown in special areas in japan.          I feel this is the next best thing.  It dissolves easily and I can take it with me and add to water on the go. I use match a when I'm at home, but this beats buying bottled green tea in quality and it's much more economical.
