My mountain feist (a  eed that is similar to a Jack Russell), an admittedly finicky eater, is no big fan of them. He will only eat the treats if they are mixed with canned dog food.  While it is good that the treats will be eaten and will not be wasted, mixing it with food seems to defeat the purpose of a treat.          They are made of great ingredients and not made in China, which is a great thing if you are concerned about some of the junk that has been put into dog food as filler ingredients. I give it three stars because, despite my finicky dog's lack of a desire to snatch them from my hand, the treats smell good and this appears to be a trustworthy and relatively healthy offering.
