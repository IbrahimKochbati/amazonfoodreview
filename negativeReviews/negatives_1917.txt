My cat has an iron stomach. She can eat absolutely anything and everything and is always getting into my "human" food and has never thrown up. I gave her 2 of these treats and within 20 minutes, she was wheezing and throwing up all over my carpet. I didn't connect it at first but when I gave her the same treats the next day, exact same reaction!          I have tried several different flavors of this same  and and she has had the same reaction! If you are trying these with your cat for the 1st time, only give them 1 of them and just wait to see how they react before you give them anymore.
