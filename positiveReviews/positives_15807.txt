These are fantastic!  I was worried about the SF Carmel since that's what a lot of the complaints were about, but I didn't find the taste disagreeable.  I did give away the Raspberry (without having tried it) because I didn't think that I'd care for the flavor in my coffee (which is what I use these for).  My favorite flavors are the caramel, hazlenut, and vanilla.
