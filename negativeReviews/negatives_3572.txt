My husband is the driving force of healthiness in our household and insists we eat as clean and organic as possible. Normally this kind of snack would be right up his alley, which is why I got them. But he didn't care for the taste. He told me they were alright but kind of plain and told me not to get them again as there are tastier snack options out there for his packed lunches. Saying that, I have to also mention that he either ate the whole box over time or he threw them out because they weren't in the snack drawer the other week when I cleaned it out.
