I've always hated powdered milk. Until I tried Nido Full Cream powdered milk. This milk is the best of not only powdered milks. But it's the best milk I've ever had. I use a shaker type Blender Bottle to make it. I try to make it a few hours before I need want it. I like to give it time to chill. Also I've never had to throw any of this milk away. It has a fresh, creamy taste and is a tiny bit sweet. Really, it's better than any store bought milk.
