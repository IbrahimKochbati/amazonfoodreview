I have tried all the Via blends, and my favorite by far is still Starbucks Tribute.  It was so sad when they ran out last year.  My back up is the Columbian, always good, but I have always loved Sumatra.  The cherry is a note, and does not come across as a 'flavor'.  I do not like flavored coffee.  I heat this in the microwave for two minutes in a mug of 1% organic milk.  Yummy!          Starbucks writes:  . . . "Spicy & Cherry" and "With beans from all three of the world's coffee growing regions . . . Aged Sumatra, sun dried beans from Ethiopia, and coffees from Papua New Guinea and Colombia come together to create this spicy and full bodied blend with dark cherry notes."
