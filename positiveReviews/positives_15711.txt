Petite cuisine is probably the best cat food I have ever bought for my cats.  Open the can and it looks and smells like people food.  The ingredients are basically fish, vitamins, and minerals.  There are no meat by products or fish by products and if you know what "by products" are you will be happy about that. If you are concerned about your pet's health, this is a great food. And if your cat is finicky about what she eats, then this is a wonderful food.          This size variety pack is quite a savings over the 4 packs so if you are sure your cats will like it then it is worth it to buy this size.  Some cats don't mind having the same food every day and some cats might not like each flavor so whether to get the variety pack of 24 or the single flavor pack of 24 is up to you and your cat.  My cats love all 4 flavors and I'll bet your fish loving cat will too!
