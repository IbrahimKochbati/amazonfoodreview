The title to this review may seem harsh, but it's true. The pet food industry is in a sad state and takes huge advantage of the fact that dogs will eat virtually anything. So much of the pet food out there is down right garbage, literally killing the animals that eat it. After doing extensive research, Weruva  and food take every precaution to deliver a high quality, nutritious and safe meal to your fury loved ones.          I'm not going to reiterate Weruva's web site. Just visit their site and learn why they are the best and most caring in the pet food industry. Yes, their product comes from Thailand, a country that has more strict regulations when it comes to food production than the USA and Weruva is constantly auditing the Thailand food production to ensure they are nothing but the best quality and safety.          Enough said. You want the best for your pet? Then spend the $4 a can for this unbelievable product. Expensive it is, but that's the cost of giving your loved on the best there is.
