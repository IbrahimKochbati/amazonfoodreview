I was very confused when I wrote my first review. Yes, everything below was true but it was no fault of the product. The KEY to kettle style popcorn machines is proper temperature. The process to get big kernels is simple and is as follows:            Let the kettle heat empty for 5 minutes.       Put popping oil in kettle and let it heat for another 5 minutes.       Put in popcorn and salt and wait for the magic to happen.          All of the problems I was experiencing below went away when I followed the procedure above. Popcorn pops real big and fluffy. I'm all out of corn right now and will be giving the Chiefs Choice  and a try to compare the two.                              OLD INACCURATE REVIEW BELOW                       I had read a few other reviews here on Amazon that said this popcorn wasn't very good (Coconut oil flavor) and I have to agree. I thought I could suck it up and eat all of it but there is no way I will be able to do it. It's just nasty plain and simple. I'm using a Paramount popper and it works very well.          My findings:            Kernels pop real small and are very chewy. Not big light and fluffy.       Overall taste of the popcorn is not very good. Popcorn has a nasty coconut oil flavor to it. I thought maybe reducing the premeasured oil to half would help but it still has a coconut oil flavor to it.          Overall, it's pretty bad and maybe I just ended up with an old batch or something because when you taste the popcorn you could swear that it's old. I'm hearing there is a  and called Chief's Choice and I will order some of that today and give it a try.
