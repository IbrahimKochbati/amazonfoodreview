I've been eating Quaker  and oatmeal for years, and the Maple & Brown Sugar flavor is my personal favorite.  I usually make it with water rather than milk, and add half a teaspoon of peanut butter when it comes out of the microwave.  It's delicious and nutritious, and keeps me from getting hungry for hours.          I've given it four stars mostly because this is oatmeal, not helmet mounted laser cannons, puppies, or a handy personal teleportation device.  It's oatmeal.  Delicious and good for you, but still just oatmeal.
