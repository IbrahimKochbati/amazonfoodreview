I was excited to receive this coffee maker as a Christmas gift.  But after three weeks of use (1 2 cups per day), it started  ewing partial cups.  I followed the troubleshooting instructions to get it working again, but now I find that after 4 5 cups  ewed, it will  ew a partial cup (about 4 oz), and quit with an error. This is very disappointing, not to mention the waste of a number of K Cups.          Based on other low ratings and comments, it looks like this model line has design problems.
