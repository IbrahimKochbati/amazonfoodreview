This is the best quality Chamomile tea I have ever tried! This is only 1 oz. so it's a little pricey, but I will buy it again anyway, because the quality is out of this world. You will get three nice cups of tea out of one tablespoon, but the first one is the best, of course. I like mine strong. Chamomile fans will love this tea.
