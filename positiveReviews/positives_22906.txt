Bigelow's Plantation Mint isn't just a tea. The moment you toss the bag in water and start to smell that intense aroma of fresh mint, you'll realize you've gotten not only a tea but an aromatherapy kit that'll have your whole house asking for their own cup.          The tea itself is wonderful. You might not expect tea and mint to go this together, but they really do. The overall flavor that you get is a wonderful mouthful of mint flavor with just enough bitter tea to make it go down smooth. It really is a fantastic experience.          If I had to come up with a downside, I'd say that the flavor is just a touch too syrupy. Anyone who's actually used fresh mint before will likely recognize this tea for what it is  an (excellent) mint syrup drizzled (deliciously) into a cup of tea. Basically, this is a really good approximation of mint infused tea, about as good as you could possibly expect from a bagged tea. For a product this wonderful you can't help but wonder what it would be like to have real leaves and  ew them yourself. However, that's the trade off you make for just being able to toss a bag in water and get your tea quickly. And having a tin of fresh leaves in this mix, you'd probably use it for the smell long before you considered drinking it anyway.          In the end, this has instantly become my very favorite comfort tea. Especially if you're feeling a little under the weather, the smell solves a stuffy nose in no time. Definitely get a box and try this  maybe two boxes if you have other tea drinkers in the family, since they'll likely steal the first box for themselves.
