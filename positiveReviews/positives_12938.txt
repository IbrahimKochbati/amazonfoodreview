Carbonated juice is exactly what this drink is.  Even though there's no sugar added, it's still very sweet, which makes me think that any health benefits it has is overwhelmed by the sugar content.  Also, I don't think the amount you get (teeny bit more than a cup) is fair for how much the product costs.  Stick with real fruit.  This is basically sweetly flavored sparkling water.
