I ordered this because it is Science Diet and it says it is minced. Well, it is NOT minced and my cats do not like it. It is more of a pate than minced and gets mashed down in their bowl so they can't eat it. I am very unhappy with this product and my cats are too. Will not be buying it again. Returning it would be not worth it as the shipping charges are taken out of the balance so I would be losing money.
