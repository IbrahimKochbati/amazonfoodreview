This is IMHO the best instant oatmeal ever. The problem is only one grocery in my area carries this  and and they are erratic in stocking the flavors I like (Apples 'n Cinnamon and Baked Apple). Consequently, I have to order it on line. The only draw back to online ordering is price; it cost me more than 100% more to order on line than to purchase in the store ($0.99 in store vs $2.15 per serving on line). And to make matters worse, Amazon doesn't stock it all the time. Right now I have to sign up to be notified when it will be available again. So, I end up having to go to other suppliers on line to find this product.          However, this is still the best instant oatmeal in the world and I will pursue it to the ends of the earth!!!!
