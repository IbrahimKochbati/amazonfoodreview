These are okay, but like other reviewers have mentioned dogs need to be monitored while chewing these. These are essentially rawhide, so they eventually get very soft and pliable, and dogs who tend to gulp food treats may try to swallow these. My recommendation for the most effective care (albeit one of the more difficult solutions) would be  ushing daily.
