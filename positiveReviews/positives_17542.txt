We were looking for whole wheat pasta alternative. This product exceeds our expectation in taste and texture. Sure, it is not as yummy as wheat but still pleasant. It has complete potein from quinoa and less gluten issue. It is also organic at a reasonable price. However, it does take longer to cook but it is not a problem to us.
