So the hottest hot off the press recommendation is an ounce of almonds a day will help keep the doctor away.... and for good reason.  They're full of B (and other) vitamins, fiber,   not cholesterol, not sodium, not empty calories, and not tasteless wallpaper paste....          But these     these new Blue Diamond almonds (I've so far tried both the Brown Sugar Cinnamon and the Vanilla    are soooooo good that it's hard to stop at an ounce.  This has become my after dinner treat.          To help fight the sodium bugaboo, they've instead coated them with a velvet dairy whey based powder (take note, lactose intolerant folks) that is loaded with flavor.  They're not sweet    except the sweetness of the lactose.  And they're not the least bit salty.  They taste like a great dessert in both flavor and texture.          Thumbs way up    licking my fingers kind of up.
