I believe the world is divided into two groups: those that eat black licorice and those that don't.  I belong to the first group, which I also find to be superior.  (Just kidding, kind of).          I'm always looking for black licorice and cannot get enough of it.  I find licorice from Europe to be superior to that found in the states.  Gustaf's licorice is made in the UK, specifically where, I don't know.  It comes in a huge and heavy 5 lb bag.  It contains a long list of ingredients, including BEEF GELATINE. Okay, that's gross.  It also has Desiccated Coconut, whatever that is.          The licorice is not shiny like in the picture, but dull, like a tractor tire.  It smells good and has a nice pungent taste to it.  (The Beef Gelatin perhaps?) It's all stuck together but comes apart easily.  It's a bit soft for my liking, but hopefully it will harden up over time.  Despite the disgusting addition of beef gelatin to my licorice (I know gelatin is from hooves, but do you have to remind me?) I will eat this licorice.  I have uploaded a picture to show everyone how this mass of licorice really looks, just so you don't stock up for parties.          Will I order it again?  Probably not.  I want a company to lie to me about where gelatin comes from.  Gustaf is just too honest for his own good.
