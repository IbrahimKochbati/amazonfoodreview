I don't actually eat much milk and cereal, but I do snack on frosted mini wheats throughout the day. I just grab a handful here and there when I'm hungry and looking for a snack.  There IS some sugar added obviously, but there's also a lot of fiber.  When compared to a typical snack, this is the far healthier choice.  Loved them when I was a kid and I love them now.
