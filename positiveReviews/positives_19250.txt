Great toy for short periods of observed play.  My adult cattledog figured out how to removed the ball almost immediately, while the puppy took several minutes.  Even so, they have not tired of playing the game.  After removing the ball quickly a few times, they will complicate the puzzle by tossing the cube around, batting at it with their paws, pouncing on it...and only then remove the ball.  They wait for me to put the ball back in, and wait until I tell them to "Go find".          This is not for the dog who runs off with a toy and plays keep away, as the thin rubber "bars" of the cube could be easily chewed and ingested (my puppy had to be told not to chew it).  Of course, all of the Kyjen puzzle toys are designed to be enjoyed by dogs playing in the company of their owners.  They are excellent training tools for "wait", "go find", "give" and the concept of taking turns (one dog waits while the other finds).  I work my dogs on them for about 15 minutes, then put the toys away.  They stay new and exciting that way.
