As the initial reviewer stated, the biggest issue with this product is its durability, or lack thereof.          With the Nylabone  and name on it and a price approaching $10 you might be under the impression that this will last quite awhile.  I timed how long it took my dog to eat the largest one they make (the one shaped like a fist).  It took him 11 minutes to leisurely eat and about 2 minutes to 'clean up' the mess.  If he were actually hungry he probably could have done it a few minutes faster.  So, almost a dollar a minute for this product when viewed as an entertainment chew toy product.  It's possible to get them for about half price from some of the amazon vendors but this only makes sense when buying large quantities due to the expense of shipping on small orders from them.          I was hoping this might last awhile and be better for him than the 'plastic' Nylabone products which exit the dog in solid chunks (eww!).          My dog thoroughly enjoyed this but at these prices I can't justify it.
