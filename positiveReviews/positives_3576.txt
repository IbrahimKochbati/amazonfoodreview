As someone who suffers occasionally from digestive difficulties, these Kavli Crispy Thins are among the few things that I can eat at such times.  I always keep these crackers around to add to soups.  However, there are also times when they are the only thing I can properly digest.  This is a great item to have around when having digestive difficulties associated with the flu or stress.  For me they work better than the "bananas, rice, applesauce or toast" of the BRAT diet used in relieving IBS. These thin, easy to chew crackers are a really great product.
