I've been feeding liver biscotti for years. I was looking for a healthy treat without additives for my epileptic dog (additives can be a seizure trigger) and liver biscotti filled the bill. The ingredients are top quality. The bite size bits are perfect for training and don't muck up your pockets. The bite size portions also make it possible to give rewards without adding pounds, which is a problem with other treats.  And for dogs with wheat and other sensitivities, there is an anti allergenic recipe. Enthusiastically recommended!
