I bought this with the expectation of receiving exactly what is shown in the picture.  Obviously, that doesn't happen (like most tragic marketing schemes).  The plant arrived with 6 TINY traps of which 3 were in dormancy (fully black and dried out   but hey I live in VA so it's cold here).  So you can imagine I was somewhat disappointed at first.  Then I stuck with it and kept raising it for 3 weeks.  New traps grew and the plant seems to be doing fairly well.  The traps are also looking bigger.          I would recommend this purchase, but buyers should not expect a PERFECT plant to arrive.
