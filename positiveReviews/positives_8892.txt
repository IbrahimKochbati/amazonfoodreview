I have been using butter ghee for cooking purposes, and found this product on Amazon.  The color is much darker than the grocery store product I had been using, and this product has a richer flavor as well.  I have been buying grassfed butter online as well, and it's clear there is a flavor difference.  I would recommend this product and will continue to buy it for cooking.  Butter is good for  ead, ghee is better for cooking, and grass fed is the best!
