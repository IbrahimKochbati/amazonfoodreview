One the plus side, I seem to use a lot less of this than I do regular sugar in my coffee. On the down side, I'm not really happy with the taste. It's not bad, just a little strange. Not at all like coconuts   I like coconut flavored coffee and coconut oil (I even like coconut oil in my coffee a la "Bulletproof Coffee"). I've also found hard particulate matter, just a little bit, in the bottom of my coffee mug. Something I don't see when using regular sugar.          I'm not at all disappointed in my purchase, and I plan on using it all. But I'm not sure I'd buy it again. Truly a YMMV situation.
