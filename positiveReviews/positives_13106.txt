These treats are the bee's knees. I've bought them in EVERY flavor they offer. Lamb liver is a great flavor, but my pups love all the flavors equally, it seems. Each treat is about 1" wide and 1" to 1 1 2" in length. Good sized treat for a bigger dog, and if you have smaller dogs like my shelties, these jerky treats tear apart easily into smaller bites with no crumbs, no mess. They smell like the jerky I buy for myself, and have quality ingredients. The shelties love them! I gave a bag to my sister for her giant dogs and they love them too, they work hard for these treats to get them out of puzzle toys.  My parents' little pom terrier mix has a special place in her heart for anything liver, so these were well received (*snarf snarf snarf*) by that pup too.          My younger sheltie can't handle grain or gluten... he has epilepsy that is possibly triggered by gluten, so I feed both furkids grain free everything. Even if he didn't have epilepsy, I'd probably still feed grain free, including these treats, because my shelties have *fantastic* silky soft coats from feeding them this way. I don't buy these treats here, I get them elsewhere, but they are a fantastic deal for 12 ounces of treats, it's a LOT of little torn up bite sized treats for my shelties during training. Each bag lasts me about a month, I think.
