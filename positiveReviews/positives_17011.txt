I purchased this toy for my four month old corgi; she absolutely loves it. The only problem is she figured out how to get the bottom off (where humans fill to bottle) before she figured out how to use it as designed. So, if you have a corgi or any extremely  ight dog, you may want to consider gluing the bottom shut and taking a more difficult approach of filling with treats via the top.
