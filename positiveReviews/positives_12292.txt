Local store's discontinued sale   3.50 USD.          I bought a jar.          Upon eating some I was stunned at what was happening to my mouth. Eager to replicate the impossible, I took another spoonful.          The next day I bought the rest of the jars. There are no more jars. After the last I slept for 20 hours.          I'm scared. If I order more, part of me will be satiated, but at a terrible cost to my faculties. The agonizing wait makes purchasing a zero sum game.          Apricots taste like ash now.
