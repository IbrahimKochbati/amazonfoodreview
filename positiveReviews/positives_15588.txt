My Tigger was a kitten when he came to me (Dropped)he loved the outdoors but often got into some accidents that ended up at the Vet's office, needless to say he then wouldn't eat and was loosing weight. I had tried other cat foods but nothing he would even look at, then I tried Petite Cuisine Tuna & Shrimp to mine and Tigger's amazement he fell in "LOVE" and eats well now. He is now 2 yrs old and I have another (Dropped) 2 yr old male Cat and he also loves this cat food. Tigger and Ziggy are very "Happy Cats".
