Couldn't believe it when told how relaxing this beverage was. Seriously, drink it only if you are getting ready for a nap or bedtime. If you have plans to drive or perform any other activity not recommended.          I feel my arms and legs almost tingle with relaxation. After a short time my eyes start to get droopy and I am in another place.          Love this stuff.
