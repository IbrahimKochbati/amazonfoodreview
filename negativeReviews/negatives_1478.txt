I'm sorry to hear about the difficulty in finding the details about the Hill's Science Diet Savory Chicken Entr&eacute;e Adult Cat Canned Food on our website.          I checked our website and found that the item Hill's Science Diet Savory Chicken Entr&eacute;e Adult Cat Canned Food is currently only offered by the third party sellers on our website.          Amazon Merchants and Marketplace sellers are independent, third party sellers who offer a variety of new and used merchandise through Amazon.com. When buying from a third party, your order is fulfilled directly by the merchant. As a result, Amazon Merchants set their own shipping terms. In general, these charges reflect the handling costs for assembling and packaging each order, as well as shipping costs.          Products listed for sale by Amazon Merchant should be identical to the new items sold by Amazon.com, with any differences noted in the description of the item's condition.          When you shop with an Amazon Merchant their merchant's shipping terms will apply to your purchase. Rates, restrictions, and methods vary from merchant to merchant and are not set by Amazon.com. For instance, while some merchants will ship to international destinations, others do not.          You can always view details of a merchant's rates and policies from the product detail page of an item you're interested in buying, and from the order form before you submit your order.          As Amazon.com doesn't handle the shipping of Amazon Merchant items, you'll need to contact the specific Merchant with any questions you may have before ordering. They'll be happy to help answer your questions.
