Coffee is a personal taste so hard to review for others, but by way of comparison:  My favorite  ands are this and Tully's for Keurig, and Starbucks for non Keurig.  I find them smooth and full of flavor (for typical house blends).  So, if you like either of the others, you'll probably like this too.  And I like that profits go to charity for this one too.  Enjoy
