Cats love this stuff. One pouch doesn't go far so it is more of a treat than a meal (unless you feed according to recommendations on box).          Pouches are easy to open and a little messy, always seems to get on my fingers.          My cats come running if they see me reach for the pouch or they hear the sound of flicking it back and forth before opening.          All the yucky stuff (think fast food for cats) must be addicting because they seem to listen for the very quiet sound of the rustling pouch.  We give pouches as a treat.
