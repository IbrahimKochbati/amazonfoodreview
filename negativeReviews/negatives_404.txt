These taste alright, but they are health food by no means. At least regular potato chips are just greasy potato slices. This products is made of processed potato by product and is natural by no means. The calorie savings isn't even significant enough to give up the better taste of potato chips. Also keep in mind that the healthiest part of a potato chip is the oil (if eaten in moderation) because of the healthy dose of balanced fats. In my opinion if you want a healthy chip eat sun chips or a cracker like triscuits. If you want a potato chip eat a real potato chip. If you feel these taste better than the above, then by all means enjoy, but don't be tricked into believing these are healthy at all.     Overall 4 stars for taste and 2 stars for the marketing scam that they are.
