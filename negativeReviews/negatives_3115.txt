I have become somewhat of a coffee snob over the years and consider it one of the few grocery items that I will pay top dollar for if it suits my taste. My preferred coffee is Seattle's Best French Roast, so comparing that to this Melitta Classic Supreme may not be entirely fair.          While this coffee has a somewhat pleasant aroma, it tasted a little bitter. I did not follow the recommended preparation of two spoons per 6 oz. because it would end up way too strong for my palate. I used the same measurement that I use with the Seattle's Best, a perfect cup, in my opinion. I also provided this coffee to some house guests, who thought it was just okay.          So the bottom line for me is that this coffee is okay, but not excellent. It is cut in a very fine grind, which I like, but the bean is not very dark. The  ewed aroma is not something that perks you up either. If you are a coffee connoisseur and do not like a dark roast blend, give this a try.
