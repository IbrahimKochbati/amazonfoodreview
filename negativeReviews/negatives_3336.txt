These lamb and barley treats have some excellent features. I was impressed the certified organic ingredients, the re sealable bag, and I like that they are large bones, but are scored so they can be  oken in half. Left whole, the treats are good for large dogs, but when  oken in half would be good for medium sized dogs. They seem a bit too hard for small dogs.          Our dogs usually like lamb flavored food, so this seemed like a good choice. We have three dogs and each had their own reaction to the treat. Our smallest dog, who usually likes anything, would barely sniff the treat and didn't even try to eat it. The middle sized dog who is more picky wouldn't eat it at first. After playing with it for a few minutes, he finally did eat it. I'm assuming the smell wasn't appealing to him since it doesn't smell like a typical dog treat. Our dogs are used to a variety of store bought and homemade dog treats. However, these organic treats smelled like hay to me (I'm assuming that's the barley), and therefore weren't very well received by two of my dogs.          Our Golden Retriever likes most any treats and she ate this one without hesitation. While the treats might be great for some, since only one of our dogs will eat the treats regularly, I don't think they would be worth the extra cost for our household.
