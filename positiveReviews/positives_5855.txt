By god, is there anything this stuff can't do?     Recently when it snowed holy hell, I was out of rock salt     with which to ensafen the driveway with. Sure enough, Meyeberg's     powederized saviour came to the rescue. With just a few sprinkles of this remarkable 'Jesus in a can', every last bit of that ice didn't just melt, but literally *sublimated* away, leaving bare, dry... and actually kind of unnervingly warm, concrete beneath!     However, it managed to turn snow into ice cream, also apparently induces water into wine by proximity alone!     However, since this occoured, I have never been able to reproduce these  eathtaking effects. Except for one:     It makes a very rich quishe.
