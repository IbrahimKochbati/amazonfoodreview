I enjoy the flavor and use it for much of my cooking and add it as the oil to my home made granola.  It does not cook well on high heats (as advertised), but does well at medium to low heat.  It's health benefits far outweigh vegetable oil and canola oils.  I use both this and coconut oils whenever possible for flavor.
