For a regular cup of coffee, I like the smooth taste of Donut House Extra Bold or Green Mountain Breakfast blend.  I did not like this one at all  I guess it just depends on your taste.  I could tell by the burnt unappealing aroma of it that I wouldn't like it.  It tasted bitter to me with a little bit of a bite to it.  This one's for you if you like a more bitter bittersweet coffee  it just didn't appeal to me because I like a smoother taste with less of an aftertaste.
