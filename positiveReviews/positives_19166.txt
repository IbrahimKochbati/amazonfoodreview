As a relatively new Keurig user (former Senseo user), I have been trying various flavored coffees along with regular pods.  This coffee was not bad, just not my favorite flavor combination.  I'm not sure why because how can you beat chocolate and raspberry.  This is just a personal preference issue.  The product was received in a timely manner and arrived in good shape.  So far my favorite flavored coffee is Timothy's Sugar Bush maple. This flavor may work well for you.  Enjoy
