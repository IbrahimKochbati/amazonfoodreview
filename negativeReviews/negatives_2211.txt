This was the nastiest flavored coffee I have ever had in kcups. I purchase many different kinds of flavored coffee and caramel is my favorite but this one made me gag. It smelled like buttery cheese and the taste was not what I expected. I will stick to gloria jeans and timothys flavored coffees. This was my first wolfgang puck kcup and will be the last I order of his  and. I thought maybe I got a bad cup but I  ewed 3 and I opened the other box and tried those since it comes with two boxes and same nastiness.
