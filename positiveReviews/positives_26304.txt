Love this popcorn and eat it often.  I wouldn't say its totally hulless....but 90% less get stuck in my teeth.          Also had the same issue as other reviewer...bag split open inside the cardboard box.  Popcorn was spilling out of the box as the UPS man  ought it in.  Amazon refunded me for it.  If someone at Whirley Pop is reading this....thicker bags please!          I do plan to purchase more when this runs out.
