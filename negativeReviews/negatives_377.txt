I love shrimp chips and I love healthier alternatives as well so I thought these would be a match made in heaven. Not so much. The flavors were too strong most of the time (I am a huge fan of pepper but even I had a hard time enjoying the salt & pepper flavor and the salt and vinegar made me shudder with each bite because of how strong the vinegar flavor is    and this is from someone who currently lives in the UK and enjoys all types of vinegar crisps here) and too bleh in others. The only flavors that my husband and I both liked were the bbq and sour cream and onion and we didn't enjoy them enough to want to buy these again.          I wish these were as good as all the hoopla regarding them said but we still have 15 bags of these in our cabinet four months later uneaten so needless to say, I will be giving these away and avoiding them from now on.
