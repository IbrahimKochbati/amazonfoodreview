I've eaten these for a long time, and they are totally awesome, though not always easy to get hold of (they run out).  Great protein source for a busy vegan like me, plus I am a fitness trainer and workout a lot, so I need the convenient protein. Personally I think mesquite lime is the best, flavor wise, of all the Primal Strips, but they are all good.  My hubby loves the barbecue ones.
