The coffees are great, if you can get one that doesnt bust open while  ewing and ruin your coffee! its good if you are looking for a bargain and dont mind making a second cup very once and a while, but if you use the keurig machine because you are a busy person, these coffees are not the right purchase for you. The flavor is though! just buy a normal sized package instead.
