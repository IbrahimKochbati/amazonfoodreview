I have used honey for many, many years   and still do. But I really love agave nectar, especially when using it in cold things that I want to sweeten, as it readily mixes in (honey is not good for mixing in cold things   it stays in a gooey wad). This is a very good agave nectar and it is extremely economical compared to honey. I highly recommend this product!
