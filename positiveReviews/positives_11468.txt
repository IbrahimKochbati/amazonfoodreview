This orzo is absolutely delicious, with a firm bite and an astounding 9 g of fiber in every serving (and when it comes to pasta, that's what you should be looking for on the package). This is the healthiest and most delicious choice I've found in whole grain pastas, bar none. The orzo shape is great for cold salads and hot dishes alike    I really like making a hot caprese style pasta dish with this stuff. I don't buy anything else ... and you can't beat Amazon's price for the 4 pack, particularly if you select the automatic shipment option (I get a new pack every 3 months).
