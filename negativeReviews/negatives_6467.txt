Disclaimer: I have this on subscribe and save.          I make yogurt with raw milk and this product, when I don't have any yogurt lying around it makes for a very tangy yogurt that is fairly runny. (Milk heated to 110F and incubated at same for 12 hours.)          If I "cook" the milk to 180F (then cool to 110F before adding this) then it makes for a very firm yogurt that is bland.          So, if I had to make a recommendation, it would be to buy this if you're wanting bland yogurt that will be mixed with various fruits. Otherwise just use a dollop of an otherwise edible yogurt as a starter and chance the result.          It does contain sucrose so if you're attempting to be paleo primal you will need to weigh up whether that's acceptable or not.          Bland and firm vs runny and tangy. Your choice.
