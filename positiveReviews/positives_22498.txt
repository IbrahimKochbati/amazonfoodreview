I purchased this popcorn to use in my popcorn machine. It pops easily. It is very flavorful that every time we have a movie under the stars its the first thing the gets eaten up. Everyone in my family enjoys it. We no longer buy microwave popcorn. The package is easy to open and pour into the machine. The part I really enjoy is that it is all measure out so all I have to do is put it into the kettle. I don't have to stress out about making sure I have the right oil, butter or kernels.
