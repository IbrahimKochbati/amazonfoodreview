Loved the coconut dominated taste and the health benefits are a bonus.  A minor complaint is the bars fall apart easily.  Make sure if this is something you would take with you that you can keep it somewhere protected or you will have a crumbly mess when you open the wrapper.          Price wise it is pretty comparable to what is out there.  You get 5 bars per box and six boxes per order, 30 bars total.  With Amazon subscribe and save you can lower the cost even more.  If the gluten free, wheat free and non dairy aspects are important to you then these are recommended.
