The Oriental Flavor Ramen Noodles taste okay but I almost always add ingredients to make the dish more wholesome. I prepare it by adding sesame seed oil, vegetables and water then adding the seasoning and noodles after the water boils. Rough vegetables like chopped onions taste better if they are boiled with the seasoning for 15 minutes prior to adding the noodles.
