I wasn't sure I was going to like this   I'd had other Tasty Bite meals and they were all sold out, so I took this, thinking of the lentils my mother used to make, and wondering if it was edible. Now it is one of my favorite Tasty Bites! Its very soupy   you definitely need to eat it from a bowl with a spoon. The taste is just out of this world   perfectly seasoned, rich and creamy   I don't know what it is, exactly but it makes my tongue just dance. I eat them for lunch, sometimes alone or with a vegetable, there isn't a lot in a packet but it's a good side dish size for one person too.
