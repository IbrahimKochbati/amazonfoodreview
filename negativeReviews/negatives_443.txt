If you like Werther's hard candies, you may like these. The pretty good caramels. But they are hard, and really sticky. Like "do I have all my fillings?" sticky.          Eating a bag now. But I wanted caramels, and these really aren't. The are closely related, but so different, in terms of texture.          Not my cup of tea. If you like your caramels really hard (not hard candy hard, but still), you may love these. If you think caramels should be soft and chewy, you may not.          Now, I just tried warming them up, and that really helped. Almost tempted to raise it up to 4 stars. Don't microwave it though. That turns them into a bubbling mass of goo!
