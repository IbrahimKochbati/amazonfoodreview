After years of searching, I finally found a decaffeinated coffee that is strong enough to be called coffee.  This Lavazza has a deep flavor with smooth and enjoyable taste. So pleaseantly surprised that I can drink decaf coffee now, throughout the day, and not feel cheated by an underwhelming flavor.  Lavazza is super!!
