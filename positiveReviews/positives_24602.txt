Our dog gets pumpkin mixed with her dry food.  Grocery stores don't have much in stock, so I ordered a case from Amazon.  I was a little worried about the reports of damaged cans.  Delivered within a couple of days.  Cans were in great shape.  One can had a small dent.  I'll order from Amazon again when we run out.
