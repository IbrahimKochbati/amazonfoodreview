The dressing came quickly and was packed carefully.  I had thought I was getting the dry powder to mix with milk and mayonaise and make my own so I was very disappointed.  I was cooking for a large group in another country and needed the powder for traveling. I thought no problem, I'll just return it but found out most food items are not returnable.  Now I have 84 tiny packages of dressing that I have no idea of how I will use. I needed to read the info more carefully and it would have been helpful if it had been specified more clearly.  The powder and ready made were all mixed together on the shopping pages.  Perhaps someone else can learn from my mistake.
