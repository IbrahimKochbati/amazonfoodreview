Simple, plug in setup. Garageband recognizes it right away, as long as it's opened as first step, before plugging in Icicle. Nice, clean, "transparent" sound without much coloring with my Electrovoice stage mic. Depending upon your setup, you may have to crank up your inputs and headphone volumes to get comfortable levels.  Blue recommends plugging directly into computer. A great little device for the price!
