I love Starbucks but I don't like paying the price for espresso from Starbucks. When I was looking around on Amazon and found these beans were  ewed by Starbucks and made by Kirkland, me being a Cosco lover and a Starbucks lover I was sold! Verrry glad I decided to go with these beans! They taste like high quality espresso beans, I get compliments all the time when I make friends and family lattes. You can not go wrong! purchase these beans!
