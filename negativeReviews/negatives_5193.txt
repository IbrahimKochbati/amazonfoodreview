I received my order this chocolate quickly and it was well packed. There was no damage to the chocolate from heat. In fact the merchandise was in the very good condition.          The confection itself had nothing specific to recommend it. Oh, it was good but it was not remarkably good. I believe one day just as well by buying supermarket chocolate. In my opinion this was definitely not gourmet chocolate.          Therefore, although I don't have anything actually negative to say about this stuff, I don't think it is worth the price and again I think one is better off buying chocolate in the supermarket, since the quality of their product is as good as this.
