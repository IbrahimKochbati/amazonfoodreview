Enjoying a cup of coffee or two a day, I was really disappointed when acid  reflux reared its head and coffee was off my list. I enjoy coffee. Alot. I enjoy the whole process, the ritual. I was glad to find this coffee, but really wasn't that hopeful. It turned out to be a nice, smooth, mellow coffee that my stomach tolerates. This is not to say I can drink alot of it, but for a nice hot cup of coffee, it definately does the trick.
