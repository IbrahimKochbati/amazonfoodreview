I bought this to take a check mark off of the bucket list, but my wife and I had a cup of this and both of us immediately got sick with a headache and vomiting profusly. What made it worse it's Christmas and this day is shot now. We're coming through it but I'm sorry to say but my bucket list was almost over before it got started. Try if you want but it's made us sick and almost in the hospital. This is a Christmas I'd like to forget.
