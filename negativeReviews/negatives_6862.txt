I wanted to have the best movie theater tasting popcorn for my son's upcoming carnival birthday and was very disappointed in this popcorn.  I love salty foods, but this was way too salty even for me.  And the tast was just off.  It tasted chemically or artificial.  Based off of the positive reviews, I bought to boxes   48 packs   and it's just a waste because they will go in the garbage.
