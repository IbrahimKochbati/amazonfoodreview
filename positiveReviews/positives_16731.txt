Used too make syrup for canning our peaches this year.  It worked great, doesn't seem too raise the blood sugar on my     husband which is diabetic.  Gives the peaches a fresh, sweet taste.  Not bitter like most of the artificial sweeteners.     Can't use splenda, because of allergies.          Good in everything I've used it in.  Will continue too buy.  Great product
