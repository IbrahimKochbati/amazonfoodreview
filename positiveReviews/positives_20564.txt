My husband loves this  and of peppermint tea, but he goes in phases of drinking a ton and then just drinking a little bit.  It was hard for me to keep it stocked regularly b c I wasn't monitoring his consumption, but now I just order 6 boxes and have them delivered every 3 months!  It's a little cheaper than buying them at the store, and I don't have to worry about forgetting to put it on my list!!
