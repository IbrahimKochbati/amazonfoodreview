Let's face facts, dogs will pretty much eat anything that you put in front of them   they really are not that choosy.  They drink dirty garden water, smell each other privates, and occasionally snack on cat turds, so trying to determine if a treat tastes good really is not that easy.          Having said that, my two medium size dogs (roughly 30 pounds each) absolutely love these treats. I like the fact that they don't have that smelly dog treat scent that most have (they smell more like people food   kind of like a ginger snap), and because they are harder and larger than my normal treats, the dogs must crunch them, promoting tooth cleanliness. But if you have a smaller dog (I also have a Yorkie), these treats are just way too large.          They are about two inches long and one inch wide (with a perforation in the middle). They contain organic ingrediants including carrots, apples and molasses, rather than fillers like corn meal.  They are relatively easy to  eak at the perforation   but really hard to  eak down further (though a hammer works well).  My Yorkie looked down at the treat then looked up at me with an expression of "you gotta be kidding me" and stared at me until I gave him one of his regular treats.          The only drawback is that unless they are purchased in bulk, they are a bit expensive, so I would not use them as a training treat. But for the occasional atta boy treat   my older boys love them.
