Kiwi and strawberry are a good combination, and combined with a bit of carbonation, this drink "hits the spot".  It is made from real fruit juice (concentrate), but it still has 33g of sugar.  As a "snack" or "treat," it would be good, but I don't think I would drink it if I was just thirsty.  8.3oz isn't much.  Nice concept similar to an "energy" drink, but not just sugar and caffeine.
