My 4 jars were shipped in lots of bubble wrap, it took me a while to open.  Anyways, it is real artichoke spread, made in Italy.  Claims all natural ingredients and no preservatives.  My first shock is the size of the jars.  4.5 oz ain't much   think baby food.  The other thing I didn't like is that nowhere on any of the jars could I find an expiration date!!  Looks like Amazon took individual jars not labeled for resale from a large box.  Maybe it is OK to sell stuff in Italy without a date, but I am sure some law is being violated selling it here in the US.  Anyways, I opened a jar and it tastes OK, so I'm keeping it this time, but have doubts about re ordering in the future.          My recommendation for Amazon: if you want to get into the online food selling business, please make sure that not only the products are labeled properly, but the expiration date is noted on the product page.
