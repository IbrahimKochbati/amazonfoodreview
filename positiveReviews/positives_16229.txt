My dog loves these snacks.  I have a smaller rat terrier mix dog she loves these even more than Cherrio's.  They come in a canister which is flimsy but I threw it away as they are also in a resealable bag. They should last a fairly long time as I don't give them to her daily, only for special treats and after she takes any medicines.
