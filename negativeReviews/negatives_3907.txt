When it comes to low calorie drinks, I'll usually partake in a flavored water or apple juice. This little can, however, packed some big taste!          First Impressions: I must admit, I was disappointed in the size of the container. Sure, it's slender and can fit on shelves easier, but in the end, it means less juice. I read about the promise of 100% juice and 0% added sugars and preservatives. I knew the only way to properly test this out was to crack open the can.          Appearance and Nutrition:  This can is identical to the size of a Red Bull, giving us about 8.3 ounces to drink, roughly 4 less than a standard soda can.     The nutritional facts tell us that each one of these little cans packs 135 calories. There's sodium and a pretty high carbohydrate count of 34 grams   plus 33 grams of sugar (that's regular, not added). It does have 100% vitamin C, so there's a plus.          Taste: This is a sweet, fruity drink. The sweetness is natural, not artificial, which is a very nice change of pace for those who want to kick soda to the curb. It has the right blend of kiwi, raspberry, strawberry, apple and grape juices   no one overpowers the other. If a drink has a high carbonation level I usually hiccup, but that didn't happen here.          Final Thoughts: While the taste is good, I'm not ready to "make the switch" for two main reasons:     (1) The small can size.     (2) The large calorie count.          For a quick burst of fruity goodness, this is a good choice. However, if you want more drink with fewer calories, I'd suggest a 1 liter bottle of Clear Splash water, which retails for about the same price.
