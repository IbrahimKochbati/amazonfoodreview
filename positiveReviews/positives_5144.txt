It really is!  I am not a fan of carbonated drinks because most of them are simply not healthy.  I even know people who have developed physical problems because of too much consumption of them, especially those who even drink them as a starter in the morning.          BUT THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT. It has a real full bodied orange  tangerine flavor, although the label says it is combined with other juice concentrates:  apple, grape and acerola juice (I had to look that one up:  it is the cherrylike fruit of a small tree of the West Indies which has a high concentration of vitamin C).  Anyway, it's just darned good!          I experimented a little on the best way to serve.  I drank it cold as is, then poured it over a glass of ice cubes.  Neither of those ways seemed quite right.  Then I poured the beverage on ice, left it for a minute, then removed the ice by pouring juice through a strainer.  This left it nice and chilled, not just cold, and not weakened by melting ice.          I live in the Colorado Desert where temperatures are scorching in the summers.  Orange juice doesn't quite quench my almost constant thirst, but has been the best thing available to me until now.  Yes, I will definitely SWITCH TO SWITCH, forgive the pun!          It's actually good for you too.  Hope one day it will be in ALL schools.
