These are among the best chips I have ever eaten!  I first came upon them when I visited a CostPlus World Market store in Opelika, AL, in the Tiger Town Mall, in 2007.  I wasn't a big fan of dijon flavored anything, but I decided to give these chips a try.  I was hooked.  I probably ended up buying over a dozen bags within just a few months' time.  I searched all over my part of Alabama (the northwestern part of the state) and could not find them.  I later tried to find them at the World Market in Hoover, at the Patton Creek Shopping Center, and they did not carry this flavor.  However, when I learned that they were available on Amazon.com, and also available for PRIME Shipping   I bought them as soon as I read "Kettle Chips Honey Dijon, 9 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)!"          You get a pretty big box, filled with 12 bags of these delicious morsels.  They last quite a while, but I will re order, very, very soon!  I suggest you buy them, in this bulk form, and enjoy them   you won't be disappointed!  They go great with hamburgers and hot dogs   so they're perfect for spring and this coming summer's outdoor activities and cook outs!          Take my word for it, these chips are a hidden gem lost in the world of snack foods!  Buy some today, and fall in love like me!
