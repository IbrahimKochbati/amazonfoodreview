This Walkers Premium short ead selection is a huge tin of short ead cookies. Luckily, they are wrapped in many packages, so they can stay fresh longer. If one is absolutely in love with short ead cookies, I suppose this would be a good gift. Personally, I thought it was too much short ead cookies. There are four different ones, but they all taste the same to me. I served them up to a bunch of kids and they didn't like them. I thought they were okay, but I wasn't in heaven over them and certainly don't have a craving for them. They are very buttery, but I find them bland and flavorless. I guess maybe that's what short ead cookies are all about. These were a gift to my husband. I don't think I'd go out of my way to buy them. I'm not too embarrassed to serve them to guests, so that's how we'll get rid of them. Not bad, but not great.
