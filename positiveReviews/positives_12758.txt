I grew up "doctoring" my mother's oatmeal with massive amounts of  own sugar. Then  eakfast hot cereal makers started adding sweeteners, which at first, seemed OK, but as I grew less needy of the morning sugar fix, they all seemed too sweet. This is a perfect blend of taste and fiber for both my husband and I, who buy it two boxes at a time and always seem to run out. Great for traveling, camping, or using as a "safe food" after a bout with the flu or stomach problems.
