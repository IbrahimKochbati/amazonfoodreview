I am on the fence with these, as they are pretty tasty for being a store bought cookie but they are 180 calories each, and granted they are a decent size, it would be WAY easy to eat several at one sitting. Maybe the good thing is they come individually wrapped so you stop and think before you eat more than 1 cookie. I know my husband would of had more  ) I'm not so sure I would purchase these on a regular basis, but I can see where they would be VERY convenient for travel or for lunches.
