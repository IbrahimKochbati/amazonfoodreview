I don't know how people could say this doesn't smell or taste bad. It is horrible!! I was getting raw goat's milk for quite a while and when we moved it wasn't available. The fresh raw milk was delicious and mild and did not have that gamey odor and flavor that this milk has. Maybe some people don't mind the taste, maybe some acquire a taste for it, and maybe some even like it, but I think it is vile. If you like the taste of the goat's milk cheese in stores, then you may like this, if not, stay far, far away!
