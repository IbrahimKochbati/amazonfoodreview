If only more people knew that if they ate high protein, low sugar and high fiber for  eakfast not only would they actually stay full until lunch time, they would also help control their weight! This cereal is awesome, and is one of the few high protein low sugar cereals on the market. Wish it would have a little more fiber, but it tastes great and keeps you full. Kids love it, too. An extra special bonus : )
