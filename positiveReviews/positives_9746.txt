Like many people who have bought this sauce, I decided to pay the extra nickel to try the hot sauce created by none other than one of my favorite singers from one of my favorite bands growing up, The Offspring.And like many of those who have purchased online, this sauce isn't available in stores near us.          First off, I am a native of New Orleans. I'd like to think I know a thing or two about hot sauces. Tabasco, Crystal, and many other hot sauces that have had heart and soul put into them have made their way onto my plate. But man........Dexter hit the money on this one. This sauce is truly amazing, for lack of better words. You get a burst of flavor when you first bite into your dish covered in Bandito, then a nice after rush of spice hits the tongue for a great ending. I really haven't found a dish that it doesn't go good on.          I was skeptic at first, as I knew going in that I was only buying it because I was a fan of The Offspring. But I can tell you now, that this sauce is officially a household staple in my home. This is literally the best hot sauce i have EVER had. Try it!
