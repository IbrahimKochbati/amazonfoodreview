The 2.5 oz. size bags of Great Northern Popcorn comes with oil on one side of bag and the popcorn and salt on the other side. This way you can add the oil to the popper and warm it up ( usually takes around 3 minutes.) Add the popcorn and salt and in just a few minutes you are ready to enjoy. Now I did found some old maids, but i had tried other popcorns and also found it true with these too. This has a good taste and just the right amount of salt. I feel that this is a good buy for the money. This work good with the use of the 2.5 oz table top retro style popcorn popper.
