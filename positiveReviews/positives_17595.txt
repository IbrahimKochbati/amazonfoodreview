I have tried two other of these low acid coffees, and the others in the past eventually still upset my stomach after a couple cups. I still couldn't drink them two or three days in a row. This one is different! I was able to drink two cups, two days in a row without any stomach upset, and it has a wonderful taste as far as coffee goes. I would definitely buy this again!
