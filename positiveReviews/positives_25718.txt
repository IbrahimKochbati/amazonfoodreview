What I like about this cookie:          The size: It's not huge, but definitely large so one is quite filling.     The taste: Very nice, subtle blend of oatmeal, chocolate (real pieces) and almond pieces.     The freshness: I don't usually like boxed cookies. They tend to be unexciting and dry. But these cookies are specially wrapped individually so that they maintain freshness and softness.          True, one must handle them gently as they do crumble easily. If one does that, they shouldn't crumble. I find they taste especially nice with coffee, hot or iced.          I am very pleased with this cookie and am looking forward to finishing the box. Would definitely purchase these and I rarely buy cookies in the store.
