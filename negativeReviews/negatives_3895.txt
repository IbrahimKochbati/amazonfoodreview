My guess is the other flavors of Switch taste better. I thought this had an overkill berry flavor and aftertaste. It probably would have been okay if it were cherry flavored. That being said, I'm not sure I would let my dislike of the flavor dissuade you from trying it. Could just be a personal preference.
