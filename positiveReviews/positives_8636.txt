I have been drinking this coffee since I learned that it won a national (televised) competition for best tasting coffee in its category (organic).  I can't drink any other coffee now because all the others taste terrible compared to Weavers. Try this...grab a handful of whatever whole been coffee you drink in one hand.  Hold a handful of Weaver's whole been coffee in the other.  Look at the size of the beans.  Now notice the texture and smell of the  beans.  You don't even have to taste them to see that it is a high quality product.          I used to order this coffee directly from Weaver's website until I found it here on Amazon.  I was worried that it would not be as fresh as the coffee ordered directly from Weavers but Amazon sells so much of it, that it never sits around for long before being shipped out. It also arrives much faster via Amazon.          I can't think of anything bad to say about it.  It is a little more expensive than standard coffee but not much.  After you taste it, you won't mind the price.          God bless Amazon, UPS, and Weavers.
