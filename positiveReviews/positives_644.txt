I tired many different dog foods over the 3 yrs I have my cocker  iel. I then came upon this  eed specific dog food & figured I'd try it. My dog loves this food and always finishes his food. I've used this for over 1 yr now & he has not tired of it. I have seen a significant change (for the better) in him, he's more active and doing well.          I only buy this  and food for him now.          Buster gives it 2 paws up & I give it 5 stars.
