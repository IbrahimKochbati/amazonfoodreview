I tried to change my review to 4 stars, but I don't seem able to do that.  These are 3 oz cans of 4 different flavors of fish based catfood.  Chicken and rabbit are often more recommended for cats.  The first ingredient is fish  oth, making it somewhat high in moisture.  I've heard that cats often need more water than they drink, so I'd assume its a good thing to get more moisture down them, but this is an expensive way to do it (you could just add a little water to their food).  The good news is that there appears to be no grains in the ingredient list, looks like almost all meat based (except for the usual additives).  The grains in most catfoods are thought to not be good for the cats.  This catfood is not cheap, but it appears to be a better than usual cat food.
