As another reviewer mentioned, these treats are CRUNCHY!. I like them for 2 reasons..my dog can't just "woof them down", she has to chew them, so they last..and I like that the cruchiness may be good for her teeth. The treats are small, but again, are crunchy...I'm glad I found these. She loves them and I like giving them to her.
