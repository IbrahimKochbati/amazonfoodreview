These little bars are very good   very much like a Mounds bar but without the preservatives and other ingredients. Just a clean, sweet, tasty candy bar with a thin coat of milk chocolate. They are moist, unlike alot of other healthy coconut bars. They are heavenly if you are a coconut lover and definately satisfy a sweet tooth. Only 80 calories, 12g carbs per bar, so good for a treat.
