Our 8 month old Goldendoodle goes ga ga for these, and without a doubt they are very good for her teeth and mouth.... Problem: they give her THE WORST GAS we have ever smelled in our entire lives.  It took a while for us to figure out that these were what was giving her the gas because the vet recommended them, so we figured of course they must be legitimate.  But they are definitely the culprit. She might be the exception and maybe she just has a sensitive stomach, but I recommend you ask for a few samples at your vet to make sure your dog's stomach agrees with them before you buy the big bag.  Side note, our 5 month old Goldendoodle doesn't even like them, won't touch them, and he's a chewer!  I guess every dog is different.
