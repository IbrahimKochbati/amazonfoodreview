I prefer this powdered milk to the condensed form that Meyerberg sells. The condensed has a more sour flavor to it.  One has to realize that goat's milk is not cow's milk in that it is richer or creamier in flavor so it does startle one until your palate get's used to something which tastes "different". When it is warm, it honestly tastes about as close to what a milk product should taste. Cold it has a slight powdered milk processed flavor.          I actually made ice cream from this powdered milk and it turned out pretty good. It is like ice milk as this is milk, but it was different and enjoyable but quite sweet.          The recipe was 1 quart milk (8 scoops of powdered milk made warm and allowed to chill)          1 cup white sugar          1 tsp vanilla flavoring (you can try other flavorings like banana)          1 8 tsp salt          My electric freezer will freeze this in 20 minutes.          I like the powdered for it's ease and it keeps well. I can make up a quart and it will keep 2 weeks, so it is on hand and not wasting or forcing someone who has limited use to drink a gallon of milk. Granted one is used to cow's milk, but this is something one can get used to if they have allergies and I am glad it comes in a nice metal can with a plastic lid to reseal after you pop the top and a plastic measuring scoop to get it right.          One can will make 3 quarts of milk.
