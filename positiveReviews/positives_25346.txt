These Cet Hextra Premium chews are the best thing to come along since tooth ushes for K 9s.          I have 8 Australian Shepherds and  ushing their teeth regularly does NOT happen around here.  We have over 100 other animals and its too bad we can't give them to ALL.          When you open the package, they smell good enough for ME to chew on and all the dogs get them regularly.  Its their after dinner minty tooth ush.  My dogs range from 14 months to 16 yrs and they keep the teeth clean and pretty much plaque free which cuts down on the dental visits.  Needless to say I must buy the Large to Extra large 30 pack which can get pricy if I go through my Veterinarian therefore I shop on line for the best deal.
