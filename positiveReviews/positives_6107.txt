I bought this as an experiment to try on a camping trip.     After adding hot water, there was a  ief 'instant coffee' taste. But that was soon gone and I was left with a real good cup of coffee.  It's too expensive for my budget as a regular item, but I'll definitely include it on future camping trips, and driving trips with stays at cheap motels.
