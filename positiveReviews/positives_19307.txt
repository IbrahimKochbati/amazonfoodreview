I can't do white flour, and Japanese style  eaded pork cutlet was a great temptation I had sadly avoided for a while.  These  ead crumbs are SO good...I just love how well they work, making a nice crisp crust on the pork tenderloin.  I think they will also work for oven fried chicken.  They are definitely a crust crumb, and not to be added into meatloaf.  If you like Panko  ead crumbs, but want whole grain, you have to try these!
