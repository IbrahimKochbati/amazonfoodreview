I have used Harmony Valley hamburger substitute several times now and have been very happy. It is spiced and tastes pretty close to a meatball mixture. When used in sauce or to stuff peppers I cannot tell that it is not hamburger meat. I was thrilled with its performance and its ease of use.  I can't wait to try it in other recipes.
