Taste wise, these treats have "paw's up" from our 5 dogs. We have a yellow lab who absolutely loved them, a few bites and it was gone. She had no problems chomping it up. Our maltese took her time and ate every last crumb she could find. Our shih tzu did the same. Their offspring had no problems as well. Our maltese is a mere 9lbs and I did not need to  eak them in half. I do like the fact they have the line down the center for easy  eaking in two. Our eldest is quite picky, she is 17 and has years of experience with treats. Dispite being picky and not having many teeth left, she did take half of one that was offered and ate it. Mind you  she is a slow eater and can still chew hard treats and food. So 5 out of 5 taste wise.          Parent wise, as their owners we want them to eat healthy food with the right ingredients and these fit that criteria. They are not only tasty but healthy. Because they are a dry treat they leave crumbs. Some dogs will clean the crumbs up like mine; however some eat the larger pieces and leave the rest of the mess for you to clean up  so keep that in mind especially if its on a carpet.
