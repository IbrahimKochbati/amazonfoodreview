These bars are just the right balance between the flavor of the coconut & the sweetness of the rice syrup. Unfortunately, although the expiration date is in 2013, about a third of mine went bad, or perhaps started life that way. They had a funny, metallic taste, & one even had some black substance on it, which may or may not have been mold. I'm wondering if refrigerating would have prevented this. I highly recommend these bars, but beware of the keeping quality!
