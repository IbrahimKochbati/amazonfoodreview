I have to agree with the other reviews here.  Caribou makes an excellent coffee with a very distinctive taste. I bought this based on reading the other reviews and they were right on in their assessment and am thankful I took the time to read them.  I would encourage everyone to at least take a look at the Keurig site and compare what they have to offer in the way of coffee and prices.  I believe you will be very satisfied.  Free shipping, 10% off when you order 4 boxes, coffee club rewards program.  Just take a look.
