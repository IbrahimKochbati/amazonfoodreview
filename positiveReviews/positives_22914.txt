On my regime of eating better and working out, I have cut out all soda and high sugar juices and replacing with iced tea. I bought several boxes of Bigelow tea at my local store in various flavors, and this being one of them. I made iced tea one day using this Plantation Mint flavor. Before I even tasted it I could tell it was a love affair about to begin, just from the aroma. YUM! After I made the tea and tasted it, WOW. It's so refreshing and tastes so good. A lovely mint flavor that's not overwhelming but just right. It's also a great remedy for an upset stomach and or a cold, as it soothes, settles your stomach and makes you feel so much better. This is my all time favorite tea from Bigelow, with Constant Comment being my 2nd! Try it you'll love it!
