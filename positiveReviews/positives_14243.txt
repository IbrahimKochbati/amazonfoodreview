I like this potting soil for potting plants in containers.  The soil distributes moisture well, helping the plants stay moist on hotter days.  If I ever notice bugs, I just sprinkle some diatomaceous earth (seven dust) in with the soil; this usually kills off any infestations in the soil.  Then spray insecticidal soap on the leaves.  The best part about this soil is that it was delivered to my door!
