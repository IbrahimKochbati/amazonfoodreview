I have used this products off and on for several years. I decided to test trial this and use it every day for 30 days. I decided to make an iced tea verson of it sweetened with stevia. I love it. I make a 1 2 gallon every day and drink it. I have not changed my diet. What I have noticed is that I feel better, my skin is clearing up and I have lost some weight. THE taste is different. Yet, if you open your mind to the possibilities of the benefits, the taste is outweighed in my opinion. I did do 30 days and wait one week. Also, this price is unbelievable compared to my local whole foods.... Hope this helps.
