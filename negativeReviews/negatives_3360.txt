I was recently put on a gluten & nightshade free diet. Having spent the better part of 40 years eating yummy snacks like cheese & crackers or peanut butter & crackers, I was very unhappy with the new diet. When I discovered that a local grocery store actually carried GF products I was thrilled to find Glutino Crackers.          I managed to eat one. It was nasty. I tried again and again over the next few days to see if my opinion or desperation changed. It didn't. After staring angrily at the box of nasty crackers for over a week I decided they had to go. I took them to work to see if I could hand them off to someone else. Everyone tried a Glutino. Three people actually spit them out and the other two did not come back for more.  I'm not a fan of throwing away food but my husband wouldn't touch them either and there was no way I was going to get another one of these things down. They went in the trash.          Nasty!
