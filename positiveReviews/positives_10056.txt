Having lived in Europe for over 30 years, it was indeed a pleasure to savor a more classical, European style gourmet coffee. This was the first time that I had tried the Melitta  and and I was very pleased with the aroma during  ewing, which did remind me of cafes back in Britain and France. You need to make a fairly generous  ew to get the full bodied impact from this blend and it goes very well with cream and also a dab of honey. The taste is quite rich and the aroma during  ewing is very much like freshly ground coffee beans.          I am sure that I will be back for more as it makes for a delightful  ew that is great to wake up to on a Sunday morning, or any morning for that matter.
