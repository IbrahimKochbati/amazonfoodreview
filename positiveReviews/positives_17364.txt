Emeril's Original Essence is a way to add a fabulous zing to vegetables, meat or chicken.  I use it on steamed vegetables in the winter along with a heavy dose of butter, and my taste buds are awakened.  Great taste   use lightly, and the Essence lasts, and lasts, and lasts.  I think I had my last 2.8 oz for about three years.
