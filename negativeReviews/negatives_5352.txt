As someone who suffers from stomach problems exacerbated (if not caused) by drinking far too much coffee, I had high hopes for this product. Unfortunately, during the two days in which Puroast replaced my usual  ew, I noticed no significant changes to my physical or mental states nor any respite from my ailments.          So it strikes out as a medicine, but how is it as a beverage? The answer is, at best, nothing special.          While billed as a "dark French roast", the fine grind of the coffee was more suggestive of espresso, and for best results one should not make espresso in a standard automatic drip coffee pot. The coffee had an acrid aroma and initial taste, which quickly gave way to an empty and hollow flavor, such as one might get when drinking the melted ice from what was once an iced coffee or making instant coffee with cold water. In fairness, my wife liked it more, but she regularly dilutes the coffee that I make... why pay for gourmet when you could just add water?
