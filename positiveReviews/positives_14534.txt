Avocado oil has beneficial nutrients, vitamin A, E, and D, protein copper, and etc.  The nutrients are vital for hair growth and health.  I like using La Tourangell Avocado oil because it helps condition my hair.  It also, helps my hair retain moisture.  Do not puts too much on your scalp and hair or your hair is very oily.  I highly recomment this product for healthy hair, growth, and a very nice sheen.   "
