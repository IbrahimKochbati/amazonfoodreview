I can't even tell these are whole grain pancakes!  Better yet, these do not have that     stinky raw batter smell that you have with regular pancake mix.  I love foods that     are good for me but are not so yucky I have to make myself eat them. I also gave a box     to my Mom who is a diabetic so they will not cause a spike in blood sugar. I will never     go back to regular pancake mix after tasting these!
