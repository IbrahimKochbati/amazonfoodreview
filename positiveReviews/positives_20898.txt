I wanted to write to thank you for coming out with the Wunder smoothies.       My son is 9, autistic and a very picky eater. When I found your product at Roche Bros., I was taking a chance. Now my son has actually asked for them, using his voice!     One request, more flavors!          Sincerely,     Kelly Bossert
