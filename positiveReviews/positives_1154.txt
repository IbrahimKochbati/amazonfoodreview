As I was growing up my mother always made apple sauce cake for every birthday and special occasion.  After I was diagnosed with celiac I began trying to make a cake that was like the one my mother made.  After 6 years I gave up trying.  Then I saw this mix in the store 2 years ago and got very excited with the prospects.  When I make the cake I tweak the mix recipe a little. I add to the dry mix 1 4 cup coco, 1 2 cup chopped walnuts and 1 2 raisins. I use 3 large eggs, 3 4 cup apple sauce, 1 3 cup of oil and 1 3 cup water instead of what is listed on the bag.  This cake and the chocolate cake mix also made by Namaste are our family's favorites.  This includes my husband and children who are not celiac and are VERY picky eaters!
