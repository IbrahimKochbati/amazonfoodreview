Rocky loves all types of squeaky toys but this one is the best, he has hours of fun trying to get the rover out of the moon ball. Whenever i have guests i let rocky play with the moon ball and the rover. It keeps him occupied for hours. Its perfect for little dogs with lots of energy. Rocky has little paws that way he can stick his paws in the moon ball and retrieve the rover. Its easy to clean unlike other squeaky toys just wash with water and let dry and its ready to keep him occupied and lets me entertain my guests.
