I'm new to trying GF, and most of the 'substitution products' I've tried so far are okay, but don't taste quite 'right.'     This was the exception.  The pancakes I made with the GF bisquick were light and smooth and delicious!  I couldn't tell a difference, unless maybe they were a bit better. A larger box would be better, but the product itself is wonderful.     Highly recommended!!
