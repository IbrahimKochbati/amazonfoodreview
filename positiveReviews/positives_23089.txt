So far this is the best gluten free mix I have tried.  The first time I tried it the  ead didn't come out that good, I was wondering what I had done wrong, sure enough, I read the instructions again and I noticed that it states not to use the GF setting on the  ead machine, to pick the basic white.  My next  ead came out perfect.
