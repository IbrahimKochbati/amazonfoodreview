When my Yorkie was about 10 1 2 years old, her  eath suddenly became extremely nasty!  I thought, perhaps, the malodorous  eath was caused by a bad tooth so I took her to the Vet for her annual checkup.  The Vet gave her a clean bill of health and suggested I have her teeth cleaned at the price of over $350!  Well, before forking over the big bucks, I thought I'd try  ushing her teeth myself and headed to Petco to buy some doggie toothpaste.  I found the toothpaste and continued to walk around the store because Spunky just LOVES her Petco outings!  I let her sniff her way down the doggie treats aisle when we bumped into the boxes of Greenies.  After checking out a box, I thought it was certinaly worth a shot so I bought a box of 96 count Teenies for $35.          As soon as we arrived home, I attempted to  ush her teeth the best that I could and then gave her one Greenie.  She seemed to really enjoy it.  I typically buy everything on Amazon so I jumped on here to check the price and was pleasantly surprised to see that the cost was $10 less than Petco's.  I immediately ordered them from Amazon and when that box arrived a day later, I took that unopened box over to Petco and returned it to them to get my $35 back! :)  Very sweet deal.          My dog is now a Greenies addict with sweet  eath again!  I should create a video review sometime because it's hilarious to see this little Yorkie "yelling" for me outside of the pantry door.  She knows exactly where the Greenies are and every morning she runs over to the pantry and just barks for me to get her a Greenie.  I allow her to have two Greenies per day and she seems to know that's her quota.  Both Spunky and I are very happy with Greenies and will continue to buy them!
