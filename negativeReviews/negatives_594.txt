I have been drinking green tea powder for a few years and have come to love the slightly bitter and tannic flavor of it. I decided to try the Stash  and instead of my normal Japanese  and, and it's not even in the same universe. The Stash product is just green colored powder with no flavor at all. Seriously, the Stash  and uses a maltodextrin base and it has dehydrated tea added to it. Real, authentic green tea powder is supposed to be 100% tea, with no additives!          If you drink a lot of green tea, you will be very disappointed with the Stash product. I strongly recommend you go with a Japanese  and that contains 100% tea ONLY.          I tried to return it to Amazon, but they don't allow grocery items to be returned!
