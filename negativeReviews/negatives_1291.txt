This was my first experience of a bad Darjeeling   before, I hadn't known there was such a thing. The first  ew yielded a dark rust color tinged with olive green. The bottom of the cup was invisible. The taste was sharp and astringent. Thinking I'd  ewed too long or too strong, I set the first cup aside and tried again. And then again. A light  ew of 3 minutes improved the clarity; however, nothing I have tried since has removed a level of astringency and a furred taste that I associate with lesser teas. The wet leaves are the typical size, light  own but unexpectedly interspersed with limp green squares.  The aroma of dry tea in the bag reminds me of old hay   neither moldy nor spoiled, just old. In contrast, the Davidson's Keemun Conjou which arrived in the same shipment smells and tastes like delicious Keemun Conjou and nothing else.          Given the price, I knew I was gamboling and consider this a lost bet. I have given the product two stars instead of one, because I haven't thrown it out (yet). I keep a supply of Lipton's bulk tea for emergencies such as long periods of unemployment, and I don't really need more emergency tea. Perhaps it will work for iced tea.          By no means am I an expert, but I do value tea, and so I hope this opinion helps other buyers who are trying to decide between two Darjeelings. Davidson's ships quickly with value pricing, and so I am not giving up on the merchant. Just on this particular Darjeeling.
