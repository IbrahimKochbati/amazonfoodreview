Wow   I just tried this this morning.     I love both vanilla and caramel, so thought how bad could this be?     I am not normally a fan of warm drinks, but I am trying to  eak my soda habit.     This tea will go a long way in helping me  eak this habit!          I have tried it plain, with sweetener and with sweetener milk combo.     I like just the sweetener the best, but of course, everyone has different tastes.          I don't really taste a whole lot of vanilla, but there is a definite caramel taste,     which is why I loved it so much. This one will be on my regular list to buy from here on out!          Great job, Bigelow! You have converted me from Celestial Seasonings!
