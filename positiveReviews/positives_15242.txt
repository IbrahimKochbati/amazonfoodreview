It is a mixture of chicken, sweet potato and pasta. But you can't really see the chicken, and I guess it has been pureed really fine. My daughter loves it and can finish the whole pack under 5 minutes. I like it becuase it has a good combination of protein, fiber and carbs. Plus it is organic! This is the second case I bought, and will continue buying. And the shipping was fast and packing is very good.
