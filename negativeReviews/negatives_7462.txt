I placed an order for Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Beef Liver on 6 25 12.  On July 5 when my current supply was used up, I opened the new batch.  Started with one pouch and then a second pouch.  For the first time the product doesn't appear to be healthy and fresh.  Instead of being solid  own, hard and crispy, the beef liver pieces are soft, pliable and some have a whitish powdery covering on them.  I'm afraid to feed these to  my dogs or other dogs that I meet in the park.  I've been buying this product for years and this is the first time it doesn't look and feel right.  I'm going to try to get an exchange hoping that this is just a bad batch.  One thing I did notice when the package arrived and that is the long, tall plastic bag was substituted with a horizontal short bag that didn't fit the 6 pouches very well.  My guess is that another manufacturer is making this dog treat, not the original one and that's the reason for the inferior and unhealthy quality of the treats.
