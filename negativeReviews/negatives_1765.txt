I was very excited about this purchase until I tried this truffle.     These were horrible.  Maybe I got the worst bottle they have ever sold and I just happened to get them.  But, these are bad.  If you want to eat the root of a dirty old root of a tree, you will enjoy these.  If you doubt my credibility of my review, please feel free to read my other reviews.  Please don't waste your money.  My wife tried these and couldn't even believe these could be called truffles.
