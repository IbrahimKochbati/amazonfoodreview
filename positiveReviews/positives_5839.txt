I received this item today and while it is indeed a Venus Fly Trap in a 3" pot, I was disappointed to find it is the kind of plant that comes in the clear plastic packaging that is available at a few department stores and garden centers in my area. I specifically ordered a plant on the internet to avoid getting one of these.          I still give 4 stars because it did arrive in pretty good shape, and most of the plants like this in stores are not very healthy. And, after all, I ordered a flytrap in a 3" pot and that's what I got. Just know that if you have a local store with a garden center, they may have these plants already and you could save the shipping cost by buying one there if you can find one in decent shape.
