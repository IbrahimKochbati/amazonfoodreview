Shake N Bake is the favorite staple of those in a hurry.  The fact of the matter is, many of their  eading are fantastic and flavorful.  The Shake N Bake Pork Pouch is no different.  this is not what I would call a "crispy"  eading, more like a "crunchy"  eading.  It has tasty seasoning and really makes the entire preparation process much simpler.  If you haven't tried it in the past, take a chance, you will not be disappointed!
