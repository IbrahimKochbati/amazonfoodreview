I didn't find these to be particularly good. I don't expect them to be the same quality as homemade but these were not even good for a store bought cookie. As other reviewers mentioned, they are very dry and bland.          The quote on the back that says "Try one, you won't believe it's that good!" is kind of laughable.          I also thought it odd that they come individually wrapped packages of *one* cookie each. You'd think if they were going to be individually wrapped they would come with at least two. Seems like a lot of packaging waste and expense for cookies that aren't even that good. I could get better cookies from the grocery store bakery.
