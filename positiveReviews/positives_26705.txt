Initially, I bought this food for my dog because it is considered limited ingredients. She's had some issues with other food and a sensitive and irritable stomach. I try to keep her away from grains, corn, chicken and some other ingredients that tend to trigger dog allergies. I haven't officially gotten her allergy tested as it's pretty expensive...but she does excellent on this food (in addition to a probiotic). In the AM I mix it with some of the  and's wet food because she likes to go on hunger strikes when I leave for work, and it seems to motivate her to eat. I am very happy with this food (and I think my dog is, too!)
