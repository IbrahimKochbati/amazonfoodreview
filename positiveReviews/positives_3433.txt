My friend who lives in Fla. told me about these French twists and was complaining that she couldn't find them here in Middletown, OH.  I ordered 12 boxes to see what she was raving about and found only one problem with them.......I couldn't stop eating them.  I ate 11 boxes of them in just a few days and gave the last one away so I wouldn't eat it too.  If a person can stop after eating 1 or 2 servings, they are a great addition to your diet.  Unfortunately, I couldn't stop!!!!!
