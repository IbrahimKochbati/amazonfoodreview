We are a dairy free family and use Silk Pure Almond Milk everyday in our cereal and as a drink. Fantastic stuff! We buy both refrigerated and shelf almond milk. These are about the same price as buying it from the dairy section at the grocery store. We buy them for food storage. These came in handy for us this week when the snow came in. We didn't have to rush to the grocery store to buy milk because we were covered. :) I love Silk!
