I really liked these sea vegetables (I use them in home made miso soup). The price is a bit high (I'd feel better with a $5 $7 reduction in the price), but the quality is great. I love the fact that these are 6 different species included, to provide different vitamins and minerals. Unfortunately though, the various species are not included in equal proportions, so some flavors overpower others.
