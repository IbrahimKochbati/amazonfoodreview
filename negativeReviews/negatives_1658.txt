SWITCH isn't a bad product, but it's not great either. I like the fact that it's all natural sparkling juice, and the can design is pleasant to look at.          The orange tangerine isn't bad; this flavor isn't as syrupy as some of Switch's others.  However, at 140 calories per can, this beverage has 50% more calories per ounce than the average soda. Too many for me.
