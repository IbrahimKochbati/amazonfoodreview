It works, that's what matters. People have to nit pick every little thing. Maybe it doesn't last forever, but it's not meant to.          My experience   melted it on my tongue and ate some foods I couldn't normally eat. This means it worked, and real good. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: strawberries!!! Willing to buy these again just for eating strawberries. Limes are tasty too.
