I don't have a problem with wheat but my son does and the Wheat free Amazing Bread is just that, I bake two loafs a week for him as it is the only  ead he can eat. I have tried other  ands and they don't even come close to the moist wonderful  ead Pamela's is. ALL of the other mixes are dry as dirt. The market I found this mix no longer carries it so I checked on line and I buy two cases at a time. Thanks for such a great product.     Dorthy
