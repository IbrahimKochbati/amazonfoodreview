I tried this k cup in a sampler pack. Is full bodied and tastes good but has an aftertaste (more like afterBITE). I like my coffee smooth, so that was a minus for me, but definitely not a deal  eaker. Made this flavor more than once, and the taste was consistent with each cup. Also, I can use the 9oz setting on the Keurig and the coffee does not taste watered down.
