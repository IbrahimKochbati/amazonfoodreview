I got it in the mail today,it took a week to get here. Very pleased about the shipping. It was kind of confusing to make but the box helped me. I didn't like the red sushi taste but the rice,yellow sushi and the fish eggs were AMAZING. would definitely reccommend this to other teens or parents helping their children. It's fun to make. My younger siblings enjoyed it. : )
