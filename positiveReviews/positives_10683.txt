This protein bar is delicious!  It tastes similar to a 100 Grand candy bar, has a good crunch, packs 30g of protein, and is HUGE.  I tried one at my local health food store and fell in love, so I ordered them from Amazon.  After waiting and waiting and waiting for the item to be available and shipped, I noticed the nutritionals were VERY different from what I remembered.  There is a carb smart version with 1g sugar and 25g sugar alcohols.  The non carb smart version is reversed.  If you're watching your sugars or carbs don't give up after looking at the content of the regular bar, just look a little harder for the carbohydrate concious version.  It's worth trying!
