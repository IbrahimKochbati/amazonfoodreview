I serve this popcorn to my guests and they can't get over how much taste it has. Not to much salt nor not to much oil. It tastes so fresh. It is always served as part of our appetizers when entertaining. We even have people that use the pool adjacent to our home yell at me to ' ing popcorn'. The free shipping is very nice. The discount for setting up automatic shipments is a nice perk. We have purchase at least 4 cases since we bought the Roosevelt popcorn maker and the cart. It is a nice addition to our family room.
