What can I say about potato starch. It's just potato starch, so this review will be on Barry Farm instead of potato starch.          From Barry Farm you're going to get things cheaper, much cheaper. I've been buying products from Barry Farm for several years and they have been great to deal with. Their shipping is fair, but unfortunately, flours and starches weigh a lot and shipping isn't cheap. I purchase items from them that are too expensive to buy locally, things I can't find locally (finely ground white corn flour, sweet rice flour and Ivory Teff) and items that are better quality than what I can buy locally (the best sorghum flour anywhere). I usually order 25 or 30 pounds of product at a time and that reduces the overall price per pound to a reasonable cost.
