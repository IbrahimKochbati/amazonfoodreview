These Flaxseeds are of good quality, I eat them daily.  Bought the whole seed, rather than the ground seed, because of the better nutritional value of grinding your own.  Will buy again.  I read that whole seeds can pass undigested, and that ground seeds can loose their nutritional value over time.  So we grind a week's worth at a time.  Best used in oatmeal as the flavors blend well.  Or in a cold cereal, or added to a cup of coffee for a twist. Seem to blend better in hot foods.
