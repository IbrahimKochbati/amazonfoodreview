Let's face it, eating an energy bar is not the same as real food.  However, this bar is a step above the norm and I recommend you have it available for those times you need a boost and no time to cook.  The Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Bar has a nice coconut taste with a touch of chocolate.  A tad on the high side with 180 calories but certainly no higher than many. 180 mg. Omega 3 Fatty Acids, no transfats and 9 grams whole grains.  Add Gluten free, dairy free, and wheat free and that makes this a particularly appealing bar for those with such allergies or sensitivities.  And Pamela's Products (the maker) donates to Celiac and Autism support organizations.  So not only does the bar have nutritional value it has human value...a winner all around.  Definitely give them a try.
