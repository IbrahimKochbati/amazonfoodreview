I had been using Green Mountain MILK Hot Chocolate, which is good (my kids love it), but weak for a true chocoholic like myself. I thought since I like dark chocolate in general, I would try the DARK Hot Chocolate. Thankfully, I only bought a small quantity because it has a really nasty after taste to it that lingers. I'm going to stick with my weak milk hot chocolate and just make a smaller cup.
