My son was just diagnosed with allergies to several different grains.  I've been trying all kinds of products to pack in his lunches because of it.  I decided to try Pamela's wheat free, gluten free chocolate  ownie mix.  He LOVED it.  He almost ate the whole pan in one day!  My husband, is SUPER picky about "health" foods and though the texture is somewhat different than white, bleached, enriched, yucchhh flour, he and my boy were fighting over the last pieces.  It is a little crumblier, but we all liked it.  Thank you Pamela's.  It's nice to find some alternatives out there;  the fact that they are healthier is just an added PLUS!!
