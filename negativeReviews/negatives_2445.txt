The taste was a little off to me and like with microwave popcorn not all of the bacon skins developed. Some were still very hard on the ends and others not developed at all. I bought a box of these so I tried to perfect the technique several times with not much better outcomes. All in all I will stick with the ready to go variety offered by Frito Lay and Mission.
