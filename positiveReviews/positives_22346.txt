The Nut Delight bar is a mildly sweet, solid bar of whole nuts (even the  azil nuts are whole!)   bound together by whatever glaze makes them slightly sweeter than the individual nuts mixed together would be  yet you get few of the carbs you'd expect with such a treat.  It sure beats counting out nuts to find your limit!  easy to carry & easy to keep a few in the car for lunch on the go.  If you like nuts, you'll like this!
