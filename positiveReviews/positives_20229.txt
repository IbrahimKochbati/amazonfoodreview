This flavor isn't EXACTLY like Diet Dr. Pepper, but it certainly isn't *bad*. It's actually pretty good, and a heck of a lot better than most Diet Dr. Pepper knock offs. Just like pretty much all of the SodaStream syrup flavors, do yourself a favor and buy the assorted smaple size pack if your SodaStream soda maker didn't come bundled with one already. This way you get to get a good idea of what you, personally, will like because NO TWO PEOPLE ARE ALIKE in their taste preferences...
