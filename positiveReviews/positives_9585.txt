Not a writer but this Reese Cheesy Popcorn is the best in the area Michigan where I use to buy it at Kroger's. We start buying it through amazon because Kroger's stop stocking Reese Cheesy Popcorn, so I hit the net in search of it. It is very tasty on popcorn better than any other power popcorn salt that's been tried by our family. I highly recommend Reese Cheesy Popcorn to all.
