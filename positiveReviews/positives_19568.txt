Been using this chilli mix for years. Will crock pot it for when people come buy in the winter and I'm amazed at how much they rave about it. Have tried using other mixes and recipes for stove top but there's just something about the taste of this chilli  from a packet no less  that lingers in the memory.          Bought this bulk pack from Amazon because the stores around me seem to charge a much higher price than they should for thsi product. Maybe the word is out and there are people like me that really enjoy the simplicity and ease of preparation of this dish. Recipe hint: the packet calls for two cans of red chilli beans, for variety try a can of light red and dark red or a can of red with a can of white. It's almost impossible to hurt the base flavor of this tasty chilli.
