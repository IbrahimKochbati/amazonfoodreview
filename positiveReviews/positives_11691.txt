I bought a case of these because I had liked the Oat Cranberry Almond Whenever Bars.  To me these bars taste almost exactly like an Almond Joy candy bar, which is one of my favorite candy bars.  The texture is similar in mouth feel to that of the candy bar as well.  I am extremely pleased with these Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Whenever Bars and have put in an order to have them delivered to me on a regular basis.  They are healthy, wheat and gluten free, and non dairy.  If you need to have wheat, gluten or dairy free products these are a fantastic find.
