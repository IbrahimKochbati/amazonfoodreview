Once you master the technique of processing yogurt, using this starter will yield a smooth, firm and wonderfully tasteful product that will keep you from ever buying store yogurt again. I generally use the starter to make 2 liters and then use the resulting product as starter for 8 to 10 generations of yogurt. With three family members eating yougurt daily, making 2 gallon batches at a time, the first 6 count of starters lasted for 8 months.(Partly due to trial and error on my part, perfecting my recipe) No "Yogurt Machine!....I heat the milk in pyrex, cool in sink water bath and let the mix mature in styrofoam containers in 115 degree waterbath. Somewhat crude, but consistently effective for a superb product that amazes all that try it. I make converts to the taste and texture of hand crafted yougurt every time some one samples the product and the health benefits are tremendous. Now store yogurt tastes like drywall paste and I can never go back. Like good coffee and good music, once you try the best, mediocre is no longer acceptable.     ps: you can also (very easily) use the yogurt to make a cheese that is incredible.
