I was looking for a formula to supplement my  eastmilk for my twins (I have never made enough). I was given Similac Advanced in the hospital in the little two ounce bottles, so I started there. When we ran out of the free samples, we tried to switch to the powdered Similac Advanced, it gave my girls horrible gas. I didn't realize that the two might be different. When we went back to pre mix to try to resolve the gas issue, I bough a couple of bottles of the organic to try out. I felt like I would rather feed my children organic ingredients over conventional ones if all else was equal. I also looked at the Similac for gas and fussiness and sugar is the first ingredient. Um, no thanks. I felt that the organic milk ingredients were closest to the ingredients in  eastmilk (what they get 3 out of 5 feedings a day), so I was happy when they took to it easily and without gas. For the record, we have had ZERO problems with constipation. If I have to feed formula (which unfortunately I do for some of their feedings), I'm glad that I have this formula as an option!
