I bought this for my 15 month old son who has become a very picky eater as of late.  I wanted a fun and easy way to make sure he gets his fruit and veggie servings each day.  This does the trick!  He loves them and he can feed himself.  What more can I say?  (Oh, I actually tried one, and they really are good!)
