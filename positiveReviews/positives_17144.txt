This has been my favorite soup since I was a child many, many years ago, and I still heat up and eat the smaller, 10 oz. can at least once a week.  It's my comfort food!          My husband also likes this soup, but one of the smaller 10 oz. cans aren't enough for two people, so I was thrilled when Campbell's came out with a 26 oz. can.  Now, I can just open one large can and fix enough yummy, creamy, delicious soup for BOTH of us, and we are very satisfied with the large bowls of soup we both get.
