I got a call from my mother in law last night thanking me for her birthday present I ordered here. She thanked me for the surprise and also had to comment how terrible they tasted. She asked me if it was supposed to be a joke on her. I said no and felt bad a 93 year old lady ate some bad jelly beans.          Won't buy again,          Steve Baker
