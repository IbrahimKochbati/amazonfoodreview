I have been buying these habenero peanuts for some time and they are VERY good and, unfortunately, as advertised, they are also VERY ADDICTIVE!          ( I am consuming them as I speak...electronically)          FORTUNATELY, they are much better NOW since I can order them from AMAZON where I get a MUCH BETTER PRICE and LOW TWO DAY SHIPPING with my membership.          This is not a paid advertisement.          John
