I like a more robust flavored coffee and try a few different ones. This Tullys Italian Roast consistently delivers. The  eakfast blend and French Roast is also a good choice. If it is too strong you an always choose a larger cup size on your  ewer. The taste is comparable to what I would purchase out shopping for a nice pick me up.
