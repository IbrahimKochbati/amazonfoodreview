I have been drinking this tea for years and am so disappointed that they change the formula. It has a terrible after taste, especially when it starts to cool just a little. I also enjoyed it cold over ice and now am not able to tolerate the taste cold. I purchased 2   6 pack boxes and now am stuck with this foul tasting tea. Unless the Oregon Chi company goes back to the original formula I will never purchase it again.
