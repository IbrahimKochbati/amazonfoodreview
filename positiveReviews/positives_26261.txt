This Southerner loves to make homemade "pimento" cheese.  In fact, I've perfected my recipe over the years, and a restaurant recently asked to add it to their menu. One of the secrets to my recipe is Mario Pimientos, and I've found them superior to anything else on the market. (Pimientos are made from the same pepper that is harvested for paprika.)          Mario's pimentos have superior color, flavor, and texture. Additionally, the juice is a deeper red than other  ands, and that means additional flavor. (If you need to drain these babies for a recipe, don't pour the juice down the sink. Add it to salad dressing or a Bloody Mary!)          Kudos to Amazon for carrying Mario Diced Pimientos. This is a 5 star product, and, if I had five hands, I'd give it 5 thumbs up!
