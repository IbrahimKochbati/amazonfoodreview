I received my order of Twinings Earl Grey K Cups today and anxiously tried one tonight. Wow, I am disappointed to say the least. Funky smell, taste and aftertaste compared to Bigelow's Earl Grey. Now I have 49 K Cups that I don't want. Not all Earl Grey's are created equal.          Edit: I mistakenly left this review for the decaf Earl Grey and I ordered the regular blend. Oops
