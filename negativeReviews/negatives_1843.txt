I bought this tea cause I had consumed the one from the bottle and I like that one.     However in tea bag is not just tasting totally and completely different, but additionally tastes really     horrible... believe me, I even tried to give it to my co workers for free after they tried it and they did not accept it.     In my opinion It tasted like Serum :s. Now I have 100 tea bags wasting space, probably soon they'll go to the waste bascket.          It's sad... I thought it would taste like the bottle or at least close, but totally a disappointment.
