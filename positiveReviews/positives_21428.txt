I absolutely love this soup.  There are always several of these on my pantry shelf.  My family & I eat a plant based diet, so I use this soup as a base, then add onions, bell peppers, corn, black & kidney beans, a dash of seasoning, then top it off with some cut up tortillas.  It's one of our favorite soups to make when friends come over.
