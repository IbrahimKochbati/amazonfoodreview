If you're looking for a k cup tea that tastes like tea with a twist of lemon, this isn't for you. This is more like a hot cup of lemon with a little tea in it. I can imagine it could be overwhelming for some people, but I like it. Lemon is the star and it is good hot or poured over ice. I wish they'd make a lime zinger k cup as well.
