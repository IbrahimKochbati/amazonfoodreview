Dieting since mid May using whole grains in pastas, rice, etc, and this orzo in whole wheat is just not able to be found anywhere but here  so happy to find it. (Now if I could also find whole grain orecchiette too, hint). With 9 grams of fiber per 2oz serving, this orzo delivers high fiber, just what I wanted.  Use it in rice dishes like pilafs and stuffed peppers, add to soups, or just serve as a side dish on its own w butter and sage, etc..no need to go back to white orzo anymore.
