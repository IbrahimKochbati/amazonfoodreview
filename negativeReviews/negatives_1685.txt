For product to work properly (IMHO) you need coffee ground as fine as possible. Once filter has been inserted, plave carefully leveled measure of coffee in it. Manuever lid into place, then press down on center STEADILY  w  thumb.          Plan to use no more than 6 Oz. of water for your cup.          Removal of used cup from machine is occasional problem. (Jiggle it and it will generally loosen up.)
