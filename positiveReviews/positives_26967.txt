This is true jerky not the kind that looks stamped or processed. This being said because of the natural variances of beef some pieces are smaller or contain a trace of fat or may be grisly but this is not a common occurrence. I purchase 4 pkgs of this per month and have been for 8 months. In my opinion, this is the best out there for the price. Its consistent in quality and you get 16oz. I have tried all the flavors and my favorites are Hickory, Peppered and BBQ so this review will apply to these flavors.
