This little one pack of Low Acid coffee is great   I had never tried a low acid coffee before and expected it to be lacking in flavor or taste "light".  I was pleasantly surprised with this coffee.  I could not tell it was a low acid coffee at all in relation to the taste. Very flavorful, strong and robust, smelled great while it was  ewing and I would recommend and try this again!
