Our family has liked every other flavored we have tried (BBQ is the best). We like sweet potatoes so we assumed would like these pop chips.  I was wrong, no one in the family likes the sweet potato pops chips.          I highly recommend you go to a store that sells the sweet potato before deciding on purchasing a large quantity.
