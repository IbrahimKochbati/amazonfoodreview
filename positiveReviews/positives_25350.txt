I've tried lots of treats, chews and teeth cleaning products, but this is the best! My dogs love it. I have one large dog, one small one, and I cut the large pieces in half for the little guy. I wish this was around when they were young, it truly cleans their teeth well and would've prevented my big one's cavities! The  own coating will leave yellowish stains on your rugs, get your dog to keep it in a special spot while they chew, though. Even when mine sneak it onto the light carpet, I'm more than glad to clean up after, it's easy (Dawn and OxyClean!), and to keep cavities away with a chew that's so safe and digestible and they enjoy so much, it's worth it. Lasts long, too!
