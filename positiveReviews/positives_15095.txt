Other than a few table scraps, Canidae is the only  and (dry and wet) we feed to our blk lab.  She's done excellent on it and has a very healthy and shinny coat.  People routinely comment how nice her coat looks, most even ask what we feed.  I sent a bag to my  other and he too noticed his dog's coat was healthier looking after a week or two.  I highly recommend this product.
