The layers spin very easily and my 5 year old female weimaraner cleared each slot of hidden treats in less than a minute. If you nudge it gently it opens & aligns and as long as you don't bump it, it stays in place to eat each dish. I even tried to use it to feed her dinner to slow her down, but that didn't work at all  she aligned it once and ate out of it like a bowl. Bummer, I spent over $20 for a piece of plastic that will end up in a landfill. Stick with frozen kongs...
