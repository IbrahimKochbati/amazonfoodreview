What a challenge.  Creating a wheat free, gluten free and dairy free nutrition bar that doesn't taste like a fi ous mouthful is an accomplishment.  These bars are good, not great.  They are somewhat gristly but they are not hard to chew.  The taste is good enough that I would buy these and keep them in my desk at work.  I felt safe when I ate them; the ingredients are gluten free and organic eggs, butter, cocoa paste, chocolate chunks and sugar.  This definitely should be a helpful and fun snack for many who must eliminate wheat, gluten and dairy.  I couldn't taste much of the coconut but there is never enough coconut for me!
