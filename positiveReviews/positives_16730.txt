This product was recommended for folks with potential for type 2 diabetes...I use it in everything in place of sugar or honey...it does not raise your blood sugar and it tastes great....I also love the convenience of the container size...I could not find this size locally and the smaller bottles are much more expensive.          I have this product sent via auto delivery, it is wonderful for older folks and it is so easy to increase decrease frequency of orders depending on your use.
