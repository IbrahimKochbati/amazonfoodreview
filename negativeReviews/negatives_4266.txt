I am a big fan of Jem and I love the way it is so spreadable. This is the first time I tried the Coconut Cardamom flavor and I loved the flavor, but after the first use and I put it in the fridge, it was hard as rock and not spreadable at all. Flavor was fantastic and I did not have the problem with the Cinnamon Maca flavor   it spread like a dream down to the last drop.
