SPECIAL K IS BATTING 1000 IN THE SNACKS DEPARTMENT BUT ESPECIALLY WITH THESE CRISPY CRUNCHY DELICIOUS CHIPS. SOUR CREAM + ONION WAS SPOT ON + GREAT. THESE HOWEVER HAVE A LITTLE SPICY SIGNATURE I'VE NOT TASTED B4. EXCELLENT! A BIT OF ADVICE. COUNT OUT THE 27 CRISPS AHEAD OF TIME + THEN PUT THE BOX ON A HIGH SHELF! ..HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
