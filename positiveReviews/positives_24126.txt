These are really hard to find outside of Europe, which is where I first had the pleasure of enjoying them. They are a delicious, thin, biscuit, but I would describe it more like the perfect short ead cracker  but it's not chalky or crumbly like most short ead sometimes tastes. It's lightly sweet and crisp, easy munching makes it perfect on the go. They would go great on a biscuit tray with champagne, wine, or cheese, and you can top almost anything on it. (Peanut Butter, Icing, Marmalade, etc.) I like mine just the way they are though. :)          I was really excited when I found these on Amazon, since I hadn't seen these in the US. I bought about 6 packages, and I'm already running out!
