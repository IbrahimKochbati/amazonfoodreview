There was nothing wrong with the pastries  everyone seemed to like them, so you'll be fine as long as they don't mess up your order.          I ordered two boxes of pastries for Christmas gifts, but the shipping was slower than expected and, more importantly, they only sent *ONE* of the two boxes.  I tried calling them and got a recording  figuring they were probably just busy because of the time of year, I also sent them two e mails.  So far I have not heard back.  The shipping label was attached directly to the SINGLE pastry box (rather that being affixed to a larger cardboard box that could possibly hold two) and said BOX 1 of 1, so I know it wasn't a delivery service problem.  They simply only shipped one of the two boxes that I ordered.          Mistakes can happen to any company, but the fact that they are hard to get in touch with and won't return my e mails is just poor customer service.
