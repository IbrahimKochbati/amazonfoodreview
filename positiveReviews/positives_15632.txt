Petite Cuisine Gourmet Cat Food was a real hit with my impossible cat.  My cat refuses almost all canned cat food so I was completely shocked when she showed an interest in this food.  The food looked like human food.  My only complaint is that I had to drain the juices from the can before I could serve it to my cat.  My cat actually ate a good portion of it, and she is an extremely finicky eater so this stuff must be good for her to even look at it.
