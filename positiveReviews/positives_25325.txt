My vet recommends these chewies for all my six dogs that range in size from a 4lb Mi Ki to a 130lb Great Pyrennes to help with their teeth and the dogs love them. I give them to them at night along with their "sleepy time" treats when they go to bed. My Pyr loves this extra large size chew so much that he won't touch his treats until I give him the chewie, then he often takes it and hops up on the bed and chews the night away. I learned of these from my vet and bought the first couple of bags there but the prices are Amazon are terrific so I've been buying them here for the last year or so. Great product.
