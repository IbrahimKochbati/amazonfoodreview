We have purchased boxes and boxes of Pirate's Booty over the last year.  We used to buy individual bags at Whole Foods but they are expensive and get eaten too quickly.  My 1 year old son just loves them and they are great for his self feeding skills.  My 8 year old loves them as afterschool snacks.  My husband and I enjoy them   but we try not to eat too much since these are snacks afterall and we should not have too much junk food.          A few months ago, we shipped a box to my father in law in CA. because he got addicted to them while visiting us.  He took a few bags to visit his mother in Wyoming and she got hooked.  When she could not find any in her very small town, my father in law shipped a box from Amazon to her.  That should last her for a while since she is 96 and lives alone.          As you can see, this is addictive so be careful with buying your first box!!  We have also tried Smart Puffs, Cannon Balls and Veggie Puffs. The green Veggie Puffs did not go over as well with my family.  Only my 1 year old son likes it!
