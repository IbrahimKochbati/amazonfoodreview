When I opened the box the aroma of this coffee permeated the room in a wonderful way. I love the taste of this coffee. Its smooth and flavorful but not overpowering. It reminds me so much of one my all time favorites, Gevalia Chocolate Raspberry. I never thought I would say this, but I find it better. When I am in the mood for a flavored coffee, I now use Van Houtte's Chocolate Raspberry Truffle. Its so decadent in a good kind of way.
