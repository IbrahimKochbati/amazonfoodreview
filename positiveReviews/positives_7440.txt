This is the best candy cane cocoa, and it has real bits of candy cane. Don't worry, it's not totally sharp... Most of it dissolves in the liquid.          I mix my cocoa with a battery operated frother, which uses every single bit of cocoa, so there is not a single bit of cocoa on the bottom.          After, it's really a pepperminty cup of chocolate that is very lovely. Refreshing, I'd say.          This is a must with milk, though I think you can do it with water... but milk is best to get the full flavor effect.
