After eating Thai sticky rice at our local Thai restaurant, I wanted to be able to enjoy this tasty dish at home.  I purchased the steamer, basket, cheese cloth and rice kit.  It arrived quickly and carefully packaged.  Complete instructions were included, which enabled me to make great sticky rice on my first try.  Import Foods also offers a full list of Thai receipes, along with a list of the ingredients needed, and the ability to simply click and order the needed items.  They offer an easy to use web buying experience and excellent quality products. I will definitely order from them again.
