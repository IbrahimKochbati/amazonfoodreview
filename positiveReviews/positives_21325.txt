All 3 of our dogs love the various vitamin enriched "tasty pastes" available through Kong.  Although they loved to chew on their Kongs before, we found that they really got into it once we started inserting some of the paste into the Kong cavity.  All of them go nuts when we put down the "pasty Kongs" for them to enjoy   and enjoy them they do!          I would highly recommend all of Kongs' "tasty pastes"   it's easy to use, doesn't seem to make a mess, and is a great extra treat for dogs.  Our 3 give it "2 paws up"!
