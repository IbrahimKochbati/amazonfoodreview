I am a huge coffee drinker, and love the k cups for making one cup quickly before leaving for work in the morning.  While there are many choices, I prefer a bold, strong coffee first thing in the morning.  Wolfgang Puck French Roast is absolutely delicious, strong and not at all bitter, and makes a great first cup of coffee.  I would highly recommend to all bold coffee drinkers!
