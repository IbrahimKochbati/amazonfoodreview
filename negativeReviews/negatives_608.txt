The first ingredient in this mix, before the tea is even listed is maltodextrin.  If you suffer from a corn allergy, please do not forget to read the label & unwittingly drink this.  I have no idea why there is more maltodextrin in this product than the main product, the tea itself.  I realize this is not a review, let alone a "helpful review", as I did not describe the taste of the product or even review the product. I couldn't review this product, if I wanted too.  I want people with a corn allergy to be advised of the ingredients in the tea.  I didn't know how else to inform folks about the ingredients except for on the page with reviews.  I could not give the product more stars, as it contains more maltodextrin, than tea itself.
