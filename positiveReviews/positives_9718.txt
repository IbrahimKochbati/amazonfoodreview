After Consumner Reports came out with their results after testing protein powders, i.e. containing heavy metals, I started my search on the internet for something that did not contain these metals.  I started researching organic products and decided on the chocolate hemp protein. I also like the fact that it is made with Certified Fair Trade Chocolate.I have started on my second container.  I feel different than before I started, i.e. more energy...just feel better overall. I have a shake in the morning. I use 8 oz lowfat milk, protein powder (2 tablespoons), 1 tablespoon ground flax seed, 1 2 teaspoon cinnamon powder, fruit of choice and some crushed ice. I have this every morning and on the weekend when I cook a regular  eakfast, I do not feel as good. The chocolate taste a little different that regular chocolate, but that can be changed with a little Splenda. I am definitely buying this again.
