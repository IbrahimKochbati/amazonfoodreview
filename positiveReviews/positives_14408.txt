Boppy gets overly excited when Rodan (grey crane) flies up from the creek, or a squirrel raids the bird feeder.  She has torn her ACL more than once   when she takes off at top speed.  So I now get her treats with glucosamine   so much easier than trying to get a pill in her.  She like the chicken flavor best   she tried beef too.  I like that it is made in the USA.  She does much better with her hips and joints   vet tells me it is really her knee that has ACL problems.  Zukes has a great product here that I like to give her, and she enjoys the good for her treat.
