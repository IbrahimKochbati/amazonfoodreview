This has a strongly bitter taste of lime when made as directed.  Definitely not a natural made from scratch taste.  It made the worst tasting Margaritas that I've ever had.  My initial response is to just pour the rest of it down the drain and cut my losses.  I'm glad I only bought one bottle to try.
