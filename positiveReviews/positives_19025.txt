I have given the knee cap bones to my 75 pound chocolate lab and 11 pound miniature dachshund for years. When we added a 5 pound miniature chihuahua to the mix I wondered if she could hold on to her bone with the larger and more savvy dogs in the house. No problem! She is quick and limber and gets to chew whichever bone she wants. She likes to get hold of a bone the older dogs have been chewing on because they have softened it up a bit. Then she chews it for all she's worth. The older dogs are indulgent with her, and she always leaves one nearby as a trade. I take the bones out of the mix when they get small enough the lab could choke on them. The little ones get put in the crate with the chihuahua when we go in the car. All my dogs have great teeth and I credit these bones. They never splinter, but the dogs can chew off smooth bits, which they eat. This  and of knee cap bones are huge and provide many hours of chewing enjoyment for my animals. I highly recommend them.
