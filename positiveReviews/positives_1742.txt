You can substitute nut milk, coconut milk or goat's milk or even soy milk for the 'milk' in this instant pudding.          If you add coconut cream and toasted coconut you have coconut cream pie pudding! If you add some raw cocoa powder you have chocolate pudding! You can add some softened cream cheese and have cheese cake base puddin'! You are only limited by your imagination. This is also excellent as an addition to a cake mix (about a 1 3 packet and an extra tablespoon of liquid).
