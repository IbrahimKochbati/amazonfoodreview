Any review of this product, necessarily, must be based upon observation of the four footed furry feline friends (barring any truly dedicated and odd reviewers). We have two cats that deign to call us their owners, at least at feeding time and when the litter box needs cleaning.          This is soft food in the petite cans favored by the feline haute cuisine products. However, the similarity seems to end there as the product is flaked rather than sliced or diced, and the sauce is clear with an oily consistency (somewhat like vegetable or olive oil), the pot pie cans were considerably more fluid.          The boy, Otis, will eat just about any soft cat food put in front of him unfortunately we were disappointed with his response to this product. The girl, Crystal, is the pickier of the pair and will usually lick a little of the food or sauce before abandoning any soft food (leaving the remnants for Otis), but would not touch this product. I was gratified to see that the product did not come out of China after the problems of the past year.          Bottom line is that the cats did not seem to like the product as much as other soft foods. The poor response from the cats means that this one will not make it into the rotation.
