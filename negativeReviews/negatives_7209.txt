My little dog wouldn't even lick it, she isn't going to even get close to it.  Beware!  She loves her treats and I was hoping after reading the other reviews that it would be good for her and her  eath, but what a waste of $5.  So frustrated!          Just a friendly warning, you might have to send them back.
