PLUSES:     delicate fresh olive flavor and the color is a beautiful pale green.          MINUSES:     thin gauge plastic bottle     not the prominent olive flavor I'd prefer (which might be a plus for you)          This was recommended to me because I am looking for a very full bodied olive oil.  In Olave, you can taste the olives, and they are very pleasant but it lacks the strength of olive flavor I'm looking for.          This is a good oil and for someone else, this might be nirvana. Pricewise it's average, not bad, not good.  It's packaged in too thin clear plastic bottle which is a big negative, first because after a time plastic imparts it's own flavor to the oil.  And second because the bottle too easily collapses.  I had to transfer the oil to a carafe.
