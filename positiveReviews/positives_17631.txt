A friend of mine who has acid reflux cannot drink coffee. So when this was offered, I decided to get it and have my friend try it. Well, low and behold, she liked it without any ramifications concerning her reflux. If she had any complaints, it would be that the French Roast flavor was a little on the strong side. I am sure that could be adjusted with coffee to water ratio, but that was one of her complaints. That aside, she was quite hyper afterwards, which she liked the energy it gave her (at first), but then started to have the shakes (but this is probably due to lack of caffeine for some time). I dont know if there is lots of caffeine packed into it or she just made an unreasonably strong cup of coffee. Her words were "it has very good flavor and a very robust coffee".  I don't think she is a convert to this particular flavor, but if she found "regular" coffee, she would get it, but found French Roast a little too strong for her liking.
