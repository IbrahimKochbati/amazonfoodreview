My family and I have been using this tea for over 40 years.  I make the best unsweetened tea I've ever had with this tea, and get many many compliments on it.  If you use good water, this tea will last for a day or two without refrigeration, which changes it's flavor.  I am in South Texas and we take our tea very seriously down here.  This strong,  isk, hearty  ew is just the thing on a hot summer afteroon.  I haven't experienced stained teeth or other ill effects, either.  Using a drip coffee maker to  ew it keeps it from overheating and getting bitter.  It's healthy, too, with plenty of antioxidants in it's orange black pekoe blend.  If you try it and it's too strong, tinker with your recipe.  Once you get the ratio right, you'll find it is delicious.
