I toast a cinnamon raisin bagel, slather with peanut butter, add Nutella all around but just along the outside edge... ahhh  heavenly! A little bit of Nutella goes a long way. I'm going to donate my unopened jar of grape Jelly to a food pantry... it's never going to be opened as long as I have Nutella in the house.
