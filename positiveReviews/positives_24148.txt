The robust flavor of black pepper is a favorite at our house so when I received this Black Pepper Western Cut beef jerky as part of a gift, I couldn't wait to open it. I like the thinness of the Western Cut jerky because it lets you really taste the flavor of the seasonings. The taste of fresh black pepper comes through loud and clear in each piece of this jerky. The  own sugar flavor is more subtle and keeps the black pepper under control.  Very tasty! The resealable package makes it easy to keep a healthy snack in my desk drawer. I can't wait to get more of the black pepper jerky, very glad that Choo Choo R Snacks is quick with their shipping.
