I love the Udi's gluten free granola! I have had the plain and the cranberry flavors and they are both great. I have it for  eakfast with my yogurt or as a snack right out of the bag. Definitely recommend this product. Clearly says on the bag everything it does not contain (like the big common allergens  gluten, egg, milk, nuts, etc.)...makes it easier than reading all the ingredients on every package. Delicious!!!
