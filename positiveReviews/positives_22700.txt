Looked all over for this popcorn after receiving my Waring Pro 2oz. popcorn maker for my kids for christmas. Could not find any pre packaged popcorn for the 2oz. maker. I found this on Amazon less than 2 weeks before Christmas and had it wrapped and ready to go in plenty of time. This popcorn tastes wonderful. Friends and family love it and I will keep on ordering this as long as my popcorn maker keeps popping. This package makes just enough for two kids at snack time and two paks for the adults also. Very pleased.
