I'm of Russian descent and have been eating buckwheat for my entire life. I live in the US and usually buy buckwheat in local Russian or Eastern European stores. This is the first (and last) time I tried American made buckwheat. Here are things that I found.      1. It takes only 10 12 min to cook this. Normally, it takes 25 30 min. And this item is not  anded as an "instant buckwheat"      2. It tastes quite different than "usual"      3. There is a strong metallic smell      4. This item is overpriced. Just go to the closest Russian or Eastern European shop and buy the same thing 4 times cheaper.
