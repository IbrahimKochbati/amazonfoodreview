This stuff is fantastic!  My son started on rice cereal and wasn't a huge fan  but then we tried him on this oatmeal and he goos and gaas with joy and smacks his lips and smiles because of this oatmeal.          Our grocery store doesn't carry this so we had to buy another  and one time  we thought "what's the diff  it's oatmeal right?"          My son got all excited since he thought he was getting fed  opened his mouth, literally gagged and then started crying....          Lesson learned.
