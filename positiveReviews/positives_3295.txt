After my husband's enthusiastic reaction to the glutin free Bisquick biscuits,I rediscovered an old Bisquick recipe booklet and used its recipe to make an "impossible" cherry pie. He loved it! Next I'll try the Impossible Pecan Pie. This is the first gluten free product that my husband really likes.  I will buy again although I'd like to find it packaged sold less expensively than on Amazon.
