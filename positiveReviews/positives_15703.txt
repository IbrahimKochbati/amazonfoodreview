Well, he's a cat. I opened the can, spooned it down on his dish, and he ate it. Not all in one sitting, but he did gobble. Bear in mind though that this cat denuded a mouse and has gnawed on baby rabbits, so he will eat things that don't smell like seafood and are not on an attractive ceramic plate.          I suppose the true taste test would be to partake of it myself, but Amazon Vine, I'm not willing to go there, even for you.          The cans are on the smaller side, the smell was not overpowering. The product is made in Thailand, if that information would help you decide whether to purchase.          Personally, I'm sticking to Red Lobster for my seafood. But I can't take my cat there.
