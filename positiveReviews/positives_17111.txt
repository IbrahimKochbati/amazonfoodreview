This is an amazing product. I've spent so much time trying to find a decent baby food, but I was so disappointed. Some products simply looked inedible and I'd never want to give them to my baby. Then I came across NurtureMe. The peas actually look like peas! Imagine that. They pop with a  ight green color and smell just like fresh peas. My baby loves them and so do I. I've tested Sprout, Happy Baby, and Earths Best, but Nutureme is the only baby food I use.
