there is not much one can say about Hawaiian punch.  my kids love it.  the only r eason i took off 2 stars is that i ordered 8 64 oz bottles and received 4 128 oz bottles.  i need the smaller bottles so my kids can pour on their own.  i will have to revert to going to the supermarket for future Hawaiian  punch needs.
