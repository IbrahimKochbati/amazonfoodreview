I had been buying Senseo coffee pods to use in my Hamilton Beach pod  ewer.  The Senseo pods became impossible to find locally, so I looked online.  I drink decaf coffee, and it's often difficult to find decaf in different variaties.  When I found these pods from Baronet, I decided to take a chance on them.  They are so much better than the ones from Senseo!  The flavor is rich and the price is quite a bit less than the old pods I was buying. The Baronet pods are also stronger in flavor, which is great if you want to make a larger mug of coffee.  They come in flavors, too!  Highly recommend!!
