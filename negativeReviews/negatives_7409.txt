Jimmy Dean Country Gravy   B000H153W2          I bought this gravy mix because I do prefer to buy bulk online and my `usual'  and wasn't available on Amazon, but I have mixed feelings about the results.          For what it's worth, there's no sausage flecks in the actual mix, so that picture on the front is just a serving suggestion. The taste is... okay. Nothing to really write home about, and often I feel like it is just too salty for my tastes. The texture also starts to feel rather gummy after you remove the pan from the heat. I do like that this packet makes a small serving   one cup of mix instead of the usual 2 3 cups that a lot of packets have, which invariably gets wasted at our table. There's also no roux dissolving step   you just toss the water milk in a pan, mix the packet in, and you're done   and I've had no clumping issues that aren't immediately solved with a little whisking. It's certainly VERY convenient, but I do think the taste suffers a little as a result.          I think when these are gone, I'm going to keep trying other  ands.          ~ Ana Mardoll
