I will definitely keep some of this in stock. I tried a sample and   being a long time acid reflux sufferer   I was pleased to find this a rich but mild coffee. Rich in that it was very flavorful while mild enough to not irritate my stomach. Perfect if you have been told to cut back on the strong coffee.
