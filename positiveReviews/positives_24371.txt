Organic Chocolate Green SuperFood is one of the best natural energy bars I have ever tried. The combined ingredients of dates, dark chocolate and agave nectar gives it a sweet and fruity taste you will never think it is purely organic.          I am a vegan for over two years now and am a regular consumer of Gene Eden Vir 101, a natural product which has effectively helped me get rid of chronic viruses.  Unfortunately, I lost stock of it so I urgently needed an instant energy boosting supplement alternative for my very stressful lifestyle. My friend recommended Organic Chocolate Green SuperFood since she knew I am a vegan lover. I took her advice and am forever grateful for doing so. Now I have two products to enjoy whenever I need to boost my energy.          It is certainly your money's worth!
