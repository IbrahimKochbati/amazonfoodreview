i wanted something that had enough meat so my mini schnauzer would want to bite on it however i needed something that could entice him to chew on this rather than my apartment. THis bone was not the solution. There is practically no meat on this bone and after two minutes of chewing he lost interest in it. I threw it away after the first week snce he never touched it again.
