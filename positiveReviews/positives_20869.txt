I wanted to try a decaf coffee for after dinner and found the Donut House Decaf to be very good.  I was a little leery because it was labelled Extra Bold   Light Roast.  Wasn't sure what that label meant   was it going to be very strong (extra bold) or was it going to taste too weak (light roast)?  I don't like real strong coffee or weak coffee, so I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't taste too strong or too weak, as Goldilocks said "it was just right!"  I would definitely recommend it to a friend.
