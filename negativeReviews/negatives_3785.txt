These crackers taste absolutely delicious, but leave a coating aftertaste in my mouth that lasts for a long time.  Also, they contain MSG and for some people (I'm one of them) it causes a headache.  The last time I binged on these crackers (and they are hard to put down!), I ended up with a crashing headache.  Be forewarned!
