Melitta's Riviera Sunset Decaffeinated Ground Coffee turned out to be a good basic coffee   not bitter, not burned tasting, a well rounded mellow  ew that tastes like real coffee. I had it this morning with almond milk, stevia and a pinch of cinnamon, and though I'd had a bad night and didn't even know if I could handle coffee, it was delicious and easy on a morning tummy. Besides  ewing it alone to get a nice decaffeinated coffee for night time drinking (especially in the winter), we've been mixing it with regular coffee in various blends, depending on our caffeine related needs at the time.          The packaging is practical and easy to re close and the grind is good for my automatic coffeemaker. I will buy this one again.
