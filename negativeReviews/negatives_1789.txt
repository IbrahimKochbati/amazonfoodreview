I have been disappointed with this product.  We have always enjoyed Annie's products & have never had a problem, until now.  The "cheese" was so solidly clumped that I was unable to make a sauce without lumps.  I have used 3 different packages from my order & have had the problem with all of them.  I am not sure if it is the result of a manufacturing issue or if they have been sitting on a shelf too long in the warehouse.  Either way, beware.
