I have to warn that my review is going to sound like I sell this product.     I wish I know how to make them but I don't.          Next time you have minor digestive issues or stomach gas or nausea try one of these babies!     Just put it on your tongue and take in the juices.     You will feel better in 5 minutes.          Just a little bit of history.     When I was growing up, I knew them as Al Bukhara.  My father used to regulary eat them.     50 years later, when I recently had stomach ailment, I remembered about them.     My wife found them at a local middle east store under the same name. They are made in Iran.     Unfortunately, the store stopped selling them and had to look for an alternative and found the golden prunes from Sadaf.     They are not as good as Al Bukhara but next best thing and work well.          I have been using these for two years and they work every single time.     But watch out, they will make you hungry; I am not kidding!          Now, here is the most important thing     I found that not all dried prunes are as effective. In fact most of them don't do anything.     The prunes need to be moist, golden or light  own and soft. Sadaf also sells pitted prunes; don't buy them for relief from digestive issues or just to clear your stomach.          Amazon has been out of stock for a while now.  I buy them locally.     If you don't have access to such a store, Sadaf sells them online.
