This is incredible  ead. AS big as "normal" sandwich  ead. I used my  ead machine, and added raisins cinnamon and sugar at the last rising, and its the best ever raisin cinnamon  ead I have had ever. Also, I took half of the large loaf and froze them, now I just take out what I want and its fresh and awesome each time. By far the BEST for  ead out there and sooo easy to make with a  ead machine.  Definintely a MUST HAVE!!
