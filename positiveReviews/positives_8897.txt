I have made my own ghee and purchased various  ands of ghee. I have also tried traditional Moroccan ghee "Smen" and it can be strong and tangy. I found a review of this  and on an organic vegan website and it commented on the fresh sweetness of this ghees scent.  That review was right. This is bar none the sweetest scented butter product I have tried. Absolutely delightful. It is more expensive than other  ands I have tried.  I am not sure how they process it to get this fresh sweet butter scent but I will use it in my baking when the sweet buttery scent is most noticeable. In sauteing, this delicate scent is covered by meat and or vegatable scents. If you like a "tangy" butter scent to cut through with an oregano tinge try "Smen." Zamouri spices carries it.
