By accident, saw a lady pick this up in the grocery store.  She told me to try it and went on and on about it.  I bought a pack.  Wow!  Went back and bought all that was left on the shelf, about 7.  Gave some to kids and kept one for me.  Now the store where I purchesed it doesn't carry it anymore.  Thank goodness for Amazon.          You will not be disappointed.  You will be delighted you purchased it.  I promise.
