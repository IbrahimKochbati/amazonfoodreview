The tug a jug keeps my boarder collie busy for hours! I just put her normal food in the jug and she thinks it's a game to get the food! It is wonderful.  I don't sugest using it in any rooms with glass doors (like on an entertainment center) though, they  eak from the hard plastic jug.     WONDERFUL PRODUCT!!
