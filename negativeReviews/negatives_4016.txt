WHY, OH WHY would Gluten Free Pantry mess with a great thing? The reviews of this product are ALL from pre recipe change. I wonder what everyone thinks now that the recipe has changed. The FIRST ingredient in these  ownies used to be DUTCH COCOA and OH, were they decadent! But NOW, they don't stand out above any other mix out there. They are just "okay", where they used to be FAR superior, heads and shoulders above the competition! I'm extremely disappointed. They taste so BLAH now. I won't be buying them anymore.
