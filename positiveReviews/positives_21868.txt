I'm a new Keurig user and this is by far my favorite flavor of tea.  I've tried 8 flavors of tea and the Mandarin Orange Spice is the most flavorful.  In addition to drinking it on its own, I pour a "small" cup of the Mandarin Orance Spice mixed with a "small" cup of the Lemon Zinger.  I like mixing flavors, but still my favorite is the Mandarin Orange Spice on its own.
