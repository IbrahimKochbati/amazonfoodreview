Pretzels are too easy to just keep eating until the bag is done.  Therefore, a 100 calorie option gives me the pause I need ( before I open another snack sized bag), to decide   and therefore think before just eating all 60 packages (yikes!)  We use them in lunches, as snacks, as halloween treats, at the beach, at the pool, at work, in the car (now I am becoming a Dr. Seuss book).          The shipments we have received (2 so far) have not been stale, soggy or out of date.
