The Switch tries to blur the line between soda and juice, and I'd say that the experiment is successful. It's sweet and rich like soda, but it is, as the label says, 100% juice, and therefore of vastly more nutritional value. I guess it all comes down to taste, and it's more similar to soda than juice here, maybe like a more toned down Sunkist soda. As I said, I liked it, and I'd probably pick it up again, though it hasn't displaced Squirt as my favorite.
