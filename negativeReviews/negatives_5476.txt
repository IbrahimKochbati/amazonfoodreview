When I opened this package and sniffed (like I do all coffee), I just prepared myself for the worst in terms of taste. It smelled bitter and almost sour and sure enough that's exactly how it tasted as well. I am used to strong coffee but this is was just a travesty. In order to not waste it, I added some cappuccino and milk to it and managed to get it down but even through that, the sourness was still evident to some extent.
