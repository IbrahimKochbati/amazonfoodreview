I am pretty picky when it comes to my coffee.  Tried just about everything.  Can not stand the weak blends and only like dark roasts (extra bold).  Used to drink Timothy's Parisian Nights, Midnight Magic and Green Mountains Dark Magic on medium water selection to get a strong enough  ew, but now Barista Prima French Roast ONLY, on the large water setting.  Even with extra water it is perfect.  Little pricier than some of the others, but it is worth it, plus I get a full cup of coffee now when I  ew on the large water setting.  I should also mention I only use filtered water when I  ew my coffee, makes a huge difference.  Filtered water and a Barista Prima French Roast K cup and it will by far blow everything else out of the water.  Nothing else compares.  If you like a really dark, smooth, flavorful coffee, you must try this.  You will not be disappointed.  But keep in mind, this is only for people who truly like the darkest roast (i.e. I think it curls my hair). Serious coffee drinkers only!
