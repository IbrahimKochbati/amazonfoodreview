This was really a disappointment. While the products included are fine, the real disappointment was the travel mug. It is a cheap plastic cup with the nutritional information for the cookies on it! So it is basically just a cookie package! Yeah, that is really what I want to use as a travel mug. I agree with the review that it looks like it came from a dollar store. The product description says the polka dot tumbler is "definitely a keeper." What? It is simply cheap packaging! Not something of quality to enjoy. Had I known that I would not have purchased the set. I really was looking forward to using the cute looking mug on a daily basis. I like the products inside and the basket is OK, but really this what not what it appeared to be.
