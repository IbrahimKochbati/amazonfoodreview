I ordered this product for a 50th birthday party to be used with a full size carnival popcorn machine.  It was perfect for this use, however, we had several left over and was very surprised that we could use it in our regular sized Whirley Pop popcorn popper that we use at home.  We just needed to scale the amount back by 1 2 and do two batches, but it had the same great taste and popped wonderfully.  Will definitely order again just for home use.
