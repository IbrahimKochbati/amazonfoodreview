This instant coffee is a versatile ingredient. You can add it to ice cream you are freezing (or gelato or sorbet) or you can add it to chocolate icing to make mocha flavor. It is the ingredient to have when the recipe calls for "one cup of strong, cold coffee."          As a beverage on its own, it is a bit more acid than fresh espresso. But as a mix with milk, it works wonderfully well. You won't make a barrista cup of espresso with instant, but you will have a great way to make a latte in a pinch and for regular cooking, I personally am never without this jar on my shelf.
