I was so excited when Bisquick came out with the gluten free version, but I was frustrated with the length of time it took for me to get a hold of some.  I did finally order some through Amazon, and today I made pancakes using the mix.  Due a milk allergy, I made them with soy milk (the original 'flavor') and I added a little double strength vanilla. They were fantastic and my family and guests gobbled them up.  I will definitely make them again and try some of the other recipes.     "
