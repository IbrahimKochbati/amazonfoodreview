I have to say that I liked this combination of chocolate and peanut butter.  Well, truthfully, you can mix chocolate with anything and I will be happy!!!!     This has a good chocolate flavor as well as a peanut butter taste.  It's a good combination.     I don't like it spead on  ead, so I use graham crackers or a butter cookie.  But, with all honesty, I'm a knife dipper!!!! But before you cringe, the whole jar is designated as mine, so I can get away with this.  Plus, if I offer anyone this type of Peanut Butter, I get a new jar for the company!!!     I liked it as it was described correctly.  I would have LOVED it if it only taste like chocolate.  Oh, but that's a different product.     Thanks, TJ
