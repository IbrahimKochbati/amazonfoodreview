I bought two bags (original) which were delivered to me on November 16th...          The first bag was good. It had soft pieces of jerky mixed with annoying hard pieces of jerky. The meat has a nice fat to meat ratio, you know when you bite down on a fatty piece of meat. However, the hard pieces had tendon or sinew. On some pieces I could pull the silver sinew out and use it to floss my teeth. Not palatable at all. Generally the jerky is somewhat grainy due to the spices but is palatable. A strong peppery taste permeated the jerky. I felt like some of the pieces were not mixed properly, some pieces of meat were more salty than others.          The taste is quite enjoyable. (I'm known to eat anything... & can acquire taste) If you don't mind fishing out the bad parts...          However, my second bag developed some kind of mold. I started on the second bag without knowing that this bag contained a mold ball right in the middle of the bag. About half way through I found the moldy meat. I had read of this occurring in some people's product but I dismissed it as a freak chance.          The mold is white, it reminds me of  ead fluff. The mold is very bitter. I just reached into the bag for a piece of jerky & bit down on a moldy piece. I promptly spat it out and saw the middle part of the bag was fully rotten. IMHO.          Would I buy this product again?          No. a 50% chance of getting moldy meat... Well I don't wanna chance it.
