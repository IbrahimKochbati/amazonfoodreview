I like strong coffee; so when this came I made a pot and my husband and I tried it.  The coffee is ground fine and is bold in taste but not bitter.  Other than that I cannot say I would buy this coffee.  My husband liked it; I can take it or leave it.  Melitta has a good name and maybe if this coffee were  ewed in a Melitta Coffee maker and filter; it might have a different flavor.  It was okay.
