My puppy loves this product.  The moment he has a Greenie in his mouth, he'll begin to munch.  I actually got this product not only to keep my pup's teeth clean, but am using it to help my puppy teeth.  The product is just hard enough so that my puppy can keep gnawing on it, but it is simultaneously soft enough for him to sink his teeth into (providing assistance for teeth development).  I definitely recommend this product.
