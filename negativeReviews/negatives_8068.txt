This isn't one of my favorites... My rule is that I always taste something before feeding my baby. This taste kinda sour   and it's really purple. My daughter seems to be okay with this but it would get stuck to the roof of her mouth for a while    maybe this is an issue for all these melts, I am not sure yet... but I decided to wait till she's older to give her some more of this stuff.
