My 65 pound hound loves these treats, and she isn't normally a fan of lamb. When given the blind 'taste' test (this treat in one fist, another treat in the other fist), she chose this treat every time.  Smaller dogs may have a tough time, however, because these treats are hard as a rock and come in the bag as two treats joined together (each square is about 1.5x2 inches), which are not that easy for me to separate.  The dog loves the flavor and we like that they are organic and not simply made out of wheat or corn (which she is allergic to) with a flavor added.
