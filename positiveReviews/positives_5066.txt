I have two Chihuahuas and they absolutely love their little bites!  The ingredients are the best quality available .. organic chicken, flax seed, nutra drops, and TONS of vitamins and minerals!  The best part about this food is that toy  eeds can be on this from the time their little puppies til they're full grown  for life!  Try finding another dog food that does that!  This is a MUST if you have a toy  eed dog.  It helps balance their glycemic index even at the most stressful periods of time.  Overall, it is just a really healthy food that will make your dog look and feel beautiful inside and out!
