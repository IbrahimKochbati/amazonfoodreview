I typically feed them dry food, and once a day I split a can of Fancy Feast to give them a treat with their supper.     They love it. They have never turned down any canned cat food. Sometimes one will refuse or just nibble at a particular flavor, but they usually like their canned food          I tried out both flavors on my three kitties, None of them did more than nibble, I tried it on my dog, just out of curiosity, He ate it . Continuing my experiment, I went to my friend Margie's house. She has three cats as well. Much like my feline family, one is a senior and two are young. Sadly, I had the same result. None of them liked it.          Before receiving the food I looked online to learn as much as I could about this food before subjecting my furkids to it. Everything looked good, safe and worthy of Morgan, Rosie and Emmie. I was quite disappointed that they don't like it, to tell you the truth. It looked so good that I really wanted them to like it.I will be dropping off the rest of it at the shelter tomorrow. I certainly do not want it to go to waste, as it is a good quality product.
