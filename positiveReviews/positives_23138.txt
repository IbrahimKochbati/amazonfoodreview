Pamela's mix is the best on the market.  And though it's machine made, this  ead is heavenly, especially a fresh, hot slice slathered with real butter.  I've found that when sealed in a gallon size ZipLoc bag, a loaf will stay fresh for 5 or 6 days    but it rarely lasts that long because it's soooooo good for peanut butter & jelly sandwiches.  Why "nearly" perfect?  Well, gluten is the "glue" that holds  ead together and, when there is none,  ead tends to crumble    true for all gluten free  eads.  Pamela's ingredients, however, keep the  ead moist, and crumbling to a minimum.  For another taste treat, I'd also highly recommend Pamela's wheat free pancake mix.
