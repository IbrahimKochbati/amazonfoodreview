I am aware that tea bags do not give the same flavour as looseleaf, but this stuff is still quite good, and unlike with looseleaf, I can carry a ziplock of teabags with me everywhere so I can  always have tea. These bags are pretty cheap too. I bought one and then split the box among 2 friends, so we each paid like 6 bucks for 40 tea bags. I had never tried Lady Gray before, but it is pretty good. The other three are all classics, and I love them too!
