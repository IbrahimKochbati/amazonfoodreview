My 5 year old Flat Coated Retriever developed symptoms & was diagnosed with IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease).  He had an allergy spike in his blood work that was "off the charts" in his specialist's words.  A change of food to Venison & Sweet Potato has  ought my very sick dog back to himself.  He's on no other medications daily.  Next we're trying the Venison & Sweet Potato treats.          Thanks for a superb product.
