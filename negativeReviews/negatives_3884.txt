I thought this taste good, till about 20 mins after drinking some of the can.     Then It kept coming up (burping) yuck!      I usually do not burp up my food.           I also did not find this very refreshing.     With that said, I'm not a soda drinker. I drink allot of water, which does not have 135 Calories for 8.3 oz.      It says, No surgar added, No preservatives..Believe me, it does not need anymore of a sugar taste..     33 Gr. of natural sugar!          If your a soda drinker etc. you might find this a better choice.
