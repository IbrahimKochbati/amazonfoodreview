I fell in love with these when visiting the UK this fall and so happy to find them on amazon! If you have not had them before, they are not what most would think of as a cracker; being soft, not crispy but can be toasted. The rough cut oats are quite evident. I like grabbing one or two for a quick snack, far better for me than cookies! I suggest giving them a try.
