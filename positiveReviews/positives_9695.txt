I love Larabars.  They are the simplest ingredients, but don't taste processed.  I ate them during my pregnancy as a snack when i didn't feel like preparing something, but wanted something relatively healthy and quick to satisfy my hunger.  And the peanut butter & jelly is my favorite because it has a nice combination of peanut with the cherry fruit.  (unlike say cherry pie or peanut butter cookie, it has it all).
