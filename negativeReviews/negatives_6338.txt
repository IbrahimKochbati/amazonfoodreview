Before purchasing this product I had read that it was close in taste to Lavazza...which is lighter in taste and not bitter at all. This particular blend is quite bitter and I did not find it to be "smooth" like the description states. This is probably perfect for those of you who enjoy a dark and bitter roast...but for those who want a light smooth espresso without bitterness...I wouldn't recommend it...It really just comes down to preference.
