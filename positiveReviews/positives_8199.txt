I was a huge skeptic when this first came out but no longer.  I can't get over how good this instant coffee tastes.  It's better than what I can grind and  ew myself.  I have these on my desk at work now for making decaf ice coffee in the afternoons.  It costs 1 4 of what they'd charge me at the store and I can get decaf.  Awesome.  I am truly shocked how good this coffee is.          I just wish they sold it in large containers for making full pots.
