Shake 'n Bake has been around a long time, which should tell you something about the product. It's very easy to use    just put it in a plastic bag, add your pork chop (or whatever), and shake until the meat is coated with the crumbs. They tell you to put the crumbs in a bowl if you don't happen to have a plastic bag, so you're not limited there.          I used the coating for pork chops and they didn't stick to the pan. The underside crumbs were a bit mushy and not crunchy, so I don't know if I should have flipped the pork chops halfway through cooking or what. I guess I'll have to get more Shake 'n Bake and try it again. My husband said it was "okay," which isn't a bad thing. It's not something to rave about          The ingredients are enriched wheat flour, various B vitamins, salt, canola oil, sugar, spice, caramel color, dried onions, dextrose, yeast, extracts of paprika, and ascorbic acid (vitamin C). There are six 40 calorie servings per pouch. My only qualm is with the "spice," since I'm trying to avoid MSG and I don't know if it can be hidden under "spice." If it's in there, it's a very small amount, but I prefer full disclosure on ingredient labels. The onions are also very, very small. I actually don't like onions, but I do like onion powder. If you have kids who are picky eaters, they won't notice the onions. I didn't. ;)          The "original pork" flavor is mild and makes a nice meal by itself, but if you want to spice it up, you can always mix in your own herbs and spices. That makes it very versatile. Overall, a good item to have in your pantry.
