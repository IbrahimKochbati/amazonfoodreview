Normally I love walnuts, however I regret this purchase.  The nuts are coated in a savory seasoning with paprika, garlic, and veggie flavoring.     I was expecting something sweet or plain which I could throw on my morning oatmeal.     However, they aren't a bad product, if you like salted and seasoned nuts.  I can only compare it to garden vegetable flavored crackers. The quality is decent overall, just not a flavor I enjoy.  The packaging is lightweight and portable, which is nice to grab on the go for snacking.
