I'd been looking for whole wheat orzo for awhile, and it's almost impossible to find in any grocery stores. This is a very great pasta at a reasonable price. I've been very pleased with this pasta. One thing   If you are accustomed to the enriched wheat (non whole grain) orzo, this is a lot firmer   and another thing I've noticed is that It develops a grainy texture if I leave a pasta in the fridge overnight.
