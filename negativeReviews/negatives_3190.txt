These food trays are terrible. I requested them in my baby registry, and thank god I only got one. It is very very difficult to scoop the frozen food out, and frozen food even bends spoon if you try to spoon it out. I'm donating it first thing in the morning. I highly recommend purchasing single food pods that you can just toss into a lunch bag and go, and defrost independently wherever you are.
