Due to our dog's  intestinal issues it was suggested we give him a couple tablespoons of pumpkin with his meals. Not the pie mix, but pure, organic pumpkin.     It was pretty pricey at the pet store and not available in our supermarkets since it is a seasonal item. I always find the best deals on Amazon and this was one of them. Good price and FREE shipping on two cases, that stuff is heavy so the free shipping and no tax was a welcome reward. Now that Max is over his tummy upset we continue to give him this  product. You can also use this for baking, adding your own sugar and spice.
