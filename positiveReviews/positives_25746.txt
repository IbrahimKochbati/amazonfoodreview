I am currently doing the HcG Diet and cannot have anything extra with calories, fat, or sugar.  This barbeque sauce is perfect!!!  I used it last night and WOW! It tastes so good!  It's not thick like traditional bbq sauce, but it is for dieters.  It's sweetened with Sucralose which is an HCG diet no no, however I didn't stall.  It is tangy, sweet, and barbequey.  I couldn't ask for more.  I have tried Walden Farms Balsamic Vinagrette (which is good), the Honey Dijon (yuck), the Sesame Ginger (so so), the Ranch (yuck), Peanut Spread (sweet, but not peanut butter tasting), and the Blueberry Jam (good) and I have to say that so far this is the best that they have to offer for dieters.  I don't understand the 1 stars people are leaving (they probably aren't really dieting!).  My coworkers who are also doing the HCG Diet along with me LOVE this bbq sauce, they almost stole my bottle.  I am ordering more now so I don't run out!!!
