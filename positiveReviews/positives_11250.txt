My 3 yr old daughter just got diagnosed with Celiac's. We're experimenting now finding the right products to substitute what we like that taste the best. This is the best  ownie mix! I like it better than Bob's Red Mill  ownie mix (which I thought was good too, but a bit moist). It tastes just like "regular"  ownie mix. No complaints, everyone loves it, and my daughter doesn't have a tummy ache. Perfect!
