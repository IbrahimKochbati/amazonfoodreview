This toy is phenomenal.  It keeps both of our dogs (1 silky terrier, 1 boston terrier) busy, and actually keeps my boston's farting problem at bay (I'm serious).  The only downside is the plastic top that you have to screw off on to put food into it is NOT durable.  I called customer service and they sent me a new one, but they sounded surprised because the tug a jug is apparently made of ballistic plastic (I don't even know what that means).  The 5 jugs I've gone through say otherwise...          Note: I will continue to buy these anyways.
