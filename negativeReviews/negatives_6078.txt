I recently purchased the On the Go Yamamotoyama Sweetened Iced Green Tea and was floored!  I bought it at a store that is far from me.  I was told I could find this  and at Ralph's. But when I went I could only find the Raspberry flavored one.  It was absolutely horrible compared to the one I had earlier, which is easily a 5 star review.  It was just weird tasting.  I would stick to the regular one and flavor it later.  Wow big fail.
