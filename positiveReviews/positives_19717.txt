I've been a vegetarian for 10 years (all of my 20s) and absolutely love it!  Lately I've been really looking for good healthy protein sources that I actually like to eat, and these Primal Strips are excellent!  These things scare me because they are so realistically meat like.     I've tried 3 flavors of them so far, and there was only 1 that I thought wasn't great.  It was completely edible, but the texture was just not as good as the others.  I think it was the Teriyaki that I didn't like so much, but I really liked the Texas Barbecue and the Hickory Smoked flavors.          These are excellent low calorie, low fat, convenient, tasty snacks with high amounts of protein.  You can take them anywhere, keep them in your desk at work or in your purse!          The only complaint I have about these is that I wish there were versions with lower sodium.  To me, as someone who loves a good salty snack, but knows that too much salt is not good and tries to avoid it, these taste too salty.  And 300+ mg of sodium per strip seems high.          But in the end I am overlooking the sodium and am purchasing these in bulk now!  I just bought the Thai Peanut flavor because I love spicy foods, and I love Thai food!  I'll update this review with my thoughts on this flavor after I receive them.          UPDATE: I received the Thai Peanut flavor and LOVE them!  They have a great chewy texture, good flavor, and a good amount of spice.  All for only 74 calories each, but 10g protein!  I definitely recommend these!
