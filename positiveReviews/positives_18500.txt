Finally! I can indulge in a crunchy, tasty snack that I won't regret an hour later. My favorite is the sea salt and vinegar flavor    not too much vinegar, and just the right amount of salt. (The plain Pop Chips are solid, too.) These chips are unbelievably light. They give me the same satisfaction as munching on popcorn, but with less guilt and hassle.
