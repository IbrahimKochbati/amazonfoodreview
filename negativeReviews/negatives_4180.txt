This is truly bad loose leaf tea.  I still haven't used very much of it and I bought it some time ago, and no it didn't go bad (unless it was shipped bad), as it was very subpar when I first got it.  Quite bitter and lacking any maltiness whatsoever (at best it tastes slightly above Lipton bagged tea).  Do yourself a favor and order from teasource.com or uptonteas.com both are far better then this.  Heck even Teavanna is better than this.  Extremely disappointing....can barely make passable sun tea out of it.
