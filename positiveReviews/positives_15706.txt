Unlike other fish catfood, this product does not have that strong fishy smell.  Nice flaky chunks of fish in some nice gravy.          However Ms Cassiopia lapped up the gravy and left the fish.  This has happened with other food so it is no reflection on the product.          I would have given it 5 stars but since I won't be buying it, I gave it 4.  If your cat will eat food other than pate, you will want to give this a try.  Looks almost like something you would eat.          I have given the remainder of the package to a less fortunate friend.     Her cat will probably eat it and expect it all the time.          Thank you!     MEF
