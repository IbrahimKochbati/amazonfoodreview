I've been sampling gluten free cookies, including Mi Del and Enjoy Life. These are the clear winner. Nothing else comes close. These taste very "cookie like" and have that special something that is delicious. If I didn't know these were wheat free, dairy free I wouldn't have suspected anything.          Highly recommended.
