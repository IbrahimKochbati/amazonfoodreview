I read some reviews that claimed that this shake cause GI issues.          Everyone has different sensitivities. My son has autism and according to his IgE and IgG panel test he has about 20 food sources that he has to avoid, such as: gluten (wheat, barley, rye), oats, milk, garlic, walnuts, sesame, grapefruit, coconut, and so on. I myself am sensitive to gluten and dairy and would get bloated and heartburn if I consume gluten or dairy. So this may not be the fault of this product because I found it to be a great product. I suggest if you have any GI issues you check with a good GI doctor, not just ANY GI doctor. The best GI doctor in the world is Dr. Arthur Krigsman. He practices either at Throughtful House in TX or in NYC. He has helped so many children with autism and addressed their GI issues that eventually the autistic behaviors improve. My son has been treated using simiar protocols by our DAN! doctor, Dr. Neu ander in NJ, and has recovered from autism just by cleaning his GI problems.          I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish it would not use sugar. It uses sugar cane, but natural sugar or not it's still sugar. Sugar feeds yeast, and yeast causes GI and neurological issues (definitely behavior issues with my son). Signs of yeast overgrowth: dark circles under the eyes, red cheeks ears, rashes ezcema, hyperactivity, fatigue, craving for carbs and sugar, and so on (check out SCD diet on the Internet). I would rather use Stevia or Xylitol, so I wish this product didn't come sweetened. Xylitol actually has an added benefit, to prevent and fight cavities, since we don't use fluoride at home (fluoride is toxic, and it binds to calcium but it can't tell the difference between calcium and lead, so it increases metal retention in your body). I know this is digressing from the topic, but since I mentioned it I thought I'd explain a bit for those who are not familiar.
