I have never been much of a soup person, unless down with a cold or too tired to cook up something fancy.  Once heated, I crumbled tortilla chips on top (or even some shredded cheese).  Since I love Mexican food, this satisfied me for the evening.  I was advised by Progresso that they have discontinued this soup.  Thank goodness Amazon had some for purchasing.
