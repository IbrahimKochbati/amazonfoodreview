Arm & Hammer's baking soda is aluminum free, they just don't write it on their packaging.          I wasn't sure so I called them and they said there is no aluminum in it, and they would have to state it if there was because people take the product internally.  This leads me to believe that there just isn't aluminum in baking soda.  And researching it showed me that there might have been in the past, but not anymore and not for a long time.          I resent that Bob's Red Mill writes "Aluminum Free" on their package and then charges a premium for their product.  It's also arsenic free, I hope.  If they label it "Arsenic Free" will we assume other  ands aren't?  I don't like that kind of marketing.
