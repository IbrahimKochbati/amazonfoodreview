I recieved this item the other day and while the packaging looks really nice, It was much smaller than expected, although the " ews 60 cups" is right, only if you use the super tiny 6oz cups that are on your coffee maker or like your coffee pretty weak.          I would say that these bags are pretty small and you "might" get 3 coffee maker uses per bag if you're lucky, probably more like 2 uses per bag as they are much smaller than expected.  The quality of the product is VERY good however and I'm sure my  other in law will love this gift since he usually drinks awful folgers!          Shipped fast and I would order from them again for gift purposes!
