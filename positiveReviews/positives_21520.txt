Unlike the McDonald's oatmeal, which made headlines for having more sugar than a Snickers bar, this version is quite healthy, with only 12 grams of sugar per serving. And its ingredient list is fairly simple  oatmeal, sugar, the mysterious "flavorings," then a bunch of vitamins.          Perfect for a quick morning at home or work. It won't rock your world, but it's convenient and healthy :)
