Spend a little extra money and get the real stuff...and quite honestly you will never go back to that stuff that pretends to be maple syrup.     Grade B is what we prefer in my household because of the stronger maple taste.     Amazon has wonderful sales on this product which makes it much more affordable. Believe me when I say...ditch your fake maple syrup and go for the real stuff.
