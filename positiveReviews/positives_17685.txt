This coffee boasts less than half the acid of regular coffees.  Fair enough, how would I know?     I get heart burn on occasion and did not while drinking this coffee.  And no stomach upset either.          The taste is good, no after taste of bitterness, smooth and dark the way I like it.          I made a potful and asked everyone else for their opinions and everyone said, "It tastes good, pretty much like any other coffee."
