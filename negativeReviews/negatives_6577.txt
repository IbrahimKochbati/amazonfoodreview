I've never been a huge fan of oatmeal in any form. But I've learned to appreciate these instant packets as I get older. They're ready in mere minutes, quite filling, and the taste is not bad  I find Quaker  and far tastier than any generic or store  and I've tried. Maple  own sugar, along with apple cinammon, is among my faves. Add half a banana, and maybe some strawberries, and you have a high energy meal that leaves you feeling full and satisfied for hours. Great for the price and convenience.
