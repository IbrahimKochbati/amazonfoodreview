I really wasn't expecting much. Just something relatively tasty and quick to make. I would normally steer clear of Chef Boyardee but the reviews were good as well as the price so I thought I would take a chance. I have no idea how this could have a 4.5 star rating, and I have to wonder what the culinary standards are across the US.          Let's start with the sauce. First of all it's  own, thin, insipid, and lacking any tomato taste. There's some tasteless gristle in there that I guess is supposed to pass as meat. The ravioli themselves have a texture I've never before encounted in pasta. I have no idea how they hold together being that soft. I wasn't expecting al dente, but this is at the other extreme. It's mushy and slimy. It didn't even know there WAS a stage of pasta like this. It has no texture to it at all and becomes a gummy, pasty mess in the mouth. There looks to be generous filling but I have no idea what it's made of. The generous 'meat' filling shown got me to buy it but it has no taste of meat at all.          I don't know how any mother with a conscience can feed this to her kids. I don't know how anyone with taste buds can feed this to themselves. There HAS to be better options than this for quick ravioli. There certainly can't be any worse ones!!!
