Shake `N Bake Original Chicken Coating is very easy to use. You can use it on 6   8 pieces of chicken, either bone in or boneless. You simply moisten each piece of chicken, put the coating mix in a bag, put the chicken in the bag (one or two pieces at a time), and shake the bag until the coating mix covers each piece of chicken. Once that is done you put the chicken in an ungreased baking pan, heat the oven to 400 degrees, and cook for either 45 minutes (bone in) or 20 minutes (boneless). You just stick it in the oven   no need to turn the chicken during cooking   and forget about it until it is done.          Shake `N Bake Original Chicken Coating makes for a quick easy meal to prepare that tastes good. I have to confess that I'm not a particularly good cook and I don't have the patience to fix fancy meals but even I can't mess up when using Shake `N Bake. It is very easy to coat the chicken (although if you have large pieces of chicken you may run out of mixture) and it only takes a matter of seconds to rinse the chicken, coat it, and put it in the oven. You can use it on either bone in chicken or boneless (for a quicker meal) and while both taste equally good, I prefer to use it on bone in chicken. It tastes good (sort of like fried chicken) although a bit greasy. The pan can be a bit messy after cooking but it is still an easy cleanup.          Shake `N Bake Original Chicken Coating is great when you need to fix a quick easy meal.
