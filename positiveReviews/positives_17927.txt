This stuff is wonderful on days when you just don't feel like going all out on making dinner. Just trim the fat off your pork chops, and shake and bake! Shake and Bake seasonings supplies one plastic bag inside the spice bag for you to use. Just pour spices into the plastic bag, add chops, shake, and bake. Easy as one, two, three. Tastes great, and easy. Kids love it too!
