I purchased this product at a health food store about 2 years ago and I've been buying it ever since. I've recently moved and the health food store is too far away so I decided to buy it off the internet. At the time, I was having major tooth aches. I didn't have insurance so I couldn't afford to get any dental work. This product was like a miracle cure. I can't remember how long it took for the pain to subside but I can tell you that the pain did go away. Well, I've recently ran out of the coconut oil and the tooth aches are back. I would suggest you do some research on the benefits of taking coconut oil. I take 2 TBSP two times a day. There are so many more benefits to taking this.
