It's reassuring that the treats I give my precious Yorkie are of the best quality and of course I appreciate the cost effectiveness of dealing with a reputable company.  Amazon has provided swift service and a product that would cost much more from a local pet shop.  Greenies are good for my dog's dental health and are not dangerous as are rawhides or toys with squeeking mechanisms which can choke a dog.  Just the sight of the Greenie box, and she knows it's nap time or time for a treat.
