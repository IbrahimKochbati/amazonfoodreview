I have a 6 year old westie that had the worst food allergies, her coat was very  ittle, and she had low energy.  One walk and she'd be passed out.  As many of you on here, I take pride in my dog and pride that I want to take care of it the best that I am able to. I've tried blue buffalo and other high rated foods, but she would not eat them unless I "spiced" it up with something. It was time consuming, frustrating, and hard to keep her on an eating schedule.  I finally decided to give this a go ahead even though it is on the pricey side.          What I've noticed is that she eats it immediately and even licks her bowl.  Her coat is soft and shiny now, she's a running dog now than a walk dog (and thats saying something considering she's a westie), and her eating schedule is regulated and I have a better idea of what she's eaten so I can control her weight (she's a small westie around 14 lbs.)          For those of you thinking that its too expensive there's no way you could afford to keep your dog on this diet. For my dog she requires about 0.75 ounces or 3 4 of a scoop and that goes a long way for a 2.2 lb. bag.  So its not like I am buying this dog food every week.          The only small negative is the dog food has a slight smell to it.  Nothing that will make you vomit but its not something I am used to smelling when giving her dog food.  For those wondering what the dog food looks like?  It's like small shredded pieces of dark jerky.          Recommendation?  BUY
