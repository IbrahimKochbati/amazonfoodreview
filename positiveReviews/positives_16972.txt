A friend of mine had just bought this for her dog who seemed to find it challenging and recommended it to me.  My Rottie Sarah figured this out pretty quickly; within two minutes she figured out if she pawed at the rubber throat side, it will upend and kibble will come out. Second round she graduated to that plus nosing it up the rest of the way.  Third she figured out putting one paw on the rope helped her paw it upend with the other.  She's also lifted it up in her mouth, open end down. In defense of the toy, she previously learned to do this with kibble in Kongs so she may already understand "things that if tipped upside down dispense treats".          She's a pretty smart dog but of course everyone thinks their kid is the smartest in the class :)          I've read suggestions on adding balls to it to make it more difficult, which would slow her down, but I was hoping to be able to increase the mental challenge not just reduce the randomness, so this now is as "difficult" mentally as it'll get.          She's completely ignored the rope except as a way to upend it.          On the positive side, it does provide her mental challenge, slows down her otherwise rapid eating, and isn't so difficult that she gives up or gets frustrated.  She also has the Kong wobbler which she's figured out (gets her nose under the fat end and just keeps rolling it to get the kibble out), which is a pretty good product, but the Busy Buddy is a bit more challenging.
