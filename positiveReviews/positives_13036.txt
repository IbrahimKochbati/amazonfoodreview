I'M NOT A CANNED PASTA PERSON BUT THERE IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GENERIC CANNED SAUCE AND THIS PRODUCT.  I BUY IT FOR MY ELDERLY MOTHER AND GAVE IT THE TASTE TEST. AND I PERSONALLY LIKE THE ITALIAN SAUSAGE STUFFED BETTER THAN THE BEEF. I LIKE NOT HAVING TO CARRY THE BAG OF CANS IN FROM THE STORE. HAVING IT DELIVERED IS VERY HANDY AND MUCH EASIER TO PUT AWAY IN THE CUPBOARD.
