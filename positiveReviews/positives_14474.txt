I am in my mid 20s, approx height 5'8". For a good part of my college years I was 220 250lbs, I have since dropped down to 175 (weight loss not related to this drink). I began a rigorous workout routine once I reached my ideal weight to eliminate the love handles. Working full time and attending Masters Degree classes part time, with a few hours a week spent at the gym, really takes a toll on the energy level. Preworkout I drink Jack3d with A Akg powder. That product let me tell you is the best thing since slice  ead. I am big on Monster Absolute Zero, and if that is not available Monster Low Carb. So when I dropped by the Vitamin Shop a few days ago and the salesman who most certainly knows what he is talking about, dudes rock solid, suggested I try Celsius. Handed me 4 cans of this flavor, "Sparkling Orange". Upon initial taste results, it reminds me of Soda. I have not drank soda in upwards of 2 years. This  ought all those couch potato memories back, till I rotated the can and read the ingredients. That quickly made the lazy days disappear once more. This drink is loaded with the energy stuff you will expect from a drink such as monster, BUT with a change of pace in taste. It does not taste anything like a redbull or monster or even rockstar, this unique taste separates it from all the energy boosters I've tasted in the passed. Long story short, this does pack a kick. Today is a perfect example, I worked a full shift on 8 hours of sleep, 8am 4pm, worked out at the gym from 9pm 11pm, slept 2 hours, and got up to go into work at 4am, pickup a few hours of overtime, drank a can and I am feeling GREAT. The energy boost is enlightening. So if you are looking for a good energy booster at a better price than most, this is it for you. I love Monster Absolute zero, but it is more than twice the price per can.
