I really like this particular flavor    always enjoyed the coffee grounds back when I had that kind of coffee maker.  This one is good too.  It tastes good either hot or iced.  The only downside is it's about 5 cents more per cup than if you buy at Walmart of Target where you can get 18 K cups for $9.95 on sale sometimes.  Not too big a deal because it costs money in gas to get there so the price is on par and maybe better.          The organic coffees just taste better and Newman's products are well made    as if they really care about taste.  I highly recommend it.          With amazon prime, it's good because you only wait 2 days.
