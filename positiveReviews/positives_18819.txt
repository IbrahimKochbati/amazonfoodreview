I'm not a big frosting person.  I always scrape off the frosting on fancy cakes because frankly its vile.  But this stuff I could eat out of the jar with a spoon.  Duncan Hines Strawberries 'N Cream Frosting is THE BEST frosting I have ever tasted! Its difficult to find in grocery stores which is sad because its so superior. I highly recommend this frosting!
