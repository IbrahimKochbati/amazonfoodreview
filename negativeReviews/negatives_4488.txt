We bought a 16 pack and have 13 left.  Of the 3 that we tried, she never once finished a single pouch.  I tried it and was really surprised because it is well seasoned with herbs and spices compared to other things she will eat.  It could be the texture   I don't know.  It's a little mushy, like baby food.  Probably would be better with pasta instead of amaranth, although I appreciate the diversity of grains.  Anyway, I love it, she hates it, so 3 stars.
