There should be some sort of Surgeon General's warning on these they are so good. With all the high fat and high sugar cheeze puffs most people are used to these may taste somewhat bland at first bite, but believe me you'll be craving it soon enough. I offered my neighbor a handful and even though he thought they were just okay he came back ten minutes later and asked for an entire bag. My dorm room is full of sugary pop tarts and rice krispy treats, but I always go for these first and I think that kept me from gaining too much weight during finals.
