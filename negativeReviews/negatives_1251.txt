I usually feed Earth's Best baby food to my grandson. He has never had a reaction of any kind to any baby food I have given him. This is the first time I have tried this particular variety pack. I fed him the Peach Oatmeal Banana and Apples and Apricots for  eakfast this morning. Shortly after I noticed he was scratching. I looked and he had a rash. I remembered reading a baby food review where someone mentioned an allergy so I checked and yes it is this variety pack. I don't know what is in it that would cause this type of reaction. Unfortunately I fed him two different jars so I don't know which one caused it but I don't want to take a chance of him having another one so out they go. Just thought I would let others know.
