I've  ewed this coffee a few times after buying a bag, and unfortunately it joins the many other decaf coffees that just don't have the full flavor of regular coffee. I'm giving it away and will keep on looking.          If anyone has tried a few decafs and found one that tastes great ( ewed like most in a drip coffee maker), please let us know!
