I have been looking for this.  I had one from SAM sometimes ago.  When I returned to SAM, they do not have it anymore.  SAM is always a hit or miss.          I search the web and found it in Amazon.  I am so glad to find it.  I used this every where from stir fried vegitable to bake fish, grill steak, chicken and shrimp.  It taste great!  It is just the right amount of simple spice with low sodium.
