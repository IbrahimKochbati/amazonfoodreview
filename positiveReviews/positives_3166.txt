I don't write reviews at all but I'm just going to say that this is a very decent product to buy if you're not looking to spend hundreds of dollars on a mixer, phantom power supply, and pre amp for XLR mic recording. Because guess what this little thing has it all in one all for a low price! Cop you one!
