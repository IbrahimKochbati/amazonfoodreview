This is a very different sauce   nothing like anything you'll find in the grocery store. It's closer to the "botique" salsas that have recently appeared with the new "taco restaurant" trend. It's a little smokey. My picky 3 year old will eat a burrito with this on it. My family always had this (mild) on the table in Southern California and now that I've been transplanted in South Florida I am happy to mail order. You can get the little single serve pouches directly from the company, too.
