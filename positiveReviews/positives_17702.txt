If you're someone for whom heartburn or other digestive issues are a problem, but who also enjoys a good cup of Joe   this may be a great choice.          I'm usually not a big fan of French Roast, since it's a bit burned, but the low acidity of this coffee led me to a less bitter experience. Of course, preparing coffee at the proper temperature is a key to extracting the correct oils from the bean.          I liked the fact that this coffee comes in 3 ounce bags, perfect for a normal pot.
