I did like you probably did: read all the healthiness (gluten free, etc) and translated it to be 'tasteless yuck'. And then I opened one bar and looked at how...small it seemed and felt robbed.          I have never been quite so happy to be wrong!          These things are small because they are rich, dense and amazing and the taste is absolutely decadent.  This is a fantastic midafternoon snack that really feels like an indulgence!
