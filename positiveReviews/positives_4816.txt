Anyone who knows Yaucono will like the "new" packaging of mylar laminated plastic.  I wonder how long they packaged in layers of paper?          If you have not had this very rich Puerto Rican coffee, you must sample it and then buy in bulk.  Juan Valdez might have a good bean, but the Puerto Ricans do it better.
