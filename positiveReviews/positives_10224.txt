I have two dogs that require medication and after years of hiding pills in peanut butter, cheese, and cream cheese they finally outsmarted me.  I had heard about the pill pockets but they aren't available locally.... so I went online and gave them a try.  WOW is all I can say.  They are fooled and loving their new treat.  I am getting them the medication they need and it is so much easier.          I bought them in multiple sizes, both chicken and beef... they love them all.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
