This is a good spiced chai tea.  Not the best, but far from the worst.  It's one that I always keep on hand, and I love ordering it from Amazon because of the great price.  It's inexpensive enough that I don't mind using it for an iced tea too.  My favorite way to make it is with some sugar & hot water, then stir in a couple of spoonfuls of Nestle's Nido instant whole milk  delicious!  (I like the instant milk better than "real" fresh milk even.)  My other half usually prefers his minus the milk through some strange prejudice that milk or cream are not to be mixed with tea.          I highly recommend Lipton's Spiced Chai  there is NO medicinal taste like some other  ands, and the spices aren't as strong as my favorite  and (Bigelow), so its something that those who aren't as fond of spiced chai can enjoy.
