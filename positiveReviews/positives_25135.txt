We tried about 10 different kinds of dog food before discovering SmartBlend Lamb & Rice.  We tried Iams varieties, Science Diet varieties, Kibbles & Bits, Costco  and and Pro Plan.  Finally, a food our 40 pound shar pei   greyhound mix would eat that wouldn't give her awful gas.  Thanks so much Purina!
