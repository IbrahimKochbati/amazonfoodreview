I have a 12 1 2 year old Golden Retriever who has worn her teeth almost completely down.  The Barkster treats are very crunchy and yet very easy for her to chew as they  eak apart easily.  Also, due to less activity due to her arthritis, the Barksters are low in calories which is a big help.  I really am pleased to have found them available on Amazon.  Thank you.
