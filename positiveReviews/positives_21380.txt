My dog really loves the Stella and Chewy's freeze dried dog food. She ate her previous food a little at a time, all day long. I can give her a patty and it is gone in a matter of minutes, sometimes seconds.  Before I was worried she wasn't eating enough and now I am much more relieved knowing she is getting plenty to eat each day.
