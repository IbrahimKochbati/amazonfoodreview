I've been eating Nong Shim's noodles for years    I particularly like eating their Spicy Seafood udon style noodles (not 'instant' stuff like this).  Their products usually deliver on lots of flavor and a decent textured noodles.  This Spicy Chicken flavor bowl of noodle soup would be the first instant variety of their noodles I've tried.          The quality texture of the noodles is similar to that of the Nissin  and noodles (better than Maruchan).  What sets this apart is the soup base flavor pack which delivers a more complex flavor and IMO tastes much better by comparison.  Since they give you the soup base pack, it gives you the option to add as much or as little flavoring as you'd like (whereas Cup O' Noodles, you're usually stuck with however much they give you).  It has the usual dehydrated veggies.  Other reviewers mention that there are little chunks of chicken... Reading the ingredients, I don't see a single mention of chicken besides chicken  oth.          Whereas the typical Cup o' Noodle will deliver 2.25 oz of unhealthy goodness, these bowls of noodle delivers 3.03oz.  The bowl of noodles wasn't that filling    it'd be a perfect sized snack.  I don't know how they would conclude that this bowl would be equivalent to 2 servings.  The bowl delivers 380 calories (120 from fat), 14g of fat, 6g of saturated fat, 1780 mg of sodium, 56g of carbs, 2g of dietary fiber, and upwards of 2g of sugar, and 8g of protein.          On the packaging, it seems NongShim is trying to sell you on the product being healthy.  It touts "No MSG added," "30% less sodium than our regular product," "0g trans fat."  It has received some "2011 Chef's Best Award" and is "Endorsed by Professional Chefs."  Really?          If you're buying this, don't expect this to be your answer to a healthy diet.  That said, if all you want is a quick and tasty snack, then NongShim will deliver what you're looking for.
