I have used Walden Farms' products before. Indeed, one of my favorite salad dressings by them is the 'Bacon Ranch' calorie free, fat free and sugar free salad dressing (two tablespoons is a serving and has Zero calories).          That said, I found this particular product, the Walden Farms Sugar Free Thousand Island salad dressing, at a grocery store the other day: I loved it so much I returned and bought three more bottles.          Mind, it is not calorie or fat free: a serving (again, two tablespoons) has 40 calories with 4 grams of fat (zero saturated). However, it tastes, to me, so much like one of the 'premium' salad dressings (with much, much more fat, as well as sugar) that I feel the splurge is worth it.          I came here to Amazon to see if they had it cheaper, but I see that it is currently unavailable. I will keep an eye out for it.          Final note: Walden Farms products can range from 'ugh' to 'wow'. For instance, I love the Bacon Ranch calorie free dressing, yet hated the 'Ranch' (no bacon) calorie free dressing. With this company you simply must try everything at least once, and you are sure to find several items you will enjoy.
