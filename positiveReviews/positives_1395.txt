The reason why I ordered this on line is because the only Pop Chips they have in my store are the regular and salt and vinegar & barbeque.  I LOVE the sour cream and onion ones   actually I love ALL of them, but it's great to have them in the 100 calorie bag, because if they weren't I wouldn't be able to stop eating them.
