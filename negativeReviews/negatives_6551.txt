The "Sugar and Maple" label on the top and front of the box also states "Natural & Artificial Flavors," as does the ingredient list on the side of the box.          But "Artificial" is not mentioned in the Product Details or Ingredient list on the selling web page. Instead, there is a disclaimer that the ingredients may "differ."  That is deception.  Was that really necessary?          We don't buy ANYTHING with artificial flavors in it.          Quaker has a long reputation of excellence and should know better.
