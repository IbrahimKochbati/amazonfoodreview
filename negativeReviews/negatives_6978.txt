I read the other reviews and thought I would give this protein bar a try.  My taste buds must not be like the reviewers who liked this bar.  It was edible at best.  It has a smooth filling with an artificial taste and after taste. As one who started a weight watching quest with Tab in the early '60's (bad, bad after taste that still lingers 50 years later) I am willing to try a product on others recommendations. This one, though it has 20 grams of protein, is not worth a rebuy.  As I watch what I eat and look for low carb, high protein snacks, calories weren't key in this purchase.  If you want high protein and great taste, try the Questbar. It's like a rice crispy treat made from nuts.  thinkThin does make a very nice product in their thinkThin crunch bars.  I ordered the white chocolate dipped mixed nuts, and will keep on buying them.  I think they are crunchy and tasty.
