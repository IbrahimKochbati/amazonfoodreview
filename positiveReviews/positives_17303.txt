This product from "Annie Chun" is very good. For a "soup in a bowl" package, it has well packaged ingredients including "soft noodles",dehydrated veggies, and a flavor pack.  I found that it really became a whole meal when I added egg, shrimp, etc. It was delicious!  Only drawback is the price: its more than $2.00  per bowl.  I have tried other soup bowls from Amazon which have been about 70% less: they were also nowhere near as good  tasty as this product! If you can afford it, this is a great product.
