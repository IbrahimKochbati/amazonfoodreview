Product appears to work as advertized and my dog spends roughly 25 minutes chewing them. One major gripe is the inconsistently of the size of the large chews. There is just no excuse for some of these being less than half the size of others in the same bag. I paid for a bag of large chews and I expect large chews. Apparently no quality control exists or it doesn't matter to the company what size chew goes in what size bag.
