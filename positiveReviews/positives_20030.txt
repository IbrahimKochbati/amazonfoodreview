My son bought a package of the Jalapeno Potato Chips a couple weeks ago, and he and I have become addicted.          First, Kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc. than many other chips, as one peruses the dietary information.          Second, individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at them.          Third, the jalapeno has some kick (not overly hot, of course). Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat. But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would. Still, decent spicyness.          All in all, I have been pretty happy with this product, in the few weeks since we first bought it. I now purchase a package each week in my foray to the local grocery store. . . .
