I have never enjoyed my Keureg more!  They couldn't be easier to use and I'm so happy to be using my favorite coffee and making it to my own specifications.  Love these things!!          Additional comment:  In reading the reviews I see some complaints about leakage, etc... one trick I have come to rely on is NOT to fill the kup all the way to the top with the coffee.  You need to leave some room at t the top so that the lid isn't touching the coffee inside (maybe a little less than 1 2cm from the top rim).  When I follow this protocol, I get a perfect cup every time.  When I fill it too high, I end up with leakage.  The only problem is that I usually need a cup of coffee int he morning before I can follow my own instructions.
