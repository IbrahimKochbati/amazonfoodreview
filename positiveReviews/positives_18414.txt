These chips are very very good. The flavoring on them is the perfect bbq flavor. Unfortunately they leave you with terrible  eath (maybe don't eat them before going in for a kiss or talking in someone's face!).          They have an odd crisp that's unsettling at first, but if you give it a try, you get used to it, and will most likely enjoy it. You eat them expecting that crunch of a potato chip, but are greeted by something more airy. It's a pretty unique texture that's not much like what I've eaten before.          They are not baked or fried, but popped. Which means less calories and fat. They also seem to have the ability to fill me up even though the bag is small (smaller than most I think). So that is a double win.          I'd highly recommend trying these in store before investing in a big box of these unless you are adventurous (or generous enough to give away if they displease you)...but DO try them!
