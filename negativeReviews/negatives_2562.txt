I had high hopes for the convenience of this product.  My daughter LOVES hot chocolate. This really was a total disappointment.  I threw these kcups out.  If you use the smallest setting on your Keurig, you get 3 oz of watery hot chocolate.  Larger settings are not drinkable.          Save your money and get cocoa packets or a good tin of hot cocoa   and take advantage of the instant hot water the keurig provides.
