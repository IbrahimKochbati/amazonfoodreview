I can't give these a 5 because the ingredients show they are very processed.  I'm not sure how healthy they are.          But the taste is great   very hot    like about a nuclear on the Zaxby's scale.  If you like hot wings, you'll like these.  Be prepared to not be able to leave them alone.  When my husband buys a bag, we sit there and eat them until they are gone.  Also, have something to drink handy!
