I like this  and and the size of the cans. Leftover tuna is not good.  I disagree with the previous comments.  I do not think it is too fishy.  I would not compare it to cat food.  I have tried other  ands and dislike the over the top smell and the mushy textures.  I like Chicken of the Sea and buy it frequently.
