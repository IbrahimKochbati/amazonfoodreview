I'm an 82 year old male with a swollen prostate.  At night I was getting up every two hour to urinate.  This cornsilk tea cut my trips to the bathroom in half.  For me it was not enough by itself and I eventually started taking Avodart to shrink the prostate.  But I have found cornsilk tea helpful for the prostate.
