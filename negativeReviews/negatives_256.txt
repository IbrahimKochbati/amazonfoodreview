Even though the item says "Pack of 6," I only received one. I called them up to see where the other 5 were, and they said that Amazon put it incorrectly. Seriously?? They are issuing a refund, but still. I wanted 6, which is what the item says, and instead and only getting the 1. Should we just not trust what's on Amazon now???
