love the wolfgang puck restaurants,cookware, and endorsed products, all his  and products   cuisine are amazing, i am a loyal fan, yet this creme caramel coffee is tasteless, no real coffee flavor, no hint of caramel or creme, it  ews like a bit of steamed milk, that somewhat pasty tasteless feel on your palate. soooo dissapointed as i am such a loyal fan of all his  and, products. sadly,a waste of funds, did not return because i think food items are none refundable.
