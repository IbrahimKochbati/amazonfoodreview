I am a peanut butter fanatic, but it was hard to eat a lot of it & stay within my calorie limits for the day. I was looking for a substitute that wasn't going to taste nasty and leave a weird aftertaste & I cam across PB2! I love the simple peanuty taste & it goes great in smoothies & in yogurt as well. Love this on a piece of whole wheat toast!
