My young Keeshond puppy is a master of the Tug a Jug, but even my 10 year old Border Collie loves the thing!  She will play with it until every last bit of kibble is liberated.  After many hours of play, the jug is a bit scratched, but the rope remains intact.  My dogs do not chew the rope (or I would remove this toy and replace with something more appropriate). They seem to recognize that the rope is helpful in removing kibble from the jug.  Tug a Jug is definitely a hit!  It keeps my very busy puppy occupied for 45 60 minutes per refill.
