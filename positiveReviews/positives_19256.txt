I was really skeptical as to whether my Jack Russell Terrier would even bother with this type of toy. But I put it down for her the day I got it and she spent a good 45 minutes playing with it, retrieving the food, and me refilling so she could play some more. That's an incredible length of time for her to spend on one activity. I'll be getting some more toys like this I think.
