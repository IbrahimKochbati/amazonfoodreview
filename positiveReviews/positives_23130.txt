My son just started the gfcf diet due to severe intolerances to both.  We've been on the diet as a family so finding a good sandwich  ead has been a top priority for the past month and a half.  I've tried countless recipes in a cookbook I have as well as a couple of mixes and none of them were what I was looking for even though my 2 year old would eat them.  None of them were terrible just they didn't taste like the  ead I remembered.  My mother in law was kind enough to buy me this mix at the health food store near her house as mine only sold the big $15 bag mix which I didn't want to buy unless I knew we'd use it.  I am so glad she bought this!  I followed the  ead machine instructions.  Baked one night and let it cool while we all slept.  We had sandwiches for lunch the next day and boy was I surprised when the  ead actually tasted like BREAD!  I still have a few recipes I want to try out but this is definitely going to be a staple in our house!  Thank you Pamela's for gfcf  ead that actually tastes like  ead!  It's a lifesaver!
