It appears that the coffee is not very consistent with the flavor. My first experience with this coffee was a good one, smooth rich flavor. This box is so bitter that neither myself or my wife will drink it.          I tried the coffee again this morning, just bad, very bitter. I normally like most coffees, this one is exceptionally bad. I must have received a bad batch, it seems that the batches are very inconsistent. I tried to send my coffee back to Amazon, no return policy fo coffee.
