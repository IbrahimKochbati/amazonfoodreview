I've been using these chews for years now and they truly do what they say they do. I have all my dogs using them except for 2 pomeranians that have allergies. Those are the only 2 that have to have their teeth done yearly at the vet. The others teeth stay white and tartarless!     The HEXtra chews seem to work better for my dogs than the regular CET chews, but regular do a suitable job, just have to take them in now and then for a cleaning.
