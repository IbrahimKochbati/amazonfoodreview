I had been reading about echinacea for ages, but I finally decided to try it when I got sick. In addition to drinking tons of water, resting and taking vitamins I've been drinking this tea and I feel tons better. And I read some reviews about the taste   personally I love the taste! It tastes so good I want to start drinking it on a regular basis. It's a nice hot drink to have in the morning instead of coffee and it's tons better for you!          I always make my tea with sugar and cream. I don't know how others make it   but adding sugar and cream makes it taste more like a drink than a tonic (which most teas taste like).
