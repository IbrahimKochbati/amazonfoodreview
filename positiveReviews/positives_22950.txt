I got the Mystic Morning flavor, and if this is what a medium roast from this  and tastes like, I wonder how deep their dark roasts go. It's a  acing flavor profile in the morning, the kind of coffee that'll put hair on your chest. If you want your coffee strong enough to get up and walk away on its own, this is for you. Bear in mind though that an 8 oz pack will not go very far.
