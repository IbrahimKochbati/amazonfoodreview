My golden|yellow lab mix was adopted from the shelter with a number of health issues including severe malnutrition, a pretty bad skin condition, and chronic  inflammation of the feet and face.  We placed him on an elimination diet and found that he was allergic to chicken, turkey and beef.  I use the ZiwiPeak, fish and pork as the main sources of protein for his diet. He loves the venison over the other flavors and has put on 40 healthy pounds and his skin and allergy issues have pretty much been cleared up.          The food is not the hard dried fare, but small moist squares.  It offered a good option for a balanced meal and you cannot beat the convenience of the pouch.  I would recommend refrigeration after opening.
