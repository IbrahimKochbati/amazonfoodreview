At first I was disappointed by the size of my three ounce sample of the Puroast Low Acid Coffee. Would I be able to form an opinion with such a small amount?  Yes, Yes, Yes, definitely yes.          Upon opening the envelope I was overwhelmed by the aroma and checked the envelope again to make sure I hadn't opened a package of loose tobacco. The  ewed coffee didn't smell any better as the kitchen was filled with a smell like a dirty ashtray. The taste is not better. I dutifully drank three cups so I could give it a fair assessment, and the last cup tasted as bad as the first. I even added a spoonfull of chocolate powder to the last cup to make it palatable. That only helped marginally.          I'm a long time, daily coffee drinker, and this may be the worst tasting coffee I've ever had. It may be low acid and make one's tummy feel better, but it's a big price to pay for the comfort. Now I'm disappointed that I still have a little of this stuff left. Definitely don't recommend this flavor.          Why didn't I give this foul tasting  ew one star? I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt because evaluating taste is a subjective thing, and after all there is that low acid factor to consider.
