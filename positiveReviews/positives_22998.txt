I found this tasty candy on vacation, but alas there are some drawbacks to small town shopping.  That's why I was happy to find these available on Amazon. It is a very strong flavor, not sugared up for general consumption.  If you're a fan of the instense flavors found in Altoids, you'll appreciate Chimes.  The peanut butter may cut the bitterness of ginger, but in no way distracts from the intense flavor.  And when the candy is gone, you have a nifty tin for sewing notions, little bits of hardware, or any sundry of small things in need of a sturdy box in which to hold them.
