I purchased these with the intent to make vanilla extract. The bean arrived in a timely manner, and were in a vacuum sealed plastic bag. They didn't smell super 'vanilla y' when they arrived, but I can attest that they were soft and pliable   maybe too pliable and greasy though. Almost immediate of being immersed in it's vodka home, the beans left an oily residue on the top of the glass bottles. The grease has not necessarily gotten worse, but it has some type of oily smell that distracts from the richness of the vanilla. Any one else have this problem?
