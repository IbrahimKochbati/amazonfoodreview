Thought I was getting a really good buy on these until I read the label. The dosage amount of Glucosamine Chondroitin is vague. It appears I need to give my dog an entire bag to get him 500 mg of glucosamine. Too expensive for me. The dogs love them, so if you want to give them an expensive treat they'll love, go for it. If you are trying to get a preventative dose of glucosamine in a treat look elsewhere.
