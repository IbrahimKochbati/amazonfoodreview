Unfortunately, bunnies love it, too, so we are having to grow this batch of cat grass indoors.  The cats love this stuff:  just put it where they can reach it and they will "go to town" on it, munching it all up.  It does not make them behave erratically, like catnip does, so don't worry about that.  You don't have to do anything to these seeds other than press them into some moist soil and water when the soil starts to become dry and crumbly.  That's it!  A nutritious treat for your cats!
