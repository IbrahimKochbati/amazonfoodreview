My yorkies absolutely love this food.  Originally, I purchased this product because it was free of ingredients that would cause allergies.  Subsequently, I have learned that my dogs do not have food allergies but I kept them on ZiwiPeak because of its high quality content and delicious taste.  It is very expensive but I believe my yorkies are more than worth it.  I highly recommended this product to any dog owner who wants the best food for their pet.
