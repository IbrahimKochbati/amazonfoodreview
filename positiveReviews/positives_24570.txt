We love pumpkin soup and eat it year round, not just during "pumpkin season".  And I make a pumpkin macaroni and cheese that even company raves about.  Normally I wouldn't serve mac and cheese to company, but this particular recipe is definitely 5 star quality. (I do not make pumpkin pie   don't like it.)          I was really happy to find this  and on Amazon in 2011 for half of the price I pay through my food club when the product is on special sale.....and about 1 3 of the price that is charged when it's not on sale.          It's really good pumpkin.  My original review gave this pumpkin only 4 stars because at that time it didn't come in a BPA free can.  It is now October, 2012 and I recently received a second case from Amazon and was delighted to read "BPA FREE" on the label.          Thanks, Farmers Market, for caring about our health!  You earned your 5th star.          The pumpkin is still a very good price now in 2012 IF you order it in the "frustration free packaging" from Amazon, but only slightly less than my food club.  But, hey, pennies count!
