Just a few observations here: 1) We have a small chihuahua. These are way too big for her. We basically have to crush them to crumbs for her to eat them. Otherwise she carries them and hides them like bones, and, trust me, it's no fun to find to find a slobbery lamb barley biscuit under your pillow when you go to bed! 2) What the heck is barley doing in a dog treat? It doesn't seem to me that dogs were designed to graze in barley fields, so why are we feeding them barley? 3) My dog seemed to really enjoy the flavor, so these at least have that going for them.
