Upon opening the package I thought that the tea had absolutely no aroma and looked old as if it was sitting somewhere in an open container for months.  After  ewing, it revealed a bland taste at best.  It was like drinking  ewed hay.  I checked the expiration date which is two years from now.  Maybe I had a bad batch but it's going back.  I had a better experience with Rishi Organic Jasmine Pearl Loose Leaf Tea.  I do not recommend this tea to anyone.
