There is nothing like fresh roasted chestnut.  But when these are not available, the French roasted chestnuts that come in a jar are typically the second best alternative but cost more than two and a half time these and do not have single serve packages.  These are the best alternative for a quick snack.  The drawback:  They are smaller, very dark and look very unappetizing although the taste is fine, but the only thing that makes me yearn for the French chestnuts is their moisture content.  Either the manufacturer is roasting these incompletely so they weigh more roasted than the French equivalent, or they must have problem with the manufacturing technique, or pack them while warm, increasing the moisture content in the bag.  At time they can be even sticky to the fingers.  Would I buy them again? Yes.  If money was no issue would I buy them? No.  I would buy the French roasted chestnuts in the glass jars. Better yet, I would have a maid roast them for me and peal them. LOL
