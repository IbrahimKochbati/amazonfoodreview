I recently joined the dinner of the month club and I am so glad I did! It may be the best gift I've ever given myself:) My entire family reaps the benefits because it is a treat for everyone, no matter age or gender. We always look forward to the arrival of a new and exciting pasta in the mail every month. We even have a tradition now in our house that we all cook dinner together on "pasta night" and enjoy a savory dish provided by the dinner club.     It is so easy to make an impressive dinner with dinner club because they even send recipes to go along with their noodles and sauces! I recently received the Vegan Pumpkin pasta fettuccine paired with the Butternut Squash with Parmesan Cheese. I also got the Italian Spice Linguini with the Organic Roasted Garlic sauce. Even just boiling the noodles warms your home with a delicious fragrance. Everything I have ever received from Flying Noodle has always been of the highest quality. I have friends over to play dominoes every Tuesday night and I always  ag about my Flying Noodle packages. They have tried most of my dishes and always want to know where they can get the noodles and sauces at our local grocery store. There is just nothing like it that you can buy from the store, I have since gotten all of my domino friends on Flying Noodle  dinner of the month club.     I definitely know where to go to do my Christmas shopping this year! There is something for everyone and I know I can trust Flying Noodle to deliver the best quality of products to my loved ones.
