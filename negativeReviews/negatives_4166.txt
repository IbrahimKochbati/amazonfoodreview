Consistency   good.     Value   bad.     Taste   not good, but bearable.     Smell   awful.          I think I'll try the natural PB rather than resort to this expensive, stinky, messy powder.  If it were cheap, maybe I'd force myself to eat it, but there's no way I'm paying a premium for this stuff.  I am trying to find ways to cut back on fat & calories, but this isn't going to be it.  I was actually surprised at how bad I thought it was considering all the glowing reviews.
