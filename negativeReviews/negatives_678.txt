These things are NOTHING like Oreos.You think wow Oreos. Think again. I would say spend your money on something better (the Hershey's or Reese's crisp wafer bars come to mind). My honest view on these "thin crisps" cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer, or milk bones.
