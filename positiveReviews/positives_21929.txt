Long, long ago in a galaxy far away known as college, I spent a summer in Turkey and discovered cardamon. Life interfered her and in the states it wasn't as easy to get and when I did see it at the store it was pricey. Having bought it to indulge myself and make Christmas Spiced Hot Chocolate to give as gifts. I will now buy it at almost any price! This is so good!! I've added it to carrots, to sweet potatoes, sprinkled on my popcorn and this morning as I make homemade doughnuts cardamon is going in! It's spicy and sweet yet has a bite. It's wonderful!
