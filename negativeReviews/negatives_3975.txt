I really like the Froose  and and am a huge fan of the gummy snacks, but the juice just leaves a little to be desired. I find it to be very thick and syrupy, which is probably due to the use of rice sugar and other wholesome organic ingredients. Perhaps younger children wouldn't mind this texture and they would be able to suck it down and reap the benefits of the fiber and nutrients without knowing any better. Overall I'm going to stick with the gummies, but I look forward to more products coming out from Froose as healthy alternatives to some really bad options in the supermarket.
