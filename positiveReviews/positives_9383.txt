I have been giving this to my dog every day for about 2 years because he has a patella problem. His limping has completely stopped as a result, not to mention he cries for it! Definitely his favorite treat by far. I was spending more than 1 3 the price at the local pet store for just one pack! I should have checked Amazon sooner! This is an amazing price. I will be buying this here exclusively from now on.
