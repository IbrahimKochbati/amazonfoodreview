I've been putting cheese and peanut butter and whatnot on Ritz Crackers for my entire life. I liked Ritz Bits, which are good. (Ever had a chocolate covered peanut butter Ritz Bitz? Mmmm. Good cracker!) Well, now Kraft has come out with a more grown up premade Ritz   Ritz Crackerfuls.          Shaped like a snack bar, this one ounce snack cracker comes in at 140 calories (60 from fat) or 18 grams of carbs. It has a great taste, with the sweetness of the chocolate and the savoriness of the peanut butter. It is really delicious, not too sweet, but not too peanut buttery (if you know what I mean). This Peanut Butter and Chocolate Crackerful makes a great afternoon snack, being close enough to the 100 calorie mark for me, and being delicious and satisfying (some 100 calorie snacks only seem to whet my appetite!). I like it!
