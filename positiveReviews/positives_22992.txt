I'm a health nut so I love cooking with EVOO or eat it raw with rye  ead. It's great for both your insides and outsides. I could go on and on about the good things evoo is but I must state that I have acne prone skin and literally tried everything on the market. I used evoo and a little bit of lemon juice as a moisturizer, a simple soap free cleanser, and my skin has improved so much! Who knew the most simple things can be lifesavers, especially on my wallet. :D
