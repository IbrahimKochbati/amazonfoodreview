If Keurig  ewers were evaluated by this particular K Cup, Keurig would be out of business. Wolfgang Puck   French Roast Melange Francais is inexcusably terrible coffee. Aroma hints of singed oak leave and the top note is simply bitter.  Mid taste is like the bottom ounces of a days old Kwiki Mart carafe.  Mouth feel is harsh and leaves an appalling coating. The after taste leads one to immediately  ush ones teeth.  I simply couldn't believe my Keurig was capable of making such a bad cup of coffee, so I tried again a week later with same results. I use average to good filtered water and have no problems with other  ands like Green Mountain, Tulleys, nor Emeril's. Everyone I know that has a Keurig learned of it via word of mouth or a shared cup. Usually the results are stunning, and the Keurig invasion lives on.  When I share I'll stick with offering The Coffee Peoples' Black Tiger or Jet Fuel. Now I have 22 more WP FR K cups sitting in the bottom draw of my china cabinet to get rid of. Let me know if you want them, as I'd be embarrassed to even give them away.  Sorry Wolfgang, but what the Puck   your French Roast is unpardonably horrible, and at K cup prices I'll not be duped again. I'll stay away from any of the other WP offerings.
