Oh my God, this is the best gluten free  ead I've had in 12 years since my diagnosis.  That includes home made  ead, disastrous flops from my  eadmaker, down to the store bought  eads that taste like cardboard. It looks like real  ead, smells like  ead, tastes good (OK, fresh wheat  ead from a bakery tastes better...) and you can even slice it thin.            This  ead doesn't disintegrate into a handful of crumbs.  (Till now, I always had to eat a GF sandwich hunched over the sink to catch the crumbs.)  It makes great sandwiches, toast, cinnamon toast, toasted cheese sandwiches, BLT's, etc.  I even made a hamburger bun out of some of the dough.  The only failure so far was French Toast: it didn't absorb much of the egg and milk mixture.          For Easter, I made a turkey with gluten free stuffing and gravy.  It was heaven on earth!  The whole family loved it, even though I was only Celiac in the bunch.          I never bought this in the health food store because it was so expensive.  It's very affordable on Amazon prescheduled delivery.  I've been using Pamela's Baking mix for many years.  It's awesome.
