This was the first time I tried purchasing a food product over the internet, and as feared I was sent something other than what was pictured.          This package contains Chia Seed POWDER, which I assume is ground up seed (or the remainder from packaging whole seeds) that you have no way of identifying whether or not has additional filler.          Not going to bother returning a $7 product, but just disappointed when the page advertises whole seeds.
