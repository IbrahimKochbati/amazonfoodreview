I was out to dinner with friends & family at "The Saloon" in "Rte 46 Entertainment Complex" in Sanford FL. Besides having an awesome staff (ask for Keith) and fabulous food (the escargot is a MUST) they serve China Mist tea. This is the 1st time I chose the Tropical Organic Green    I have no doubt it is the best flavored tea I have ever had.
