Agree with the reviewers who pointed out this is too watery, acidic, and tomatoe y. It doesn't taste like beef at all. It's a little sweet from the tomato, not in a good way. I think it's a problem with all Happy Baby foods I've tried  they are all sweet, maybe to appeal to baby's tastes. This works well for the fruits and veggies, but not so much for the meat and chicken. I want my baby to eat savory food too! The texture was not appealing  very mushy with some quinoa globs. Again, where's the meat? I guess I'll stick with the fruit pouches, and make my own baby meats, which my girl loves.
