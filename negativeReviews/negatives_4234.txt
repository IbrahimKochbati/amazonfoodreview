Like the other reviewers wrote, GNATS!!!! I first noticed little clear worms in my soil, and soon I had little black flies buzzing around. I tried everything I could to get rid of them, including drenching the soil with chamomile tea (I know that moist soil helps them, but chamomile is supposed to kill the larvae), but last night I found more larvae in my pot! I sprinkled the surface with cinnamon, which I read helps, but I have little faith. One of my pots a strange green moss like thing growing across the surface. I've since bought cheapo stuff that has no problem with bugs or moss! I didn't think I had to look up reviews for something like potting soil from a reputable company like Miracle Gro, but obviously I was wrong. Stay away!!!
