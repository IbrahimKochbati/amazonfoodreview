I often buy Costo's Lamb & Rice dog food; Costco used to carry Purina One and I bought Purina from Costco; now they no longer carry Purina. The ingredients of Costo's and Purina's appear to be much the same. However, my Siberian Husky prefers Purina; so, whenever I run out of dog food and going out to Costco is a hassle, I will spend more and get Purina.
