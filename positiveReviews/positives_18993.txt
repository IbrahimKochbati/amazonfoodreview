I decided to try these in the hopes of finding a good organic and sugarless option.  These are wonderful!  I tried both the Pomegranate and Cherry flavors, and like them both.  Instead of sugar, these are sweetened with cane juice.  This adds a very slight flavor note, which enhances the appeal, giving these a bit more complexity and interest than the typical sugary sweet hard candies.  The fruit flavor is definitely predominant and comes through loud and clear.  These last a long time, don't burn the roof of my mouth (like some hard candies do), and don't seem to get soft and sticky after residing in my purse for a while, like most hard candies do.  These are a standard item in my household now!
