Admittedly, I am a bit skeptical about gluten free products. Most pale in comparison to the 'real' version they are trying to mimic. While this cookie mix probably couldn't go head to head with 'real' cookies per most peoples' standards, it certainly does for me. The mix is fool proof and easy enough for children to make  you don't need an electric mixer at all  just mix by hand. You can add extra goodies too, though they are already very generous with the chocolate chunks. Walnuts or your favorite nut or fruit makes awesome additions.          As for flavor, these guys are  tasty . I really like the cocoa in the mix and although there's actually not a whole lot of sugar in them (6 g of sugar per cookie is  nothing  compared to other mixes and premade cookies), the cookies are very sweet. I've made, and served, them to regular cookie eaters (who are not gluten free) and everyone has loved them.          You can make these cookies more interesting by substituting coconut oil (which is full of 'good' fat and MCTs) for the butter. Do so at your discretion though   I love the taste (especially when combined with macadamia nuts), but it is certainly a subjective area. Also, as a warning, the cookies come out pretty crumbly if baked for the time specified on the packaging. I did not cook mine for the entire time suggested and remove them from the pan shortly after removing them from the oven. This has prevented any sticking and crumbling issue.          All in all, I really like this mix and hope everyone who can't eat 'normal' cookies enjoys it too!
