I purchased a bunch of easy and quick microwave meals that I could take with me to work for lunch without the need for a refrigerator. This appeared to fit the bill, so I bought a six pack!          Pros:     1) Easy cooking   Very easy to cook, finished in under four minutes, and requires no additional materials (except about a cup of water).     2) healthy   is fairly healthy (all things considered).     3) Contains meat   this is a debatable pro, however I've found it difficult to actually find microwave meals (that require no refrigerator freezer) that contain meat. This does, although not very much...     4) Acceptable serving size   given that the base of the dish is rice, the serving size is acceptable for a light lunch. I certainly feel full for most of the afternoon if I eat this meal with an extra snack during my lunch hour.          Cons:     1) low average flavor taste   I've definitely had better microwave meals (even microwave easy mac beats this). I usually love sweet and sour, but this flavor profile tastes more like an artificial pineapple flavor fused with minute rice. I will not be re purchasing this item solely based on it's poor execution of flavor.     2) Uneven rice texture   The base of this dish is quick cook rice, and the method that Healthy Choice chose was basically rehydration of cooked rice in a microwave. The result is unevenly cooked rice with either too firm or too soft texture.     3) Very sparse serving of veggies meat   despite the fact that this meal contains veggies meat, the size of the serving is very sparse. Whether it was to cut production cost or to cut caloric cost, the result is a very meager portion of flavored rice with bits of processed chicken veggies.          All in all, this meal has some pros that I was really looking for in no fridge to go meals, but the cons just outweigh them too much. I won't be purchasing again.
