Everything about this treat is Great for my Dane: quality healthy ingredients, size & ease of tearing into smaller pieces for training, texture is moist but not greasy or crumbly, smell is excellent to me and my Dane, they are not a heavy treat so you get a lot in the bag without crumbs in the bottom. Will buy more!
