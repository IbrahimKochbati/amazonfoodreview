I bought both the rice and oatmeal 6 packs.  The cans clearly state they use Life's DHA (manufactured by Martek).  If you research Martek (including their own site), you will find that they use hexane to extract the DHA from algae.  Shame on Happy Baby for lying to parents by saying that they do not use any DHA extracted with hexane.  Will never reccommend this product to anyone.          Also, all the cans that I opened smelled rancid.  I prefer Gerber Organic with Smart Nourish instead.
