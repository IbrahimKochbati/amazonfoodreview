This stuff is great.  It will mess you up and it tastes great.  What me and my friends like to do is combine this vodka with root beer, it tastes just like a root beer float.  Or orange soda, which makes it taste like creamsicle.  It's kind of expensive compared to other vodkas.  But if you like sweets like me and want to get a little drunk...then try this vodka.
