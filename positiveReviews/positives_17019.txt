I purchased this product hoping that the "bullet proof like material" would last longer than the other toys I'd purchased for my 8 month old lab. He's a chewer, and within an hour had the rubber rope gnawed in two. But someone posted a photo of the modification they made post rope that saved the day: inserting a tennis ball into the bottle. AMAZING IDEA! Whom ever came up with that should write the company and suggest the modification. He can't get through the bottle, and the ball blocks the hole enough to where he really has to try to get the treat out. It is loud, but this is the first toy to survive my lab. If it's lab proof, I'm sure it can survive anything!
