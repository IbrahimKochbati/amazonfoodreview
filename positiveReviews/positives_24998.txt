I chew lots of gum, especially when I'm on a diet.     I recommend this gum over SPRY.  If you ask which is better,     I would say this gum wins hands down.  I can even blow bubbles with gum     while with Spry you can't.          Hope this helps if you have to weigh the purchase between the two items.
