I am sorry to say I had trouble with the cups themselves. Each time I used them, my machine would say "decalcify" which I did the first time. When I used them the 2nd and 3rd times, the problem occurred again. I was able to clear the hot water spout with a toothpick, which remedied the problem. I will not use them again, though, because I don't want to have to do that after every use.
