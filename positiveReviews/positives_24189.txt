Most of them are sour, but some sweet. These Lem Wat ones are sour. But great. Some of the best candy I've ever devoured. My box was gone in 20 seconds. I will be getting these some time next week!          You should get some too. You will stay in the cupboards that they reside in! ^_~b          They are a classic candy that will satisfy a sweet tooth in a second.          I love them! My favorite is Lemonade   Watermelon.          MMMMMMmmmmmm!          5 stars.
