Fish has that all important DHA that helps  ain and eye development so I went looking for a baby food with fish. I was so excited to find WILD CAUGHT salmon in a baby food (wild caught salmon does not have the mercury content other fish have)! Plus it has other super foods such as lentils, sweet potatoes, and carrots! But all this goodness is only good if baby will eat it and she gobbled it right up!!
