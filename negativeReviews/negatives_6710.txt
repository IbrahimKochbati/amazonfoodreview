I'm a big popcorn fan and have tried many  ands. I tried this one because the best, BKH popcorn has gone out of business. I like the hullless kind and they not only had the best but the largest popped kernels. In addition to that on the average 99% popped. The Black Jewel had like 25% not popped and anymore then 2 min in the microwave made it burn. The popped kernels were very small, hardly nothing to eat. The flavor was good but certainly not worth ever buying again. If anyone knows the BKH  and and can suggest one like it let me know.
