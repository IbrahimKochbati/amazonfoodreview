I HATE SUCRALOSE.          Honestly, I don't know how other people CAN'T taste it when it's in sweetened products. It's got this unpleasant fake flavor that I just can't ignore. I think any company that uses that junk should be required by law to indicate it on their box and all advertising.          That being said, it seems like this hot cocoa has less sucralose than the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa, and as such I have to give it higher marks than the competition.          Still, I can't believe this product AND its nearest competitor use sucralose but don't say they're a diet, lite, low sugar, or otherwise unnaturally sweetened product. It's frustrating. I can taste the stuff, and I really dislike it. I also don't like the chemical makeup of sucralose, but I won't go into that here (just believe me: natural sugar is way better for you in the long run).          There's one other choice out there for a hot cocoa in a K Cup, and that's Swiss Miss. Unfortunately, the Swiss Miss K Cups are ridiculously high priced and hard to find.          My opinion? It's probably better if you just get your favorite hot cocoa in packets, and use the hot water function of your Keurig. It's not worth the K Cup convenience if you have to put up with artificial sweeteners or significantly higher prices. Spending more than seventy five cents per cup of water based hot cocoa is about the limit for me.          So, if you're into sucralose Splenda, then by all means grab this and enjoy that weird aftertaste and decidedly not sugar flavor. If you're like me, though, and can't stand that artificial stuff, then avoid this product and find another option.          Three stars for tasting decent despite the awful artificial sweetener. Minus two stars for being artificially sweetened and not mentioning it anywhere.          UPDATE:  I just found out that the Swiss Miss K Cups also use sucralose. So really, your only choice is to get packets and use your Keurig as a hot water dispenser. How disappointing.          UPDATE 02 12: After some research, I found that there is one K Cup hot cocoa that doesn't have sucralose; However, it is loaded with fructose instead (not the greatest trade off, since it tastes different from sugar sucrose, in my opinion) and has no actual sugar sucrose in it. That one is Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa. Unfortunately, reviews of it say it has a strong coconut flavor (probably because the second ingredient is coconut oil) and is on the salty side, so I have avoided it. It's also more expensive per cup, and unless you think a single cup of cocoa is worth over a dollar and twenty five cents (as opposed to a box of 12 packets being around two dollars) then go ahead and try it. I will refrain at this point and stick to using packets.          I would also like to clarify again that despite what some comments say, the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa K Cups, Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa K Cups, and Grove Square Hot Cocoa K Cups ALL use sucralose. Yes, there is sugar in some of those, but it is IN ADDITION TO sucralose Splenda, and not by itself.          So your choices right now are pure sucralose, sucralose plus a sugar, or pure fructose. None of them is appetizing to me, and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasant.          43 servings of sugar sweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks, and it's no more complicated than a K Cup if you know how to operate a spoon.
