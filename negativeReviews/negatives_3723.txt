I was rather dissapointed with this product. I've had Lavazza before and remember it being more flavorful. This was very mild. It may be because it was old stock. The "Best If Used by" date on the bag was 7 months ago. I won't order it again through Amazon for fear that somebody it just getting rid of their old stock through mail order. I'll find a more reputable store.
