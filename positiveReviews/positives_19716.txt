And it's a good surprise!  I was cautious, expecting either something with no resemblance to meat, or something so rubbery as to be inedible.  Sure, the texture is not EXACTLY like real jerky, it's a bit liquidy for that.  But for a vegan product, outstanding!  It's chewy without being rubbery, far juicier than real jerky(which is a good thing), and tastes spot on.  Granted, the Texas BBQ doesn't taste the way I'd thought it would(I was expecting a tomato y BBQ sauce flavor), but it's very good, with just the right amount of smoke.  I can't wait to try more flavors!
