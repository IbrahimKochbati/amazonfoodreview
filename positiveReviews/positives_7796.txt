The Lowery's Original and Hot & Spicy Pork Rinds are great.  I can take them with me on trips, pop them in the microwave and have a great late night snack and I do not have to be concerned about carbs.  I would highly recommend any one who like pork rinds to give them a try and be ready for a surprise when they come out of the microwave. The price from Amazon was very good and it was delivered in a couple of days.          Steve Puente          P.S.
