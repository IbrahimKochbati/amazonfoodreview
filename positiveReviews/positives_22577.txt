I can't say enough good stuff about this popcorn.  It is the best tasting popcorn I've ever had. I've ordered it twice (both times from Amazon) and have not been disappointed by it in any way.  After popping, there are very few unpopped kernels and it comes prepackaged with just the right amount of salt.  The oil gives it a unique taste.  If you have a 4oz popper, buy this popcorn.  It is simply amazing.
