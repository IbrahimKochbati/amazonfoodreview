Boy howdy, is this stuff good or what! Let me tell y'all this is easily the best ginger ale available on the market, bar none. Sure, you get the benefits of having zero sugar and zero artificial sweetners, thanks to stevia. But the taste is where it's at: this product strikes exactly the right balance between packing a punch of ginger taste to avoid the bland, stale flavor all too common in ginger ale and yet stops short of being the too strong attack commonly found in batch  ewed ginger beers.          You're gonna love it. It has a crisp, definitive ginger taste without being overpowering. The sweetness level is just right, but without any of the bad stuff. Delicious!
