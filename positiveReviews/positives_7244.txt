I love this product! BUT the downside is that I was overcharged. When I saw that the cost of this product was $10.00 I assumed that it meant $10.00 for a case. When I received only one can, I was stunned to say the least. A few days ago I happened upon this product at a grocery store. The 8.1 oz was $1.29. I am hereby requesting my change back!!!!!!  Rumford is one of the best baking powders presently on the market!!!  I like the fact that it's aluminum free.  Hence, I will be purchasing this product from the grocery store.
