We have a 30 lb Doberman Pinscher mix puppy that is about 5 months old who absolutely loves this toy!  Because we knew he was going to be a bigger dog, we opted for the medium large size, which for his current size, is a little big for him now.  But he manages fine with it, plus I like that he can't throw the toy in the air like he does with so many of his other toys.          We've had this toy for about a month now and use it at least 4 5 times a week.  Initially, our dog was a little slow in understanding the concept and wasn't very interested in it.  But after a few days, he got the idea and now gets excited whenever he sees us filling it up.  We usually fill the container with a mix of his kibble and some cut up treats for a total of about a 1 4 of a cup and it keeps him occupied for about 30 45 minutes at a time.  We haven't tried adding balls to the jug yet to increase the difficulty, but we may do so soon.          This toy has been a savior to help occupy him while we are busy trying to do things around the house, such as cook dinner or do laundry.  I also give it to him to prevent boredom as well as help get rid of some excess energy that he still may have at night since he will push, drag, and carry it all over the place as he is trying to get out the contents.  After a month of use, the only thing that has some signs of wear and tear is the rope.  Our puppy hasn't done any damage to the actual jug yet.          On a side note, I have seen the smaller ones in the store that have rubber plastic ropes, which do not seem to be very durable, but ours was an actual rope, as in the picture and has held up great with our dog.  We have been so pleased with this product, that we bought the smaller one for a family member's new puppy.
