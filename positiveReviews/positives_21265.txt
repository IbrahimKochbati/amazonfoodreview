Every chocolate manufacturer will have a chocolate that can go with every season and satisfy the taste buds of all generations. Well Lindt has this chocolate which tastes absolutely awesome and goes with any occassion. You can either get the milk chocolate or go for the assorted one which has dark and other cocoa variations of chocolates. There is a myth that Lindt has liquor in all of its chocolates which is not so   Most Lindt in USA will only have cocoa liquor. Dark chocolates with whisky and other liquor variants are normally available from European markets   I got it few days back   available in Amazon. An amazing chocolate that melts so much in your much and makes you go crazy over its taste. In my opinion, truffles are the best chocolates Lindt has ever made over these years. Affordable price has mentioned at Amazon   you don't get that many deals for these stufss as these are preferred round the year. You may also smaller gift boxes that has around 20 truffles   you can also mix and match based on your prefernce
