This product seems to be torturous for my dog.  She sees the treats inside, but being such a small dog, even the "small" sized bottle is too big for her to thrash around and get the treats out. I love how busy it keeps her, but in the end, I have to take a treat or two out for her because she can't do it on her own.  Probably better for bigger dogs.
