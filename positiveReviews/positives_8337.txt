This is a great Tea. I use a french press to make my Tea. A lot of people use a coffee maker, And I have too in the past.     I have found that if you use a french press and hot water from your water dispenser and let it steep as per the instructions this will be the best tea you have had in a long time. Don't take my word for it TRY IT.
