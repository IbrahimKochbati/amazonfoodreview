I love this stuff. It's not your regular milk chocolate hot cocoa, but if you like trying different flavors of cocoa, you should give this a try.  To me it tastes like dark chocolate and isn't as sweet as the regular stuff. But it has a great taste and it's actually good for you. Highly recomend it.
