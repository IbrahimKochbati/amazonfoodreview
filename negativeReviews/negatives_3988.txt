It is a shame WHEN YOU ADD SUGAR AS A PRIMARY INGREDIENT IN THE FIRST 5 ITEMS! Being allergic to gluten, doesn't mean a person is NOT ADDICTED TO SUGAR! Sugar is the number one substance that manufacturers LOAD UP ON and place in the top ingredients when they omit so called allergies, like gluten. I AM SICK AND TIRED OF NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE WHEAT FREE GOODS and being forced to take in sugar. I AM ADDICTED TO SUGAR, AS WELL ARE MILLIONS OF US! stop replacing what could be valuable gluten free foods with sugar       AND SUGAR IS KNOWN BY OTHER NAMES and is the same:; maltodextrin, sucrose, sucralose, dextrose, dextrin, ORGANIC SUGAR (that's a joke, sugar is sugar!)
