I Loooove peanut better and this ersatz butter tastes pretty good to me and has 0 cholesterol. Nevertheless, because of its high calorie count and high price, I can stretch the rating to only 3 stars. Yes, the taste is good but, in order to get a 2 tablespoon serving, you need at least 6 tablespoons of the powder mixed with 3 tablespoons of water. Otherwise, 2 tablespoons of the powder mixed with 1 of water will yield only about 1.5 teaspoons of spreadable "peanut butter"   Barely enough to coat half a slice of  ead. And so...one serving (2 tablespoonsful) of the mixture ends up being 135 calories  not 45 calories which is the count for 2 tablespoons of the powder. If you're counting calories and pennies, you might as well get the regular peanut butter for less than half the price of the dry stuff.
