I got this when a trainer recommended that I find ways to make life more entertaining for my dog. Apparently dogs find working for their dinner to be entertaining. It actually is really great. I just unscrew the bottom, pour the kibble in, and then my dog spends the next 20 30 minutes getting it out. And he does seem entertained   I think eating his food slower makes him feel fuller too. I mix this up with a couple of other kibble dispensers so he doesn't get too used to just one way   then it would be boring again. One warning   the med large is really good. My friend has a small and a full cup of kibble fits easily into it. Unless you are feeding your dog a lot, you probably don't need the big one.
