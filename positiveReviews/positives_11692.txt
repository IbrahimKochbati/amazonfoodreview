I have bought and tried so many different Gluten Free food products in the last several years and after finding quite a few enjoyable Pamela's Products, I finally stumbled upon their newer Whenever Bars and the Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Coconut taste so incredibly good, I sometimes can't believe they really are gluten free!  If you have been at a loss for a great quick  eakast bar or an on the go protein snack bar that are gluten free and delicious, then you owe it to yourself to buy and try these and you will not regret the decision.
