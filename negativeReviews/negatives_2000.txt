...or the good reviewers' taste buds are weak.  This is some disappointingly     weak coffee.  I'm not some crazy "gotta have my jet black sludge to get     through the day" coffee drinker   I'd say my favorite (and my wife's) is     Caribou Blend.  This blend is WEAK, it can't hold half and half or even     just whole milk without being wiped out.  Now, I will say I  ew it on     the "large cup" (9.25 oz, I believe) setting on our Keurig, so maybe it's     a bit better on the 8oz setting, or even the small setting.  But Caribou (we     also like Donut Shop, Green Mountain Kona Blend 10%, etc.) can be easily      ewed on 9.25 and hold a good bold taste.  This coffee doesn't     hold a CANDLE to any of those.  Now I'm stuck with 40+ of these. Blech...maybe     the guests won't mind it! :)
