Received Different than pictured. Labels Just say "certified" not "D.O.P. CERTIFIED". Don't know if that is the same and after a couple of orders I am not going to put the effort in to find out.     Also came with Basil. I want tomatoes only. Not Basil.     A couple cans dented like others have said.     My case was $44 now its $60.     I'm over the tomato thing. I'll buy what I want in the store.
