I got the Keurig as a present recently and have been trying all the samples that came with the unit. I like a smooth tasting coffee with lots of flavor, especially for  eakfast. Unfortunately, the Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend left me flat.     All of the Keurig K Cups lack the wonderful aroma that makes coffee drinking so enjoyable, but this  eakfast blend is even less aromatic than others.     Flavors are, of course, a personal preference, and I can see the appeal of this coffee for some. It doesn't bite you, like many coffees, so if you're looking for a mellow flavor in the morning, this may be for you. Otherwise, steer clear of this one.
