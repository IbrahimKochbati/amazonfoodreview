I bought this box of crackers for a party at home but when I opened it, most of the crackers in the box were  oken. Other reviewers seems to be getting only 50%  oken but mine was more like 80 90%  oken. Definitely not for serving.          Now, if you are not buying it for serving and just for your own munching, I'd definitely give it at least 4 stars. Great crunchy taste and the sea salt is just heavenly!
