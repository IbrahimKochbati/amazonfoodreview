Attiki honey has an excellent sweet natural flavor, is very thick, and quite possibly is the stickiest substance known to man. I would like to try some baklava made with this honey. After tasting this honey, I suspect some US honey suppliers are artificially sweetening their product. Attiki is sweet without being over powering. Pricier than your standard supermarket honey, but well worth it. Recommended.
