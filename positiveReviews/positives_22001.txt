Another hit from Coffee Masters.  Not overly oily like some flavored coffee companies make, but still the same flavor. Again, a pretty good sale, $18 for 4 bags of beans. Doesn't make as good an iced cup, but more than makes up for it with a normal  ew. Smooth, creamy but not overpowering. Works out to 3# of coffee for $18, still a good deal for flavored coffee.
