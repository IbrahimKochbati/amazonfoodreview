The good:        Good taste;        Pops up plump;        Convenient.          The bad:        Lots of unpopped kernels (far more than any other  and I've used). You get plenty of popped corn, but it seems a waste and could lead you to question freshness or quality of the corn;        Uses the coal tar dyes Yellow #5 and #6 which have been implicated in various health issues and are listed as Group I carcinogens by the IARC.        The generic term "natural and artificial color" is used rather than listing actual flavor contents.        No "best by" or expiration date on the package          For me the bad will prevent me from ordering more of this otherwise good popcorn. I don't need questionable additives just to make my popcorn yellow, and it leaves a colorful gross residue in the pan after popping. And for flavor, if the popcorn itself, along with whatever I want to add on my own, can't carry the day, I will find a product that can stand on its own.          Other:  You only need 4 oz, or half this bag, to completely fill a standard Whirley Pop so you can cut back as needed. Very salty for my taste, so you may want to start with much less than the salt offered and then salt to taste till you find the amount that works for you.
