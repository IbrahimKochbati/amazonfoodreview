To be fair, I have to say that French Roast is not my favorite roast of coffee.  I never buy it in any  and.  If the sample sent to me had been a medium roast I could give it a better rating, probably.  Part of the joy of the experience of drinking coffee, for me, is the smell of a freshly opened bag or can.  The fragrance of this, freshly opened, was of burnt coffee beans.  The flavor, upon making it, was of coffee made with burnt coffee beans.  But, as I say, I have this problem with any French Roast.  As far as low acidity, I think the makers are on the mark.  I'd like to try this  and in a different roast to give it a fair evaluation.
