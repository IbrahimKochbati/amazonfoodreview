My youngest Miniature Schnauzer is very food driven. I'm not sure why but he has always had a bad habit of "wolf"ing down his food.  I have resorted to locking him in a seperate room, away from my other two Miniature Schnauzers, placing a tennis ball in the middle of his bowl and feeding him large kibble sized chunks of food to get him to slow down during feeding time.          Toys like the "Premier Busy Buddy Tug a Jug" is great to keep him busy and entertained because if there is food in there, he's going to work at it until he can get to it.          It took him a little while to 'get' that the food comes out of the front of the jug and previously he was trying to pry off the bottom, chew the front , purple hard rubber ring around the neck of the bottle and then he finally figured out how to get the food out and is content trying to do so until all the food it gone.          My other two are just not that determined.          I agree with everyone here, if you have an aggressive chewer this may not be the best toy but if your dog isn't an aggressive chewer but a food driven dog this toy will keep him busy.
