I do not like soy products, at least my body doesn't like soy products.  So I've been looking for a healthy shake for awhile now.  I found these hemp shakes and am very pleased with the amount of protein and the easy digestibility of this product.  I'm not one for a sickly sweet product and this one is sweet enough for me.  Most people don't like the color of my shakes, but I don't mind.  I appreciate the value and the cost.  I'd recommend it for anyone looking for an alternative to isolated soy protein shakes.
