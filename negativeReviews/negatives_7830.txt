Con          *Not great tasting     *No English directions (see youtube to find out how to do this that is what we did)     *Box arrived crushed          Pro     *Fun to make     *looks cute          My boyfriend got this for me just for fun because we both love sushi. We could not figure out the directions via the pictures so we looked online and found directions on youtube. Everything smells like grape but the texture is not that appetizing and I like fake grape flavoring. We both had a problem just trying to swallow it but for $11 we kind of felt obligated. It is fun but as another user stated you can buy it places like j list for around $5 if you want the experience buy it at another place. Otherwise I suggest you find directions online "how to make candy sushi" out of rice krispy treats, Swedish fish and fruit roll ups or come up with your own ideas and have fun!
