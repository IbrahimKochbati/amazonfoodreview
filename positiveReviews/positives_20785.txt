Kellogs Rice Krispies Treats  Crispy Marshmallow Squares.  Cheaper at Costco when they have them in stock.  Stock varies as Costco doesn't always have a product when you want it.  Their inventory stock varies and they don't always have a product they had last week or last month  one of the disappointing shortcomings of the store.
