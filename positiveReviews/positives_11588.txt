My son and his family like to have a relaxed family  eakfast on weekends, and pancakes are often on the menu. They love maple syrup and have developed a taste for the "good stuff"   real Vermont maple syrup. It seems that Vermont has the strictest rules about what goes into Maple syrup (believe it or not, they aren't all pure Maple out there!) and of course, the grade A Dark Amber is the best of the best. I couldn't resist picking up this jug of syrup for them as an additional gift for under the Christmas Tree. They were thrilled, and I understand they used it for  eakfast the very next morning. I think I will do this again in future Christmases, it was so well received.
