My dog, Spike, had a skin infection requiring taking 2 antibiotic capsules twice daily for just over a month, and the antibiotic had such a strong smell that I'd want to run away too when opening the bottle.  I've always snubbed Pill Pockets because of the expense   it was cheaper to bury medicines in pieces of hot dog, cheese, or  ead or even burying it in peanut butter.  Stubborn Spike managed to figure all of these out though due to the strong scent of the medicine, and it made medicating him a nightmare.  As a last resort, I ordered Pill Pockets to give them a whirl.          These really do make giving Spike his medicine so much easier!  In a week, he never turned his nose up or spit out medicine, and that means a lot less stress for this puppy mom.  Another reviewer said this and I figured I'd reiterate   they're a lot like chicken (or other meat, depending on your flavor) putty that's pre shaped for capsules.  Spike's capsules (at 500mg each) were a little big for these pockets, but it was easy to shape around.  I know I'll be using these again rather than any other methods I've tried before.
