Cook some Basmati rice and you have a meal for two.  This is an excellent product and doesn't need any additional ingredients.  Tastes almost as good as authentic Indian restaurant food.          EDIT:  Changing the rating.  This last batch was a little bland.  It tastes OK, but not great like before.  With previous packages my wife and I would practically lick our bowls clean! With this last order, there is flavor missing.  It no longer has the strong spicey taste to it like the restaurants do.  We are really hoping it was just a bad batch.
