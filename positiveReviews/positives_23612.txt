I remember eating these in the 70's... probably a different  and, but the same taste and crunch!  These are awesome for a quick snack on the go. They stay crunchy and fresh and you will polish off a bag in no time, so there is no worry about storage after the bag is opened.  One downside... they are expensive.  I actually tried to 'make these' in my food dehydrator.  Not at all the same crunch and flavor.  These are the best that I have tried anywhere and I have tried a lot of different  ands. The Apple is the best of this  and :) All natural too and healthy!
