First off, as of this writing, this product is not actually for sale on this page. But it is for sale here: [...]          Just had a bowl of these for lunch. I'm not a huge eater, and found the volume of this to be okay. I'm glad I  ought some corn chips to supplement (I know, not the best combo). The taste was okay too, though not, in my mind, much better than most ramen or Cup o Noodles or Maruchan type things. Really, it was like a squirt of sriracha in a cup of chicken ramen. Which is fine. Good. And this doesn't have MSG, so that's nice, and it comes in a bowl, so that's nice. There are flakes of veggies, and a couple pea sized chunks of very spongy chicken. It took me a while to realize that the spongy stuff was chicken. Seems about right for this kind of product.          I can't leave the office for lunch, so I'm always looking for something I can tuck in a desk drawer and actually enjoy. Given that it is in a microwaveable (non styrofoam) bowl, and I like the idea of squirting sriracha in my ramen, this is a good option. Given how infrequently I'll use them, though, I might splurge and go for a much more expensive but slightly more gourmet bowl of noodles (Annie Chun, etc). On the other hand, if I were going to eat them more frequently, I might want to splurge and go for a more expensive but healthier alternative.          If cheap, easy, and basically tasty are your priorities, this is probably a good option. If you want to throw healthy or interesting into the mix, I think you're going to have to spend a little more.
