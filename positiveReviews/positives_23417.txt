These Marcona almonds are for the SERIOUS gourmet who is VERY hungry as they are shipped in a 50 pound box! Good for a candy making company, too, but for us regular people that just love FRESH nuts: You can get fresh Pecans at Sunnyland Farms dot com, and fresh English Walnuts or Almonds at california almonds dot com. The prices and shipping are very reasonable, and bigger orders are discounted, PLUS get on their email list for notices of NEW CROPS each year! We have used these two sources, and they are excellent, always shipping only the finest "new crop" nuts!
