Seeing that this is a chocolate bar, you would think the first ingredient is cocoa, but no it's not. I bit into the bar and taste sour and moldy. It doesn't even smell right. I didn't taste any chocolate. The term "milk chocolate'' is misleading. Actually, milk chocolate is 90% milk, milk fat, sugar, and soy Lecithin. The rest is cocoa, artificial flavors, and preservatives. The U.S. government only requires 10% concentration of chocolate liquor in milk chocolate bars. And Hershey, for your information, has reformulated their chocolate products to replace cocoa butter with vegetable oil as an emulsifier, which makes it taste even worse.
