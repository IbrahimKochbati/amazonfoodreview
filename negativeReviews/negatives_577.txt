As far as canned soups go this is ok. I was disappointed with the texture, extra unexpected bits (shell pieces) and overall quality. Having been spoiled by living in Maine for 20 years before relocating to the south, I tried different  ands of canned bisque. I have come to the realization that Lobster Bisque is best when made fresh.
