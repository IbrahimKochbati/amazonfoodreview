Pocket Coffees are something I "discovered" while assigned to an Air Force Intelligence Unit in southern Italy.  They are positively incredible!  It's a dark chocolate filled with espresso and a big pick me up.  We used them on the night shifts, helping to stay awake, but the taste is fantastic.  Very unusual.  I've been trying to get them for years, and recently treated myself on Amazon, with half paid by gift certificate.  Give Pocket Coffees a try...they're unusual and exciting.  Not for children, the taste of coffee is pretty intense.
