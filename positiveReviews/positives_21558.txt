I suppose this is a new formula since Quaker is marketing this as 'heart healthy' and whole grain.          To me, it tastes as good as any other Quaker Instant Oatmeal that I've tried in the past so I do not hesitate to recommend this one.          That said, I am not an oatmeal connoisseur; if you are very picky about your oatmeal, then your mileage may vary so to speak. I do like less fattening and more healthy foods so would probably purchase this one over a less healthy version.
