Pros:  flax seeds, organic, fiber, pumpkin seeds, taste!     Cons:  price          Yum.  I used to avoid granola cereals because they were hard to chew.  A friend visited,  ought a box of Nature's Path Pumpkin Flax Granola, and forgot to take it when he left.  So, I tried it.  I was hooked immediately.  Not only was it tasty, but it wasn't jaw  eaking hard.  It wasn't mush either.  Perfection.          The only problem with this cereal is the price.  For someone on a fixed income trying to eat right, it's expensive.  It is hard to find it for less than $4 5 box and that's just too much for me to spend on a small box of cereal.  I bought this bulk package from Amazon when it was on a super sale, but on accident I didn't hit auto renew and the price went back up.  When it goes back down I'll renew, but until then it's other places that are cheaper.  These are Fred Meyer in bulk and Trader Joe's ($2.89 box).  The best price is Fred Meyer.          Make sure that you chew the cereal good.  The flax seeds are whole.  If they enter the body whole, they EXIT whole as well, and that means you get zero nutrient from them.  So, chew it up!          It's EXCELLENT with So Delicious Coconut Milk, a non dairy, non soy drink.  I just use it for this cereal.  I have stomach problems and this combo is one of the few things during the day that doesn't ache me.
