I'm a regular stevia user, but this is the first, last, and only time I'll use this product    or any stevia product that is artificially flavored or extracted with alcohol. The chemical aftertaste from this product was overpowering and distasteful. For a better stevia product, try SteviaClear by SweetLeaf    the only stevia product I use.
