My son is on a GFCF diet and LOVES these  ownies.  I also enjoy them.  They taste almost as good as regular  ownies, but are safe for him to eat.  It is wonderful to be able to easily prepare treats for him that he loves.  They are very easy to prepare and bake nicely.  I typically prepare the entire package, and freeze some for a later date.
