Let me tell you right now, if you love these, DONT ORDER THEM IN BULK.  I fell in love with them when i first tried them from the vending machine at work, and for a small tiny packet at $1, i was like "forget this, ill get mine from amazon and stock up".  Which i did.  They arrived in excellent condition, they were tasty, crunchy, NOT EXPIRED (unlike some other food items from here).  I was completely satisfied with the shipping and handling and condition and taste of item.          Now i am sick of Gardetto's cuz i had too much too soon. But they definitely are very yummy, my colleague's love them too.          (:
