I bought these to share with the office and the disappeared almost instantly.  They are very good and contain enough protein to keep people going while suppressing that "snacky" feeling.  These are a great snack to carry with you as they are very light (for example, on a flight or road trip).  I highly recommend that you try a few of the other flavors as well.  They have this snack in Chicken, Turkey and Beef in various flavors.
