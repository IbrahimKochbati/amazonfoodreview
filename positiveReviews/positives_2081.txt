We've been eating this delightful cereal for several years.  My kids always feel better on gluten free foods and so do I.  Unlike the popular junky cereals, this version of a slightly chocolately cereal is light and not too sugary and it's a special treat for the kids.  I also like supporting Envirokids products   the pricing has come down to where it's nearly the same as the other mainstream cereals that are not as good for you.
