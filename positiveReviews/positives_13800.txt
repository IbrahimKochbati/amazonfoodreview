Love, love this item.  I bought the regular and chocolate and enjoy them both.  I mix mine equal parts powder a     & water and it is perfect on crackers, as a dipper or just off the spoon for a quick protein rich, low fat snack.          I have also used it in protein shakes and diped raw apple and pear slices right into the powder too!          Yum.     Try it!
