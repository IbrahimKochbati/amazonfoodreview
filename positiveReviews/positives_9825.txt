My husband just loves nuts.  We usually buy at various markets but really haven't tried getting them online.          These were just as described: crunchy, large, perfectly salted and fried.          They were really fresh and delightful.  I wouldn't have tried them if it weren't for all the great reviews and I am glad that I did.  In this case, the reviews are accurate.  You will be surprised at how great these are in contrast to many others that are out in the world or online.          Try Royal Oak Peanuts.  Excellent product.
