They're okay, but not the most amazing thing ever.          ~ The Good ~     Good flavor, no too strong or weak.     Crunchy, but not too dry.     Plenty of chips in each bag. Not just filled with air.     Not greasy, so makes a good on the go snack.     All natural, using no artificial flavors or colors.          ~ The Bad ~     Sill plenty of fat per bag (3.5 grams per bag of the sour cream flavor) so don't get them expecting them to be low fat.     Tastes like a low fat chip, but with all the fat of regular chips.          ~ Conclusion ~     I'm 50 50 on if I'll order them again. I have a finicky stomach, and so I'm fine with things that taste low fat and healthy, since those are mostly what I eat. But these have all the fat and calories of chips that are fried and even more than those that are baked, so I'm undecided on if I want more chips that have a healthy taste with all the fat. The all natural ingredients are what make this chip different, and what might  ing me back for more. It's definitely one of those snacks you have to try for yourself, and see if you like them or not.
