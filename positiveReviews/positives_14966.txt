I had already tasted Citron Oolong a few years ago in Barefoot coffee shop in Palo Alto, CA. It is a delicious tea. My friends even enjoyed it. It is not a heavy oolong tea, or even the traditional oolong such as Iron goddess of mercy or Jade oolong, both of which are my ultimate favorites. Also, know this: Rishi makes the best oolong tea so do not skimp on your tea :)! Be sure not to over ew, and follow instructions on how much to use. Also use filtered water to boil, it will improve the taste over tap water. I love using my  ita water in the zojirushi which has hot water ready to go at all times at my house.
