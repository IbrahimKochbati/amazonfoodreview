These are the BEST BARS I HAVE EVER EATEN. I have one and my daughter has one EVERY day.          And I shop on the internet whenever possible, so its not like I have something against Amazon, other online sellers, or UPS.          But buy these bars at the store. The wonderful white chocolate covering on them melts when delivered by UPS, and although you can still eat it that ruins the bar, with chips of re hardened white chocolate falling off every where.          So BUY THESE BARS!!!!!THEY ARE INCREDIBLE, but buy them at the store.          Apologies to Amazon, online sellers and UPS, but it is what it is................
