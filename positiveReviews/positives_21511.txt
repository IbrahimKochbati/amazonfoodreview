This is my 3 year old son's favorite type of oatmeal. We have tried many others but he likes this one best. He gets very insistent that I put honey on top of his oatmeal, so I like the fact that this instant stuff has a little bit less sugar on it than it used to have. I love how easy it is to make, and it is great that my son can help me make it in the morning. In addition to the honey, we also usually add a couple heaping tablespoons of yogurt to it, so that it cools down faster.
