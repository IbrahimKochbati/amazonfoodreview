I've had a couple of these for a few years but find that I don't use them all that often because their size & design limits their usefulness. For bushy herbs like cilantro or parsley it only holds a small bunch, and it's difficult to keep the bunch together while you snap the lid back on. Since the bottom cup is so shallow herbs tend to flop out the front unless you lay the pod down when first filling it. It works great for asparagus, but only for small ish bunches and if the spears aren't too tall.          More often than not I simply use a canning jar + 1 2" of water with a plastic bag over the top, which keeps the contents just as fresh and allows for easier access. These pods do look much nicer in the fridge than a bag topped jar, however, and the clear front makes it harder to forget what's in there.          They are definitely well made and not prone to leaking or tipping over. And the little drain port is fun to use.          But it only works for small bunches.
