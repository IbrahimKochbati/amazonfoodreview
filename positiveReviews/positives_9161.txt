These bite sized banana pieces are delicious.  They are covered in dark chocolate and are chewy (the bananas are not fried or crispy and banana chips typically are).  These chocolate covered bananas are vegan, organic, and fair trade, and while they are a bit pricey (the bags are small and won't last too long because these are delicious), they are a unique treat which makes it worth purchasing.  These aren't too sweet   they have a hint of sweetness from the chocolate and banana, but are a tad bitter from the dark chocolate.
