Amazon normally does a fantastic job getting product out to me in great shape and on time, but, I guess this is one product that they can not.          Several jars had compromised seals and so we had to immediately throw them out.  I wish I could order this by mail but it seems this is one item we'll need to go to the grocery store for.
