Got these large Greenies originally when we noticed our 60+lb Boxer mix puppies' teeth were getting a little dirty and  ushing didn't too much.  We give them each one Greenie in the morning when we leave for work, they love them.  The boy gobbles it down, but his sister savors every bit.  They also keep the buildup on their teeth down quite a bit, they're not going to make them shine, but they'll keep them pretty clean!
