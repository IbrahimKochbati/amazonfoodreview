M fussy  & i DO mean FUSSY EATER doggies  LOVE these treats; they devour them, but not TOO fast for their digestion. & no worries about splinters, etc. My 2 little "gentlemen" and i thank you for this welcome surprise, cuz i've been forced to throw out many other "treats" that my boys just sniffed 'n scorned! Spoiled pooches? You bet!!! But BEST companions anyone'd ever hope for!     Connie in Denver
