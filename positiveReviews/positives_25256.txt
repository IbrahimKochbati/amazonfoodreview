Our large family loves maple syrup and we have purchased this  and regularly for years.  We prefer Grade B over Grade A because Grade B has a stronger maple flavor, but Coombs makes excellent Grade A syrups for those who prefer their syrup a little "lighter."  This syrup is organic, which we purchase whenever we can afford it, but Coombs also makes delicious non organic syrups that are slightly lower in price and just as yummy.          Pros: This size is good for our family, and a much better value than the tiny little glass bottles in health food stores that cost a fortune.  The jug is easy to pour from and doesn't make a huge mess.  The flavor is great and works well in all applications: topping for waffles or pancakes, making salad dressings or barbeque sauces, baking corn ead or muffins.  I also love that the product is certified organic...when I am not buying locally and cannot personally speak to the farmers producing my food I feel more confident buying certified organic stuff.          Cons: Obviously, this is slightly higher in price than non organic maple syrup but not by much.  I would also love to see this available in half gallon or gallon sizes.
