I'm a peanut butter addict but since going on Weight Watchers, I've greatly decreased my intake of PB. It's very pointy and they don't care that it's "healthy fat"! Enter PB2   it's basically dehydrated peanuts that have been processed into powder form. Mix it with water for regular peanut butter consistency, or just mix it into your smoothies as an ingredient. It tastes great, is not gritty, and the best party is 2 TBSP of this stuff is VERY low in points and calories. I highly recommend this!
