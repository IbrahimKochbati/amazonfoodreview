I have two 60 65 lb greyhounds and I buy the Teenie sized greenies as a snack twice a day.  I use it as a  ibe in order to get their teeth  ushed.  I'm not sure how well they work for deterring tartar but they seem to love it.  Doesn't seem to cause any digestive problems as my hounds have sensitive stomachs.  Another reason why I like the teenie size is becacause they can be rationed out to last longer rather than getting the "large or X Lg" greenie where you get fewer pieces.
