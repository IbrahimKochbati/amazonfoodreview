These snacks are such a great finger food.  Unlike a lot of other snacks for toddlers we have tried they actually taste good.  My only problem is wanting to eat them before I give them to my daughter.  They are not messy and are the perfect size for little fingers.  The fruit melts very quickly in my daughters mouth and is so easy for her to eat.  All the flavors are excellent but this is our favorite.  Both the blueberries and apples taste fresh and sweet but with no added sweetener.  Great job designing a healthy snack for young children.
