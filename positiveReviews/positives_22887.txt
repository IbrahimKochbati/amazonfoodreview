My family loves this tea.  Take 1 qt water in a measuring cup, heat to boiling, put in 6 tea bags, steep for at least an hour (I leave it overnight).  Pour the tea into a .5 gallon container, put in 2 3 to 1 c. sugar, add another quart of water, mix, and you've got great iced tea.  We have this and Lemon Lift in the fridge year round.
