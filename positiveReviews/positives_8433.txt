For those of you that have never tried spiedies (which is most anyone that is NOT from the Endicott, NY area), you should do yourself a favor and use Salamida's Spiedie Marinade.  Cut up some chicken into chunks, marinade for 48 hours and bbq on skewers...serve on italian  ead or rolls...YUM.  So nice to be able to get this sauce shipped to the house in California!
