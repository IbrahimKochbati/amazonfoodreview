This canned pumpkin was purchased for my dogs, wonderful benefits for canines.  No dented cans, good packaging.  I will never buy any other pumpkin again even for my family's use.  The pumpkin we used to buy in the grocery store is watery, this pumpkin is firm, no filler or artificial coloring.  Texture is similar to stiff mashed potatoes. Simply the best!!
