My dogs love love the chews on a normal basis, keeps thier  eath fresh for a few days. I ordered a bag of large and a bag of medium and both were covered in a powder that smelled spoiled. I purchased from Amazon.com and they are refunding returning the items. I will look for a different distributor for them as they really are a great product for my dachshunds.
