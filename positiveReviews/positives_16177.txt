I buy the teenie greenies and  eak them in half for our dogs.  They go nuts over them no matter what the size.  Having them in a "lite" version is even better because the vet did tell me they are high in calories.  Don't know what they put in these things to make them so appealing, but haven't known a dog yet who doesn't love them.  Hope they are also doing the job they are meant to do.
