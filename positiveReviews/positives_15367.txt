I love trying different salts and seasonings, but I have to say this may be my favorite salt ever! I use it in everything. You won't believe how much flavor difference just a little amount makes, and it smells divine. I am already re ordering for myself and plan to give some to friends for gifts. If you like mushrooms, you will LOVE this salt! Highly recommended!
