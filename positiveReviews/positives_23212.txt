It has been 11 months since I began a gluten free diet and this is the first  ead I've eaten which tastes good. It is moist and holds together well even when sliced warm out of the  ead maker. I bake it in a Breadman TR 875 and follow the directions on the bag of the  ead mix (which says to NOT use the gluten free setting). I'm baking  ead from Pamela's  ead mix for my 11 year old granddaughter who also must eat gluten free. It allows her to take sandwiches to school like the other kids. The  ead toasts well and probably freezes well, but we eat it too fast to worry about that. It bakes well with added herbs, cheese, etc. It's a good product.
