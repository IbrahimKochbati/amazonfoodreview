I have been ordering Big Train Vanilla and Spiced Chai for just over 2 years on Amazon's subscription.  It was so good and it rivaled the chai at my favorite coffee house (NOT Char bucks).  I always LOVED it, and enjoyed a cup each morning as I  aced for the coming day.  I did, that is, up until several months ago. They seem to have changed the recipe because it just isn't the same.          Now I get a numbing sensation on my tongue when I drink it.  If it sits for too long and sediment settles my reaction is really bad...I won't go into details.  The taste is hard to describe, but it is kind of a detergent taste that burns.  I even thought that I had detergent stuck in my mugs from the dishwasher, so I was very diligent in cleaning them before I made a cup.  It didn't help.          The flavor was stronger with the spiced chai, so I started getting only vanilla.  Unfortunately, I find the same unpleasant flavor with vanilla as well.          I have never used as much mix as the directions say because there was too much that settled out.  Since this started happening, I have reduced the amount I use even more.  That horrible flavor is still there, so I know it isn't related to the way it's mixed.          I am very disappointed because, like I said, it was my favorite beverage in the morning.  After trying so many different things over the last 4 months, I have finally selected another  and to try out.  I hope it is as good as this one used to be.
