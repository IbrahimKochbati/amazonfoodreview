I've been using Shake 'n Bake for pork for more years than I'd like to remember. The compliments I've gotten are usually in regard to how tender the chops come out (I use boneless chops). One guest told me he'd never had pork chops this tender.          If I am going to oven bake pork chops, this is the only way I'll make them. I like the flavor of the mix, and it has a good texture. Preparation is super simple, and the chops cook quickly, so it's ideal for last minute prep  get the chops in the oven, and while they're cooking, make a  salad and whatever vegetable you're in the mood for. It sure beats frying.
