These taste fine, like a fancy cracker rather than a saltine.  My only issue with them is the packaging.  They come in two bags inside the box, and many are cracker pieces.  I'll buy them again but I really wish the company would come up with a better packaging method, perhaps in cylinders like ritz crackers are packaged.
