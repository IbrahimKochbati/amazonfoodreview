The Butterfinger has been around since it was introduced by the Curtiss Candy Company of Illinois in 1923. In the 1990s, they put a new wrinkle on the trademark by making Butterfinger BBs. Those were good, but they really outdid themselves when they invented the Butterfinger Crisp! The Butterfinger Crisp is made of baked wafers sandwiching layers of Butterfinger flavored cream. Then, the whole thing is wrapped in chocolate.          Yeah, this candy bar is great, a real improvement on the original. It has that same great Butterfinger taste, but without that stick to teeth consistency. If anything it even tastes better! The normal sized Butterfinger Crisp contains 210 calories, but a nice thing is that it comes in the form of two bars, which allows you to eat one as a (roughly) 100 calorie snack and save the other one for tomorrow's snack. I wish that they did that with other candy bars.          Anyway, if you like Butterfingers, or if you like wafer candy, then you will like Butterfinger Crisps. Go for it!
