Sorry, but this isn't truffle salt.  I'm shocked that it's so bad.  All the truffle salts I've used have an excellent aroma that is garlicky and salty, a great addition to many dishes.  I was impressed with the reputation of Whittingtons, but what is this stuff?  If I mixed coarse salt with dirt from my backyard, this would be it.  Maybe I just don't know black truffles, but someone should have washed them first!  I'm sending this back and will get truffle salt at my local gourmet store that I can smell first.  I thought they'd all be fabulous at this price and on Amazon.
