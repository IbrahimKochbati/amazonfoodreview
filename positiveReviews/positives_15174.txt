I bought this food for my adult male chiweenie and two female chiweeniepom puppies. I researched for a while before finally deciding to get this particular  and. I'm glad I did get this  and. My dogs absolutely love it. Before buying canidae my puppies were on purina puppy chow and my adult was eating kibbles n bits  and. They were "healthy", but their poop smelled horrible and I knew there was much healthier food out there for them. I gave this to my adult to see if he liked it and indeed he did, I attempted to try and feed him his last bit of "junk" food he had left and he would not touch it. The only dry food he will eat is canidae and nothing else and the puppies love it too. I read all the bad reviews and chose to still buy it and hope for a good outcome and it was good. My dogs are healthier than ever, they haven't had any diarrhea, vomitting, weightloss, unhealthy weight gain, or anything that I have read on the other reviews, but my dogs also have no allerges that I know of either. Another plus is that their poop doesn't smell as bad either, I mean in still stinks but nothing like before. I started feeding them canidae on Thursday July 26, 2012 and two months later they are healthier than ever with no adverse effects and my veterinarian likes it too.
