I love this mix!  I made these as a  ead item for our dinner and my husband and daughter, who normally don't like my gluten free foods, loved them too!  They have a good chewy texture to them.  Be careful not to over bake them, take them out when they are light  own.  I tried to make mini pizza crust with them but it didn't turn out for me but as little rolls, they are excellent!
