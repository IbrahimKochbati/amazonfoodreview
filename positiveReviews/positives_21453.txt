This is the best plain granola I've come across. Even my 21 month old loves this stuff, and she's quite the picky eater! Excellent source of fiber and whole grains to go with  eakfast or an evening snack. And this package offered by Amazon is the best deal I've come across anywhere. The grocery store jacks the price of this by a single bag around so much it gives me whip lash. I pay between a 1 5 and 1 4 of the price of this six pack at the grocery store for ONE. At the very least I'm getting one free by buying this way. Definetly a deal, worth the money and excellent quality.
