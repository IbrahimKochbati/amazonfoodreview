If you like strong, black tea, then this is the one for you!  My grandfather owned a tea plantation in Assam, India, so I am an admitted tea snob who would only drink tea fresh from the plantation.  It is extremely difficult to find a good domestic black tea within the U.S. (The U.S. is a coffee country, not a tea country   and herbal tea is not real tea!!!).  Black tea within the U.S. is generally weak, watered down and has no taste.  I was pleasantly surprised by this  and of teas (Taylor's of Harrogate in general).  All of the teas that I have tried of this  and have been good, but the Irish  eakfast tea in particular is excellent (for packaged tea).  It is a wonderful blend of African and Assamese black teas, with a bold, strong flavor and color.  It is excellent with milk and sugar.  I indulge in a cup of tea with biscuits (cookies!) each afternoon!  : )
