This is basically candy masquerading as a "healthy" snack. They taste good   because they have three different kinds of sugar in them! Blue Diamond  wants you to think that eating sugar is a healthy snack   c'mon!          I purchased these thinking they were sweetened with stevia. Yeah, there's a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient)   but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed. These have corn maltodextrin   the worst thing there is on the glycemic index (can you say fat formation?). Now I'm stuck with 3 containers of this sugar snack.
