I have two poms that love treats (what dog doesn't?!) These were very well packaged. They were a little too big for my large poms, had to  eak them in half. A large or medium size dog would do fine. You may need to take a hammer to them for smaller dogs to  eak them into pieces. Not sure if they come in smaller size. I really like that they used all organic products in these. I'm not an organic freak, but I notice the taste and freshness difference in organic food for myself so my dogs deserve the same!
