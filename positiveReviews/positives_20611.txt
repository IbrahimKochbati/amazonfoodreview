If you have azaleas (which are actually part of the genus rhododendron) this is the product for you. In Chinese culture, the azalea is known as "thinking of home bush" (xiangsi shu) which makes sense because when I think of home I remember the azaleas in my yard and I feel better. I have a crazy looking azalea in my backyard. It's been there for at least 20 years. It looks like a bonzai  it's all bend over and stretched out and narly. I put some Miracid on it and Jeez the awesom blooms I got this year! It was wicked cool! Thanks Miracid! You're the best!
