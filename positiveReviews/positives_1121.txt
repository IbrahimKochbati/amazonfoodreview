I first tried Britt dark roast when I was In Costa Rica.  It has a lot of rich flavor, but it is not bitter at all.  I've bought     it by the case ever since.  It's really no more expensive than those "gourmet"  ands you find at your local store.  This is     simply the best coffee I've ever had, and I've tried many supposedly special ones over the years.
