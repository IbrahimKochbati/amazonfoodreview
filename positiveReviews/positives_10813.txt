Newman's Lamb and Barley dog treats have been happily, and eagerly, devoured by both dogs in the house: a Siberian husky, and a Jack Russell terrier. The ingredients in the treats are organic and natural, without anything weird or unusual (like colors, stabilizers, preservatives, etc). The treats are odorless and come in a re sealable ziploc pouch.          The treats are rectangular with an indentation down the center to allow (in theory) one to  eak the treat in half. Even half of the treat, though, seems a bit large for smaller dogs. Additionally, the treats are so hard and dry, that  eaking them in two can be difficult. Fortunately, a good number arrived pre  oken, and those are the ones the JRTs been getting. The hardness of the treats makes me think they're probably good for the dog's teeth, and each pup takes a while to eat them. They can leave crumbs, but dogs are usually pretty adept at getting every last morsel, so there's never been any mess left over.
