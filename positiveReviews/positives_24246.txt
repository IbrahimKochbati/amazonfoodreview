I've tried many different  ands of chai over the years and Big Train's Vanilla Chai is one of the best out there.  My boyfriend loves it, too!  It's the only  and of chai that he'll drink.  Plus, you get so many servings for the price and free super saver shipping!  One of the gourmet food shops in the mall sells the small pouches of the same chai for $8 and there are only a few servings in the pouch.  It is definitely worth stocking up by buying the two can pack that's offered here!
