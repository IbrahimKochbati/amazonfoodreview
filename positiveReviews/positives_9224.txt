Sustainably caught off the California Coast, packaged as disclosed in a previous review. I feel a tad guilty buying 10 at at time at the local co op but they are simply the best tasting sardines, distinctive and flavorful. You know you are buying premium product compared to the plethora of sardine purveyors out there: Nordic, Portugal, Mediterranean, etc...The cool waters off the California are well known for sardines
