My daughter enjoyed some of this product at a Deli while on an out of town trip.  We looked all over our area, but it seems no one carries it.  I did find it on Amazon and ordered her a case of 12 one liter bottles of it.  She loves it, but the shipping costs were three times the cost of the soda.  I will seek a more local point to buy it next time.
