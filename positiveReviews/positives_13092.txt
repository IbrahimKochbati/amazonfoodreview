My mother is Thai, so I grew up eating a lot of sticky rice. The last time I went to visit her (she lives 4 hours away), she forced me to take home the pot and basket to make it, and she also provided me some rice. Once that ran out, I looked up where the closest Thai market was from me, and found one 30 minutes away. Due to feeling a little lazy, I opted to order this instead. I just made some tonight and it's PERFECT! It turned out just like my mom's sticky rice. When it runs out, I might venture out to the Thai market to see if I can get it for cheaper. But I didn't mind paying more for the convenience.
