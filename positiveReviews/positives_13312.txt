We have been baking these  ownies for several years as I have a gluten free son who is the pickiest of eaters.  If there was a change to the recipe when the company was acquired by Glutino, it did not affect its taste to our family!          These are fudgey and chewy not at all dry or cake like.  We tried freezing them to make them last longer, but they are just as good if not better frozen.  We cut ours after baking and freeze them already cut in a zip lock bag.          A few years ago, an organic living magazine did a taste test on all  ownies and these placed first.  Incidentally, Gluten Free's chocolate cake mix which used to be called Danielle's decadent cake mix also took first place and it makes the best chocolate cupcakes I have ever eaten!  Try topping them with Pamela's dark chocolate frosting mix. The best!  NO ONE will ever suspect either mix is gluten free.
