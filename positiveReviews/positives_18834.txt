I have to purchase lollipops out of pocket for the kids who come through my Immunizations office.  These are perfect and comply with patient safety requirements. Great price for a lot of lollipops.  Will purchase again.  Only a few lollies  oken or out of a wrapper and for 200 lollies, that's pretty good.  Each flavor tastes good. My only concern is these might be too big for the little kids mouths. other than that. 5 stars
