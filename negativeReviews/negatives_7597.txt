There were bird feathers in my last shipment. I wrote the company about this, asking how this can happen and where they source the product, but received no response whatsoever. The presence of bird feathers in the tea is quite unsanitary. and the lack of response by the vendor is equally quite troubling. Please note the date of this review. Product received in March 2012.
