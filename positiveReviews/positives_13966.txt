I've always loved peanut butter and have been inclined to mix a spoonful or two into whatever I happen to be eating.  This is a great way to get that wonderful peanut butter taste without the fat, calories, and gloppiness of peanut butter.  The powder form makes it great for stirring into soups or oatmeal or sprinkling on yogurt.  I've tried it reconstituted as well, but I don't think it has quite the same consistency of peanut butter as the real stuff, so I woudn't be inclined to use this like peanut butter in a sandwich or just eat it by the spoonful.  It does impart a nice flavor though, and I don't detect any weird or chemically aroma or flavors    it's just nice and peanutty.          I ordered this and a version of PB2 with chocolate.  PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter and Powdered Cocoa Peanut Butter   85% Less Fat and Calories   6.5 Oz Each   2 Pack.  Frankly, I couldn't tell much difference between the two.  They both have a strong peanutty flavor.  I think I will stick with just this plain version if I order it again.
