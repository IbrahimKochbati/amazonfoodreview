I bought these mainly to get free shipping for a case of silken tofu. I have yet to try the tofu, but I did try the Shibolim whole wheat soup croutons in a super salad I made for dinner. I'm not big on soups as I am with salads and croutons makes for a nice topper. These being so tiny had me concerned they would get lost in my salads. They are a welcome change from the boulder croutons I usually buy. I would buy these again as they are yummy.
