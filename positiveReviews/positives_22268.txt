Of course no bagged tea can ever be the "best tea ever", but in the realm of bagged, this tea is about the best you could ever ask for.          Twinings Everyday is just that  a tea that's perfect every day of the week. It's a light black tea, with a nice easy flavor that has just a pinch of citrus. Steep it more lightly and you get an almost white tea flavor, longer to go darker. The only reason any tea enthusiast should be disappointed is if they prefer especially strong  ews. My father in law is the type that would eat the leaves if he could, so he'd have to use extra bags to make the sort of insanely strong  ew he prefers. Then again, that's why it comes in boxes of eighty.          The actual flavor is perfectly balanced, and suits whatever bells and whistles you want to tack on. If you want to drink it as is, it's wonderful. It goes perfect with lemon, or with milk, and I've found it's also wonderful with honey and sugar. In short, this tea suits whatever you're in the mood for.          I recommend this tea enthusiastically. I wound up picking up a box on clearance, and couldn't be happier. If you love tea, this is the perfect default to keep at hand when you can't decide which specialty  ew to have. If you've never really gotten into tea, this is the pefect blend to learn what the fuss is about. This tea does lend itself more to afternoon and blending with milk or sweeteners, but it's fine in any situation.
