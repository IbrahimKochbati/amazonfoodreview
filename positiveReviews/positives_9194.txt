I ordered these noodles after seeing them advertised on the Internet. I was a little surprised to see that the noodles were in a bag of water, but I went along cooking with them anyway. I rinsed, blanched and dried them like the package said, and put them in about half a cup of smooth tomato sauce. The noodles involved a little more chewing than I expected (and the texture is a little different), but it was enough to feed one adult such as myself and I liked that the noodles have 0 calories. I might purchase these again, perhaps when I have a better recipe to include them in, such as a soup.
