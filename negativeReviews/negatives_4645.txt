Item not as pictured or described. Smaller, much smaller. Tho I will admit the one I got was in good condition, it wasn't what I expected.  Green is beginning to yellow at the bottom ends where attached to trunk.... It was wrapped pretty tight but no fragile on box or other such info for postal carefulness just some packing peanuts thrown in the box... Wish it was more as pictured but for 12.00 I can work with it!
