These jerky strips are delicious!  I've been a vegetarian for 13 years and I'm always looking for tasty vegetarian "meat replacement" foods.  These strips definitely work for me. I keep a couple in my car to snack on when I don't have time to stop and eat.  The texture is so "meat like" you will question yourself and re read the ingredients to be sure is isn't made from animal flesh. I bought a case of the Texas BBQ and a case of the Hickory Smoked.  They are both fantastic, and the Texas BBQ has a nice spicy kick! I think you'll really enjoy this product. I do.    "
