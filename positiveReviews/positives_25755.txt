I am on a low carb and sugar diet, and needless to say I have been craving some of my old foods. My expectations were medium to low, but I am very surprised by this stuff, it helps me so much. Its a bit runny which sort of stinks, but the flavors are pretty good considering it has no calories and is made out of some suspect stuff. I season my protein more to kick up the flavor a bit more, but I enjoy it. Its not the best BBQ sauce ever but for not having calories it rocks. I like this the most of all the walden farms stuff I have tried. Look at a grocery store for a price cut; I got mine at Albersons.
