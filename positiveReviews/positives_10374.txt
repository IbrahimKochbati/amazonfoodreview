It's really difficult to find good truffle oil these days and unless you want to spend a lot of money, a product like this is just fine for most kitchens. There is a decent amount of flavor, and the price isn't bad. Maybe Thomas Keller would turn his nose up at it, but for me   it's good enough because honestly I can't tell the difference between the really expensive stuff and the mediocre stuff so I'd rather just pay $14, and not $90.
