Hi,          My first grandson was born and I wanted everything under the sun to cele ate!  This is a wonderful idea that has been around for a very long time!  HOWEVER......everything was fine and wonderful except the fact that they just weren't fresh.  These little bubble gum cigars were as hard as a rock!  The moral of the story is that being a "fun" item the shipping was as much as the cigars themselves....at least they could have been fresh and not hard.
