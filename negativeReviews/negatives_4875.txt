I am writing this because this product KILLED my in laws 2 year old YORKIE. They have been  eeding Yorkies for 18 years and this was the first product they have used, that KILLED one of there dogs. They started using this product this past summer. Sweetie (the dog) was chewing on the GREENIE chew in front of both of them, when she started convulsing.  They immediately took her a 1 2 mile to the vet, by the time they arrived there, Sweetie was DEAD.  The Greenie had Pierced her TRACHEA.  Please be aware od how dangerous these could be to small dogs.
