These are actually pretty good. I was not expecting to like them (I don't like chocolate and coconut together) but I did! They are soft and chewy and great for a snack. They are wheat, gluten and dairy free, so they are pretty good for those with allergies or food sensitivities.          Each bar has 180 calories, which is pretty standard. They do have 80 calories, or 9 grams, of fat, 2g of which are saturated. The rest of the contents are pretty good with 8g of sugar and 9g of whole grains. The ingredients are all things you can pronounce and has none of the weird chemicals.          The bar is pretty chewy and tasty. I liked it and may even buy them.
