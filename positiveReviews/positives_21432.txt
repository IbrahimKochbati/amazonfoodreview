If you love chocolate and want a non guilty pleasure, nutritionists recommend one oz. of dark chocolate above 70% per day.  As a friend said, chocolate is a vegetable  it's a bean!  I bought this bag of individually wrapped chocolates and have one for a tasty treat after dinner.  They are healthy and darkly rich and smooth.  I'm happy with one square, and frankly, it helps to have them individually wrapped so you can't keep  eaking off small pieces of a large bar.          One square is about 75 calories  it's a thin larger square and is satisfying.  If you want to spoil yourself, or someone else, with something that is good for them, consider these chocolates!  I love them.
