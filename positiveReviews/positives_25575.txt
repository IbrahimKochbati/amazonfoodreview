I was raised on the Caribbean drink "Sorrel" and there are limited options locally to find a good quality hibiscus flower.  I've resorted to the Internet and have purchased Ocho Rios and Flor de Jamaica but the price and shipping charges deterred me from regularly purchasing these products. This is by far my favorite in regards to quality and consistency and for a better price with Amazon Subscribe and Save.  The Davidson product's flowers are finer than those other products so you need to be careful with portioning if you are use to making sorrel with bigger flowers.  A little goes a long way with this product, which makes it far more economical to purchase this at Amazon. I make pitchers at a time, and sorrel is a cold drink that steeps overnight, so I cannot speak to making individual serving of tea. MexGrocer has a hibiscus product on Amazon that's pretty good, however I am getting more for my money with Davidson and it qualifies for Amazon prime so I save on shipping.  I didn't have any issues with the taste or potency as some other reviewers have stated.  I was raised on hibiscus flowers, and my sorrel tastes exactly how its suppose to.  Highly recommend.
