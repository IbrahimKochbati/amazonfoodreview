   class "tiny"  Length:: 0:28 Mins              I try to choose wet food for my cat that i would be willing to eat if someone bet me $50 or less to. For the record i'm a very picky eater.          The reason why i say $20 is because the can says cat food. If someone added some chicken  oth and threw it in a bowl with some egg noodles, i will drink it all up thinking its regular chicken noodle soup. It seriously looks yummy. There's chunks of veggies in there, which my cat surprisingly eats most of. When i was feeding him steak frites by Weruva, there would be a pile of just the veggies left behind when he was done. The peas are a bit hard, so that's the only thing he refused to eat in the can. If you take the time to squish it and get rid of the skin, it seems to make it more edible for him. but i really don't have time to do that for him.
