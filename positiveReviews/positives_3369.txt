My wife and daughter are Celiac but my son and I are not. We have been using Bob's Red Mill GF pancake mix and it's pretty good but you can tell it's gluten free. The pancakes we made today with this Bisquick mix were amazing. My mother, my son, and I could barely tell them from the normal wheat version on flavor. The texture is a bit different but they're light and fluffy unlike a lot of overly dense GF versions. We'll definitely be stocking up on this and using it with some of the old stand by regular Bisquick recipes to see how it works in them.
