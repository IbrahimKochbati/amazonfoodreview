When I ordered these, I thought they were a bit pricey, but I decided to give them a try anyway.  I'm glad I did!  My dogs absolutely love these dried liver treats.  And, since my dogs are all small, I can cut the treats in half and still have large enough pieces to satisfy them. They're great for training; I'll definitely order them again, and would recommend them to anyone.
