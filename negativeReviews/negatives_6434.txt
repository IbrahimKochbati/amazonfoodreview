I cannot tell whether this product is good or bad since it is nigh impossible to get much of it out of the tube.  I even put it in one of those tube rollers used for toothpaste and it still does not want to leave its "home." I have run it under hot water and that did not work.  My next plan is to take my box cutter and cut it open!  The person who "thought" this should be in a tube, should be fired.  They have obviously never tried to get it out!!
