These catfoods come in smaller cans, which is great for one serving. Upon opening, they look delicious. However, not all cats like it. I tried one of each with my two, who love fish and seafood, and they sniffed and walked away.     A neighbor's cat and two friend's cats loved it. So, as we all know with cats... they can be finicky! I would have to say give it a try and see if yours like it. They really look great, smaller cans store easily also.
