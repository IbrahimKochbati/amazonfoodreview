I really did not know what to expect.  They appeared a bit strange.  In fact, they did not look like a food product.  However, after just two minutes on high, I got a treat.  The rinds were better than I ever had.  Once cooled, they were perfect.  If hot, they were soggy.  I enjoyed them; my son, who is extremely fussy, enjoyed them.  I would absolutely buy them again.  I recommend them highly.
