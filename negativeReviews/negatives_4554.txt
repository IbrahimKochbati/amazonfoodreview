Very disappointed.  All the coffee and hot chocolate we made had a plastic like after taste.  When the unit is  ewing it gives off the same smell.  We thought it would go away over time, but it did not. It is very convenient with no mess and minimal clean up, but that does not make up for the bad after taste. Tried different coffees and they all had the same bad after taste. We are returning the unit.
