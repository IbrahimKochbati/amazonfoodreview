This is my 7 year old son's absolute favorite soup that he takes to school almost every day.  Despite my attempts to  oaden his taste buds he continues to insist that he wants this "red" soup every day with crackers.  My husband and I have also tried it and it is quite delicious.  Like all Amy's products you can feel good about giving your child this soup.  The ingredients are all organic and tasty.  I have offered my son Campbell's soups in a pinch when I have run out of the Amy's Alphabet soup but he really doesn't care for them.  If you read the label on Campbell's soup you will realize that they are loaded with junk.          Amy's soups cost a bit more than traditional canned soup but I think the extra cost is justified in higher quality ingredients and delicious taste.
