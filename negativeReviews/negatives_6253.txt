Tried one and it was horrible.  My son is 11 months old and have been eating cereals for a while (mix of Earth's Best and Gerber organic).  This is the first one that he doesn't like.  When I first opened the can, it smells like green apple candy.  However, the taste does not have any apple flavor, or even "grain flavor" like the other cereals but a little weird chemical tasting; not exactly sure how to describe it.          Back to Gerber & EB for my son...
