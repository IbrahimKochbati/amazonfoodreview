This is the first time I have tried an organic maple syrup.  Being a Grade A Dark Amber already promised great taste, but being organic added to the expectations.  The product has surpassed what I expected, with the warm, mellow taste that reminds me of northern woods, campfires, and the tingle of frost in the air.  After being raised on the authentic flavor of real maple syrup, artificial syrups are a big disappointment; this product enlivened the taste of my Saturday morning pancakes.
