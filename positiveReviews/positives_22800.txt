I'm so thankful that Trader Joe's is selling some of its products online!  This grain mix is one of the few items that our son will eat and the stash that I mailed home to Colorado when I was on the east coast for a conference is running low.  I wish Trader Joe's would come to Denver but this is a good stop gap.          Cook the mix with chicken  oth, add in goat cheese, tomatoes, Kalamati olives, and roast chicken and you have a quick and tasty meal!
