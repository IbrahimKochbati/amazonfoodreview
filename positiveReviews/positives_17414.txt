If you're in the same position as I am, and don't live near a Whole Foods or World Market, you might be paying lots of money per box at local or online boutiques. This is the second purchase of Amazon Barry's I've made, and it's been really good. The stuff is fresh, the price is right (especially if you get free shipping), and the tea is Barry's. If you can't drink 6 boxes of 80 bags all on your own, get a friend or two to go in with you
