I am always impressed when someone tries to solve an old problem in a new way. And I have never been happy hobbling my horse   I'd rather she could escape from a dangerous situation, and something unpredictable is far more likely to happen on the trail than at home. Sooo   here we have this device that is compact and weighs only 15 pounds, thus is easy to pack for trail rides. And since it operates on easily obtainable D cells, no problem being "off the grid".          The Fi Shock HC 100 Portable Paddock showed up in a nice durable red Cordura nylon case. The long part contains eight molded, reinforced plastic stakes with foot push tabs to make it easy to get the metal spikes at the bottom, into the ground. Their working height seems to be just about 3 feet. Multiple slots allow a variety of configurations in set up.          A smaller bag attaches to the pole bag with snaps. It contains 100' of conductive tape on a reel (no, I don't know why the product description says 200'), the transformer of nicely molded, durable looking green plastic, a transformer stand to be tamped into the ground, a shoulder strap, and two D cell batteries which I promptly put in a safer place so they couldn't accidentally contact conductive material and discharge.          This proved easy enough to set up in an area that is clear of tall  ush that could cause trouble when contacting the live tape. Properly set up, the paddock's batteries did not drain. Of course I carried extras. I also chose to guy the corners which I am used to with tents. Of course I had to  ing extra rope and tent stakes for that purpose. No problem.          This worked... for ONE not huge horse who is trained to electric fences, so she doesn't challenge them. Sure, any beast of her size could easily  eak out, but I'd want her to if in danger. No, I can't see how the stated 4 or 5 horses could be contained in this enclosure. But this a viable solution on the trail, for my mare.
