This is a very, very mild ginger tea.  I take at least 2 bags in 6oz of water to even taste it.     I also found the quality rather cheap compared to similar priced teas.  Here are just some of the problems I found:     1. Cannot open sachet without scissors.  Many are missing tear marks.     2. The tag falls off on half the tea bags.  So you end up fishing the bag out of your tea.     3. The tag is glued to the sachet on several (maybe 20%) of the bags.     4. The tea bag rips apart when opening the sachet or when squeezing out your tea.
