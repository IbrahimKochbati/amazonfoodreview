I am not one with a 'sweet tooth' per se.  I didn't care for it but maybe someone who is hungering for something sweet would. It was just too sweet for me. I thought maybe my 10yr old would try it and he did not either!     34g of carbs and 135 calories in this 8oz can, I think I will stick with good old H2O.
