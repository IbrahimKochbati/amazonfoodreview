This is for the regular flavor...     I give it zero starts, it was so bad.     Hard to believe this is food, and really hard to believe all of the good reviews.  I felt like I was eating packing material, and it left a slimy, yucky residue in my mouth.  Totally disgusting.  BBQ Stix are way better!
