This is by far the best doggy toy I have ever bought.  I wish it was a little harder to get the food out.  My dog Bailey is a master at pulling the rope stopper in and out to get out the little bits.  I tried putting in bigger dog treats, but they are too big.  Smaller dog food slides out pretty easily if Bailey gives the jar a whack.  He can get all the food out in under 15 minutes.  I need a puzzle toy that is more difficult so he can be distracted for hours.  If the puzzle toy is too difficult, he usually just gives up.          But it's an awesome toy because it makes your dog think a lot and keeps them distracted, because lord knows that if puppies aren't distracted, they are going to want to play with you!
