Amazon has the best price around for this product.  It's Organic.  It's whole wheat.  It tastes great.  I like the fuller taste (and healthier characteristics) of the whole wheat.  Our daughter loves it and you don't have to feel guilty about giving it to her.  Throw in veggies or tuna or eat it plain   it's a good meal.
