This shake is really tasty and is fairly filling too! It took me a while to figure out how to mix it   the first few times the protein would just clump up in my almond milk instead of completely dissolving. BUT this is easily fixed   just dissolve however much hempshake you will use in a little bit of water first, then add that to your milk! My favorite way to mix it is to add 3 tablespoons to just enough water to make it dissolve, then shake (it'll make a nice and thick mixture as the protein absorbs the water). Then I add enough unsweetened Almond Breeze to make it 1 cup. Makes a great  eakfast that's yummy and healthy!
