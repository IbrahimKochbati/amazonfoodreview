I am pregnant and have been enjoying a variety of decaf coffees for the last 9 months.  This coffee is the absolute best in decaf for Keurig.  I have tried probably 20+ different flavors and I can say with complete confidence this is my favorite.  I have had the Donut House regular and it is awesome as well.  I've drank it with cream hot and over ice.  Listen  I drink coffee every single day of my life since for like 15 years; I know what I'm talking about. decaf, regular, fresh ground, folgers, french press, hospital cafeteria, peculated, drip, instant, starbucks, dunkin donuts, Caribou, Gloria Jean's, mcdonalds  you name it I've had it.  This machine with this coffee is perfect for a decaf drinker.          Decaf can sometimes have an icky taste, this has a coffee house aroma and a smooth taste, not bitter or dirty or chalky.  I highly recommend it.
