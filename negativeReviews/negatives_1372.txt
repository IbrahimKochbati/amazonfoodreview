I tried this carrot juice for the first time today and regret buying it.  I took my first sip and actually wondered if someone had put pickle juice in the jar.  It was awful.  I've had several carrot juices and never had any as sour as this.  It is difficult to fathom how this product is still produced.  It has lemon juice in it, but apparently far far too much.  If you enjoy pickle juice with your carrot juice, you will love this product.  I don't.
