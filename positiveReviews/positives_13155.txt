I'm pretty sure a lot of us have tried the "Chef's" spaghetti, ravioli, etc.  These little microwaveable bowls make it so easy to have lunch, a snack, or dinner.  It's not only great for kids but it's good for adults, too.          It's nice to have a variety on hand when someone gets the "munchies" and doesn't have a lot of time to cook.  It's not gourmet by any means but definitely satisfies the appetite for a little Italian food......quick and easy.
