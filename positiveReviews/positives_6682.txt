A nutritionist recommended these to sweeten my coffee etc. as there are no negative after effects unlike artificial sweeteners.  Stevia is made from herb in South America. Japanese tea drinkers have been using stevia for years with no ill effects she said.  It's quite a bit sweeter than sugar, so you need less of it as a replacement.          I like this  and and put two packets in my iced coffee every morning with almond milk and 1 T cocoa  it tastes like a coffee milk shake for only about 70 calories as the Stevia is calorie free! The stevia makes it taste like an iced dessert drink and is a great, refreshing treat for the day.          This multi pack offer for this price is about 30% lower than what I can get NuStevia for locally.
