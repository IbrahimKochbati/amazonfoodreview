Rishi Tea Organic Earl Grey Loose Tea will appeal to those wishing a more subtle use of bergamot than other  ands that overwhelm the tea drinker with perfumed aroma. Personally, I prefer my Earl Grey to be somewhat more aggressive. The attractive packaging and the fact that the tea is organically grown by farmers who are fairly compensated are pluses.          Incidentally, I tried this tea first with no sweetener; and it tastes fine "straight"; however, because the bergamot is not strong, I found that I preferred it with a sweetener. Honey did not work for me with this tea; however, I found aspertame to work surprisingly well (Aspertame is usually one of my least favorite sweeteners).          The  ewing instructions are simple and work well.          It would be nice to have the option of buying this tea in tea bag form.          To sum up, this tea is a quality product with good taste, from a good source, but otherwise unexceptional.
