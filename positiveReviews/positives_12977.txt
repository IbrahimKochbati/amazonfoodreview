For someone who cannot resist kiwi flavored juices, unfortunately, THE SWITCH did not appear to have a kiwi berry taste.  However, the berry half stood out as well as the 100 % carbonated juice and after taste sweetness.  Indeed, this drink will appeal to a younger crowd and those who love a sweet carbonated drink that is not too heavily bubbly as a soft drink or too mild as any fruit juice.  And no doubt, it may satisfy that temporary thirst where drinkers will be switching for more.
