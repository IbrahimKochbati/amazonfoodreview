I use this in my  eadmaker but make it with warm milk and an additional egg, which greatly improves the texture. When made with just water and a small amount of butter, the crust comes out very, very chewy in my  eadmachine. I have also made this  ead and used carrot juice in place of the water, which makes it a beautiful color and naturally sweet.
