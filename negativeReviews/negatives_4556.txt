My wife's shop has a Keurig in her shop and she loved it.  She wanted to buy one and only went off visuals.  (It's black and had two cup sizes)  So to my happiness I found it on Amazon.  A taken aback was I after two weeks of backorder I finaly use at home.  In the instructions it says this is Keurig Classic B44.  Brews two cup sizes  SMALL AND SMALLER.  7.25 oz and 5.25 oz respectively.  So, it is great if you want to have tea with your imaginary friends and plastic Barbie china ware.  Not so great if you need it for your morning cup of Jose. Heck fire, it will not even fill up a normal sized travel mug   coffee cup.  I WOULD RECOMEND THE KEURIG ELITE B40 FOR PEOPLE WANTING TO HAVE THEIR COFFEE CLOSER TO AMERICAN PROPORTIONS.  The B40 will  ew 10.25 oz.          This Classic B44 is a waste of K Cups; I will not reccomend to anyone other than for tea conasewers.  At least Amazon steeped up to the plate and gave me a gift card refund so I can purchase the correct one.  Thanks Amazon!  Boo Keurig Classic (thumbs down).
