This is the third blend offered by Coffee Masters that I have tried. I have liked all three, and have only changed from one to the other to satisfy my curiosity and add a bit of variety to my life. The San Francisco Decaffeinated Blend is fine coffee. It is probable that I will try other Coffee Masters offerings, but this is not to say that I am in any way dissatisfied with the San Francisco Blend. I find that I have a distinct preference for Coffee Masters Coffee over other  ands, and the individual CM blend doesn't seem important.
