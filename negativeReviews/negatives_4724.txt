I loved half of these flavors, liked one, and dumped the one down the drain. I'm glad I ordered this six pack though so I didn't make the mistake of buying a three pack of one of the flavors I didn't like. Here's what I thought of them:          Vanilla   EXCELLENT! I've used this syrup in ice cream, coffee, diet cola, and even in a low carb crepe recipe. It's really good and one that I will re order on it's own.          Hazelnut   Yummy, rich flavor. It's great in coffee. I would order this again.          Raspberry   I loved this one also. It's great in coffee and berry smoothies.          Chocolate   I liked this one but it is VERY STRONG. Literally, one drop in a glass of diet cola will make it into a chocolate coke. It's good, but you don't need much. It didn't work well in coffee.          Irish Creme   I knew I wouldn't like this one so it remains unopened. I made a mistake of buying a three pack of this one once and hated it. I'll give it away to someone who will enjoy it.          CLASSIC Caramel   I don't know why Torani insists on making "Sugar Free Caramel Syrup" and "Sugar Free CLASSIC Caramel Syrup". The Classic Caramel is terrible. After experimenting and trying to find a use for this syrup I just dumped it down the drain. It's not worth it. Avoid this one.
