I love portable electric corrals.  They are a fantastic option for containing horses while camping, etc.  They are easy to use, give your horse some walking around room,  don't require a level set up area, are flexible for size shape, and are  small enough to keep handy in your trailer's tack room.  I much prefer using these to portable panels, high lining, tying to the trailer, etc.          There are many portable corral kits on the market, all very similar with the same kinds of components.  (Except the Zareba EZEE, which is a different animal.)  So I'll give you a component by component rundown on the items in this kit.          CHARGER   This kit comes with a charger that takes 2 D batteries.  I was leery of this, having had less than stellar performance from a 2D charger in the past.  But this one works pretty good, producing a reasonable strength zap with 100 feet of electric tape (with good grounding in damp, solid soil).  If your horse is already accustomed to and respectful of electric fencing, this should be sufficient.  The charger is easy to use, with the fence and ground terminals clearly marked.  The on off switch is very accessible, and a light and an audible sound tell you when it's on.          ELECTRIC TAPE     This kit is advertised as coming with 200 feet of Â½" tape.  My kit had only 100 feet.  100 feet is enough for one horse.  I don't know where they're coming with up the statement `perfect for containing 4 5 horses for short periods of time'.  No way, not even close, even if I had received the full 200 feet.  Of course, it's easy enough to pick up more electric tape at the farm store.  But beware that the more tape you add on, the less zap you'll get from your charger.  So I'm not sure if the 2D charger would be strong enough with 200 feet of tape.  The tape in this kit comes with a handle pre installed.  It's a nice handle with a good feel to it, but it doesn't connect nicely to the posts.  I rigged up an extra little tape loop to hook the  handle to.          STEP IN POSTS   These are my favorite kind of step in posts.  Each post has numerous clips to slide the tape through, so you can set at the right height.  It's very quick and easy to insert and remove the tape from the clips, making set up and take down easier.          CORNER GUY LINES   This kit comes with some very nice corner guy lines and metal  acing stakes.  Honestly, I'll probably never use them.  With this style of fence, there usually isn't much (if any) tension on the posts, so  I've needed corner guy lines.  Why add to set up and take down time?  But if you prefer to use the corner guy lines, I think you'll like the ones in this kit.  They are nice quality adjustable lines, with metal stakes.          WIRES, GROUND ROD, ETC    Of course this kit contains the necessary wires to connect the charger to the fence, and the charger to ground.  The ground rod is a 12" pointed spike.  Nothing special here.          CARRYING BAG   Oh my gosh, A+++ for this carrying bag!  The bag has one long skinny section for the posts, and a separate snap off zipper tote for the other components.  Within the smaller bag, there  are separate compartments and elastic holders for each piece.  No more jumble of stuff!!!  I love it.  (One quibble   one of the step in posts had pierced the bag during packing or shipping.  The bag is made of pretty heavy duty fa ic, but not quite heavy duty enough to stand up to a pointed spike.  And the ends of the bag are not reinforced to avoid this problem.)          All in all, this portable fence kit is about as good as any I've seen and would be a reasonable choice for anyone wanting a camping corral.  Just don't expect it to "contain 4 5 horses ", unless you're rotating those horses in and out one at a time.
