This is, hands down, the absolute best hot chocolate ever. First had it years ago in a little cafe in Va. Have been ordering it online ever since. Have also given it to friends & family as a gift and everyone raves about it. A wonderful taste of chocolate mixed with just the right spices. Try it once and you'll be hooked.
