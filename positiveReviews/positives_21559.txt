I think there are very few people who aren't almost always in a rush in today's world   rushing to from work, to pick up kids drop them off, to get to different events and activities and such, and often rushing through meals and eating something fast and easy that isn't always healthy for us.  Quaker's instant oatmeals come in handy because you can easily fit it into your busy schedule   at home or on the go.  Not only does it taste really good and is super easy to make, you can feel better about eating this rather than something loaded with suger or grease that you grab simply for the convenience.          Loaded with flavor this appeals to kids and adults both, add a little fruit and you've got a fantastic nutricious  eakfast (or lunch, dinner or snack!).
