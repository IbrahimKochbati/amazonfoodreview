I was first introduced to astronaut ice cream about 2 3 years ago and it is amazing and really fun to eat. I have a 4 & 8 year old boys and a 15 year old nephew that love these. They definitely are quite different from a real scoop of ice cream out of the freezer, but it is only in texture and the experience. I have since ordered these to give out at Christmas time for my son's classmates. I thought this would be a totally unique, great, and affordable gift for all of them and am sure most of them have not had this before. I definitely think everyone should try this at least once and if you don't want to buy the 15 packages you can order them individually and there's different flavors too. (There are 25 kids in the class so I ordered 2 of the bulk and then I'll have some left over for my nephew, boys, myself & husband).
