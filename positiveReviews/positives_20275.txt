This jam highlights the whole huckleberries, and is not too sweet. It is a real treat for those of us who have lost local huckleberry bushes to development or who no longer have the time to collect them.  The jam   ings back flavors that we thought were long gone.  A lovely bit of nostalfia for Christmas!
