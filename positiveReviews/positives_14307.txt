This food is an exceptional product.  I take care of a number of dogs and am very selective about the formulation of their food.  In particular, I have one with pancreatic insufficiency, requiring a low fat content, and a little fellow who has had a bout with gastroenteritis, so needed a food with a different protein source than chicken.  Both are healthy and happy with the Pinnacle Trout and Sweet Potato.     The only drawback, and it does not concern the food itself, is that Amazon uses FedEx for their delivery.  Apparently, when there is a holiday on a weekend, FedEx home delivery takes extra weekdays off.  Consequently my order arrived after my kids ran out of the food they needed.  It took 4 1 2 days for FedEx to get the parcel from the Columbus, Oh area to central West Virginia.  UPS was delivering while FedEx was still holding up my shipment, as my UPS driver passed here the day before my dog food arrived.  I have spoken to Amazon corporate headquarters about the fact that it appears UPS can get the job done more efficiently.  Perhaps a UPS option is in order for those customers who would rather not use FedUP...oops..I mean FedEx.  Hey, weren't these the guys that were hurling Christmas packages out of their trucks?
