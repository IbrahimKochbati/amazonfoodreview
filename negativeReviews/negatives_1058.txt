Normally I would not purchase coffee online as I have several coffee shops within a reasonable distance.  I saw this and figured "why not?"          This coffee was vacuumed sealed and was tight enough to where I had to use scissors to open it.  One thing I tend to avoid is pre ground coffee.  I usually like to grind my own beans as I find the taste is better.          The smell from the bag was for a lack of better words pretty basic.  Usually, there is a distinct smell depending on the bean and there can be faint traces of something.  There wasn't anything distinct about this coffee.          I used a standard drip maker which in itself was probably not the best choice but I suspect it would not matter as I was surprised that there really isn't a strong smell coming from the cup of coffee which I drank black.          The taste was kind of bland.  I did try a little piece of chocolate and it did seem to help.          Overall it's an ok coffee if you are not an aficionado.  However, it's not something I would add to my list of  ands I purchase.
