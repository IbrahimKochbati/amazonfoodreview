I was a huge fan of PDQ eggnog crystals and was sad when this product quit being produced. I happened upon this product and I'm so glad I took a chance. At first I made just one glassful and enjoyed it but something was missing and some of the crystals did not completely dissolve. I decided to make a half gallon of 1% organic milk in it's carton while adding nutmeg, cinnamon, and 2 tsp. of organic vanilla. I let it refrigerate over night and what a difference. Now it tastes more like real eggnog and is such an inexpensive easy to make year round treat. So today I will order another 9 pack or maybe 2 since one never knows how long a product will be stocked. Also AMZN definitively has the BEST price as other charge three dollars for ONE container. ENJOY!
