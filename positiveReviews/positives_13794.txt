PB2 is amazing!!! I was a little worried about trying it and I must say I was so pleasantly surprised. We have been using it every night in smoothies (peanut butter banana) and it is so good. I've even tried it on a sandwich. The taste is pleasant. It tastes more like an actual peanut. I would definately recommend.
