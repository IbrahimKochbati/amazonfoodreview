I am training for a half marathon.  At the start of my training I wasn't taking cherry juice.  As I increased my long runs each week my knees and hips were so sore.  I started to take this cherry concentrate and ever since then I have felt pretty good.  I take the juice every morning with my  eakfast.  It has a very strong flavor but mixes well with apple or orange juice.  The half marathon I'm running in is this weekend and I feel ready for it thanks in part to the cherry juice helping reduce the pain.  This stuff works for me.
