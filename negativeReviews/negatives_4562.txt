We have this model about a year now.  It hasn't worked right from the beginning.  We often had trouble closing the top.  Sometimes it doesn't work at all.  Other times it works like a charm.  When it works like a charm, it's not uncommon to find coffee grounds in the cup. It's a mess.  I bought the same model for the office. The experience was similar.  Sometimes it makes a full cup of coffee other times it doesn't.  Sometimes it won't even work at all.  We have to turn it on and off and cross our fingers. A friend reports these problems as well.  I agree with the reviewer who says, DO NOT BUY.  A waste of money for the machine,for the K cup that couldn't be used, and an exercise in frustration. We're in the market for a different  and.  When Keurig first came out, they had the market.  They have a lot of competition now . . . which hopefully will make it easier to find a machine that works well.
