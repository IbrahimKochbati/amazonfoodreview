I never buy pre ground coffee, we grind our own; however, I was tempted by the "low acid" offer, since I often have heart burn when I drink coffee.  I was extremely surprised with how GOOD this coffee tasted. Seriously, I had very low expectations, and I was blown away not only by the fact that I had less heart burn, but the taste was great!  It not only didn't taste like "low acid" coffee, it didn't taste pre ground.  That said, I was reviewing the prices for the low acid coffee, and it is waaay expensive.  Not sure I'll be buying it   probably just stick to my big mug of sweet tea.  If you can't leave coffee alone and you have heart burn, however, go ahead and try it.  Recommended for taste and low acid, not for cost.
