I've loved Caribou Coffee's Caribou Blend ever since my parents got me a Keurig for my birthday a year ago with a sampler of coffees to go with it.  Caribou was my favorite next to Newman's but I find the prices at some places rather off putting.  When I saw Amazon's deal on them, I had to act.  And I'm glad I did.  The shipping free super saver shipping was really fast and I didn't have to  eak my bank to get it.  Will definitely purchase again!
