I can't remember when I've had a cup of coffee so delicious, I immediately wanted another cup.  There is no bitter taste, no funny chemical taste you get with so many flavored coffees, no odd aftertaste.  It's just a mellow, gorgeous, hazelnut with a touch of the islands cup of coffee.  Outstanding.  My favorite I've ever tried, and I've tried most!
