This is a great interactive toy.  We used it for every feeding.  A great way to slow down the doggie vacuum cleaner.  Unfortunately, the toy is made of hard plastic and while we didn't care about the noise, the plastic itself eventually cracked from the beating on the hard floors.  We continued to use the toy cracked, until the lid finally cracked and was no longer able to be screwed on.  All said, the toy lasted about two months.  You decide if the price is worth it.  For us, we'll be looking for an interactive feeding toy that is made of hardier material.
