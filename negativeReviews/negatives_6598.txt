I loved the taste of this tea, and then one day I read the ingredients: it contains modified corn starch! Really?  In tea? First of all, talk about the Glycemic Index of cornstarch (85 or so). Plus, 80% of all corn in the US is Genetically Modified, and I somehow doubt that Lipton is into buying organic corn. There is no way I'm ever going to buy this again.
