My husband is originally from Germany and enjoys good hearty  eads with hard crusts.  I order this mix from Amazon.com with him in mind.  Unfortunately we were disappointed because the  ead did not rise as expected.  It did get a thick crust, but was not crusty like the  eads in Germany. It was actually "tough".     I used the  ead maker to prepare it and followed the directions to a T.  Perhaps the yeast was inferior.  Checked the date on the mix and it was not expired.     So I will not be purchasing it again.  In fact, I have the second two packages sitting on the shelf.
