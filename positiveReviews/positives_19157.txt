I never drink flavored coffee, but this one is amazingly good.  I do love the combination of raspberry and chocolate in general, so I took the plunge.  This is delicious coffee. The raspberry flavor is so natural, not too jammy or sweet   and it mixes well with the subtle chocolate and rich coffee. Not for my morning  ew, but a nice afternoon blend.
