Chewy Lemonhead and Friends are my favorite candy. Period. I love them...so much.     ...(cough)     So when I found these I was really excited and bought a pack hoping they'd have that same tartness that makes Lemonhead and Friends so good!     Nope. Tasted just like every other jelly gummy type candy. I was very let down. It was okay for jelly gummy, but don't expect much.
