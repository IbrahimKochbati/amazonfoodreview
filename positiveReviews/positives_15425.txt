These figs are firm on the outside and somewhat soft on the inside. I can just feel the health radiating through my body *wink* when I eat them. I dipped them in extra dark heart healthy chocolate, put each one in a mini heart muffin paper, and gave as valentine gifts instead of the usual boring, bad for you chocolates.
