I'm a secret Cheeto addict, but these baked cheese curls are even more flavorful and addictive than the original.  And they are healthier, which makes them the perfect snack. No artificial cheese flavor, excellent crispy texture and sharp cheese taste.  I'm on my third case now and will continue to order this gem of a snack.  Worth a try if you love cheese curls.
