My cats both LOVE this food.  I've had varying success with about 7 different kinds of canned food.  This one is a hit with both.  It's natural, mostly organic, doesn't have any junk or fillers, and I have peace of mind knowing that we're giving them high quality food from an ethical company.  Since they've been on this diet they are more active, alert and happy.  Their coats are so soft and shiny and they seem to be shedding less.  Cannot say how relieved I am to have finally found a food they like that is so good for them as well.  It is pricey but if you want to save on costly vet bills down the road due to illness caused by poor nutrition, this is the way to go.
