This is first time I had ever tried or heard of Melitta coffee, though I had used some of their filters (which I like).  I drink coffee everyday (about 3 cups in the morning) and like "between roast"  which is between medium and a dark coffee.  I also like coffee that is not bitter but has a strong kick to it.  I tested a medium roast from Melitta and found it to have a pleasant smooth flavor and was very nice to drink.  It was not bitter at all.  I tried it both black and with sugar and cream and enjoyed it both times.  I generally do not drink black coffee but this  and was pleasant when served black.  I usually drink Community Coffee (a local Louisiana  and) and enjoy that  and's strength. Melitta does not have a strong flavor or "kick" to it.  I very much enjoyed it and would consider buying it if my regular  and was not available.
