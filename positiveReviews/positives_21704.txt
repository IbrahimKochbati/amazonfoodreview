I like this because I can add some sour without adding a lemon or lime flavor.          If you can imagine tasting something which has the tart flavor of lime juice without any citrus flavor (to me anyway) this is what you get.          Also has a natural sugar cane kind of sweetness to it.          hint: i sometimes put a dab on my finger and taste it just for fun.. it's a nice candied flavor!
