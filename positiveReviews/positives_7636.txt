Although I eat a ton of fruits veg, I have to admit I was looking for a "quickie" fiber boost, and I wanted to avoid psyllium because of the phytic acid properties that block absorption of certain medications and supplements (I take many of the latter).          Sprouting reduces phytic acid, and is recommended by many in the nutrition communities for "safely" preparing oatmeal, barley, etc.          So I got the sprouted Navitas  and chia powder shown here, but at Whole Foods.  I have to say...this stuff is terrific.  I put 3 TBs (1 serving) in about 1 4 cup of warm filtered water, and stirred it, and watched as it kind of puffed up...tasted it...and you know what?  It kind of tasted like oatmeal or barley.  I intended to add this slurry into my green smoothie, but I liked the way it tasted so much, I just ate it with a spoon.          My recommendation is to add a little warm water to the powder, and stir it up before mixing it into whatever you are eating  or just eat it straight as I did.          I'm going to buy this  and in bulk at Amazon  and I'll make sure it is the sprouted powder and not the seeds.          By the way, I read on a review posted about the Navitas chia SEEDS that they make a kind of "tapioca" by adding coconut or almond milk and stevia to the chia seeds...so I tried doing that with the powder...it created a kind of soft, puffy pudding texture, and it was definitely in the "treat" category.
