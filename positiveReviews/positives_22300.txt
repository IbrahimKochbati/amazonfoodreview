Our nearby Fresh and Easy grocery store has a small section of premium soft drinks and some of them are really good. Just recently I purchased a 4 pack of Izze Sparkling Blackberry. It's an assortment of concentrated fruit juices dominated by blackberry with added carbonated water. The label says 70% fruit juices. This is not your average fruit flavored soda pop, folks. This is real fruit juice and with no added  sugar. The taste is delicious and the blackberry stands out real nicely. The drink has a lot of natural sugars, but you don't get that sickening sweet taste I associate with so many of the  cheaper soft drinks. In fact, the drink has a slight sour bite to it and it's very pleasant. This stuff is more expensive, but maybe it's worth it. Personally, I'm looking forward to trying some of the other varieties.          Gary Peterson
