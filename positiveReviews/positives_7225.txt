I'm not a coffee snob, barely drinking a cup a week, but my significant other needs a strong mugful every morning.  The pods and the Senseo machine are perfect for this; barely takes 2 minutes to  ew.  The 6 pack box comes out to about 30cents a cup even with the added latte packets (60cents when two are used for a strong mug serving).  Wonderful aroma and works well with the flavor packets.  I'm hoping the money saved by avoiding Starbucks every morning will go to my potato chip addiction....
