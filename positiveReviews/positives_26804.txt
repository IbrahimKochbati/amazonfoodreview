I have been purchasing Flavigny's Violet Pastilles for more than 30 years.  They are hard to find, so I'm glad I could find them online.  Whenever I come across them, I always get some for my  other and now for both my sons.  I take them to work with me and when I offer them to co workers, they always ask me where I get them!  A nice conversation starter and friend maker.
