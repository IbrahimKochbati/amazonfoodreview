I was  owsing threw the snack isle of my local warehouse store and spotted a bag of Kirkland Signature Cashew Clusters with Almonds and Pumpkin Seeds. Hmmmm. Nice ingredients! Lightly held together with a candy glue and cut into little squares. Well, how could I possibly  resist? Into the shopping cart they went along with a nice looking bag of trail mix. I love snacks like this. They're tasty and satisfy my snacking urges, yet they're made out of nutritious ingredients including protein and fiber. Did I mention that they're fresh and delicious? Plus, they have limited saturated fat, no trans fat and not very much sugar. Mmmmm, good. A Perfect treat, just so I don't eat too many.          Gary Peterson
