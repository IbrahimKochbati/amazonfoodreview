I live in the Kansas City Area and could not find them anywhere.  I had bought them before at the Commissory in Leavenworth but couldn't find them here.  Someone recommended checking Amazon.com and I was thrilled to find them there.  They are easy to fix and if you like pork rinds, you won't go back to the bagged ones.
