Making coffee is such a ritual and having these handy creamers in the pantry makes for a very nice treat when it's time for a hot cup of coffee.  They are also kept in the  eakroom and since they do not have to be refrigerated they make for a very nice option for our clients.  Great value too since we can purchase such a large number of cups at one time.  Very handy on the road too.  Toss a few in a  iefcase or in the car and have them if you are on the road and want to flavor your coffee when on the road.
