My kitty eats all the flavors of Natural Balance Platefulls on rotation, and loves all of them equally. He gets dry food in the morning, and a pouch for dinner every night. His coat is GORGEOUSLY soft and shiny, and these pouches don't give him nasty gas or rowdy bad  eath like some other canned pouch foods. When I first opened a pouch, I saw that it had peas and carrots in it, and I figured those would be left behind in the bowl. Cats just...don't eat vegetables. To my surprise, the bowl was licked clean! And after 3 months, he still licks the bowl clean every night!
