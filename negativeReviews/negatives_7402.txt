This was mostly sauce with 5 ravoili in it. I counted them! I guess I'm luckier than the reviewer who had maggots in theirs though. To top it off I hate the lid system. To hard for me to get the darn lids offs. Cut my finger once on the plastic lid. I'll stick to the canned ravoili. That is good & you get something to eat.
