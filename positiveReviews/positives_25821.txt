I love Italian roast coffee.  While this is not the "best" cup of coffee I've ever had it is very good for a Keurig cup.  The roast is nice and dark, but no bitter aftertaste, and does not have the almost burnt taste of some dark roast K cups I've had.  It still has a robust flavor when you use it to  ew the largest size.  This is a good cup of coffee.
