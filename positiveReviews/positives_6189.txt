Bought these for my two dogs, one and English Mastiff and the other a Black Mouth Cur [...].  I thought it might keep them occupied for at least an hour as other reviewers had stated. Well, of course, my dogs had to be different. 10 minutes flat, all chewed and gone. I might add, both of my dogs are aggressive chewers and that's the reason I went looking for something that would last. For other dogs, who chew normally, it may well last for an hour or so.          They both love these bones and this packaging is a great buy. I will continue to buy and give as a weekend treat for my boys.
