I got this product hoping that my dog will have something good to chew every day. But 15 min (if not less) after eating the chew, my dog had a diarrhea. Amazing! Never seen anything work so fast in that direction. So I had to take him out for a walk every 30 min that night. It was that bad! I thought I will send the product back, but started to read reviews. Found one saying that you should give this chew after the meal. Next time I gave my dog Kong stuffed with his regular food, and then half of the chew, and then more food in Kong. 15 min went ok, and he did not have to run outside. Later same day I did it again   food chew food, and he was fine. And I have to mention that he is a big boy and never had problems with his stomach before. And he eats different things.     Two things I can summarize   watch your dog during and after you give the chew, and give some food either before or right after the chew is gone.
