This coffee has a nice flavor, is strong yet not overwhelming and doesn't give that stomach upset that pops up occasionally.  I have been using it in a french coffee press and have been very pleased with the outcome. Having spent some time in Germany I became obsessed with finding a substitute for German coffee that wouldn't be as expensive as buying the imported German blends.  This comes about as close as you can get to the flavor and aftertaste with the added benefit being low acid.  I think it would be even better in a regular coffee maker as opposed to  ewing in a french press because it is a very finely ground coffee.
