I have two dogs that received this gift from Santa and figured it out pretty quick since Santa pre filled it. They play with it until it is empty... as most dogs would, I suspect, since they can smell the food inside. They seem to really enjoy it. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it needs really small bits of food treats and is not so easy to fill. I end up with quite a bit of food on the floor while trying to fill it. I might try to find some really small cookies to put inside to cut down on the frustration of filling it. My dogs like it though and that is all that matters to me!
