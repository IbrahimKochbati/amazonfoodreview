John Cope's Dried Corn has been a tradition in our family for generations.  My Grandmother was from PA and moved to Newfoundland Canada in the 1920's.  Our American relatives have been keeping us supplied since then, unfortunately many of my Father's cousins have passed away and we were thinking the tradition would be lost.  I am so thankful that you have made this available on Amazon.  It's going to be a New Year's surprise for my 85 year old Dad.  It will mean so much to him.
