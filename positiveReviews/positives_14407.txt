I bought these for my 13 year old pug, who has very bad hips and arthritis, and very few teeth.          Poor ole girl, she's a sweetheart, but getting around was hard on her.  These are soft, so she can chew them with no problem, and while she's still stiff if she's been sleeping a long time, she loosens right up once she starts moving.          She was on Metacam, which worked just about the same, but is waaaay more expensive.  I love that these are made in the USA and part of the profits are donated to the Dog and Cat Research Fund.  These are just a win win win all around for us!          Almost for got to mention....she loves them!
