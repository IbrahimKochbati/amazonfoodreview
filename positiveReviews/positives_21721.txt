These are the best tasting green splits I've ever had.  I love creamy soups, split pea being one of my favorites, but it's not usually easy to make a delicious creamy soup without adding some sort of meat flavoring (I don't eat anything that used to have a face). These peas are delicious without having been cooked with any sort of meat chicken based flavorings.  Nice and fresh no more of those gray colored little things sold in plastic bags at the grocery store. These peas even smell fresh in the bag (which is a nice drawstring muslin).
