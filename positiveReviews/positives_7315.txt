I thought that I should post a review in response to bad cat.  We ordered off the same batch for the same holiday reasons and had no illl effects.  The coffee was great.  There was no tart aftertaste no matter how strong you  ew it.  The only reason that I gave it only four stars is that I would personally of liked a litter darker roast.  I just wanted to say that we drank off the same lot as bad cat, in the same year, Christmas Eve and Christmas, with zero headaches or ill tidings.  It just might have been something else.
