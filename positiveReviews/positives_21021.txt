Remember how good a soda fountain milk shake used to taste?  Creamy, rich, absolutely delicious.  Wish you had one now?  Well, there is something that is just as mouth watering  and that's Gatorade Nutritive Shake.           Plus, this shake contains carbohydrate protein and vitamins that my fondly remembered shake did not.  It not  only tastes good but it's good for you.  I'm going to keep it on hand for those days when I can't stop for lunch or have to zip out of the house without  eakfast.           However, I still miss soda fountains!              Gail Cooke
