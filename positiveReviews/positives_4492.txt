I'm a profecinal cat trainer and have used several different treats including raw freezdried raw  home made and comercial treats over the last 10 years. These treats take the cake and run. OMG all cats  clients cats love these treats. They are the onlything i will ever use for training again. Best cat treat on the market. just dont forget to cut them up in little pieces there to big for your average house cat.          If you have a finiky cat that dosnt like to eat. well here is your god send. Just crush some up and toss there food in it. Its a garanteed way to get them to start eating again. Dont use a ton since its high in fat.
