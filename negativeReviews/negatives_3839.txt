pros:     1) 100% juice     2) no corn syrup     3) no extra sugar added     4) gluten free          cons:     1) Cans are too small     2) Price way too high (probably because of the 100% juice)     (you could get 24 cans of arizona ice tea at the grocery store for roughly the same price, and arizona cans are like 3x as big)     3) too sweet tasting, not that refreshing .          In conclusion, I probably wouldn't recommend it.
