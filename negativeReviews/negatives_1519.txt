It's a refreshing drink when served cold. A bit sweet when warm. A little tart, but tolerably so.          The flavor is less orange than tangerine, yet I can distinguish several different "layers" of citrus in it, including the orange. It's an interesting sensation.          I am a little bugged by the fact that an 8.3oz can (2 3rd size) manages to pack more junk calories in than a full sized can of cola. It's also supposed to be 100% juice, but reconstituted grape juice is practically pure sugar and there are "natural flavors" noted in the ingredients list as well as a soy warning which to me implies some sort of MSG, probably added with the citric acid.          So, maybe it's not an especially healthy beverage. It's still tasty and provides a diversion from more typical sodas.
