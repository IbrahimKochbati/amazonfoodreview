I was all set to buy these thinking they'd be great for my dog.  Then I found:          "At least 13 dogs have died after being fed the top selling pet treat in the country, owners and veterinarians have told CNN. The problem comes because the treats, called Greenies, become lodged in a dog's esophagus or intestine and then some veterinarians say they don't  eak down. A CNN investigation uncovered 40 cases since 2003 where a veterinarian had to extract a Greenie from a dog after the treat became lodged either in the animal's esophagus or intestine. In 13 of those cases, the pet died."          The directions also tell customers to monitor dogs to ensure the treat is adequately chewed and to always offer water after feeding. "Gulping any item can be harmful or even fatal to a dog," the directions say.          Some vets and pet owners say the directions are unrealistic.  "These things tend to be wolfed down," said Dr. Brendan McKiernan, a board certified internist at the Wheat Ridge Animal Hospital outside Denver. "They are meant to be chewed carefully, but that's like giving a sharp knife to your 2 year old. Dogs can't be controlled that way."  [...]          Even though the info from these links may be BEFORE they improved them, and considering the following quote:  "At the end of the day ... literally millions of Greenies are enjoyed by dogs on a weekly basis with absolutely no incidents,"     [...]          I'm still extremely leary.
