This is the primary way our Bouvier gets fed.     1) It's a challenge, she keeps her doggy mind and paws busy.     2) It eliminates gulping, so she can't inhale her dinner. She needs about 20 minutes to empty the jug.     3) So far ( after 9 months ) no problems with  eakage or chewage. This could be because we always set it out on the hall carpet, so it bangs less on the hardwood!
