One of the tastiest products I've ever eaten!  My husband and I love it; we are cruising sailors, and this dish is perfect for a sailboat underway; small amount of water,short cooking time, foolproof results. Our favorite way is to use 1 2 package (there's just the 2 of us), mix it with a can of salmon and a bunch of capers. YUM!!
