Preferences for type of coffee varies from person to person, so I'm not surprised some people like this  and and some do not. I drink coffee every day and have tried many different types. I've never tried low acid coffee before so was not sure what to expect.  In my opinion, this was very good.  It has a rich, dark roasted "starbuck like" taste.  I recommend trying it.
