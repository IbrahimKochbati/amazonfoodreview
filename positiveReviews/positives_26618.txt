I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but purchased this flavor for my husband. He is normally a "bold" taste coffee drinker, but says that this is now his favorite. He says it is not too strong and it's not too weak. It's just a nice "medium" blend of flavor. Because he was such a bold coffee drinker prior, I stocked up. I keep trying to get him to drink the bold stock and he only says: "Do we have any more of that Caribou?". Well, looks like I'll be ordering much more of his new favorite coffee soon!
