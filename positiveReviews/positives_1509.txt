I bought one of these about 4 or 5 months ago   and I LOVE it!  I have kept a combination of Rosemary, Thyme and parsley.  They have all kept fresh for more than 4 WEEKS!  No  own spots, no rotten leaves   just perfect.          I Highly recommend this product   no problems with leaks or the plug not holding.
