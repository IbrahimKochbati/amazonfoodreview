This is a really nice coffee to have around during the holidays.  It has a festive taste, although I agree with other reviewers the pumpkin does not have a strong presence, if any at all.  But it does taste spicy and I have enjoyed it every time I make it.  It is especially good paired with homemade cookies and cakes as well as  eakfast baked goods, such as coffee cakes.
