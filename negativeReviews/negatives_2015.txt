As coffee in general, this Wolfgang variety was alright. However, I was expecting a "Creme Caramel" taste, or something similar, and I don't feel this delivered. I tried multiple cups at different cup sizes and this coffee just didn't do it for me. It is marketed as a flavored coffee, yet I could not taste anything beyond the flavor of coffee.
