Great popcorn at a great price.          I use the 8oz bags in my popcorn machine 8oz popper I bought from from Discount Tommy. The popper and the 8oz bags have been a     big hit with the family and the kids friends for every movie night and sporting event we watch.          My 8oz popper creates enough popcorn for all the friends and they all love it.          If you have a commercial style 8oz popper I would totally recommend these. The popcorn tastes delicious. I have bought 3 cases over the years and will be back to Discount Tommy when I need more.
