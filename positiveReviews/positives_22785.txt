If you have been looking for the "REAL" theater popcorn flavor, you found it!          Very good popcorn. If you use all of the package's ingredients, you might end up with popcorn on the salty side, but that can be adjusted by not using the whole content of the salt package.          I have several people tasted this popcorn and they all agree that it tastes like movie theater popcorn.          I definitively recommend this popcorn.
