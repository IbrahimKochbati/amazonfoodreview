(Three times I've tried to post a review of these and it never goes through... forgive my a uptness.)          Popchips? As in, potato chips puffed like popcorn? You got it, bub. Surprising lightness to them  much more so than expected, which allows the taste of the toppings (in this case, chili lime) to seem supercharged. This can be a good thing or not, depending on how sensitive your tongue is. Also, the texture is passing strange at first. Takes a bit of getting used to, but once you're used to it, you'll be popping these like, well, popcorn.
