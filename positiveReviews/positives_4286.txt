I have 3 chihuahuas and I thought these would be better for them since they are smaller than a full ear. They still were too much for the little guys. I would say a dog 20 30+ pounds should be able to handle them better than my 8lb guys.     They had a strange smell and felt slightly oily to the touch. I don't know if that was something added to them to preserve them or it was natural.     My chihuahuas are fussy and they liked them I was just worried about blockages since they seemed to swallow large chunks of them. They didn't have any problems and my 4lb was able to handle them I just wouldn't buy them again since my guys are too small. The bags were a good size for the price. I bought three and should have bought one bag.     I rated them 4 stars since they were of good quality just better for larger dogs in my opinion.
