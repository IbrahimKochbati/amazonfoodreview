I am a big Quaker Oats  and fan.  But, these cookies are horrible.  And that's not just my opinion.  Two others in my family sampled this cookie and were equally appalled at its taste.  So, let's start there.  This cookie is almost tasteless:  no almond flavor; nor chocolate; and there is no pronounced earthy oatmeal flavor, too.          The cookie is soft, and while I don't care for soft cookies, the other two do, but this soft baked oatmeal cookie didn't win any fans between them.  To Quaker's credit, they individually wrap each cookie to maintain its softness.          Each cookie is nearly 200 calories for barely more than an ounce of pleasure.  The box's photo leads one to believe there are large chunks of chocolate and almonds lodged in each cookie.  That's just not the case  unless you are viewing them with a magnifying glass.          In our house, cookies cannot get stale.  They're gobbled up and gone in no time.  It's no exaggeration to say that this less than half eaten cookie sat on the kitchen counter for over 24 hours and would be there still, had we not thrown it into the garbage can.          Overall, this new product is a disappointment.  If it were possible to rate it below one star, that's what it would earn.          Quaker, we love you, but send your bakers back into the test kitchen.  This one's a dud!
