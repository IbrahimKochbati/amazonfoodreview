My experience with soft drinks has been mostly limited to the major  ands so this was quite a change   these sodas have a much cleaner( less chemical)and therefore more refreshing taste than the Coke 7up Canada Dry variety.  The cane sugar and glass bottles seem to make all the difference( although I still prefer Canada Dry to Boylan's Ginger Ale).     $3.25 per 12 oz. bottle is a bit steep. I would check your local specialty markets to see if they carry this; unfortunately, the nearby Trader Joes dropped this product so I'll have to check Gelson's or Whole Foods.
