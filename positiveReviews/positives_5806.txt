I bought this and a grinder (and a couple other varieties of course salts) as a gift for my spouse at Christmas.  I know he enjoys the visual appeal of the coarse ground salt and I was tired of buying the $2.99 use and toss grinders of salt at the grocery store.          As far as this salt goes, you should NOT use it in a grinder because it is too moist.  I did not know this until after I had purchased it.  I still use it as a finishing salt, but for the use I had in mind, grinding on food, it does not work.
