I truely enjoyed it. Ive always enjoyed the atomic bomb candy, and that is the closest thing I can say it tastes like. It burns a bit, but not a big deal really. And it certainly does keep you awake. I drank it my shift that involved sitting in a elevated position staring at a whole lot of nothing for 14 hours. Kept me awake the entire time. I approve.
