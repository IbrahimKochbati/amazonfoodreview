I had no idea something could taste this good. I'm not really a caramel person, but if I had dreamed up the most perfect balance between sweet salty buttery richness it would be these Caramel Sea Salt Squares. I found them at Whole Foods and they are expensive, but worth every penny. Milk is the perfect compliment. Get some and you will not be disappointed. You may be ruined for chocolate  ownies.
