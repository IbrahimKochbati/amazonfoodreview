I am giving this 5 stars based upon my wife's feedback (I would have given it 4 stars on my own). I am not a huge fan of French Roast (dark seems redundant based upon my experience with other French Roasts &lt;g ). I do like dark roasts, but French Roast tends to be a little too strong for my tastes, however, my wife loved the flavor.          The selling point seems to be the low acid, I cannot say one way or the other as to the effect on heartburn, even though I do occasionally get heartburn, it usually isn't associated with coffee drinking coffee, so the fact that I did not experience it after drinking 2 3 cups of this coffee is not conclusive regarding lower acid.          Bottom line, for those that love a really rich, strong flavored coffee that may or may not reduce you incidence of heartburn associated with coffee drinking, this seems like a possible choice, certainly worth a try if you have actually stopped drinking coffee due to heartburn.
