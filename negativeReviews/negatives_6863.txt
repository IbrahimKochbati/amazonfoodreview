This popcorn is distinctly different tasting from the Country Time, and not in a good way! My initial thought was that it was "stale"  though in date, and both of us (hubby and self) got an upset stomach from eating it, like you do at the movies if you add their "butter". I would return this if I could I've had it since July, and just opened the pack last night) and would not recommend it, at least not for the big home popcorn machines. AND, has a higher calorie count and fat count than the Countrytime, too! (Sort of explains the upset stomach, I guess!)
