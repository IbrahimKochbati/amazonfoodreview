When I received the box of green tea, I realized I had ordered the wrong tea. I had wanted to purchased the  Stassen "Pure Jasmine Green Tea". So, I sent it back to the company the next day and asked them to please send the Jasmine tea instead. That was more than a month ago, still no tea or response.  Last week I decided to order another box. I don't know if it was from the same company through Amazon but, I got it in less than a week.  I doubt I'll ever see the other box or my $13.00 again, but thank you for the speedy delivery on this one.  I have always had incredibly great service with Amazon...amazing in fact...but, I don't know what happened with the one before.  Let me just say that the Jasmine Green Tea by Stassen is the best ever! About 5 years ago I was in Seattle and visited a restaurant where they served this tea with the meals. It was refreshing and light so I asked the name of it. I have been ordering this same tea ever since and enjoy a cup first thing in the morning with my meditation routine. You can't beat the price and it's so worth it.
