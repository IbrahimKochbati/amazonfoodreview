Although these are said to be "hull only," there are still a lot of seeds  so much so that I can't cook with these until I have sorted through and removed all the little black devils lurking amongst the delicious hulls. If you find that your dishes have an unpleasantly gritty texture, the seeds are to blame. Delicious, but not as advertised.
