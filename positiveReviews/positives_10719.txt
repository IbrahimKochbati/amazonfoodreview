My dog loves this stuff.  No dog I've offered it to has rejected it.  The treats are hard, so older dogs and or dogs with teeth issues will have a hard time.  The treats, even when  oken in half, are about an inch square and 1 4 inch thick, so small dogs may have problems as well.  They don't crumble easily, so transporting them in one's pockets doesn't leave one with a gooey mess after doing laundry.  I'm pretty sure they are pricier than the treats one gets at the supermarket, but I'd spring for them once or twice a year for special treats, as opposed to the "normal" treats I give Bruno when he is doing what he's supposed to do even though he'd like to be doing something else.
