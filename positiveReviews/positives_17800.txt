I've found that young cats and elderly ones have an easy time with this flavor. I've always added at least 2 tablespoons of water to the "pate" form of Friskies' food. It certainly doesn't diminish the flavor from what I can tell of the cats' dishes that are licked so clean I sometimes think they look better than when I wash the dishes.
