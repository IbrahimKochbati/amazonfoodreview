Has a funky taste, thought would be interesting to try given the high reviews.  Not sure where these are coming from?  Thought this was the worst coffee I've ever had and no one I've given a cup to thought it was any good.          Going to stick with my Cafe Escapes Cafe Mocha.  Their Chai Latte is also very good.  Cafe Escapes is probably the best  and I've had in K Cups so far.
