The first thing you notice when you open a tin of Twinings Lady Grey          (beside the redolence of bergamot oil mixed with the aroma of black tea and lemon which is a staple of the *Earl* Grey Teas) is the striking visual pattern of the loose tea:          Dark dry tea leaves sprinkled with  ight dots of dry orange peel and stunningly blue cornflower petals.  It is almost as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds. Milder and less caffeinated than the Earl, this mix has become a permanent inhabitant of our pantry and our tea cups for almost 5 years now.          Note that unlike Earl Grey, *Lady Grey* seems to be a Trademark of the Twinings Co.  If you are looking for a similar tea that is not manufactured by Twinings, you may have a hard time figuring what is the exact equivalent.  For example, some other companies market a blend called "Pouchkine" or "Afternoon Earl Grey" which essentially are milder versions of the traditional Earl Grey and lack some proprietary Twinings only ingredients (most notably, the cornflowers).
