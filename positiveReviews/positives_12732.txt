While I don't eat this every day, it is a nice treat now and again, either as a  eakfast cereal or just right out of the box. Watch for the sales    a price dip plus a Subscribe and Save order can  ing the per box cost well below what a supermarket charges (even with a coupon).          Tasty and fun    always good to find a food item that fits both those criteria.
