Would of given this 5 star if it was cheaper. I love the small cans for convenience but not willing to pay for the cost of it. I liked that their was no gagging fishy smell as some cat foods have. My cats loved this food and would of eaten 2 cans at a time if I let her. I will consider keeping this on hand for those times when I need the small can convenience. However, can not afford to purchase this all the time.
