*Warning* These chips are like eating a raw habanero pepper.          This is literally the hottest processed food product I've ever eaten. I use to think what I normally ate was pretty hot, until I tried these. They taste pretty good, but good luck trying to eat a whole bag in one sitting. I can barely get down 10 chips before my nose and eyes are watering and my mouth is on fire. I'd compare their taste, texture, and crunchiness to Tim's Cascade Jalapeno (which I love,) but they're probably around 5 times as hot as those chips. Don't get me wrong, these things are pretty tasty, but I'm still working on polishing off my first bag that I received 3 days ago.          I'm probably going to keep some for myself to eat, since they don't go bad for a year from now, but the others I'm probably going to use for pranks on my family and friends. Only takes one chip to set your mouth on fire.  D
