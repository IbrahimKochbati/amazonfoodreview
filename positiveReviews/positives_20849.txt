I love this stuff!  I routinely went through one package a week because it was so well made and seasoned.  All of my local stores stopped carrying this  and, and none of the others even come close to the goodness of Melissa's.  It is a perfect ingredient for potatoes, eggs, beans, Mexican pizza, tacos, chili stew, tons of things.          I am glad I found it here so I no longer have to go through my Soyrizo withdrawals. (Unfortunately the online price is quite a bit more expensive than finding it locally, which was around $3.50 a package or so.)
