   class "tiny"  Length:: 0:55 Mins              I bought this gum for my grandbaby who has been asking for sour gum.     well after tasting this myself it is anything but sour. the flavor seem     to be more sweet while it lasted for all of maybe 2 minutes then it tasted like paper,     well actually paper tastes better. This is the kind of gum your kids spits out     as soon as it becomes soft. it's too bad you cannot rate less than 1 this gum is a zero     especially at $10.00. I also bought some crybaby sour gum here on amazon have yet to recieve it.     I hope it tastes better and last longer than this item they call Cotton Candy sour gum.     It does not taste like cotton Candy it taste like stale bubblegum.     would not buy or recommend this product.     I'll do a review on the crybaby sour gum once it arrive.
