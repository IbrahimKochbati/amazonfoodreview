These treats are the BEST for training, whether its obedience or agility. They were recommended to me from my dog trainer after learning she used them while conducting obedience training with my pups. They can easily  eak down into smaller bite size pieces which is great for constantly rewarding good behavior (without overindulging or making them chew) during training. They are also great treats to be used as a small snack for your dog. I highly recommend them!!! My dogs will listen to anything I say when I have these in my hand.
