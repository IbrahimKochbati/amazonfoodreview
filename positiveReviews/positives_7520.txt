I bought these cigars and some bubble gum ones.  Everybody loved the chocolate ones...not so much the bubble gum ones.  Besides having a nice presentation, people said the chocolate was actually really good!!!  I'd buy these over the bubble gum ones again.          The only thing I wished was if they gave you more than just 24.  Too bad there was not a 'jumbo' pack because these cigars went fast!
