Had terrible gluten free  ead?  This stuff is good!  Makes great toast and sandwiches.  I've tried it with craisins, raisins, nuts, and sesame seeds and various combinations.  I like it plain because it works better for sandwiches; I do add ground flak seeds for more fiber.  I use my  ead machine so it is fast and easy. The  ead is very porous and jam will leak through to the plate. The  ead is smaller than sandwich  ead.
