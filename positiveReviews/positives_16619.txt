I don't know about others, but my dog loves these.  He's a 55lbs golden retriever mix puppy, and loves to chew.  Like a reviewer before me said, this product is like crack for dogs!  The chews don't leave a mess, they occupy my dog for a couple of minutes, clean his teeth and they get rid of bad  eath.  A lot of chews are either messy or leave him with bad  eath    or both.  No digestion problems either, like rawhide can cause.  He did have a problem once with a rawhide chew that got us worried   I presume that's the compressed product related problem that a previous reviewer mentioned.  This never happened with the Greenies as they mostly melt away rather than  eak off in pieces, unlike rawhide.  As far as I can tell, this is a great product.
