Our dogs love the Everlasting Vanilla Mint!  One dog will licks and the other dog chews but it takes them a long time to finish them when they are in the treat balls.  The treat ball has provided them with hours of entertainment this winter when we haven't been able to get out much.  We have tried the Chicken and Liver flavors as well but the vanilla mint is by far the favorite.
