I love split pea soup and these peas are so fresh and cook up so well.  Can you buy cheaper split peas?  Of course you can but they likely weren't grown in the US and are probably a couple of years old.  These peas are far superior to the bag of peas in the grocery store.  These are grown in Washington, packaged in Washington and shipped from Washington.  It is worth it to spend a little more for a far superior product!
