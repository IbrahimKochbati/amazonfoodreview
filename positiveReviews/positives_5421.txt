We have had a Keurig Mini Brewer for over 2 years and the family really likes it!  We all have different tastes and we like the idea of preparing a cup of our choice, without wasting an entire pot.  We enjoy hot chocolate, hot tea, iced tea, and, of course, coffee   but, even then, we like a good cup of "morning" coffee, flavored coffee during the day, and decaf at night   so the pot is in use constantly and with a variety of goodies.          I was given a gourmet assortment of ground coffee, and it has been sitting on the shelf for quite awhile.  But, now, thanks to the disposable K cups, I am finally able to experiment with some lovely new flavors, while the "stuffy die hards" in the family can stay with their favorite  ew.  As soon as I saw the disposable K cups and filters I knew I had to order this product. It's easy to use   disposable   and it's just as fast to make a cup of delicious coffee in this container as it is to stand over the two drawer rack trying to decide which flavor to choose.  We are very happy with this product!
