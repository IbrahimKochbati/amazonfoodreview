I ordered this recently when it when I noticed the price dropped to $1.23 a can on Subscribe and Save.  I'd hesitated ordering in the past because of the issues with dented cans in some earlier reviews but couldn't resist trying it at that price.  I was pleasantly surprised to get a case of perfect cans that were packed in a reinforced box. The expiration date is 2014 which makes them fresh. I wish I'd ordered more!          The consistency of the pumpkin itself has also been good, not watery.  I've purchased this  and at my local market and never had an issue.  This is not a Puree like Libby's Pure Pumpkin, it's more dense, a firmer molded pumpkin.  It has about 10 more calories per serving than Libby's and has higher nutritional stats in vitamin content.  I happen to like both consistencies but prefer organic given I use it almost daily in one form or another. It works as a healthy replacement (along with unsweetened applesauce) in baking muffins, scones, cakes, pancakes, etc. I freeze it into 4 oz sized cubes and use it for Pumpkin Spice smoothies (delicious!). It's great in soups and some chili recipes too. Highly recommend.
