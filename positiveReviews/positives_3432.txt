I just had a wonderful dinner: Fresh fluke fried in a tempura batter. The batter fried up perfectly lacy and crisp, both delicious and beautiful. AND low carb; I floured my fish with the LC Foods Pan Bread Flour, and then used the same flour to make a batter with some low carb beer, salt, and a little smoked paprika. An absolute knockout. You really won't believe it's low carb, but I'm about to test my blood sugar levels, and will report back in 90 minutes.
