This stuff is good, and I mean REALLY good. My husband drinks diet soda which contains aspartame, a known neurological toxin, and I wanted to provide a much safer alternative. I found this at PCC and he loved it. I can't STAND the taste of artificially sweetened things and I usually end up with a nasty migraine, and this didn't bother me one bit. The taste is fantastic in my opinion, but this seems to be a flavor you will either love or hate, which is why I would recommend picking up a 6 pack at the market before ordering a pack of 24.
