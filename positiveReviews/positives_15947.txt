They were easy to make, easy to serve, and everyone loved them. I could even make them at school on a hot day without any problems (except the teachers that were wondering what the strange noises were). They don't taste exactly like the ones at Serendipity III, but that's why people go to New York and spend $8.50 for a glass instead of buying 3 packs for $15 on Amazon!
