My mother gave me one of those old time, stand up popcorn makers like you see at carnivals or theaters. Even though we enjoyed it, the popcorn never approached the taste of theaters. That is, until I found this stuff.          I came across them in an online recommendation and bought a case. We've never looked back. The stuff is delicious and it makes eating popcorn while watching a movie just like going to the theater.
