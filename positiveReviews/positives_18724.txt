The omnipresent Dona Maria mole has a stronger cocoa flavor but I like this one better.  I boil a chicken and use the  oth to thin the sauce.  I char 3 flour tortillas on my stove and make crumbs that add a smokey taste to the sauce. I also puree a 28 ounce can of tomatoes and add to the sauce.  Learned from my neighbor who was raised in Mexico. Bone the chicken and add to the sauce.  Serve over rice or wrap in warm tortillas.  Would buy again over the Dona Maria  and if it becomes available.
