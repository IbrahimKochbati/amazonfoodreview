I picked up a box of Wonderful Pistachios (24 1.5 ounce packets) on my last visit to my local Costco Store. They're a very nice pistachio. The roasting is perfect and they're lightly salted, just as I like them. The little bags are handy for snacks and lunches and are a way of keeping me in check when it comes to eating them. The pistachios are nicely opened and I've only found two "uncracked" so far. I save them in a pile and use the nutcracker on them when I get enough. The sodium content of a serving is quite modest relative to a lot of other nuts. The fat and calorie content is fairly high, but it's a less harmful fat. The fiber and protein are moderately good. It's a nice mix of nutrients and a good taste.          Gary Peterson
