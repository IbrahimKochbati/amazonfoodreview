I'm giving this product 5 stars because I think it is great considering that it is made with water.  The hot chocolate is best if you shake the cup and then  ew using the smallest possible cup size.  If you want a large cup of hot chocolate, use 2 k cups.  It is fairly low in calories, most likely because artificial sweeteners are necessary to get all the ingredients into the little k cup.
