I feel like an expert reviewer for this product.  We have used it as long as I can remember.  In the summer, there's nothing like pork on the grill, but when the weather cools, ths product makes chops delicious and juicy every time.  It comes with everything you need, just wet meat, shake in the bag, then bake. If I could make one adjustment, I would add a little more product to each package, as I would like a bit of a thicker "crust".  But this is a product I grew up on and never get tired of.
