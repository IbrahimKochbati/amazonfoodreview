Nutty, smooth, subtle, with a WONDERFUL aroma   I love this coffee sooooooo much. Lots of hazelnut coffees have unpleasant notes or aftertastes   this coffee is just rich, smooth, and perfect.          I've been in crisis because stores in my area have stopped stocking it. Thank goodness you can get it on Amazon!
