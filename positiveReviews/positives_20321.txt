Baby's getting to that solid food stage, so we tried the Dr. Sears recommended HappyBellies line.  Our girl likes their stuff  she's more partial to the rice cereal  and we like that it's organic and (fairly) unadulterated.  Addition of DHA and probiotics a plus.  If you can, try to find a sample portion or individual can for your child before committing to a large, 6 canister purchase, like this one.  Btw, it's tasty enough that Mommy and Papa don't mind getting this cereal in their mouths when cajoling their stubborn baby to eat.
