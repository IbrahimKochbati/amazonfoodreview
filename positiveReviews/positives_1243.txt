Since I live in a rural area sometimes I'd drive to town just for dog food...needless to say that was expensive.  For $26 w free shipping the Harmony Farms is cheaper than the purchasing the lower quality "name  ands"   my dog likes the food and his skin is not as dry & flaky. I love getting it shipped directly and that my dog is eating something healthy.  Very thankful it's something I can afford as well.  Only wish Amazon offered a 'subscription service' for this item like they do on others.
