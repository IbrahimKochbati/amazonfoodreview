My husband and I went Gluten Free earlier this year due to a health condition.  We stumbled across this product at Whole Foods and decided to try it.  These were incredible...  so cheesy and spicy!!!  So much so, we decided to buy a case on Amazon.  Once our original case was depleted, we re ordered, and though the product looks identical, the new case contained cheese curls with little to no seasoning.  They were so bland that we had no desire to eat them.  We opened each bag in the case hoping some of them would be good like the first case we purchased, but to our dismay, we ended up tossing the entire case.  We will not be buying these again.  What a letdown...
