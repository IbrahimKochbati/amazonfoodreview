As a kid I grew up picking and eating my own oranges, mangoes, bananas, watermelon other tropical fruits.  I know what 100% natural fruit juice tastes like and Switch kiwi berry does not taste like it is a product of 100% natural fruit juice.  This product like its watermelon strawberry cousin does not taste natural.  If kiwi flavor had been absent I don't think I could differentiate this product from a berry soda you can get from any vending machine.  Moreover I am not crazy about carbonated drinks considering the current discussion about certain negative side effects that may be caused by carbonation in general.  You really can't put fresh fruit in a canned drink.  For those of you who are interested in a nutritious fruit drink that is good for you, take some frozen grapes, strawberries or cherries and put them in a smoothie blender.  Add some grape juice, apple juice, cranberry juice or whatever you have (that is 100% fruit product), some kiwi and pineapple (if you like), a banana (if you want some thickness) and some ice.  Blend and then pour in a nice ice cold glass and enjoy!  Now this is 100% naturally good for you.  Nice try Switch   but I'd rather switch.
