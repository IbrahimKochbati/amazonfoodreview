I can't drink coffee, because I have painful bladder syndrome so I was rather excited to be offered this reduced acid version.          The first thing I noticed was the scent. Perhaps because I haven't drunk any coffee in years, I was pleased by the scent. It smelled like the coffee I remembered and had a pleasing scent. Brewing was easy. I just  ewed it through a strainer, added hot water and voila!          My first taste, did not necessarily excite me. It *did* have a slight Folgers coffee kind of taste. However, my second and third tastes made me realize how much I liked the stuff. Now I'm hooked. It does taste enough like the real stuff to make me want to buy more.          I can give this coffee product, two thumbs up, but if you are an IC suffer, you might try the decaf blend. This blend still is caffeine and might upset your bladder.
