I don't know if anyone else has trouble with the pull tabs on these Canidae cans but I sure do.  The tab part is very flimsy and doesn't hold up well while trying to pull open the top.  I have almost cut myself several times.  End up having to pry the top off with a fork after the pull top  eaks off.  Otherwise it's an acceptable product, although I do prefer Evangers.  But Evangers has become more expensive for some reason.
