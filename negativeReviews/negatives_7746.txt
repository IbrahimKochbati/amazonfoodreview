THIS SNACK IS "OK"...2 OR 3 STARS... FIRST, THESE ARE INDEED JUNK FOOD...ONE THIRD CALORIES FROM FAT, HIGH GLYCEMIC CARBS, 1 GRAM FIBER, 2 GRAMS PROTEIN. SECOND, THE CHEESE FLAVOR IS MILDER THAN THE "AGED WHITE CHEDDAR" LED ME TO BELIEVE. THE TEXTURE WAS THAT OF VERY SOFT STYROFOAM PACKING PEANUTS. SORRY, BUT IT'S TRUE! IF SOMEONE OFFERED ME SOME AT THE MOVIES OR NEXT TO A SANDWICH...OK, SURE...BUT THE GUSHING PRAISE I READ HERE LED ME TO PURCHASE A 12 BAG CASE WHILE THEY WERE ON SALE...I WILL BE SHARING THESE FREELY...NO TEMPTATION TO HOARD THEM. THEY'RE JUST "OK" ...IF I COULD GIVE A BAG TO THE BIG FANS, IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE.
