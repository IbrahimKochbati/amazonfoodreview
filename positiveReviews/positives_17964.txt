A true blast from the past,Shake 'N Bake promises to do for pork what it does for chicken, make a quick, convenient and tasty supper.  I am not a big pork fan, but purchased some chops to test this product.  Just pop moistened meat in a plastic reclosable bag with the Shake 'n' Bake crumb mixture and voila, you have a meal ready to pop in the oven.  The coating was nice and crisp with a mild flavor.  I was most impressed  by the meat inside.  It was moist and juicy.  I was not enamored of the spice, I prefer more assertive flavor. Can you do it yourself with seasoned  eadcrumbs and a zip lock bag? Sure.  But for a quick,  kid pleasing meal that is retro fun to prepare, this can't be beat.
