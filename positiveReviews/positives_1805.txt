I got this food for my dog that is allergic to corn, wheat, potatoes, flax, fish, and pork.  I had the hardest time finding a food that he wasn't allergic to.  I'm so glad I found this food.  He is finally eating and starting to put on some weight.  It is a little pricey but I think it is worth it for such a good product.
