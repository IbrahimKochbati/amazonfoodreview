We have bought Baklawa from Shatila many times from their Dearborn store as well as sent it to friends via mail order. It is simply outstanding Baklawa    perhaps best anywhere. You wouldn't like baklawa from Costco or other places after having baklawa from Shatila.          At their store, ice creams and other desserts are also excellent.
