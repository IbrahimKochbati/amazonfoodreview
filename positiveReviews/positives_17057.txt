This Tug a Jug turned out to be the perfect thing for our black lab puppy. We put his evening kibble inside and let him roll it around to get his dinner. The jug keeps him occupied for anywhere between 25 minutes to an hour.          Pros:     1. Good mental stimulation. Dinner isn't just available to wolf down. It requires some work and is totally worth the reward!     2. Sturdy construction. It's held up against the chewy habit of the pup. I do not let him chew on it outside of meal times in order to keep his focus mainly on the food and not the jug.     3. The rope seems to be very enjoyable to our pup. He likes to stop and chew on it for a minute before starting to roll and spin the jug again. I'm guessing that has something to do with teething. It's also replaceable (if you can find replacement rope).     4. Easy to clean. The bottom screws on off and the inside can be wiped down.     5. Mouth of the jug has a nice texture which helps our pup hold on with his paws. His spin and push control (with his paws) has increased drastically since we started feeding him one meal a day from it!          Cons:     1. Sturdy construction also means it  eaks anything fragile in its path. The rope makes it easy to swing around. I would keep the dog and jug away from small pets and children.     2. Can't use it with raw food unless you want to make a horrible mess all over the place.     3. Loud if you keep it on a linoleum floor like we do. Our pup loves to bang the jug around, spin it with his paws and push it with his nose. It makes quite a racket. It's fairly quiet on the carpet.     4. If your dog is really smart, he might figure this one out quickly. I'd recommend pairing this with one of the other Busy Buddy feeding products and switching between them often to keep your dog on his toes.
