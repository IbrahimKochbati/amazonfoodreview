Admittedly my dog loves these treats and thinks they are delicious.  However they are made in China and dog lovers in the US usually choose not to buy products from China due to prior problems with the quality control that has sickened many animals.  Dogswell should take note of this and manufacture them in the US.  It should also be noted that competitive  ands on your grocery store shelves are also made in China even though distributed in California.  The only  and I have found that is manufactured in the US is from Trader Joes.  If you love your dog do not buy this item.  Go to Trader Joes.
