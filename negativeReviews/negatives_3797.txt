I purchased these in lieu of the V8 Fusions since they sell for $2.08 per can on Amazon Marketplace (approx double the price Safeway sells them for).  First of all, they only contain 10% juice and the first ingredient after water is High Fructose Corn Syrup.  They essentially sold me Soda with a V8 label on it!  If I wanted to buy pop, I'd get a 24 pack for $8 not $30! Honestly, if you want juice, go to your local grocery store.  These are terrible for you, over priced and they taste horrible.  I would've sent them back but I figured I'd give it a try.  Now im out $30.  This left a bad taste in my mouth in more ways than one.  Oh!  I should also mention that these did not arrive in a 'weather resistant tote' but rather were delivered to me in the original packaging.  The plastic was loose and a can fell out when I carried it in.  Not using Amazon marketplace again!
