While visiting my daughter in Seattle, WA she introduced me to these wonderful Wasa wafers (alliteration intentional).  I really like them and they are an ideal substitute for  ead.  I couldn't find this product in the stores around Fresno, CA.  I decided to give Amazon a try and sure enough, they came through.  I subscribed to have shipments sent to my home quarterly and again Amazon came through.  You AMAZE me!   "
