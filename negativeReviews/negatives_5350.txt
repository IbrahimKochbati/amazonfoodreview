The moment I opened the bag I did not smell the wonderful smell of coffee, as I sniffed close to the opening I finally smelled the coffee and it smelled stale.  When I  ewed my first cup, the odor still remained stale with the addition of smelling like the second  ew from used grounds.  This really affected my reaction and taste to the coffee.  The smell of coffee is appetizing and enhances the taste, but since I already had an issue with the smell, the coffee ended up tasting weak and stale.  The process of removing most of the acid must affect the taste and smell as well as color because it took away the best parts of coffee, the appetizing smell, the rich slight bitter taste, and the dark, smoky caramel color.  I decided to use the rest of the grounds as an odor neutralizer, but even that was not as effective, it did not neutralize other smells like regular acidic coffee.  I guess I will stick to regular coffee, truthfully instant coffee smells and tastes better than this low acid coffee.
