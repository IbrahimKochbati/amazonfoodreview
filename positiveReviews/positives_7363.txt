This product makes me want to buy a Miracle Fruit tree so I can have these awesome berries all the time.          The biggest changes my husband and I noticed were in eating fruits & other berries. Store bought strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, oranges, and green apples tasted like they were just picked off the plant bush tree at the height of ripeness. It was like being a kid again and biting into my first :)          I didn't notice any change at all with anything bitter. Beers and coffees and teas tasted about the same. Spicy things like hot sauce tasted kind of gross. Savory things like noodles and meat got a slight hint of sweetness, but nothing THAT noticeable. Sweet things like candy and cake were made to be way too sweet to be palatable.          Definitely make sure you get the tablet to slide all over your tongue, and don't chew    leave it on your tongue until it dissolves.          If you're a fan of sweet, succulent fruit, but can't get fresh produce from farmer's markets, do yourself a favor and try these. It's worth the price for the fun, at the very least :)
