I bought these K cups along with the Coffee People Wake Up Call Bold and they were both great.  We bought our Keurig about 6 months ago and I've been searching for something that really tasted good and finally found it.  You can run this twice for a travel size mug and have the coffee be sufficiently bold and not go  oke in the process.
