Because I like sweet potatoe fries, I thought I would like these.  But, I found them to lack flavor.  There is just a bit of a bitter taste to them.  They may be better for you than potato chips, but they just don't give the same satisfaction.  However, they are not very salty and are in a 100 calorie pack which makes them healthier for you. I thought maybe it was just me, so I had my husband and sister try them.  They each gave them a 2.5 rating.  My sister said they were a bit bland.  Hubby said they weren't too bad.  But, none of us are excited about eating another bag.
