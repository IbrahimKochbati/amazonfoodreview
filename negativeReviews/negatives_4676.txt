I have been giving this food to my cat for a couple of days, and I have mixed feelings about it. The chicken pot pie flavor has a lot of  oth in it. Fortunately, my cat likes  oth, and whenever I buy food that has either a lot of sauce or a lot of  oth, my cat enjoys the extra moisture. However, this depends on your cat. What I found, however, is that the chicken pot pie has more  oth than actual food.  The chicken is very chunky and looks very natural, and is exactly the consistency my cat enjoys.  However, it contains carrots, and my cat doesn't really eat vegetables. Cats in general don't eat vegetables, because they are naturally carnivores, so I question its inclusion.          The Chinese Chicken is actually "sesame". It has a slightly odd aroma, which doesn't seem to bother my cat, and plenty of sauce, which my cat enjoys. However, the meat in this flavor is shredded, which my cat does not enjoy. It has fewer vegetables than the chicken pot pie, but my cat will barely touch the meat in this.          From a nutritional perspective, these foods have about the same (or slightly better) protein content than my cat's regular  ands. This is a plus, especially if you have an overweight cat. This food contains plenty of protein and plenty of moisture, which are really critical in quality cat food.          Based on what I've seen, I would conclude that these are quality cat foods. They look better than what my cat eats on a regular basis. Ultimately, though, it depends what your cat enjoys    consider the consistencies I've described before buying. In my situation, since my cat will not eat the Chinese "Sesame" Chicken, I have quite a few cans of food that I will not be able to use    an issue of the mult flavor, multi pack design.
