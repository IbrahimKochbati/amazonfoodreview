these are so great for a GF kid (or adult...) and for the whole family! we're hooked on the chocolate chip, but we like the oatmeal and cinnamon a lot too. and its great that they come in individual packs or full sized cookies.  pretty healthy and all natural ingredients, what could be wrong? they're great, we recommend them!
