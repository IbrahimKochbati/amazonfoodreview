I grew up in a house where as kids we would beg my mother to make Swedish pancakes from scratch (which is alot of work) so we didn't get them that often. I was out driving around the back country roads in Ma and came across this authentic country store. While I was  owsing, I found this Swedish pancake mix and said, "what the heck, I'll give it a try"...Well, I'm here to tell you that is tastes as close to homemade as it gets! Now in searching for it, I find it on Amazon.com. Awesome...so ordering I am! and recommending you try it too. I'm telling you, you can't go wrong if you're looking for authentic taste!!
