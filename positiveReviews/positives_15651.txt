My cat gobbled this food right up!  Each small serving can is perfect to feed one cat without the worry of overfeeding.  My cat is elderly and very picky about her food.  She the entire can of food in both flavors.  I liked the fact that the food doesn't smell too bad like many cat foods do, and that there was no waste.  Enjoy!
