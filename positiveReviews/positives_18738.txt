I've never used Shake N Bake before, but decided to try it. The results were good. I had a healthy meal in a very short amount of time with very minimal effort. It's fast. It's easy. Is it the best tasting chicken I've ever had? No, but it has the advantage of being convenient. If there were 5 stars for fast, easy, and convenient, I would have given it 5 stars.          The most complicated thing was going to the store and buying the chicken. I walked in the door, washed off the chicken, put it in a bag with the Shake N Bake Chicken Pouch spices, shook it up a little, and baked it for about 20 minutes. Very easy and fast!          It's a good option for anyone who wants a fast, easy way to cook chicken.
