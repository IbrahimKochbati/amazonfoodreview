Wonderful product to use daily! I just put a small handful in some hot water and have a great cup of tea.  A favorite way to use it is to let it cool slightly and pour it over ice to enjoy a cup of iced hibiscus tea. I'm taking the holistic approach to control blood pressure and I do feel drinking this daily helps.
