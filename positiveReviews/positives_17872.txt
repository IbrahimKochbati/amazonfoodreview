I'm not a big fan of pork. Shocking, I know. I had a package of boneless pork loin in my freezer that I got from a really good sale. I figured I'd try this product to try to use up the pork.          On the packet, it says it's enough for 4 6 pork chops. I cut up my pork loin into 8 pieces and the one packet was just enough for all 8 pork chops. It's extremely easy to use. Just take a plastic, zippered bag, empty the contents of the packet, and then put 2 pieces of pork at a time into the bag, shake until they're all coated, and finish off the rest of the pieces.          Now let's talk about the taste. Like I said above, I don't really like pork. However, with the Shake N Bake, it gave the pork a really good, seasoned taste. Also, it gave the pork a crunchy coating. Overall, I think this product is an easy and tasty way to "dress up" pork for a lovely dinner. If I ever come across a good pork sale again, I'll be sure to use this particular product to spice it up!
