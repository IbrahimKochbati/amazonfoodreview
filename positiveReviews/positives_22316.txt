I tried this soup when I was visiting in texas a few months ago. It is not available in Washington for some reason, so I heard about amazon having products that you cant find in some places. After I placed my order it arrived in just a few days. Everyone I have let try a can of this placed orders for themselves. Fabulous soup!!!!!!!!!!!
