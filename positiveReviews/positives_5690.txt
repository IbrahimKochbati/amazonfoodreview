I just discovered this addiction at TJMaxx!!!  I paid $7.99 (kind of pricy) but when I opened the bag and tasted them for the first time....OMG!  I could'nt believe it!  I can not put the bag down!  You can't eat just one...I have to stop myself from eating so many.  I have googled the website and they are down for construction until October 1st.  My only hope is when they open up the site that they will sell these at a reasonable price and not be outrageously priced like ebay and others!  I like them but I'm not paying over $7.99 for them!  Anywho....Give these little snacks a try!  They taste great and most of all Healthy!
