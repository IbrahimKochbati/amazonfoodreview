Decided to purchase the 35 pound bag for my 12 year old dog who have skin allergy base on the positive reviews I've read on line.  Very happy with shipping & Packaging service from Amazon.  But very dissapointed in Premium Edge.  Not only did the food not help him, it seemed to made him worst the first couple of days! Also, the product says for adult dogs but on the package it also says from age 1 to 10 years of age???? My dog is 12.  I don't understand all the positive feed back for this product?  and I so regret for buying such a large bag or the product for that matter.
