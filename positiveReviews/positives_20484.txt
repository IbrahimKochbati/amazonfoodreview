I ordered this looking for a great price and never really thought about what 5 pounds of Matzos would look like.  Well when the box arrived I wondered what on earth I had ordered.  When I opened it I had to LAUGH at the size of 5 pounds of crackers.  They came in good condition and will last me a while and when I finish these, I will order again.  So I give these a thumbs up!
