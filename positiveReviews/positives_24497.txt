Started feeding my two older dogs (12 and 13) this food. My lab has always had dry itchy skin. After a week on Avoderm he is shiny and not flaky at all! My german shepherd is usually picky over food but he loves Avoderm. I highly recommend this food. Packaging and expiration date were fine and I will definitely order from amazon instead of buying in a pet store. The price is way cheaper! Higher quality food really does make a difference in the health of your pets...I wish I had started feeding them Avoderm sooner.
