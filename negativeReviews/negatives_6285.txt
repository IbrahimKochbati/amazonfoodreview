Ok, so I have to say that I did not enjoy the True Lemon Lemonade nearly as much as I enjoyed the True Lemon Raspberry Lemonade.  It didn't have nearly as much flavor, and the flavor it did have wasn't much like lemonade to me.  But the ingredients were still pretty good, and that's really what makes this  and stand out from the others.          True Lemon products boast that they have 100% natural ingredients.  And its true, they do.  They use stevia instead of artificial sweeteners and actual lemon oil and juice for the flavoring.  This makes me think at least that what I'm drinking is healthy.  There's even some turmeric for color in here and that's actually a beneficial spice.  So all in all, a good product on the market.  A lot healthier than some of the other drink additives out there.          The taste, not as good in this one.  Its not terrible, like some of the water additives I've tried, but it tastes extremely weak.  That and the pale yellow color the water turns it just isn't appetizing.  Its still got a sweet taste, but the tanginess of the lemon isn't really there and it more just tastes like sugar water.  I would say their estimate on the amount of flavoring per water ratio may be off and perhaps two packets would be a better choice for the water.  It may be something I have to try.          I probably won't buy this particular flavor from True Lemon again, but it won't stop me from trying some of their other products.  And I will definitely get their Raspberry Lemonade again.  I just hope that maybe they improve this one or keep adding new products to their line up. It sure does help when that soda craving kicks in and I can have one of these instead.          Review by M.
