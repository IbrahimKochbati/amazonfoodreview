These bars have the texture of a soft cookie, and taste a lot like a chocolate chip muffin with coconut.  They are very tasty.  Also, if you love "natural" ingredients, you will likely be happy with these.  The drawback, however, is that they are 180 calories with only 2 grams of protein and 2 grams of fiber. 80 of the 180 calories are from fat.  No wonder they are so tasty!  So these are something I would eat when I am not really trying to have a meal substitute, and am throwing dietary caution to the winds.  They are, however pretty filling and for that reason a great snack.
