This tea has mostly all raspberry flavours with little to no peach at all.  I added a peach green tea bag when I  ew it & a little sweetener.  It's very tough to taste the "sparkling wine" flavour, either.  At best, it's a nice raspberry green tea, but it's certainly not what I was expecting & hoping for.  If I bought it from a store, I would have taken it back.
