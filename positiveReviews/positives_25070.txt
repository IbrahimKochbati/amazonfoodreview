So you don't want to spend $100 oz for truffle, here's a great alternative. Use this formula to build your fantastic sandwich.     (Buns) + (Spread) + (Meat) + (Creamy) + (Veggies)          I used Chabatta buns I get at Albertson, toasted in a small oven, spread Urbani Truffles and mushrooms, layer with thin slices of prosciutto, then topped with four thick slices of hass avocado, and a few mix green. There's your fancy, sexy, impress your gf bf family friends sandwich.          The only bad part is it doesn't keep very long in fridge. Urbani Truffles and Mushrooms add an umami flavor to the sandwich so it can go with any of your favorite sandwich. I usually just a make two sandwiches and had to throw away the rest when it went bad in the fridge. So plan ahead, it's a small 6 oz can that can serve up to four sandwiches.          Plus it's cheaper via Amazon.com. I saw these at Wholefood for $19.99 can.          This is my first review so it was that good that wanted me to write a review. Get it, and enjoy it with your family.
