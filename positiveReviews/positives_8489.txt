[[ASIN:B007IK5QZO Kirkland Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil] ]     I purchased this olive oil based on testing performed by University California Davis back in early 2010.(I've found of no new testing since then) The results rated Kirkland Brand extra virgin olive oil (3 samples provided for testing), and it was the only imported oil to the United States of 14 tested that passed.(not sure what the test were)The oil tastes very complex (like fine wine) very fruity and sharp(to me). Only EXTRA VIRGIN is made from the (First cold pressing) first pressing olives and offers(They say) up to 200 antioxidants,great taste and all the nutrients that olives have to offer.(that is why it's cloudy unfiltered) After I open the main container which I keep it in freezer and place a small container in refrigerator and refill as necessary keeping it away from light & heat at all times. Enjoy it's worth the extra $$.....
