My wife and I bought the Keurig and started experimenting with coffees.  Most were too strong, but this Breakfast Blend hit it right on the head.  Of course it's a matter of personal taste, but if you don't like your coffee as strong as Starbucks typically is, this is a great coffee.  Love that Keurig!
