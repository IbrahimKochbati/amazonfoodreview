I was not too impressed with this tuna.  It was ok.  I applaud the companies efforts and what they do.  I ended up giving 3 of my cans away.  I used the other 3 for  a meal.  I usually like tuna with oil, but I thought the flavor was lacking.  I think their other tuna canned in its own juices is much better.   "
