I've started giving these to 2 of my dogs which are a very large  eed.  They aren't really old yet, but we have mostly wood and tile floors which are hard on their joints.  So I've started giving them these in hopes of preventing   to some extent   damage and pain for them. They love these.  My small dog isn't very old, but wants them, too.  I don't think they are so good for her since she has thrown them up before.  The pieces are fairly large so the dog knows she's getting a real treat.  I haven't found any flavor that they don't like, although the Beef seems to be their favorite.  I like that they seem to be a made in the USA product since I lost a dog during the "bad dog food" epidemic. Since then, I've been very careful what I give my dogs.
