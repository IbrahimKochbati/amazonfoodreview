I'm not a gourmet coffee critic, but this stuff is disappointing.  Based upon previous good reviews, I suspect that the coffee in the K cups I received is not the same    they may have changed the manufacturing.  The Wolfgang Puck Decaf I received is lifeless, watery, and tasteless.  There's no aroma when it's  ewing in the Keurig.  Never again.
