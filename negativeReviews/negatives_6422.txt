I ordered Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bars and recieved Lindsor White Chocolate Truffles. I do not like white chocolate.  I've ordered these Hershey Bars before and got them but not this time.  All my orders are forwarded to me via Diplomatic Pouch and the boxes are usually destroyed and the chocolates partially melted. This is a problem with the Pouch that's fine with me except that it makes my purchases unreturnable.  My orders take two to three weeks to get to me and I'm very sad about my chocolate!
