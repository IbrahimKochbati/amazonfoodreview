I bought this chocolate a few times. A box of 12 bars to be precise. Loved every bit of it, no pun intended. The orange kind is light and energizing and feels really rich inside your mouth. It is organic, which is the main reason I bought it. Took a while to get it shipped (two weeks or so on free shipper program). Recommend it for the lovers of fine organic products.
