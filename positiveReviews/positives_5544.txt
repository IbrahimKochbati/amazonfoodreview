This packaging is awesome   my main annoyance with regular Jolly Ranchers is that if you keep them in your pocket, they will melt and stick to the wrapper and eventually stick to your pocket. Not delicious. This packaging completely fixes all that   it's the size of a pack of gum, and the candies don't stick to anything!          Clearly not the healthiest thing to eat, but if you're on your feet all day long and often find yourself without a meal for 8+hours, these could be a convenient quick fix for when you start to feel all weird and wobbly and hypoglycemic.          Totally no nutrition in these, but they are GREAT for when you need a bit of glucose boost.
