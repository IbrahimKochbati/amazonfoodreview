I recently bought an 8 ounce home popper and had read favorable reviews about the pre packaged kernels, coconut oil, and salt packets.  After scouring Amazon and reading the reviews, I finally settled on Great Northern.          The packaged shipped immediately within a day of purchase and arrived on schedule.  Be warned that based on the climate in your area, the oil portion in the packets may be solidified or liquid.  Regardless, it melts instantly in a hot kettle if you receive it solid.          As for the taste, I was not disappointed one bit.  Some reviews have mentioned that it is too salty, but I found it just right.  I do prefer salty foods, though.  Based on the look of it, I thought it would turn the popcorn a ridiculous yellow hue, but it didn't.  The taste was exactly like you'd get at the theater or ballpark and it was not too greasy.  I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to make theater style popcorn at home.
