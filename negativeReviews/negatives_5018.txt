I have a dachshund terrier mix who is 2 years old. I bought him the Busy Buddy for the same reason everyone else probably does: he needed more mental stimulation. I  ought the toy home, loaded it up, and offered it to my dog. He quickly figured out the rope was restricting the flow of treats. He promptly chewed through the rope, leaving a knot in the bottom of the bottle and the rest of the rope and other knot on the floor. Without this restriction he figured out (within a matter of minutes) that if he threw the bottle into the air, the bottle would bounce, sending a treat or two flying out of the mouth and onto the floor. It should also be noted that this toy IS  eakable. However, your pup would have to have pretty strong jaws like my dog's.          Synopses: Great toy if your dog isn't smart enough to chew through the rope or try to  eak the koosh ball.
