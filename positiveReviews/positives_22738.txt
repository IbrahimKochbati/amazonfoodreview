I used my Stir Crazy popper   almost every kernel popped, but it's quite dry for an oil popped corn. I think there might just be too much corn for the amount of oil. And definitely doesn't have the movie theater taste or texture. Also, if you put all the seasoning salt in with the corn & oil, a lot of it sticks to the machine, so I leave a little to sprinkle on afterwards to help with the flavor. I'm thinking maybe I'll try not using all the corn, next time and see if that is a better corn to oil ratio. I might also try just using a big pot too and see if that's any better than the Stir Crazy.          ** EDIT ** July 2011 ** so, after popping quite a few bags in different ways, I can say now that if you use a regular kettle, with only 1 2 the salt, it tastes great. I think it's because only about 2 3 of it pops   so this allows for more oil flavor per kernel.
