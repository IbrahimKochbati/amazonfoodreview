I wish I could say that the new Bonomo Turkish Taffy was "only a shadow of the original". That'd be good. But, in fact, it's much, much worse than that. The new taffy has none of the full, rich flavor of the original product. Instead, it fills your palate with intensely and unpleasantly artificial flavors, and little else. Probably, manufacturing the candy using the original ingredients in their original proportions proved far to expensive. Unless the makers of the new taffy change their product to adhere to the original, I'd say don't waste your time or money on what presently amounts to a hoax.
