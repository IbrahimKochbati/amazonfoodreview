Brew style: french press, espresso     Smell: Nothing special here, decent 'coffee' smell with some earthiness.  No caramel notes, no sweetness.     Taste: Mild, earthy, somewhat smokey, dirty mouth feel, finish is short.          I mostly  ew with a french press but i tried it in my espresso maker just to see how it would fair.  The caffeine seemed very pronounced to me, there was no sweetness to speak of.  It did have a very nice crema though.     Overall: I wont be buying this again, its nothing special.
