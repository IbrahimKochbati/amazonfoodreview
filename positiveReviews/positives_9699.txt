My dog gets bored easily of her food. We tried every different kind of food to get her appetite going again. Merrick's Turducken and Wing a ling did the trick. We mix it with her dry food and she is so happy! She gets very excited at mealtime. I have noticed a difference in her coat and energy level too.
