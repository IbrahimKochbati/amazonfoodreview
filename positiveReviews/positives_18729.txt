Shake 'N Bake has been a part of my life for years.  I can remember doing chicken  easts and pork chops with my mom many years back.  It is fun and easy, and makes plain old meat more fun.  Now my son is my "shaker" and he now loves it like I did.  That being said, let me tell you that it will never look like it does on the front of the package.  The coating is never as thick as in the picture.  What you get is a nice thin coating.          This particular style of Shake 'N Bake comes in a pouch so it is missing the plastic bag that you get when you buy it the old fashioned way.  It is not difficult using a Glad or Ziplock  and bag to do your shaking.  This is a nice way to change up your usual grilled or sauteed chicken.  Give it a little shake, bake it in the oven, and enjoy!
