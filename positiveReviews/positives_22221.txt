Have been using product over 2 years.  Had to play with manufacture recipe on bag.  Use 1 egg yolk and 2 egg whites then added extra rice milk to make up for lost egg yolk, added tsp sugar then other spices to taste.  Use plastic lined tortilla press. Work fast dough changes with room moisture.  Could buy 8 bags for 18.   dollars now with 5.00 increase buying locally is cheaper.
