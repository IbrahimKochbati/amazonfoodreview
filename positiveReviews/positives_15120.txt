My dog was sick for 2 months and lost 20% of her body weight. Her coat was falling out in clumps and she was still barely eating, eventhough the vet couldn't figure out what was wrong with her. We switched her to Canidae based on a friend's recommendation. She has gained half her weight back in 2 weeks and her coat is improving, as is her energy levels.     For a siberian husky, this food can't be beat!
