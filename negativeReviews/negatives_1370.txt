My recommendation? Get a juicer and make your own, or try Odwalla. The taste was bitter, and the smell was strange and foul. The label says "Enriched with organic lemon juice" and that is not pure carrot juice in my book. Maybe it was the lemon I tasted, I don't know. I had about three sips and couldn't stomach it.
