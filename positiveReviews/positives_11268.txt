One of my dogs is restricted to 21% protein or less and another has food allergies.  This is the only dry, grain free food I could find with low enough protein or I wouldn't have paid so much.  The dogs all love it and most are showing improvement since going grain free but I'm still looking for less expensive alternatives.  The venison doesn't work for the dog with food allergies.  He seems to do better with poultry.
