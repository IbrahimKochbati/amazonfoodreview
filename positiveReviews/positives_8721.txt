These mushrooms are wonderful!  They taste rich and woodsy, and add real complexity to soups, stews or anyplace you would use fresh mushrooms.          Dried mushrooms don't weigh much, so you will find your order may be larger than you expect.  The supplier recommends that you store them in the refrigerator or freezer.          Shipping was amazing.  I ordered them on Friday and received them on Monday, standard shipping    the package started in Massachusetts and arrived in Seattle in four days!  Very happy with that!
