I used to feed my dachshund Bo a pig ear as a treat after his evening meal. He liked it but it created grease spots on the carpet and added unnecessary body fat. I bought some Better Than Ears, and     Bo liked them much better than the real things. Moreover, he did not gain weight, and my carpet was not damaged by any residue. They're a great treat for dogs and a good value. If I forget to give him one after his evening meal, he reminds me of my error with a series of barks.
