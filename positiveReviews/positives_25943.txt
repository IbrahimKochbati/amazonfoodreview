I'm in college and needed to pick out a little something for munching on while studying. The next thing I know, everyone on my dorm floor is asking where they can get some Pirate's Booty! We love it and recommend it to all ages! I also find that it's good for younger kids who aren't ready for popcorn because it tastes great and because of it's consistency it's impossible to choke on.
