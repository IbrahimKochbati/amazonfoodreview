I bought several of these for a 350 mile walk across Madagascar.          Never a fan of sweet rehydration drinks, I've always preferred straight water when going with a cool beverage. For this trip, however, I figured I may want something a little extra to ease muscle cramping, liven things up a bit, etc. I wasn't able to drink it through the day as I didn't want to encourage bacteria in my mouthpiece, but it was nice starting the day chugging down a canteen, or ending the day with it. I use a SteriPEN, but I would imagine this might also mask the delicious taste of purification tablets or iodine a bit...so be warned.          The containers are waterproof until opened, then be careful to keep them sealed in waterproof bags to avoid moisture and varmints.          They are slightly fizzy, which is nice if your stomach is having a moment. I ordered both this flavor and Tangerine Ginger; of the two, Lemon Chai is my favorite both cold and lukewarm. Certainly lemony, with a bit of flair. Tangy. As for Tangerine Ginger, I'm a ginger addict, but it is not the dominant flavor.          Since returning, I've continued drinking this periodically during strength training sessions.
