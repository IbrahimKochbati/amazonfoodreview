I was always short of milk whenever I baked, made sauces, or smoothies. Silk Pure Almond, as well as their dark chocolate beverage, are very convenient. Any time you want to prepare a recipe requiring buttermilk, for instance, just use silk and add a tablespoon of lemon juice. Pancakes made with the dark chocolate Silk are a big hit, as are milkshakes and pudding. The price is reasonable as well, and delivered, so no lugging cartons home. I am pleased and will recommend highly.
