I would've given this 5 stars, but it is so messy without a pump or a way to pour this out without it dripping all over the place. I know picky picky, but that is the only gripe. Since buying this, I've used it in place of regular sugar for everything I can. From the morning coffee, to  eakfast foods like oatmeal and even cereal (suggestion is mix with the liquid first then pour on cereal)...will try cooking at some point I think...just not sure of the sugar to agave ratio, since it is sweeter I'm assuming less sugar and less liquid but I dunno. I actually purchased this since I was going to use 1 for  ewing an agave beer...tequiza anyone? LOL...not tried that yet since I've found more uses that I need to buy another set just for that purpose.
