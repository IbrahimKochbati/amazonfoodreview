With all natural ingredients and no preservatives; all I can say is "fantastic".  There is no expiration date but I would eat this within a week or two    faster if it's opened.  Absolutely excellent!          You can freeze these with no loss of quality.          Don't order if the weather is hot because they ship it in cool bags with cold packs instead of styrofoam with dry ice.  My orders usually arrive cool but not cold.
