I have had good results with this in my  ead maker preparing as dough only.  I let the  ead machine do the hard work then remove the dough (it is very wet, sticky dough) and place it in a lightly greased plastic bowl.  I let it rise  for a couple of hours, punch it down, then place it in greased & floured  ead pan, let it rise about an hour.  Bake at 400 for about 25 minutes.  It comes out great.  Good rise, great crust and soft inside.          I haven't purchased it here at Amazon but get it at my local Walmar... (well you know who) for about $2.20 a box.
