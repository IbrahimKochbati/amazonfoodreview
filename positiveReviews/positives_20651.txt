My mother always made her chili using the French's Chili o Mix by following the directions and using Ranch Style beans. It is the perfect combination of flavors and a chili tradition for our family. I have had a difficult time finding it in my local store since I relocated. Luckily it is easily located thru Amazon and our taste buds are not deprived. It is the perfect blend of spices!
