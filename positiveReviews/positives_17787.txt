I've tried a great many teas trying to find the perfect morning (or anytime) cup that would get me started. Brodie's has fit the bill to perfection. I am enamored with the rich, bold flavor thats easily tempered with sugar and milk. Several years ago, I had the pleasure of staying in Scotland for two weeks. I woke every morning in the hostel to a fine cup of tea and traditional Scottish  eakfast. Brodie's reminds me with each sip of those blissful few weeks I spent in the Highlands.
