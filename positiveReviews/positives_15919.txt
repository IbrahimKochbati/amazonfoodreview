This blend is really roasty. Since I am not a coffee drinker, I was less than thrilled with my purchase. However, all of that disappoinment went today as I added just 1 tablespoon of this hazelnut matcha into a basic scone recipe. I could not be happier with the addition of the hazelnut and I know that the matcha makes this a healthier alternative to the cookies I was eating with my black teas.
