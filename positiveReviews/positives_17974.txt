These are good for a meal replacement. To me, they are a little on the dry side so I always have something to drink with them. I can have one of these and some milk and be held over until I get home from work. This pack of 12 peanut butter and 12 double chocolate can be had at the local S**'s place for half the price, so if you have a volume discount store like that, be sure to check there first.
