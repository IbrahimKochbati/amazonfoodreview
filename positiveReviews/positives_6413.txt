While I love flavored coffees, I had never tried any of the Wolfgang Puck line.  This moved to the top of my favorites list with the first cup!  Not only is the aroma delightful, the flavor is excellent as well.  I drink my coffee black and this one has no bitter after taste and the flavor isn't overpowering.  The flavor is a very light coconut and the coffee is a medium body.  I must admit that I was a little hesitant about a "coconut" flavor.  DON'T BE!  Everyone around me wants a cup....I refuse to share!
