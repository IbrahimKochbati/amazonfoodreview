Found this product for sale on vacation in North Carolina and loved it... great maple flavor!! Walmart sold it for 3.99$ for the 24oz pack. Wish i would have bought some more while I was there because i'm not paying 15$ for what Walmart can sell for 4$. That is just robbery... very disappointed in @#@zon for their insanely high price... If price was reasonable would love to buy more and rate much higher!!
