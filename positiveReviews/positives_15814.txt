All flavors taste great.  This is a good variety to experiment with, especially if you are on a low carb diet like Dukan, Atkins, and etc.  I add these Torani sugar free syrups to non fat greek yogurt, teas, Sprite Zero (raspberry only, sometimes with lemon extract), and etc.  The Irish Cream and Hazelnut syrups are absolutely delightful!  I'm actually looking into order other flavors from Torani's website, as Amazon doesn't carry all of the sugar free flavors that Torani offers.
