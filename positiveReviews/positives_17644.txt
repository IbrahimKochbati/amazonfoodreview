Firstly, let me establish my credibility as a coffee drinker. I drink at least one pot a day of "regular" coffee and on some days I also drink that "snooty" stuff that comes at cafes. Secondly, I suffer with heartburn. I know   lay off the caffeine, right? Well, no more! Actually, I really did enjoy this coffee and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys coffee. It was very smooth and aromatic. There was no evident taste difference to me. I enjoyed it and would definitely purchase this coffee in the future.
