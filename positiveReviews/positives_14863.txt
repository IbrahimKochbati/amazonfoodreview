I guess the tin isn't totally airtight, since I could smell the tea and bergamot that adds up to Earl Grey. The cup of tea was even more fragrant, smooth and not bitter. Since it is loose tea, you need a tea strainer or tea ball, but since it is a small tin, you can pack it on a trip. I like it with milk, but others add lemon. Either way, it's what Earl Grey tea is supposed to taste like.
