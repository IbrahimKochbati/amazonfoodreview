I consider myself a fanatical quinoa connoisseur, having enjoyed many varieties over several decades. NOW Foods Organic Quinoa is by far the best quinoa I have ever purchased. First, the quinoa seeds themselves are thoroughly pre rinsed. There is no acrid flavor whatsoever. There is no impurity in this product. It is 100% quinoa. I do not know what NOW has done differently, but this quinoa cooks more evenly than any other quinoa. I mean, the seeds all cook about the same    not mushy, not too sticky. It's about 90 cents per lb more than the cheapest quinoa, but remember that it is organic, while the other quinoa is not. I highly recommend this quinoa.
