I have DH and need to eat gluten free, it's difficult. Many times I crave a good sweet and I feel deprived.  Now that I found this  ownie mix I make a patch, freeze them in individual servings, and have one  ownie a day. The recipe is easy and the  ownies are rich and flavorable. They're a chocolate lovers answer to having a yummy snack and staying gluten free.  I love them.
