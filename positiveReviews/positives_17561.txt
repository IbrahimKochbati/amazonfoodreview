My wife has occasional heartburn with drinking more then one cup of coffee, particularly with bolder blends. I got this for her since she likes dark roasts, but doesn't like the problems associated with them. After two cups, she found that the coffee wasn't bitter and was very smooth for a dark roast. No heartburn at all. The overall flavor wasn't bad, but it wasn't something that she would be drawn to in the future. Might try other flavors though.
