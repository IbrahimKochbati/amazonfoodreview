This is turning out to be the favorite Harney & Sons tea for my two young granddaughters, who come for the afternoon one day a week. "Let's do tea," they say, and we have ourselves a party.          The aroma of the Chocolate Mint Tea is delicious, and we put Splenda in it, not sugar or honey. A little dash of fat free half & half is also a favorite addition. We have quite a great time visiting and drinking our tea.     This flavor is one of many Harney teas we have on hand, and so far it is their favorite.
