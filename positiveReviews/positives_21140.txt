I bought these shortly after having bought the larger sproutmaster tray. As I mostly only sprout for myself, the smaller trays made a lot more sense. I try to stagger my sprouts now so I always have fresh sprouts on hand. These are incredibly easy to use and clean, although I recommend having some sort of  ush for cleaning (smaller seeds sprouts tend to get stuck in the holes). I highly doubt the expensive automatic sprouting trays could be any easier to use than these. I spend MAYBE 1   2 mins rinsing my sprouts a day  and thats it.
