Well, I like to make my own simple syrups to add to beverages, and this syrup turns out a caramel color, just a bit darker than the granules themselves.  It ends up giving the beverages a funky color....          As I said before, the Madhava Organic Coconut Sugar is not as sweet in my mouth, and I do end up using more to keep a similar taste, increasing the caloric impact.  That, coupled with the color in my items, I may not purchase it again until I decide to cut my sugar uptake.  I don't now how it will taste with the recipes on the site as I generally do not bake, but with the simple syrup the color is so pronounced. ; (          I got this off the Gold Box deal and it was a great price, so that is not a disappointment.
