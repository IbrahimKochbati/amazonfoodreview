If you're looking at this product, it's probably because you're like me and the acid in regular coffee is enough to cause fiery backwash within minutes or hours of drinking it. This coffee solved that problem for me, short & simple. I am reviewing this for Amazon vine and I'm not afraid to be honest.          The taste of the coffee is very much like a Starbucks decaffeinated Italian roast, but the smell is more like a Whole Foods Sumatran blend roast. If there were any complaint, the lack of acidity does take away a little bit of the "hit in the mouth" that you normally expect from coffee.  That being said, it also worked well for making iced coffee.          And   no acid reflux! So in that, it is as advertised.
