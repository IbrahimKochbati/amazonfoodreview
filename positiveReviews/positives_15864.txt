I've spent years reading labels on dog food bags, trying to establish a balance between good food and a reasonable price. Premium Edge is the answer to this quandary. I confess, I recently strayed to another  and in search of a food that I didn't have to drive thirty miles out of my way to get. On the surface the other food seemed to fit the bill (no wheat or corn). But after a few weeks on the other food, my old hound began shaking his head a lot and two hot spots appeared. I learned the hard way that this particular dog is allergic to soy products.          So we've returned to our tried and true Premium Edge and, after two weeks, not only is hound better, but the other dogs' are glowing again (and I didn't even notice the loss of sheen). What a relief to find it on Amazon at a reasonable price and even more reasonable shipping charges.
