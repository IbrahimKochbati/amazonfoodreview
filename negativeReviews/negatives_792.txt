I received my order of Grove Square hot cocoa mix today, and was very shocked to see that hydrogenated oil was one of the ingredients in the mix. I have avoided using any products that contains trans fats because of the negative effects on blood lipid levels. I would urge Amazon to require an itemized list of ingredients for all food items listed for sale. If the ingredients had been listed, those of us who have concerns about our health can avoid these products.
