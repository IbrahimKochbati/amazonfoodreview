After having to deal with overpriced whole peppercorns of dubious quality from my local supermarket, I decided to give Amazon Grocery a spin.  The price and quality of these peppercorns was vastly better than the supermarket.          Cons: lifetime supply of peppercorns if you don't use much (I do, and even then a pack of 6 is a lot of peppercorns).  Still Amazon Grocery appears to be a superior way to get your spices (and get it shipped free and fast).  Only mark down is for the lack of quantity control and a lower selection in certain items.
