Wow! This is fabulous mixed into plain yogurt or I suppose any flavored yogurt would be tasty as well. I kept meaning to sprinkle it over ice cream, but used it up on the yogurt I take to work. Left it in the office kitchen, and it's very convenient to use. You won't believe how good it tastes! I will  anch out using it in different ways on my next jar. Yum!
