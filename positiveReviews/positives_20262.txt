I ordered all three of the top hits for 'habanero beef jerky' on Amazon. This is far and away the best of the three. The quality of the meat is great. The flavor is complex, and very pleasantly hot. I don't typically go for habanero stuff because I don't go foods that are so hot that you'll slap yo' mama. This is the best jerky I've ever had.          I typically don't like things with MSG because they make me feel like crap, and this didn't have that effect on me at all, so they must not use much MSG.
