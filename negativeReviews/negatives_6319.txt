I have drank Bigelow band peppermint tea and loved it.  But, by current supermarket doesn't carry Bigelow's peppermint tea and I figured how different can they be..after all the ingredients on both is "Peppermint".  I was very surprised to find Celestial Seasonings peppermint tea is very weak tasting.  I am using two tea bags just to get more flavor.  Also, there is a subtle difference in the taste of the two teas.  Bigelow's  and has a slightly sweeter taste, which I enjoy.  In the future I will not be purchasing Celestial Seasonings peppermint tea.
