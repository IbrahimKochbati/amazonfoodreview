I have used this product for many years.  It is ORGANIC NON GMO which is a requirement for me, as well as the good nutrition analysis, ease of use, and cost.  Morinu is packaged with a shelf life of 9 12 months, needs no refrigeration, and can easily adapt to most recipes and smoothies.  My pantry is never without Morinu Organic Firm Tofu and Amazon has the best price.
