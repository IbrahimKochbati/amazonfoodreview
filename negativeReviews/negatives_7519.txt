On the cover, pink guava and coconut sounds very interesting and tasty.          It was the complete opposite.          My taste is very good and i am not picky at all. I can eat most food on this planet without hesitation.          But, the taste on this drink is different. It does not taste good or bad. It for sure doesn't taste like a $10 product.          It taste like the container that holds the drink. The taste does not taste like guava or coconut water.
