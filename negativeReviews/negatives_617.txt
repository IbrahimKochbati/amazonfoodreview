This tea was horrible.  It tasted like potpourri.  I have really enjoyed other Davidson's teas,many also containing flowers, and thought to try something new.  I think the last ingredient is where things went bad.  It was "natural flavor"  which must have been rose oil or something since my tea chemical taste and making a weaker tea did not help at all.
