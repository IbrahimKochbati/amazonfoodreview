The beans:  Delicious, not too salty, plenty of flavor.          The cans:  The 24 cans are sitting in a single layer in a shallow cardboard flat (like the bottom half of a box) wrapped in plastic.  This flat will probably be loosely included in a larger carboard box with little additional packaging (e.g, some crumpled butcher paper).  End result   you may wind up with 18 cans with dents of various severity, that will leave you wondering how long they will remain safe to eat.
