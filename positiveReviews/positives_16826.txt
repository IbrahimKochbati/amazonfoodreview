This toy really helps my dog slow down when she is eating dinner. Before she would eat too fast and would get sick.  Now we give her this with a cup of food and it takes her about 30 to 45 minutes to eat her dinner.  She doesn't seem to actually "play" with it (she never really plays with anything) but does like to chew on the rope.
