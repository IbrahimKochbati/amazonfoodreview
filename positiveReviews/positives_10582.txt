I LOVE these chicharrones!  They're tasty and have only two ingredients   pork rinds and salt.  No additives or preservatives.          These rinds puff up perfectly in my microwave. The optimal setting for my microwave is 1 minute15 seconds.          Did I mention how yummy the are?          This is the perfect snack for people on a low carb diet, and one bag goes a LONG way.          Buy and enjoy!
