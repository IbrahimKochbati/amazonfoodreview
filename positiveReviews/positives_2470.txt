AS  A CHOCOHOLIC FOR  MANY YEARS I CRAVE A GOOD CUP OF HOT CHOCOLATE.  THIS DONE IN THE KEURIG IS REALLY EASY AND FAST.  THE MILLK CHOCOLATE     IS TASTY AND THE DARK CHOCOLATE TASTES LIKE THE MANY CUPS OF COCOA I HAD AS A CHILD.  NOT PARTICULARLY CARRIED AWAY BY THE  PEPPERMINT     FLAVOR BUT IT WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH  TO MATTER.
