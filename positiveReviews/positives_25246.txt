5 stars is not enough......hands down the best pure organic maple syrup. tried many but no comparison. a rich, earthy, strong flavor. and if you do not want a strong maple flavor, this is not the syrup for you. try it with the great river organic milling pancake mixes available thru amazon. highly recommend both. i also use for roasted turkey and ham glazing. endless eating possibilities.
