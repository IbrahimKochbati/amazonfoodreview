Not quite as good as Chinese takeout, but it has the convenience that you can keep it in a desk drawer if you have a microwave at work.  It is a two step process to prepare, so it takes a few minutes.  The rice comes out better than in some microwave meals because it is prepared separately.  The flavor is OK.  The small chunks of chicken look like dark meat (so many things taste like chicken, who knows).  The Healthy Choice  and uses less salt than some other food  ands.  It has 400 mg of sodium which is OK.  The protein and fiber are in good balance, and the calorie count is OK if you are on a diet   it is a reasonable size portion.
