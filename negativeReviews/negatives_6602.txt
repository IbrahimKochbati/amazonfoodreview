I love tea...and I really hate writing bad reviews. Maybe I didn't make it right, but I've made other teas that came out just fine.     I've bought a bottled version of it from another  and and expected a similar taste out of this tea I bought today. I tasted nothing. I let it steep and steep and steep, taking sips ever so often to see if the flavor ever came out.          I think the most disappointing thing about it is its box and smell. It's box describes it as "pomegranate blueberry" flavor. I tasted neither. It had such a seductive aroma, so much so, I could smell it while it was still packaged and I admit it was what persuaded me to buy it.          I let my mother try it, and she described it perfectly:  even though it had a lovely aroma, it wasn't flavoring the water.     I noticed that there was an "apple y" after taste at least. Lipton's just needs to step it up and make it a bit stronger so you can actually taste it. I don't know if it is because I have a natural affinity for stronger tea, or what, but I cannot begin with how disappointed I was, especially for the price I paid in store. If a tea has a fruit flavor added, I want to taste the fruit. I would rather it have a robust, full bodied flavor. Or at least put on the label that it's a milder tea.          For the rest of the people who put excellent reviews, do tell what you did to make it taste so good. I find that it is sweet smelling water and nothing more.
