I usually buy Sprout and thought I'd try this food since it got other great reviews.          I am pleased with this meal.  It's a little less chunky than Sprout's stage 3 meals...so I worried a bit less about my baby gagging on it as he's learning to chew more.          Also, the chicken, sweet potato is a big hit with my baby.  He ate it all up!          These organic meals are a very nice alternative to making my own food for him.
