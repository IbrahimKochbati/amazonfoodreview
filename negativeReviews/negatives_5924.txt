loving fettuccine and being diabetic i have been looking for a fettuccine i could eat,i was so excited when i saw this product on amazon,i purchased the 6 bag package of Al Dent Carba Nada,i cant express my disappointment when i cooked it for dinner,stating it was awful is an understatement....It tasted like i was eating a cardboard box and no matter how much cheese i put on it didn't help the flavor.  I am now stuck with 5 1 2 bags and a big waste of my hard earned money.  Do I recommend this product......NOT in a million years save your money.  hopefully i will find a flavorful product and soon.          Anyone need 5 1 2 bags of....insulation.......  j.sorenson
