I was diagnosed with a severe gluten intolerance back in January. The main thing I really missed was  ead products and all the  ead mixes loaves I read about were just ok and very over priced so I never tried them. I saw someone rave about this  ead mix and since it was at one my local grocery stores at a cheap price I decided to try it. It was amazing and tasted like "normal"  ead. It doesn't rise if you're making a  ead loaf due to the mix having no yeast but I've made pizza crust,  ead, hamburger buns, and cinnamon rolls and they have all turned out great. My husband loves this  ead and he can eat gluten. Highly recommend to anybody who can't eat gluten and wants  ead products.
