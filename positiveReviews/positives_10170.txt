I love these things. My dog has arthritis and needs to take medication 3 times a day. Before I found these we had to push the pill to the back of her throat to get a pill down her. We had tried all the usual things that involved putting her pills into various types of food but she always managed to spit out the pills and get the food.     Now with Greenie Pill Pockets the pills go down 1st time every time and no one is traumatized; especially me.     A great idea, if you have a dog taking medication these are fast and easy to use. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone.
