I roast my own coffee and consider myself to be a bit of a coffee snob.  While I do sometimes drink coffee with caffeine, or do half caf, I often drink decaf because I'm hyper enough without it.          The bottom line here is that this is an outstanding, full bodied coffee.  It developed excellent crema (the reddish  own foam that forms on a proper shot of espresso) and has a wonderful flavor and aroma.  No one would ever suspect that this was a decaffinated coffee if you didn't tell them.          The beans were extremely fresh and they didn't overroast the beans, the way that some major chains seem to do.  This is a very nice and satisfying coffee.  I strongly recommend it.
