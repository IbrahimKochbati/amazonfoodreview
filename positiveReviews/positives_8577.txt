I love nuts of all kinds, and eat some almonds and walnuts every day. I've tried all the  ands of almonds  salted, unsalted, raw, dry roasted, spiced, cocoa covered, you name it. These are by far the tastiest of all  ands and types I've tried. Great texture, a hint of salt...just right. The only problem with these is that they're so delicious its hard to stop eating them. Plus, Amazon beats the store price. Love them...
