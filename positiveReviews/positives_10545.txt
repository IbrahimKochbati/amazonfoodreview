I like to try new things and we have a British store nearby call the Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. The other day when I was there I picked up a liter bottle of Robinson's Apple and Blackcurrant Fruit Drink imported from England. It's a concentrate and has no added sugar. You use one part of the concentrated drink with four parts of water. For the water, I choose an ice cold slightly carbonated spring  water. Just mix and, viola, a nice tasting glass of fruit drink with a minimum of calories. Delicious! Very, very good. And the original bottle says it has 22 servings, although I may make up a little larger serving than they suggest. Well, what can I say? It tastes like a very good soda pop and has an absolute minimum of calories.          Gary Peterson
