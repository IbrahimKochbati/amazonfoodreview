This soda just did not appeal to me it had a very different taste than soda, (that is probably because I have never a Kiwi Berry Soda before), and it was really over sugared.  The carbanation level of the drink is low.  I think I was expecting this soda to be somewhere inline with Jones Soda.  This would certainly not be an item I would want to purchase again.
