I purchased these crackers from a local store for my 9 yr. old daughter who has celiac disease. She loves them but so many crackers were  oken that they were mostly unusable for anything other than a bowl of pieces to snack on. I could only get about 3 cracker sandwiches out of the entire box. Glutino needs to fix this problem asap.
