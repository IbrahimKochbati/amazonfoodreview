If you're like me, then you LOVE peanut butter so much that you can't really keep it in the house.  The 'real' stuff is so full of fat and salt and hydrogenated oils that its yumminess comes at a pretty high cost.  PB2 is a great alternative.  It's not exactly the same taste as a commercial product, but it's close enough that when you put with the other things you would normally eat you will not notice much of a difference, and if you do, just imagine how much fat you're not eating!          One of the great advantages of this product is that you can make it whatever consistency you want, just by altering the amount of water you add in the mixing process.  I find that makes it a very versatile product for cooking when I want to make a peanut sauce, or when I put it on apples and want it a bit thicker than the standard ratio delivers.          Also, the fact that is has to be mixed up short circuits the spoon to mouth pattern that made it impossible for me to keep the 'real' stuff in the house.          The only real down side is that because it's a powder there is no 'crunchy' version, but I suppose you could chop up peanuts and mix them in if you wanted to.
