I bought this looking for a healthier alternative for chocolate milk.  Unfortunately the kids don't like it at all, and I have to admit, I didn't really care for it either.  I had a hard time getting it mixed in, so it tasted grainy.  I tried mixing it in the blender for smoothies and the blender couldn't even get it mixed in.  I've been able to sneak it into pancake mix and oatmeal, just to use it up, but I won't be buying it again.  I give it 3 stars for nutritional value.
