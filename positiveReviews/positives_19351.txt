Healthwise Decaffeinated, Low Acid coffe is a wonderful product.  Health problems had prevented me from drinking coffee, even decaf.  But, the decaffeination combined with the Swiss water process low acid made this coffee completely acceptable.  No bad reactions and what a wonderful taste.  I serve it to guests, who comment on how good the coffee is.  I never tell them it's acid free, decaf!
