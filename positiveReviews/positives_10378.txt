This truffle oil is quite good but I prefer the Plantin  and, which is from France. The Urbani is from Italy. The Plantin is more expensive but it is oh so delicious. I have tried both black and white and both are good. Black is a bit stronger, or more pungent. In any event, this is a very healthy alternative to butter! Enjoy!
