I am a huge fan of Dr. McDougall's products and this oatmeal deserves a lot of praise.  These oatmeal packs contain a reasonable 120 calories (most store  ands have 150 calories).  One package of this oatmeal truly fills you until lunch.  Each packet has the perfect mix of apples, cinnamon and oatmeal.          As you search for healthy oatmeal, you will find that the company makes large oatmeal cups.  I found the cups to be too large    I started to remove half the oatmeal for my next day's  eakfast.  I don't have to do that with the oatmeal packets because the portion size is perfect. I hope the company begins to make packets for the Dr. McDougall  eakfast cups.
