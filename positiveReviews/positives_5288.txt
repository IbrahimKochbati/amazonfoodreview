I usually drink my soda room temperature but with this one I really needed it to be cold.  The taste is okay but takes a bit getting used to the tangerine in orange soda.  There was not as much carbonation which is fantastic as far as I'm concered and it wasn't exceedingly sweet.  I would most certainly consider getting this again as I don't think it's all that bad.  It's nice to have a bit of change from the usual orange soda flavor.
