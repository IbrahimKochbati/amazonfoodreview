We've been feeding this to our dog for several months now and I must say that he is getting around considerably easier!  We started in the fall and this winter was a bit easier for him, even in the hard cold.  This spring, he is moving more easily, even when I am not diligent on regular exercise.          Riley is a Border Collie mix, male, 7 years old. Very active, healthy weight.          UPDATE:     10 months later and through the winter....     Riley has been on this food for well over a year now and hubby and I are quite shocked at the improvement.  We really only expected a minor improvement and perhaps to slow the progression but Riley doesn't do that very slow, labored rise from laying down.  Last winter, it would  eak my heart to see him trying to get up from his bed but now, he's like a puppy again, ready to go whenever we are!  We will be feeding this formula for as long as he'll eat it!  Thanks Pedigree!     Of course, no guarantees with your cherished member of the family, but considering the very expensive stuff that is out there   this is TOTALLY worth a try for 6 8 months!
