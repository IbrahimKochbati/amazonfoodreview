My Mom was born in Manchester, England,and I have been drinking tea since I was very young. A few years ago I was forced to switch to decaf tea. Most of the blends available are terrible. I used to drink regular Yorkshire tea, and was thrilled to discover they had a decaf blend and it is a strong, full bodied tea, and I love it! I decided to purchase from Amazon because I knew I could count on them, as  well  as their outside vendors. I was very pleased with the transaction and would purchase from them again.
