The Icicle is truly a great piece of hardware. It's as simple as plugging your mic cord into the product and plugging that into your USB. The BEST thing about this product is it allows you to take your mic wherever there is a usb equipped computer. It is light weight so I don't know it's durability and don't plan on throwing it to find out. The Icicle comes with a gain knob which is a plus BUT remember with this is a 60 dollar plug n play tool so it doesn't have any other features.          *also i didn't have the noise feedback issue
