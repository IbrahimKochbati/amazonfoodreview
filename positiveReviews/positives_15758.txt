My cats seem to enjoy this food as much as their erstwhile favorite, Wellness wet food.  They are pretty fussy so I am pleased.  I also like the fact that the the ingredients seem to be nourishing (no by products) although since some reviewers have mentioned a possibly dangerous ingredient, I think I will do a little more research before ordering this again.
