I will no longer be giving these to my dog!! They caused my dog to have diarrhea and vomit! When I did some more research online, there were many many posts about how the treats caused their dogs to have similar and even much more severe health issues! My dog loves these treats. I have been giving these to her for about a year or two now. Every once in a while she would have diarrhea or start vomiting a yellow foamy substance  in most cases both, and I finally now linked it to these treats. Do your research before you buy this product!! However, I would not recommend these at all!
