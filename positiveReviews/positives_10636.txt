I normally have beef jerkey with my lunch for some easy to transport protein. I decided to give these a try, bought them at the grocery store and they were great. Easy to measure and a lot less stringy than normal beef jerkey.          I ended up saving a ton of money using amazons subscribe and save over using the grocery store. Definitely something I'll reorder.
