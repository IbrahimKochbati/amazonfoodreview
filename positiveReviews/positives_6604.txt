I bought a two pack at the Friday sale for $20.  Reasonable, but not an amazing deal.  I've been pleasantly surprised by the taste.  I do like the Van whatever flavor French Vanilla K cups, and this contains significantly milder flavoring of a good tasting coffee.     I would and have served it to company and highly recommend serving with milk or cream.          If you like flavored coffees, you'll most likely enjoy this one.  If you like it plain and black, you'll probably hate this.
