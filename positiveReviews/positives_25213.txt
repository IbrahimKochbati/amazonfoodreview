The quote in the title of this review was from my boyfriend, who grew up in Canada and was convinced that America didn't have "real maple syrup." Determined to get better tasting stuff over the generic grade A syrup our grocery store had, I decided to try this Grade B Coombs Family Farms stuff based on the reviews. They weren't kidding, folks! It DOES taste better. The first few times we had  eakfast with this, my bf exclaimed "This syrup is so good!" like he couldn't believe it. He still says it occasionally. Safe to say, this has earned its place as a staple pantry item in our household; with the subscribe and save, it's a pretty good deal.
