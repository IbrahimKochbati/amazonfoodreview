I have never had any hot chocolate that tastes better than this. Not homemade, not from starbucks, not from Swissmiss... This is hands down the best I've ever had. I go through so much of this stuff because whenever friends come over, they go straight for it.          But what happened to the price? Most k cups run from about $0.45   $0.65 but Amazon has these things going for $0.92. Even Bed Bath & Beyond has them cheaper than that. Bring the price back down to something reasonable and your 5 star review will return.
