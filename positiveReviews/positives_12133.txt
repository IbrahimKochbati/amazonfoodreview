Ordering my coffee from Amazon is so easy and postage free.  I don't know how they do it but when my box is getting low here comes an offer on my e mail.  I could buy it at my local grocery for a penny more but the convenience of having coffee delivered to my front door is worth the penny it cost. I don't have to walk in the snow or drive my car for $4.00 per gallon.  Thank you Uncle Amazon
