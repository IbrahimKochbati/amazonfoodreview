So far, I have tried caramel apple, fruit & nut, morning glory, and banana walnut flavers. I have also ordered, (but not yet received) the pumpkin spice cookies. All of them are an excellent meal replacement or nutritious snack. The ingredients are wholesome, there is no high fructose corn syrup, and they have a good supply of protein & fiber to stave off hunger for several hours. The caramel apple is probably my favorite because it seems to be the moistest, but I really love all of the flavors. Like other reviewers, I freeze them, and then microwave a cookie for 20 seconds when I am ready to eat it. I find the cookies taste best warmed up. Even though the calorie count is higher than many cookies, I think you get a lot of nutritional "value" with these.
