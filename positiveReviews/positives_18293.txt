I love these; a low calorie way to get that "barbeque potato chip" taste. Still somewhat high in sodium, but healthier than regular chips. You really do get that barbeque potato chip taste! If you are trying to eat healtier or lose weight this may satisfy your "potato chip craving".  I really like the barbeque flavor. Great single serving for portion control. (It's easy to eat too many chips without knowing it!)
