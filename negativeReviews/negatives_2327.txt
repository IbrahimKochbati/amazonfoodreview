I tasted about half of the different foods on the big list of recommendations. Most tasted slightly different. Some got a sweet tickling in the mouth. I got the strongest effects from vinegar, ketchup mustard and Salt vinegar chips. But nothing tasted miraculously better as I had expected. As others have pointed out, everyone reacts differently. The two other people I did it with seemed to have about my reaction as well. One experienced a bit stronger and the other one a bit weaker than me. You could try this if you are interested but I wouldn't buy it again.
