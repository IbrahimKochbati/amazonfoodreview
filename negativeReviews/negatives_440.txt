I ordered this because I have had the Donut Shop coffee before and really enjoyed it and wanted to taste some of the other flavors they offered.  After receiving my order of the "sampler" pack, I was very disappointed! Over half my order was decaf coffee and I only got 2 cups of the flavored coffee; which was the main reason I ordered it.  I love this coffee but am disappointed in the so called sampler pack or "the lack of variety" pack!
