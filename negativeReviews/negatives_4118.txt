This was purchased as a "Warehouse Deal" and there was a noticable lack of aroma when opening the package.  I do not know if it had just been sitting aroung too long ( ew by 3 5 11 on package) or if the lack of flavor character is normal for this product.  Two stars because it is still drinkable but boring.
