I've been eating Snow's clam chowder for years, so I buy a few cans when it's on sale. Well it looks like Bumble Bee has taken over. What a big mistake. When I opened the can, it was all watery and smelled funny. I put it in a bowl to microwave, and noticed how thin it was, but thought I'd try it anyway. It was nasty to say the least. It about made me sick. So I went and opened another of the new cans, more of the same. Then I got an older can of the non Bumble Bee chowder and it was great like always. If I could give the new junk no stars, I would. Sucks bad.
