i am a diehard fan of shake n'bake.  my kids adore fried pork chops, but i couldn't justify the added fat and calories for a little crunch.  also, as someone who works fulltime, i need a quick and easy meal that requires minimal prep. the flavor of shake and bake is delicious, and the best part is that i can bake it.  anyone who has their hands full with children knows how great baked meals are when you come home at night.  and the best part is my kids gobble it up!
