I became aware of Donut House Decaf because Amazon emailed me an ad for it, since I'm a longtime buyer of k cups.  I'd tried various other varieties of decaf and found them OK but not terribly exciting to the taste buds.          Donut House is different, stronger (they mean it when they say Extra Bold)  but not the way espresso or French roast is strong, mellower than that  and more flavorful than the others.  Now I'm a fan, and I hope Amazon keeps carrying it.
