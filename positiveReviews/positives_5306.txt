I'm very pleased with the DisposaKups.  They were part of a Christmas gift for my husband and he is busily filling the DisposaKups with his favorite Starbucks coffee.  Needless to say, these will part of the Keurig experience for him and we plan to purchase more once he's used the two boxes I ordered.  I was especially pleased that the order arrived in time for Christmas since I was late in finding them. We will definitely use this company again!
