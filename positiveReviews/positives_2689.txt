Grove Square hot chocolate is very tasty.  I was searching for The Swiss Miss  and and the search pulled up this one. The price was right so I ordered some with hopeful expectations and was pleasantly surprised at Grove Squares wonderful chocolate creamy taste even on the large cup Koerig setting. You won't be disapointed
