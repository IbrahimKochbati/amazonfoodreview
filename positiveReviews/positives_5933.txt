This stuff apparently has a shelf life of many weeks, even after opening. And it tastes ok in tea and coffee, once you get used to it, which is more than I can say for soy milk.          But, I give it just 4 stars because it's so hard to mix. Now, if they added some modern chemicals to allow easier mixing, even if it caused an allergic reaction, I still wouldn't vote for Newt Gingrich.
