When you go to the movie theater, the popcorn comes coated yellowish and golden.  You love the taste so much that you pick out the yellowist most flavorful kernels and eat them first. You've made popcorn at home, both on the stove and the microwave type, and it is missing "something".  This popcorn isn't missing anything.  From the tropical based oils to the carefully measured popcorn salt, this has it all.  It tastes exactly like the popcorn you get at the theater.  I've read a few complaints here that this popcorn is too salty.  I don't agree.  In fact when I make it, I add the full amount of oil and salt but withhold about 1 4 of the kernels to amplify the salty greasiness.  When I pop this corn the entire house fills up with that awesome "movie theater" popcorn smell but without that nasty microwave undertone.  The price was great, the product rocks, the shipping (even to Alaska!) was free, I can't really think of any constructive criticism for this product.  I don't  have a popcorn kettle, and the instructions on each package shows how to pop this rockstar either on the stove, with an air popper, in a kettle, etc.  So long as the free shipping applies, I will be ordering this product again and again and again.
