I'm not a Jerky expert or anything like some of the reviews here. But I've had a few different  ands, some the national  ands and some smaller ones. I'd have to say this is a bit below average. It was slightly spicy but not terribly tasty and the texture wasn't that good. I didn't get the feeling I was eating quality meat.          So why 1 star? Easy. Within 48 hours of opening it I was greeted with bluish white mold covering about 5 or 6 pieces. I'm sure by tomorrow it will be more but it's now in the trash. I don't even know how that happens
