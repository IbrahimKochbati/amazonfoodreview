I ordered the loose tea in tins and received 6 boxes of tea bags. The only labeling on the box was a barcode sticker with for tea in tins, which was incorrect. When calling customer service I had only two options    return the tea bags or keep them and be overcharged. There was no follow up, so there was no way to know if I would receive the correct product if I ordered again. The price had gone up 20% in the mean time. Rather than be without tea (I can't buy that  and where I live), I kept it. You can't get your money back if you are over charged, and you can't complain about it to anyone who cares. I will never use Amazon Grocery again if I can help it, and I suggest you do the same.
