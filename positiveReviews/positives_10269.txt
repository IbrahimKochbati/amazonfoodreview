The Beaba freezer tray is flexible and very easy to clean. It has seven slots which is a good amount of storage for a week worth of 2oz puree portions. I make a lot of food for my 9 month old boy and I like to use this tray to store various fruit purees. The top closes securely and feels like it wouldn't come off if dropped.
