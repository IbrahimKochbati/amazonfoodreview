The one downside to the single serve coffee maker is that you cannot make your coffee stronger weaker. Well I found that with this blend of coffee it gets much more bold than other  ands. I like my coffee bold and this one is perfect for me.  I do wish that these single serving size cups were cheaper but other than that this product is excellent, great flavor with good boldness.
