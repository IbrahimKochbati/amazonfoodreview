Corn flour isn't treated with lime.  Treating corn flour with lime gives it a fairly distinct bitter aftertaste and a more dense construction.  Chocolate chip cookies made with masa harina, which tastes like the tortillas it's meant for? Little bitter  icks with chocolate chips.  eek.          (I wish it were corn flour.  As of this writing, none of the major mills in the Americas  that means North and South  make gluten free corn flour.  Not even Bob's Red Mill is, anymore, bless them for having the integrity to say so  although I hear you can order it from someplace in Canada.)          *This is where we cut to the clueless Texas Roadrunner face.*          This is masa harina, sorry guys.
