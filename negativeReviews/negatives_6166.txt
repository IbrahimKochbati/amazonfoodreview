Douwe Egberts coffee is the most incredible coffee you will ever have, but only out of the machine that uses the liquid form. I was so excited about availability of ground but very dissapointed in the taste. It's ok but nothing like the machine. It doesn't change my opinion of the company and the amazing machine, but I'll just stick with Starbucks, Peet's, Seattle's, etc ground. As always though, Amazon is so easy to work with, I received my order quickly. Amazon never let's me down.
