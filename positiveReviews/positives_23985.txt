I really like these. One reviewer mentioned they have soy in them. The last ingredient in them is soy lecithin (emulsifier)which is in many store bought foods. It is not a soy product though. I have to keep my soy intake down because I have Lupus but these do not bother me. They are quite salty and on the rare occasion when I made a pig of myself and ate the whole bag it made my tongue sore. They are really good though. I bought mine at Trader Joe's but am delighted to find them now at Amazon (for only 11 cents more a bag) as it is a pain to go shopping and have to get my wheelchair in and out of the car. I plan to order some right now.A great alternative to greasy regular potato chips.
