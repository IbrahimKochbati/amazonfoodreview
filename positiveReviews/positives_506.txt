My male Maltese dog had been enjoying the Old Roy's Puppy Biscuits from Walmart.  Then I couldn't find them.  I was desperate to find a treat that would measure up.  I ordered six bags of the peanut butter and crossed my fingers.          They arrived, and my little guy loves them.  He gets one heart shaped biscuit at bedtime.  He sleeps in a crate.  When he hears me touch the bag of treats, he beats a path to his crate in high excitement.  They are a BIG hit with my him.  They are well worth the price.  They are high quality and I can even smell peanuts in them.
