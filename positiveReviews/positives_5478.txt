A friend gave me a tea bag to try while at work yesterday.  I accidentally oversteeped the tea and expected a very strong bitter  ew.  I was very happy with the smoothness of this tea.  While it was quite strong, nothing was overpowering and the bitterness I expected was not present at all.          My 2nd  ewing was done with more care.  This tea has an exceptionally smooth taste and excellent flavor.  I'll be buying Ahmad tea in the future.
