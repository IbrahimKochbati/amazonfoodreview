My puppy, a 14 week Bernese Mountain Dog, has a very sensitive stomach and frequent diarrhea, so she was on an expensive vet prescribed diet for the first two weeks that I had her...eventually she needed a more growth oriented food, so I switched her over to Eukanuba Large Breed Puppy (on the recommendation of the vet), but she still rarely had solid stools.  Also, each day, her coat seemed less shiny, she had a ton of dandruff, and scratched like crazy.  After only a week on Canidae (I'm gradually mixing more and more of it in, and decreasing the Eukanuba)   she's stopped itching, and her poop is way more solid and far less frequent.          I know there's no perfect pet food, but if you have a dog with a sensitive stomach and or possible allergies (I'm thinking corn or another filler that Eukanuba and Iams uses?), Canidae could be a godsend.  It has  been for me.  Every dog deserves a better quality food than one with by products and a ton of fillers, and some (like my pup) simply can't handle that low quality stuff.
