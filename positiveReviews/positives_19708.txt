The package arrived promptly and all contents in excellent condition. The product is very tasty, though it is a slight bit too peppery for my taste. I have tried all their varieties, and I like this one and Texas BBQ best. The mesquite is also good, and much milder. They have the texture just right  you wouldn't know it wasn't meat if it were a blind taste test. It is a little wet as a jerky, which makes it a tad messy. Each packet contains a whopping 10 grams of protein! A lot of nutrition in a small, lightweight packet. Ideal for camping, keeping in the car glovebox,in a  iefcase or bag, etc. for those times when you need a boost. But for the pepper, I would have given 5 stars, so I rate this 4 stars. Enjoy!
