I had been purchasing this product in the 11 oz size from Whole Foods. Because it is one of the only sweeteners I use, I use it up regularly.  Some people reviewed that they were disappointed with the size when the received their shipment...well, to them I'd say "read carefully and understand about measurements". It was a good purchase for me, as I've refilled my other 11 oz bottle 3 times plus I purchased it with another item that qualified for free shipping. I will be purchasing this again.
