I decided to go shamrocks to the wall this St. Patrick's Day. Too many years, I've been left on the wrong side of the rainbow, stuck holding my Irish for a whole 'nother year. This year, I was determined to paint the town    and myself, if need be, inside and out    GREEN.          St. Paddy's Day just isn't the same without a wee tipple or three of the old witches'  ew. Sadly, I couldn't find real Irish whiskey available for sale on Amazon. So I did the next best thing and bought these fine Irish mustards, made with the very hair of the dog I was looking for.          I'm Irish enough to know that fine whiskey from the old country should be messed with as little as possible. So when the condiments arrived, I filled a nice fresh highball glass with a few ice cubes, scooped in three fingers of wholegrain Irish whiskey mustard, and sipped it by a roaring fire.          I can't say this product was quite as 'smooth' as the other Irish whiskeys I've had. The color was rich and dark, and I definitely detected a hint of the familiar smoky peat. But most of the other characteristics I was looking for seemed masked    muted somehow by a very front forward... how should I say it? "Mustardiness," I think would be the technical term.          I probably wouldn't recommend sipping this neat. Sadly, this vintage is probably best mixed    perhaps in a whiskey sour, or a mustard julep, or some sort of pretzel flavored Irish coffee.
