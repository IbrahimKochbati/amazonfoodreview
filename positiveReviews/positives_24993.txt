When I wound up with terrible morning sickness, everyone had some food or method to recommend for feeling better.  I heard it all  and very little worked for me in the slightest.  I spent my days being miserable and feeling sick as anything.  But when I was visiting a friend, she happened to have a package of Gin Gins and offered me one.  I was already chewing on raw ginger to help things, so I figured it couldn't hurt.          Rarely has anyting tasted so good as that candy did to my morning sick stomach!  Sweet, but not too sweet, with enough of a gingery bite.  One hard candy could last a while and keep the nausea down.  The first thing I did when I had a chance was order a whole case of the things!  After that I always had a bag tucked into my pocket book throughout the first months of my pregnancy.  Unlike raw ginger, there was no preparation time involved, and the candy is much more pleasant to eat and easier to share with others. (I still like raw ginger and ginger tea, though).  Since then, I've recommended and shared my stash of Gin Gins with several pregnant friends  and they've given me positive feedback as well.          Gin Gins also makes a chewable kind  but that's hard on the teeth and can pull out a filling if you're not careful! Plus it's a sharper taste than the hard candies, so it may not appeal as universally.  My only regret is that there doesn't appear to be a sugar free variety of these on the market, and that is something I could have used.  Still, all in all a great investment and one of the most useful things I bought for my early pregnancy.  Beats saltine crackers any day!          Enjoy! ^_^ Shanshad
