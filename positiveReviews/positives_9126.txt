I eat a cookie every morning for  eakfast, different kinds. I don't get hungry until later in the afternoon. I have lost 7 pounds in the last month because I'm not overeating trash all day. I'm not saying it's the cookies that are all responsible, but I eat the cookie and I'm full, then can think about what I'd like for lunch instead of just eating.
