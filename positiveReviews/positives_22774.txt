I use this with a Whirly Pop and it is a great combination!  As others have said...tastes and smells just like theater popcorn, due to the use of coconut oil.  Very few un popped kernels, and total cooking time is just about 3 minutes on medium heat.  I just dump the whole packet into the popper and start cranking.  I don't think it matters if you dump only the oil first, even though it is pretty thick, but once heated it thins out.          I will not use microwave popcorn anymore.  The taste can't be compared to this, no matter what  and you buy.          We have a large family and have tried all sorts of  ands of microwave popcorn, and none come close in taste to this.          I would estimate that one 4oz pack makes just short of 2 3.5oz microwave popcorn bags.          *Update* 8 25 11          Ok, here is the scoops on this product.  I have tried to duplicate the taste by buying coconut oil, popcorn and flavacol salt flavoring.  Cooked it exactly the same.  The taste is close, but nope...not as good as this product from Great Northern.  Of course the final price is cheaper if you mix it yourself, BUT...the end taste is not as good.  I have tried the Act II buttery flavor popping oil instead of the coconut oil, and still the taste is not the same as this.  I often use Whirl butter topping on my popcorn, which tastes fantastic   but these bags from Great Northern don't need a thing as far as topping.  Trust me.  You will not go back to microwave popcorn again.  While cooking, you will swear you are in the movie theater!
