When I saw some of the Earth's Best jars offered as a Gold Box deal, I remembered that I needed to offer a caveat to other parents.       My children have previously enjoyed many Earth's Best flavors, which in general taste quite good, so in Fe uary when there was a promotional offer through Amazon, we ordered two 12 packs of the tender beef spinach. When they arrived, one of the 12 packs seemed ok, but the other 12 pack contained several  oken jars and was leaking. It smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second 12 pack.       I noticed that the shipping box holding the two 12 packs had air filled padding on only the top side of the box, which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side.       I don't know whether some of the jars had  oken at the warehouse or during delivery, but either way, I was afraid to use the un oken jars too, because what if the seals had  oken or what if there were small pieces of  oken glass inside the intact jars too?     For more durable items, I still order from Amazon, but I canceled my subscription of the Earth's Best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where I can check them first.
