These Oat Chocolate chip coconut bars are delicious   they are very soft, with a slight crunch and have a good chocolate and oatmeal flavor. I barely taste any coconut though   just a hint.  I would say that you would not even know you are eating a gluten free, non dairy snack! they are are great substitute for oatmeal chocolate chip cookies anyday (if you like soft cookies).  This is a great snack to put in the lunch bag, backpack,  iefcase and purse just to have something in the middle of the day to keep you going or enjoy a little snack  eak!
