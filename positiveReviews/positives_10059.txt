My wife is Austrian and her favorite coffee is the Julius Meinl coffee. We like this coffee so much that we order it from Vienna (in our opinion it rates 5 stars). In order to test how good this coffee is, I substituted the Julius Meinl coffee with the Melitta Cafe Collection Supreme. My wife drank her coffee and did not say anything. When I told her about the substitution she was quite surprised and she asks about how expensive the Melitta is. Ordering coffee from Vienna is very expensive.          In my opinion, this coffee is slightly (very subtle difference) inferior to the Julius Meinl which is our gold standard. Given that the Melitta is much cheaper we will be buying this coffee in the future.          Highly Recommended!
