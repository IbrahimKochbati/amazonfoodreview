This jerky reminds me a little of the artisan jerky I used to be able to find in California. The strips are thin, so they're easy to bite and the flavor is slightly spicy and definitely smokey.          My husband absolutely loved it..he's been taking 2 3 pieces per day in his lunch and they never come back home with him the way other snacks sometimes do! I'm buying more while they're on sale!
