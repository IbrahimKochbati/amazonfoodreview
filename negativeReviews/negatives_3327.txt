Right out of the bag, these are dense, oaty smelling biscuits that look like hardtack.  My dogs loved the taste, and I felt really good about feeding them something with an ingredient list that talked about organic ingredients.  However, neither of my dogs tolerated these well.  If your dog has a sensitive stomach, this might not be the dog biscuit for you.          Just for reference, I have an older full  eed corgi and a younger corgi chihuaha mix.  My older dog has definitely developed gluten and corn allergies over the years, while the corgi mix just has a sensitive tummy.  That's probably why they couldn't tolerate these  it's not the fault of the ingredients.
