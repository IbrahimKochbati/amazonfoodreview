I don't know if its because I used too much of it, or its the coffee, or its just my taste, but this was way to strong for me. As far as the acid free part, that seemed to be true. It didn't flip out my stomach with too much acid like some coffee's do. I just didn't like the flavor of it. When I first opened the bag of coffee I didn't like the smell of it either. It just didn't have that nice coffee smell. Not sure what it smelled like, but it wasn't coffee and it was a really dark black fine grind that didn't look much like coffee either. I assumed that the package was supposed to be for a single pot of coffee and used the whole thing in my Bun Coffee  ewer. It could have been too strong because my Bun Coffee  ewer has a smaller pot than my old Mr Coffee does. But it doesn't seem to make that much difference with my usual Folgers coffee. While it was  ewing it didn't smell much like coffee either. I tried a couple cups and it was so strong that after I dumped the grounds out of the basket I ran a couple cups of water through it to dilute the pot of coffee a little bit. Didn't help any, it still tasted way too strong for me. If I had some more of it I might try using half the prepackaged amount but I don't think it would change the taste of it all that much. Would I buy some of this coffee anyway because its acid free? No. Wouldn't matter how cheap it was either. Would I recommend this coffee to somebody? Not if they were one of my friends! Who would like this coffee? Maybe somebody that's used to having the very strong espresso coffee or the super strong coffee I've heard they drink in the middle east. But I don't think anybody that I know would like this particular coffee.
