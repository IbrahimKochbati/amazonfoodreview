My husband and I were served this coffee at Derby Dinner Playhouse.  We asked the wait staff what  and they were serving and they said it was Douwe Egbert.  I had never heard of that  and, and couldn't find it in any of our local shops.  Thankfully for Amazon, we were able to find to purchase for home use.  This coffee is so good!  It's the smoothest coffee I have ever had, and the aroma is heavenly!!!!!!!  I store it in the fridge, and everytime I open the door, I can smell this fabulous coffee.  You won't be sorry on this one!  Try it!
