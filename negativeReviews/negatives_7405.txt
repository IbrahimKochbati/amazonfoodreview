I bought this product just because of the good reviews, while I was not expecting it to be the same as when making it 'from scratch', I thought I would be able to save some time from not having to cook.     Half of the bowl is sauce and the beef tastes really bad. Only good thing is the packing, ie the easiness to just put it in the microwave and eat. Not recommended from my taste.
