I pre ordered this product from ProFlowers through Amazon two weeks ahead of Mother's Day and was quite happy when it showed up today on the scheduled date. It was delivered by FedEx. The flowers were slightly wilted from being out of water for the 12 24 hours they were in transit but they perked right up after being put in water.  Included in this package was a nice vase and 2 packets of plant food.          Keep in mind these are mostly buds and will take a day or two to fully open so you might want to have them delivered slightly in advance like I did.          The only possible negative I can think of is the fact I was not provided a tracking number by email to track the package, but it did arrive on time and in good condition.
