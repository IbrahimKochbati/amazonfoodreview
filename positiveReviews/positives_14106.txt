I have been purchasing this tea regularly for a couple of years through Amazon's subscribe and save program. I have never been disappointed with it's quality. I am not a tea snob nor connoisseur of fine teas, so I don't look for the finest tea or even know how it compares with other teas. All I want is an affordable tea that tastes very good to me. Any extra quality would be wasted on me, so why pay more.  This loose tea certainly fits the bill, plus it beats all the store  and tea bag teas and actually works out to be cheaper than most if not all.
