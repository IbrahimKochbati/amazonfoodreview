These chili lime chips have only 100 calories and 4 grams of fat per bag. Most 100 cal snacks that I have had are tiny portions, but these chips are a normal sized serving.          They aren't my favorite Pop Chip flavor, but there definetly is a lot of taste. It is strong flavor that grows on you. When I first tried them, I would have said 3 stars, but now I really like them. A few other Pop Chip fans I talked to rate them at 3   4 stars too.          In the end, they are pretty not too bad for you, but the taste is, well... a matter of taste.
