First thing's first: The taste. It tastes sort of like generic cough syrup, minus the medicine like taste (if that makes sense). It doesn't taste like any other energy drink I've ever had before. So it's unique in that regard. It's not necessarily a good thing, though. I would have to say that as far as taste goes, I would not recommend it.          Secondly, the "spicy, burn your throat" gimmick. It's just that, a gimmick. It doesn't taste spicy so much as it just makes your throat itch. I assume that the slight "spicy" feeling comes from the drink being cold, but if drank warm I'd assume it would taste like camel urine. All it really did was kind of annoy me, it didn't really add to the experience. Not that I was looking for the real cocaine experience. *wink wink*          Thirdly, while it has a high amount of caffeine, it didn't give me quite the kick I was expecting. It woke me up a little, but it didn't do much else. But then again, I drink energy drinks like water so I have a high tolerance. Though I would not recommend it to others, if you value your health.          My girlfriend said that the caffeine effected her more than it did me. She got more of an energy boost without the jittery feeling you may get with supplements such as 5 Hour Energy. She said that she enjoyed the flavor of the drink, so you have a second opinion there. She said that she had experienced the taste combination of cinnamon and strawberry. She enjoyed the "spicy" ness of it but agrees that it wasn't as strong as expected. Even though she liked it, she would only be interested in buying this again if more cans were added or the price was lowered.          Now, here's where I would have to suggest not buying this product. Whether I liked it or not. It is TOO. *BLEEP*ING. EXPENSIVE. About $30 (including shipping) for six 8.4 fl oz (250ml) cans. You're better off buying something like the    "
