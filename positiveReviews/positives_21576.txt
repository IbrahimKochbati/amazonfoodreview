Not a  new product; described as a "classic recipe" on the box. I enjoyed this product many years ago, then got out of the habit. I'm happy to renew my acquaintance with it; it is certainly convenient, good tasting, and a healthy alternative to most  eakfast products. Oatmeal isn't very exciting, but it's easy to add some frozen fruit to it. The fruit thaws rapidly and adds some appeal.
