This goat's milk has been a godsend for our granddaughter who seemed to get sick on every formula we tried.  The goat milk with a little coconut oil and extra DHA became a fantastic infant formula.  Once she started using the goat milk, almost all of her "issues" resolved themselves.  Her skin cleared up completely and her scalp didn't look all scaly and dry.  She looked like the perfect child we knew her to be!  She's now 7 months and has been using it since she's a month old.  She has been growing beautifully and perfectly on this powdered goat milk.  The powder is very convenient too.  Twenty years ago my nephew used goat milk in place of cow's milk and also did great!  His allergies also became a thing of the past.  All I can say is this is an excellent product!
