Do not buy Wild Ride Beef Jerky. I purchased two bags of this jerky and they both ended up in the trash. I know Beef Jerky is supposed to be somewhat jerky but Wild Ride takes it to another level. Half the pieces are not edible. Maybe they should advertise this as bubble gum instead of jerky? The taste is OK, average at best. I think the only good thing about this product is the price. It is cheaper than most of the other  ands out there. However, if price is what you're going for, go chew on some spare tires that are in the junkyard. What is sad is that rubber tires are probably more chewable than Wild Ridge Beef Jerky. Seriously, don't buy this  and.
