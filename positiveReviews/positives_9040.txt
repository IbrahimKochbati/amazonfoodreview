Able to store my coffee right under the machine. I still have room on top for my soda maker (Keurig is a mini).     The only thing I don't like is that the pods that are in the back may be a little difficult to get. Would be better if there was a spring that would push these last pods forward slightly as the others get used. Other wise. much more useful than a carousel.     As another reviewer mentioned, can get this item for $25 at Bed bath.. and with usual 20% off coupons, for even less. It also does raise the Keurig about 3" from the counter. So be sure to have room above the coffee maker as well as on the sides
