Does your dog spit out his her meds? Maybe rolls it around in his her mouth before spitting it out all gooey & or smashed. Well, with these Greenies Pill Pockets   wheather beef or chicken flavor  they won't hesitate to readily take their meds & or vitamins. To them, these Greenies Pill Pockets taste just like a treat & they eagely await to take them   actually sitting at attention while you fill the pocket with their meds. They come in two different sizes   one for capsules (these are the bigger ones) and one for tablets. Greenies also offers them for cats as well. I haven't had to give my cats these   but if & when they need to take any meds orally I will give them a try.
