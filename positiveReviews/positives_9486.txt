If you are looking for a sweet, try this cookie.  It is extra light     and has a nice crunch to it.  I buy these cookies by the carton.     They last for one month between my husband and I.  He likes cookies     with his morning coffee.  We are both satisfied with these cookies.     Would buy them again and again.          Mary
