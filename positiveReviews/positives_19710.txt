As an omnivore, I loved beef jerky. My family would eat it all the time. As a vegan, I don't really feel the need to mimic the experience of eating beef jerky so I'm not really inclined to try out the various soy jerkys and what have you that are available. However, the mesquite lime (green packaging) is so good that it makes me say phrases that I never say (bomb diggity) and praise its deliciousness here so that all may come to know the little bit of tongue heaven that it is. Strong, bold flavor and perfect chewy texture. The only down side is that once you're done, you want more. Hence, get the pack of 24. The mesquite lime flavor is so good that I dare not try the other flavors any time soon and taint my Primal Strip food gasmic journey.
