At the Starbucks online store, this coffee is $10.95 lb (approx 68 cents per ounce).  Here at Amazon with a 3 pack (should be discounted, right?), you get 3 x 12oz (36 oz) for $28.20, which is approx 78 cents per ounce.  Not to mention that anti green waste of 3 smaller packages...it's more expensive than at the company store!!          I think a lot of people buy these thinking they are getting 1 lb bags, which seem to be the standard.  Great coffee, not a great deal.
