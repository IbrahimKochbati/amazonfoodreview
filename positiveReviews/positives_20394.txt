I tried to use the cheaper cereals with my baby and she would refuse them.  From the moment she tried the HappyBellies, feeding became so much easier.  She loves the way it tastes.  My only complaint is that I wish it came in bigger packaging.  I feel like I am always opening a new can and would rather there be less packaging.  But at the same time the cans are very easy to transport when traveling.
