These SAHLEN'S SMOKEHOUSE HOTDOGS are "Totally Yummy".  They have a lighter flavour than the all beef hotdogs I am used to....and are NOT as unduly salty!  The delicious smoked taste is there, all right    but it is NOT overpowering, and will NOT burn your tongue!  Just a nice, subtle flavour.  And this all means not only are they delicious, but also that you won't go looking for gallons of water, (or soda, or whatever), after you eat a few.          These are BIG, substantial hot dogs.  If you want yours in a hot dog bun, it will probably not only fill the bun, but some of the hot dog will stick out at either end!          If you wnat to take the "wrapping" (skin), off the hot dog, this is NOT easily done    but then, it's not easily done with any of the OTHER hot dogs I've ever tried, either.  BUT    it is EASIER to take off at least PART of the plastic wrapping    and JUST the plastic wrapping, leaving the hot dog itself, totally intact    with thes Sahlen's Smokehouse Hotdogs, than it has EVER been my experience with any other hot dogs.  (Maybe if I had more patience, I would indeed have been able to take more of    or even all of    the plastic wrap off.  But these hot dogs are SO yummy, such will, I fear, never be the case!)          These hot dogs are conveniently wrapped two together    so you will NOT be taking the entire contents out, when you want just one, or two.  At least, you won't do this inadvertently.  But    once tasting these delightful hot dogs, you may be sorely tempted to do this deliberately....          ................                                            ...................          On one of Oprah Winfrey's earliest programs, she and some guests went to a very     elite restaurant    SPAGOS.  I'm sure I'm not the only audience member who had never head of Spago's before then.  Recently, I learnt that "pizza" at Spagos is     filled with SMOKED SALMON!  This makes Spago's pizza the "non plus ultra" of pizzas, I'm sure!          For "non plus ultra", (absolutely NO better) hot dogs, SAHLEN'S SMOKEHOUSE HOT DOGS, just HAVE to be the ones.  Sahlen's has been making, (and probably, perfecting), hot dogs, since 1869, (140 years).  So, for THE ultimate hot dog, on a par with Spago's pizza, (for pizza), Tetley's Classic Blend, (for tea bags), Maxwell House Arabica Blend Decaf Instant Coffee, (for instant coffee), Guylian Chocolate Sea Shells, (for chocolate), and other such top of the tastebuds foods, it's SAHLEN'S SMOKEHOUSE HOTDOGS, for hotdogs.          Yes....they ARE that good!
