I do not like pre cooked pork rinds, not even made fresh in the Mexican Carnecerias, but hubby likes them, so I decided to buy these.          I was shocked to find that they were light, airy and crispy. Some bags were saltier than others, but we've cooked up about 5 so far and the majority aren't overly salty.          Another reviewer mentioned watching them to figure out how long the cooking time should be. In our 1100 watt oven 40 43 seconds seems to be just right.          The key is to take them out the moment the bag has fully inflated. Leave them in too long and you end up with charcoal and not enough time will make them gummy.          Since I follow a fairly low carb regimen for health and weight reasons, I like the fact that these can be a perfect vehicle for guacamole and salsa without the carbs. I'm still trying to come up with more dip ideas that will go well with the flavoring.          I wish they'd put out a version that didn't have seasoned salt as I'd like them with just salt and or garlic.
