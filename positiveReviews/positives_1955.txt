This is the best I've ever eaten.  If you like mustard and you like     horseradish this is the product to try.     My first experience with Thomy was several years ago when my Son lived     in Germany.  He used to send it home, but after he moved back to the     States the supply was cut off.  But when you notified me that it was     available, I was ecstatic.     The blend is delicious, and goes well with your favorite crackers and     cheese appetizers or with anything you enjoy with mustard.  It adds     that little zing.     Give it a try, you won't be sorry.
