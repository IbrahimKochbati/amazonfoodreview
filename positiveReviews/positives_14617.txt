Tin container not laced in the plasic crap..  The tea is very stonge and not a mixture so you have to add flavors too it but it taste good plain too and is very strong.  Taste wise it's stonge with an inner spice like taste in it if you drink your tea how your supposed to    not a gulper   chuckle.  It was less than what I thought from the other reviewer but it is so strong you don't need as much and I'd still have to say it's a great deal.  Just add a twist of your favorite herb like orange peal or ginger and this can be the making of a great exotic tea but the only thing it's missing is the organic seal of quality and then it gets 5 stars for proving it's grown under kosher conditions which is very important.  The tins are very nice to look at and I hate to thow them away.  Obviously they put a lot of pride in the product.
