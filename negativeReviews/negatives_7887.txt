Our black lab mix almost choked to death on one of these. If I hadn't been sitting in the same room with her, we would have lost her. As the chew gets smaller, it becomes VERY slippery and it slid back into her throat and lodged there. I had to hold her mouth open and reach down and grab it   which, because it was so slippery   was not easy. I strongly suggest finding another way to keep your pups teeth clean. These simply are not worth the risk.
