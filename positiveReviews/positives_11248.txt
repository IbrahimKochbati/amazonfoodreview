Truly, I adore these  ownies.  I am always reluctant to use mixes for anything but an extra crazy schedule forced me to grab this at the store, and boy howdy am I glad!  I made the butter version and added an extra Tablespoon of oil for extra moisture.  You know those flourless chocolate cakes that are so yummy?  That's what these remind me of.  I will be buying this again and again, and was so impressed that now I'm embarking on other Pamela products.
