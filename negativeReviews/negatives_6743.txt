It is unfortunate that the wording of this item description doesn't make it clear that this is artificial flavor. Real vanilla is always  own because vanilla beans are  own. The artificial vanillas are by products of wood processing and contain petro chemicals.  Do your taste buds and body a favor   use the real stuff even though your cake frosting will not be pure white.
