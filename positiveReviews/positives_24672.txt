When this item arrived, several cans were dented (during shipping I think). I contacted Amazon and they replaced the order. I was pleased with the way they handled my concern, and the replacement arrived very quickly. The pumpkin tastes wonderful and we have used it in several recipes. Organic canned pumpkin at my local grocery store is outrageously priced compared to purchasing this off Amazon. Even better, the shelf life on the cans I received was very generous. Overall we're very pleased with this product and will order more for our pantry when our stock runs low.
