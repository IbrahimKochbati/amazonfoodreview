The wild Huckleberry is the most am osia like of all berries, with a tastebud bursting robust flavor, somewhat tart, quite rare, and never to be mistaken for the more common blueberry. Indeed, the delicacy is so extraordinary that Mark Twain named his most famous character after it. And why not? People who know about wild Huckleberries tend to be very passionate about them. Evocative of summer sunlight, mountainsides, mysterious woods, and images of children berry hunting. The huckleberry bushes' small oval leaves, the blue black berries, perfectly round, each with an intense flavor, a unique tartness and crunch.          This uncultivated cousin of the blueberry, grows only in the wild at elevations of 4,000 to 6,000 feet. Twelve species of huckleberries are native to Washington and Oregon. They also grow wild in the Rocky Mountains. However varied the berry, the season is short: late July through mid September. Because they are hard to find, they tend to be expensive. But huckleberry lovers swoon over the thick skin and wild flavor that no other berry captures as well. As far as I am concerned, these berries, food of the god's, are worth every penny.          Huckleberry Haven's Wild Huckleberry Jam perfectly captures the pure, natural taste of this most elite of berries. Buy one jar and you will be back to buy an entire case. I spread the jam on toast, muffins, scones, French Toast, occasionally even on pancakes   much better than syrup, and as another reviewer wrote, this is the best jam to accompany peanut butter. I hope you try this product. I always have a jar in the fridge. ENJOY!!          JANA
