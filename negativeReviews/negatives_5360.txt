....but on the plus side, no heartburn as I sometimes get when drinking coffee.  I made this 3 ounces (1 packet) to a full pot of water in my 12 cup drip coffeemaker, maybe that was the reason for the weakness. I was expecting it to be stronger since "dark" was in the flavor name. Nice aroma and no bitterness, but unless my heartburn issues get worse in the future, I will stick to my regular mocha espresso drinks and my CBTL machine.
