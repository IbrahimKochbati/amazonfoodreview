I bought this tea after reading all of the positive reviews. I have long enjoyed Lipton's Caramel Vanilla Truffle tea and read that this tea was better, so I gave it a try. It smells awesome when steeping, but that is when the positives stopped. It seriously tastes like a thinner version of cheap pancake syrup. There is no vanilla flavor whatsoever, just a strong butter aftertaste. If you haven't tried this tea before don't buy the 6 pack   get a single box. I understand that different people have different tastes, so know what you are getting into before you commit to 6 boxes.
