I could not believe the taste of this mix!  No one would ever guess it is low carb.  The mix is very easy to work with, just like a regular bake mix.  In fact, any recipe you would use regular bake mix, you can use Carbquik.  Everything I have made has turned out wonderful.  The drop biscuits are a staple product in my kitchen.  Quick and easy, and makes it easy to stick with a low carb lifestyle.
