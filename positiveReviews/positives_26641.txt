I was looking for a higher quality dry dog food and did plenty of research on line.  I found very good evals about Natural Balance so I bought some for my 6 year old German Short hair.  I bought the Sweet Potato and Venison.  My dog loves it.  No gas or digestive issues at all.          Beyond that, there is a NOTICEABLE glow to her coat and her coat is much softer.  My wife and kids noticed it as well.  This is a great product. I'd highly recommend it.
