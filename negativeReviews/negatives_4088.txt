We've purchased dragonwell green tea from other vendors and the quality has been much better.  Of course we paid quite a bit more for it as well.  This just goes to prove "you get what you pay for". This bag has a lot of stems and other de is, so would not recommend.  Pay the higher price and get the better quality tea.
