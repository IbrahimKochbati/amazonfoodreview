I love beef jerky but this is not good in any way.  It's very, very fatty, greasy to the touch and too bland.  Maybe under cooked or something??  It's chewy, not tough chewy but chewy like chicken chewy.  Didn't come on site to write a review but to contact the seller about a refund return but since I don't think I can, thought I'd warn you so you aren't disappointed like me :(
