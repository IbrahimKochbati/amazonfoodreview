According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.          Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.          Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over the counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.          A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione "produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung." Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.          Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.          Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.          In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats.
