I have to have a box of nerds at least once a week.  They really aren't that bad in terms of calories at 180 cal. for the whole box and they take a while to eat and that's always a good thing when you are watching your calories.          They taste yummy (sweet and sour) and in terms of treats, they are in my top ten for sure.
