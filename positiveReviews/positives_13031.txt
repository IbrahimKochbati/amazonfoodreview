The case of 12 I ordered arrived with 4 (that's 1 3!) of the cans OPEN and contents all over the mailing box. They were with other canned goods (beans). What a mess! BUT Amazon came through as they always have and replaced the entire order for no charge and mailed them with Prime 1, even tho' I am a Prime 2 customer. BTW, that $79 per year has really paid off for me because what I order is always free shipping and always arrives in 2 days. This is the first year I have had PRIME 2, and I will continue every year from now on. Also, there is the benefit of so many movies to watch for free as part of PRIME membership. Good job, Amazon!
