I'm an avid drinker of bold coffees...Coffee People's Jet Fuel and Timothy's Midnight Magic are my two favorites.  I love to sample new flavors.  I tried Tully's Sampler which included Italian Roast, French Roast, Kona and House.  In the sampler package I found the Italian to be the strongest and most flavorful with French Roast a close second. I could get a nice bold flavor with the largest cup setting on my Kuerig.  Recently due to a back order situation on Jet Fuel I ordered Tully's Italian Roast to hold me over until Jet Fuel arrived.  Much to my chagrin I found the 24 count package of Italian Roast produces a much weaker flavor than the one I received in the Sampler Package.  I could still get a bold cup but only using the medium setting on my Keurig.  If you like a bold coffee and have family members who prefer medium roast I'd suggest the sampler rather than 2x24 count Italian Roast.  You'll get House and Kona which are both very medium along with two good strong bold flavorful  ews in the French and Italian.
