I got this drink expecting the carbonated taste combined with kiwi and berries. Well I could taste the berries but no kiwi. I did like the carbonation with real fruit juices without the added sugar but it is not low cal. I think that I liked this drink better than the tangerine drink but still is not for me. The drink is way too sweet for me to enjoy it.
