I use about 5 rounded tbs per one gallon. We use quite a bit of the tea. If you make it in bulk it can be drunk cold or reheated. I boil a gallon of water place the 5 tbs in the pot and turn off the burner. It will continue to boil for a few minutes. I have let it set as long as over night. Remember that this is not black tea   it will not get bitter if you steep it too long. The nice thing about the hibiscus tea is that it really doesn't need refrigeration. Just make sure that you boil it for a couple of minutes to sterilize the  ew. By the way I am very cautious about the fantastic claims of many herbal poducts. I can say with some certainty that hibiscus tea does indeed lower blood pressure.
