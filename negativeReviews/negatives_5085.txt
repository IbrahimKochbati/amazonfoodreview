This is a great idea and I had such high hopes.  My 8 mo old Shepherd is very active and rough.  We have tile floors in the house and concrete outside.  The dog slung this toy around, knee capping me a few times  before slamming it on the tile floor and  eaking it open.  It it were made of hardier material I would buy another but this plastic is just too  ittle for a rough dog.
