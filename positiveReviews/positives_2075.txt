I bought this tea many months ago and waited to review it, to see if I really liked it over time.          I do.  This tea is really lovely.  The rose scent and taste are just right    not too lame, not too overwhelming.  I find it slightly calming, even with the caffeine from the black tea.  Of the 6 or so loose teas in my drawer that I regularly use, this is the one I seem to reach for most often.  I'm diligent about  ewing times.  This one is 5 min. and I set the timer.  Gives me a perfect cup every time.          Don't forget that it's organic.  Support organic practices and do something beneficial for your body.          This tea was a good buy and has withstood the test of time (for me).
