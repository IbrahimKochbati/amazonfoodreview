I ordered this variety pack and was shocked when they arrived at the door and each one is the size of a bottle of wine. Wow! It's going to take me a year to go through them all   unless I gift a couple of them. I was drinking a cup of coffee with cream and sugar substitute, prepared perfectly to my taste. Then decided to add a couple of spoonfuls of the Hazelnut, and wow it woke up the flavor of the coffee. It made the coffee so much more robust. The biggest problem will be picking a flavor to use. I've also seen these used as flavor in homemade ice cream. That's next on my list to try!
