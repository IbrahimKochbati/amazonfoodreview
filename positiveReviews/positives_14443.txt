Tamarind paste gives delicious slightly sour taste to dark meat of chicken, pork and beef.     Make a stew without potato, because potato is not good in a sour dish.     Add 1 table spoon of tamarind to 2 lbs of meat and 2 onions.     Dry oregano, cumin powder, salt, pepper and garlic to taste.     Mix everything and cook till ready.     99% of your guests will like the dish very much.     For lean parts of beef use tamarind to marinade meat overnight before cooking it in a slow cooker.
