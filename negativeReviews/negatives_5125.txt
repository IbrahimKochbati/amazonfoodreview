My small, 6 lb Mini Schnauzer Shih Tzu mix found this a bit frustrating.  As others have said in the reviews, she couldn't get the treats out...she knew they were in there, but they don't come out easily and I put in her smallest doggie food.  Heck, I couldn't even get them out unless I pulled VERY hard on the rope.  She likes the rope, but not for long...she'd like it better by itself.  I got the smallest one and she's a very smart dog, but it's just not for her.  Don't know what I'm going to do with this thing...just put it in her toy box I guess and hope she latches onto it once in a while.  It's a total waste of money in my opinion.  She likes the roller treat dispensers...I even made one myself with an empty plastic peanut jar, used an exacto knife to cut holes on two sides, and she can roll it around and get excited about her treats rolling out...even an empty butter tub can be used.  Save you money on this one.  Just MHO.     Update:  My puppy is now 11 pounds, full grown and will be 1 year soon and STILL cannot get the treats out of this thing.  I even have a hard time getting them out....I have to pull the rope HARD to get anything out.  Then I noticed my pup chewing on it and she was chewing the bottom off and, by the time I noticed what she was doing, she had it off.  She GOT the treats, but I threw the thing away....total waste of money I think.  Not MHO this time....experience!!
