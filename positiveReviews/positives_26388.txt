This was a repeat purchase.  I have used C.E.T. chews for years for all my dogs,  previously purchasing them at my veterinarian's.  Now that I have found I can order them at Amazon.com at a better price, I will be purchasing the chews only from Amazon.  I use the "large" for my dogs, which weigh from 30 to 36 pounds.  They are the perfect size for them.  They satisfy the chewing need and help keep teeth and gums in good condition.
