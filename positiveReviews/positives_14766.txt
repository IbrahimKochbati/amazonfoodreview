While I was born in the states I absolutely love having this on my cheese and tomato sandwiches.  I had this while studying a oad in London, and I've been hooked ever sense.  So anytime I can find it here in the states or online I always buy it.  Unless you like pickled things in general you may not like this.  My boyfriend thinks it's horrid but the tangy flavor and crunch adds a little something to your sandwiches.
