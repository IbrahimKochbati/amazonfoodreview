I am in love with this product!  I make a whole package with chicken  oth, chopped red bell pepper, green onions, some frozen corn and leftover chicken, add a little salt & pepper, garlic and coriander, and away we go.  I store the leftovers and take a little for lunch every day.  Great hot or cold.  Simply delicious.  If all you can do is boil water, then even you can make this.  I'm going to try the recipe listed above for a change of pace.
