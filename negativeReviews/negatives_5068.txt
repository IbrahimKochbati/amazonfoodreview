Our pit mix loves to chew especially when bored.  We bought this thinking it was cheap enough and it might last a week.  He chewed through the rope within a day.  He loves the purple bottle though and carries it around the yard, sometimes trying to chew through that but he has not been successful.  We have been looking for maybe some kind of thick rope from a ship or something, maybe then this toy would work for our boy.
