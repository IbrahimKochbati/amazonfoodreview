I have been feeding Canidae for a long time, and when my local carrier raised their prices to $70+ without taxes, I figured I needed to start buying online.  The food quality was the same as the bags I bought in stores, and it is a great food overall.  The only issues I have had are with the delivery.  One of the bags I bought was  oke open, so when I took the bag out of the shipping box, dog food went everywhere.  The delivery time is also something that needs improvement.  I placed my order on the 10th, and it didn't start to ship until the 17th.  It took a week before it even left the facility.  It is supposed to arrive a week after the 17th, which means it will have taken 2 weeks to get my delivery.  Not a big deal if you are waiting on something frivalous, but food for you pets should be delivered more quickly.
