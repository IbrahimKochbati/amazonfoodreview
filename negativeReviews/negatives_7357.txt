I ordered a few days ago and some of my cans arrived dented. Multiple cans were on the outside edge of the box, but only one row (3 cans total with 2 severely dented) was dented. So, I guess packaging could have been a small factor. BUT these cans are amazingly malleable. Simply squeezing the can in my hand caused it to yield. The small area containing air space is very weak. Libby's canned pumpkin, the  and I've used my entire life, does not have this issue.          I already cooked with one of the non dented cans. The color is different than what I'm used to, it's more of a dirty orange sepia color, and the texture seems a bit thicker, but it tastes fine.          My order also had a long expiration date, 2013.          (FYI The packaging consisted of a large box containing a smaller box of cans with bags of air to keep it from rattling. There was no damage or excessive wear on the box. )
