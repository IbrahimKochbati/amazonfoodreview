I was a little apprehensive about purchasing these biscuits from amazon as other  reviews said that the biscuits were smashed upon arrival. Mine arrived in bubble wrap in a box and were fine. Hopefully they read these reviews and have improved the shipping.  The biscuits themselves were very good, but I think the 50% less fat did make them a little drier.  I just need to buy the non reduced fat biscuits  next time.
