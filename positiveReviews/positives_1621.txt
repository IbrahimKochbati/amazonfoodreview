I haven't had a chance to try these out yet, but I thought I would go ahead and mention that I received 5 each of the following 7 flavors:            Sweet Rasberry Black Iced Tea       Southern Sweet Iced Tea       Sweet Lemon Iced Tea       French Vanilla Iced Coffee       Nantucket Blend Iced Coffee       Ginger ead Coffee       Eggnog Coffee          Fortunately I'm okay with this, as I was wondering how the Ginger ead and Eggnog tasted as well. You might feel differently though, and might want to know since this seems to be the only variety pack of iced k cups.
