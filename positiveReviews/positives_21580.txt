It's tastes pretty good.  If you have a pretty big cup of shaved ice then by the time you get to the bottom you have a tiny bit of an after taste.  I can handle that fine. You get alot of uses out of this bottle. It has a smaller hole in the bottom so it does not POUR out, but it does come out pretty quickly. I wish there was a way to measure out the amount you use without having to go to your kitchen cabinet to get something.
