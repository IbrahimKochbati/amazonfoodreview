I have a peanut butter problem.  As in, I can't keep it in the house because I enjoy eating it too much.  This PB2 helps me get the peanut butter fix without keeping a jar of Jif on my shelf!          The PB2 is DELISH and it's perfect to add to smoothies and shakes.  I also enjoy it sprinkled on ice cream!  Low fat ice cream, of course.  GET SOME!!
