We can get these at our local store and tend to pick them up whenever we're shopping. They're great little cookies   not much bigger than a half dollar coin. Just right when you need a quick bit of sweet taste but don't want something really big or rich. Our family is essentially gluten free, so ready made treats that actually taste good and that aren't grainy are great to have. By no means are these gourmet, but they're better than the pre gluten free oreo or chips ahoy type pre made cookies.          They're free of most all common allergens, too   not just gluten.
