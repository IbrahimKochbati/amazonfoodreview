...but I love these things!  Bagged pork rinds from the grocery are beyond disgusting.  They don't look, smell or taste appealing.  But fresh nuked pork rinds are a very different story.  These pigskins come out toasty and, dare I say it?  Delicious!  Significantly lighter and more airy than their grocery store counterparts.  "They" say you can use them to scoop up salsa or dip, but they're very good on their own, and I think the porky taste wouldn't go well with salsa anyway.  Maybe french onion dip   I'll have to try that.          These pork rinds seemed fairly salty to me.  But when I crave chips and such, it's usually the salt (and crunch) that I'm really after, so it wasn't a problem.  Microwaving pork rinds   who knew?
