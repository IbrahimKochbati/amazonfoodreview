Wow, this is some fantastic tea. It is a very common drink in Mexico and Central America. They tend to dump in the sugar. I have to add some organic sugar or organic Agave syrup. But wow, this makes for a delicious tea   the color is a real WOW.          Served cold, it is really refreshing and cleanses the palate if you are eating spicy food.          Search on line see what amazing healing properties this tea has. For myself, it really helped with this horrific allergy season.          So you can enjoy a yummy tasting tea and help yourself be naturally healthy and strong.
