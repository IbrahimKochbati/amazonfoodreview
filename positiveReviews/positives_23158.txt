I discovered that I was gluten intolerant about a year ago and have been looking for good tasting wheat free products ever since.  My primary roadblock has been  ead   every single loaf of gluten free  ead I've tried has been beyond disgusting.  I've been to health food store after health food store and haven't found a single loaf that I can eat without gagging.  I thought it was hopeless until I read the reviews of Pamela's Amazing Wheat Free Bread Mix.  I decided to give it a shot, so I borrowed my sister in law's  ead machine and fired up a loaf.          Simply put, I was amazed at the results.  Does it taste like regular  ead?  No.  Well, almost.  Is it light years beyond any other gluten free  eads?  A hearty, resounding YES!  If you've eaten other gluten free (GF)  eads before, let me give you a comparison: it holds up better than pre made GF  ead, but it still feels like it could fall apart easily.  Putting a slice in the toaster helps with that.  It's a little on the chewy side.  It tastes like it doesn't have any salt in it, so adding some butter really helps.  It kind of looks like banana  ead, if I were to compare textures.  Make sure to have some milk on hand because it makes you pretty thirsty when you eat it!          I would say this is 90%   95% as good as "real"  ead.  Thank goodness, my search for wheat free  ead is over!  And Amazon sells it for nearly half the price as my local health food stores!  If you're the only gluten intolerant or Celiac in your family, I would recommend picking up a  ead machine.  It makes one loaf automatically.  All I did was to follow the direction on the package and the loaf came out perfectly.  It was as simple as dumping the ingredients in the machine, making sure the settings were right, and hitting the "On" button.  So easy, even a caveman could do it!  I put the  ead machine to work at about 9pm at night and woke up the next morning to freshly baked GLUTEN FREE  ead.  EDIBLE  ead.  Awesome!  I used a older Zojirushi machine, but some of the newer models like from Breadman actually have a Gluten Free setting on them.  There is hope for decent tasting  ead for us gluten intolerant people!  THANK YOU Pamela's Products!!
