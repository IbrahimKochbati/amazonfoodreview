We have a Frenchie with all kinds of skin problems.  At the suggestion of our vet we purchased this food in several flavors.  Our guy decided that duck and potato was the best.  He really enjoys this and we mix it with the dry version of the venison flavor.  And so far so good this spring.  He hasn't had nearly as many skin problems as last year.  Great product!
