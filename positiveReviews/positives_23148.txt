This is my favorite  ead mix, gluten free or not.  The finished  ead has a slightly sweet taste, which I love.  With celiacs, pizza is my most missed food and this mix makes the best gluten free pizza crust I've ever had for much cheaper than restaurant pizzas. Pamela's makes great gluten free products that are too expensive at my local grocery store, but by ordering in bulk from amazon, pricing is very reasonable.
