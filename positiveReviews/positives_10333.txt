Broccoli and Friends arrived promptly.  It was packaged simply (plastic bag with some strong tape fastening the opening) which I expected from a discount product like this.  Of course a ziploc would have been nice but I prefer what they gave rather than having them raise the price for better packaging.          I did not have lots of non sprouters as others commented.  Almost all of my seeds sprouted very well and produced beautiful sprouts. I will definitely be buying this product again.
