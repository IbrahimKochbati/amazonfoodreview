My Solo Apricot Filling arrived this afternoon, only six days after I placed my order, with free shipping. It's just as I remembered it from my childhood, when my mother made apricot turnovers and kolacki! I'm thrilled that I now have a supply of twelve cans; it's been increasingly hard to find in my local markets.
