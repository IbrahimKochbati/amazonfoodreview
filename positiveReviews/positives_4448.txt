I highly recommend this seller. It is an incredible value for both quantity and quality of beans. There are probably around 50 60 beans, although I'm not positive because I have not taken them out of the packaging to count. I have probably used about 8 10 beans and I can barely tell any are gone from the bag. They come double sealed, and as another reviewer mentioned, you can smell the vanilla even through the original shipping package. I have purchased grocery store vanilla beans, and I have never seen or tasted anything remotely close to the quality of these beans. I will definitely purchase beans from this seller again.
