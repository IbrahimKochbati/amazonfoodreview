Good price, beats the heck out of the local co op.  The 'tea' itself  consists of large pieces of hibiscus relative to what you expect as tea, and after you  eak it up, it only takes a couple to fill the tea ball.  This is like buying 3 pounds of regular tea that has already been flaked.  Great flavor too.  I think my co op buys this, grinds it, and resells it at 3 times the price.
