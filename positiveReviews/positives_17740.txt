I have a Jura Capresso automatic espresso machine.  I like it, but I have found it difficult to find beans that make expresso that takes much like what you might get at a Starbucks.  The beans have to be very robust, but they can't be French or Italian roasted because that makes them too oily (which can clog the machine).  I've tried lots and lots of different beans, some quite expensive (like more than $20   lb.).  I saw these at Costco and decided to give them a try.  They are perfect.  The flavor is great, and the roast is pretty dry so they work beautifully in my machine.
