Simple to make and delicious. Noodles are a little thin for my taste, I would like a heartier noodle. Please stop complaining about high sodium, of course its high as with most. I use half the pack of seasoning and a shot or two of tabasco sauce and a small sprinle of black pepper. Good to     go.          Makes a quick meal with added meat (chicken  east chunks or whatever your taste is)
