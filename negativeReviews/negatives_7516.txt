Everyone should drink more water, or so we are told. The problem is that water is plain and boring. It needs some flavor, and many companies have responded to this demand. O.N.E. Coconut water with splash of pink guava is one such product. It contains coconut water along with guava juice for a unique taste.          I like the taste of coconut but I am only so  so on the flavor of guava. Still, I decided this drink was worth a try because as long as it emphasized the coconut, it would be fine. Unfortunately, this isn't the case. O.N.E Coconut Water with a splash of guava is misleading in its naming, because you taste more guava than anything. Even then, the taste is rather unexciting. Even lovers of the flavor of guava will likely find this product a letdown.          Nutritionally, O.N.E. Coconut water is very good, with low calories and a large dose of vitamin C and electrolytes in each serving, and more potassium than a banana. The sugar content is a little higher than some would prefer, but it isn't too bad and, unlike other sweet drinks, you get a good deal of nutritional trade  off for the sugar. Each time I take a sip and feel dissatisfied, I keep reminding myself of the nutritional benefits.          Along with the bland flavor profile, there is one other problem I have with this drink, and that is the packaging. It is sold in a small foil box, which is ordinarily not a problem, but there is no included straw. There is an opening at the top that must be pushed  in to open, but the manufacturer doesn't include a straw. Thus, you have to use a fork or some other device to forge an opening. Then, you must carve out just the right shape for drinking from the box OR have another glass handy in which to pour the liquid.          I wanted to like this beverage but when all factors are considered, I must rate O.N.E. Coconut Water with a splash of guava as a below average product. The coconut flavor is masked by the guava, the taste is unexciting, and the packaging is flawed. Yes, you get a good deal of nutrition so the product isn't a complete bomb, but there are other, better tasting products on the market with equally good nutrition, better taste, and more sensible packaging.
