I wanted to like these because they come in bigger bags than Brothers and Sensible.  But the product is so inconsistent, even within the same bag.  Many of the apple pieces are chewy and some have no cinnamon flavour while other pieces are overpowered by it.  I don't appreciate the toughness of those of the pieces because since theyre already dry by nature, they have a tendency of sticking to one's teeth.  Some even taste stale.  Furthermore, there seems to be a lot of scraps of peel (in this way it reminds me of pig slop).  I don't know if it's the season or what, but these apples are very sour.  I begin to notice after eating 1 3 of a bag.  I bought this because it promised "crunch."  At best, this is a lackluster characteristic of the Bare Fruit CInnamon Apples.
