I was recommended to try the Pirates Booty, so I decided to order it online as I can not get it in any local stores.  When I received my shipment it seemed fine but as I was removing the bags from the box I realized that the bags were not sealed and the Pirates Booty was going all over the place.  Basically I paid for something I could not even eat with not refund.          Very dissatifed.
