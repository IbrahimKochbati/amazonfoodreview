I suppose I should have figured this bar would be crunchy considering this is the Nut Delight variety but I didn't expect this much crunch! Crunch factor similar to Gobstopper hard candy (I think it is the syrup that holds the nuts together that makes it so hard). There was also a type of nut that is included in the mix that I did not care for, (not sure which one). If you like exotic nuts and are looking for a snack that is super crunchy than this is for you. Unfortunately, it did not suit me. On the up side, it is a good source of protein and antioxidents.
