Coombs Pure organic grade b maple syrup is a great addition to oatmeal, sweet potatoes, muffins, and cookies just to name a few. This 32 ounce jug is very economical compared to what I would pay in the local stores for pure maple syrup. It has a dark color and a rich flavor that keeps me coming back for more.
