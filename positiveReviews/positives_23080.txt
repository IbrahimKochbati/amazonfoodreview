My husband's on a GF diet and has tried every GF baking product in existence. Some were ok, most were less than satisfying. Along came Pamela and his life changed forever; in fact, he's in  love and it's fine by me, LOL! Pamela's  ead mix makes the best GF pizza crust, ever! It's light, crispy, chewy, crusty, with a delicious fragrance that doesn't scream GF. Thank you, Pamela, and Amazon, for your great prices and ease of ordering.
