I came back from a few months living in Germany having gotten used to "a little something sweet" in my coffee.  This was a new habit I wasn't going to give up.  Well, I found Torani products at Walmart and was quite pleased.  Then they upped the price and downsized the product!  I went to my "go to for everything" site Amazon.com and there it was   all the Torani products I could possibly hope for.  Immediately I enrolled in the "subscribe and delivery" program which offers the product at a lower price and delivers on a regular basis. Wow. I love the french vanilla and the caramel flavors.  They come in 750 ml. PLASTIC bottles and I get the three packs.  My coffee is my daily reward and now I'm all set.  The best thing is that the sugar free syrups are perfect and are guilt free!
