I guess my little pup went through what can be typical for the Shih Tzu  eed to be a finicky eater.  He began walking away from his water moistened dry food: Blue Buffalo puppy, Nutro, Merrick (all of the same flavors).  I got this as my cousin had sent me some venison jerky she makes for her Yorkie's and they love it.  I put half the serving size bowl of this down for my little Weston and he lapped it up, looking up at me lovingly for more.  I gave him the rest of the serving size and he galloped away with more energy (even MORE than he normally showed) and played hard, napped and his eliminations were smaller and neater to clean up.  It seems that he is getting more nourished and retaining the nutrients he needs.  His coat is even more soft and supple.  This is a great product to take on trips without any mess or extra bowls, etc to pack.  Thanks, ZiwiPeak!!!!
