Upon receiving the item, I noticed it had a slightly pungent smell.  I tasted it plain, and it tasted like rotten tomatoes. It was obviously rancid. I emailed customer service, yet received no reply. I threw the can in the trash. I'm very disappointed in the product, and will buy a different  and in the future.
