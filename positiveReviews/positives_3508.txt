The coffee is excellent, with a smooth taste and pleasant aroma.  It did not have that bitter plastic  aftertaste you find in a lot of decaf coffees.          The grind is very fine,  my cheapo coffee filters let a little bit of the coffee through.  Use good quality filters with this coffee.          It was difficult to open the package, and the little wire closer fell off after the second time.  However, I understand why coffee is packages this way, to minimize the exposure of the oils in the coffee to air. And of course a fine grind has a larger surface to mass ratio, making it age even faster.  So I forgive them for the packaging.  You really need an airtight opaque container to store this kind of coffee.          Personally I like to grind my coffee right before using, but the convenience and taste of this Melitta  has convinced me that there are other options.
