When it became difficult to find this product in our local grocery stores, I panicked until I found it on Amazon.  This has a MUCH better flavor than any other canned chickens I've tried.  For years it has been a major staple in my kitchen & desk drawer.  For a quick, guilt free snack, it's tasty just smashed up in its own  oth.  Mixed with some relish & either mayo or ranch dressing, it makes a delicious salad to eat alone, in a sandwich, or on crackers.  My elderly feeble parents loved it microwaved with various tuna helper flavors as an easy main dish.  This is great in all of my favorite cooked chicken recipes, & it's always in the pantry, ready to use on short notice, but keeping just fine (unlike refrigerated alternatives) until it's needed.  When I can't incorporate the  oth into whatever I'm making, I usually drink it, because it's too flavorful to waste.
