I love everything about this drink.  It's got plenty of carbonation.  Even without added sugar or artificial sweeteners, it's plenty sweet, without being too sweet.  I LOVE tangerine, and this has a very tangerine y flavor and aroma.  If you love oranges or tangerines, this is the perfect drink for you.          I ordered this from the Vine program out of curiosity, but it will be one of my "must buy" items in the future.  I'm also going to buy some for my grandchildren.  Since it has no added sugars, and I know they'll love it, it will be perfect for them.
