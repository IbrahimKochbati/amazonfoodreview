These chips ROCK!  We have tried just about every kind of chip lately looking for something that is lower priced, more natural but still taste good.  These chips taste great   perfectly salted (not too salty and can be enjoyed plain), excellent crunch and corn flavor and best of all   the shape!  The long rectangular shape are the perfect size for dipping and are just thick enough to hold any dip or salsa.  Best part   they are made with only 4 natural ingredients!
