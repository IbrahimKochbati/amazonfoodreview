I'm not picky about coffee. I'll drink just about any dreck that's been sitting in a pot, mug or carafe for a day or two. Just heat it up and serve me. Normally, I use a one cup instant bag with boiling water and I get a fairly decent cup of coffee from Folgers using theirs or any store knock off.          Those taste like gourmet compared, and are certainly much better than the "coffee" I made this morning from Puroast's French Roast 3 ounce bag.          Many reviewers here have stated it tastes like gas, ashes, fuel and I agree. Add to those descriptions a hint of motor oil, old basement and a sprinkle of dog dander.          I opened the container and was greeted with an ashy, somewhat mildew like odor. Oh well, keep going, I say. I boiled water and let a bag steep in the pot for a while as I don't like drip. I feel you get a much better full flavor from steeping. It took a while for the dark color to appear, but soon it looked very coffee like and I put some in a mug. I smelled it first, noticing that it lacked a standard coffee scent. Then I tasted it with exactly the result I was expecting, a decidedly un coffee flavor. Stale, with a hint of dried leaves? That's the best I can come up with. So, I added sweetener (stevia) and my usual cream (vanilla soy milk). It still tasted nothing like real coffee to me.          I didn't give the mug a chance to comfort my stomach, poured it out and made a regular cup of joe that I could drink. Seriously, this is simply not a good product in my estimation. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I guess in a dire emergency this drink could possibly give you enough caffeine to limp, crawl or otherwise slither out to a store to buy actual coffee or at least be served something warm by the Red Cross.
