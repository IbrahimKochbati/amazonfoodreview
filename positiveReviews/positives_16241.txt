I give these to my dog to help with her minor tartar problems. She LOVES them and they definitely do the job.          One of my favorite things about them is that they are sturdy and coated enough that I can freeze them  I put one in a small plastic bag (snack bag folded in half) full of water and freeze it for a few hours. Then my dog has to lick and crunch up the ice to get to the treat, which keeps her busy AND gets her more fluids. Most dog treats tend to dissolve and become mushy when you do this with them, but these guys definitely hold up.
