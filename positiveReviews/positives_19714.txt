I ordered a box of the Mesquite Lime after finding the Texas BBQ at my local organic grocery store. I love both flavors but am glad I got a bulk of the lime. It's delicious! I love that its only 75 calories and yet so high in protein. It's hard for me (as a vegetarian) to get enough protein while still keeping my carbs low. The standard protein bar usually has way too much sugar for my liking. These are a great afternoon snack and perfect after an intense workout.
