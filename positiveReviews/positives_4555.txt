This product helped us tremendously. When our 2 year old daughter started day care, she wouldn't eat at the center and she began losing weight. We started her on Pediasure in the mornings as an insurance policy that she was getting enough nutrion. It worked great she stopped losing weight and actually started gaining :). She loves the taste, especially the strawberry flavor.
