This is a great product. My dogs love them. In fact they will fight over who gets one first. The teenies are the perfect size. It is one of the few treats I can safely offer my smallest yorkie. They both seem to listen very well when I pull out the bag.          My vet says that for yorkies they both have very little plague. It beats trying to use the small  ushes to  ush their teeth.
