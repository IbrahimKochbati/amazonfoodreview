THE PRODUCT ARRIVED AND WAS AS I EXPECTED!  I AM TEMPTED TO ORDER OTHER TYPES  OF CAT FOOD BUT SOME REVIEWS SAY THAT THEY DIDN'T  GET WHAT THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE ORDERING? MY CATS LIKE THE BEEF SHREDS ALSO BUT REVIEWS SAID THAT  WHAT THEY GOT WAS A PATE.  I DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE CHANCE! IT'S NICE TO GET THE VARIETIES IN ONE CASE RATHER THAN GOING TO A BOX STORE AND HAVING TO CHECK EACH CAN.     I  LIKED WHAT I GOT!
