Others may have a different experience. We were using this as a supplement to mother's milk because mother's milk just did not seem to provide enough fat   protein for baby to gain weight. Problem, although stated that Goat's milk is easier to digest, we found that once we mixed the goat milk with mother's milk, she ate more infrequently and got constipated with indegestion. We had bought this to help with digestion, as Formula is based on cow's milk. This goat's milk seemed to have the opposite effect on our baby, and she didn't gain weight. Also, the taste isn't so great.          We can use it as back up, in case we don't have milk in the fridge. So, it's OK, but I probably won't buy again.
