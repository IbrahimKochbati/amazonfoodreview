My dogs loved these treats.  They are bigger than what I had originally expected.  I thought they were a tiny strips of duck meat wrapped around a sweet potato fry, which in a sense they are.  They are actually a whole  east or at least half of one wrapped around a sweet potato fry.  Much more meat than I expected.  These take my dogs a few minutes to gobble up instead of just a few seconds with other treats.          I like the fact that the ingredients only state duck meat and sweet potato, no harsh preservatives you tend to find in most treats, especially ones that come from China.          The cost compared to the amount you get is well worth the price I paid.  My dogs go through about 2 of these each a day which a bag will last me about a week or so.  I definitely plan on buying more of these, its to bad they don't have the automatic delivery for these as they do for coffee because I would definitely sign up.          I highly recommend these treats.
