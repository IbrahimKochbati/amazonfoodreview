I have CHF with cardiomyopathy.  I have to limit my sodium to under 2,000 mg per day.  Because of great products like this ketchup   I can do that pretty easily most days!  My CardioElectroPhysicist had never heard of no salt ketchup, he thinks it's great!          Heinz no salt ketchup tastes wonderful!  It has a slightly stonger tomato flavor, but I wouldn't have guessed it was no salt.  I use it for homemade BBQ sauce, french fries, etc   it's awesome!  Highly recommended.
