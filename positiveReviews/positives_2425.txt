Always glad to see this water delivered to our doorstep. Not a drop of it spilled during delivery yet, due to  nice quality of  bottles.     Even though the delivery box itself has arrived bashed in, with the tape flopping,   must say the shrink wrapping has held, and the bottles themselves haven't spilled a drop of the water.       We're on our third case of  it right now, and very happy with this purchase.  The water tastes good and the bottles hold their shape.           About weight  of these bottles commented upon in another review... I thought the comment was interesting and it reminded me that yes, I do drive a few bottles to work in the car, I don't backpack them.  Not a really obvious difference in weight, though, I think. Maybe necessary for shipping?            Guess it's like choosing sleeping bags...if you are using a vehicle, you can  use a heavier sleeping bag, so they tell me.      Anyway, I think you'll like this water, and you get 30 bottles per case, instead of the usual 24.     We plan to order more.  We're glad we can do this.
