After years of never being able to have flavored coffee creamer because of all the hydrogenated oils I finally found this. I am for the convenience of the singles, but if you like big cups of coffee be prepared to use 2 3 per cup. It's a lot cheaper to get the large size if you drink a lot of coffee every week, but if your a once in awhile coffee drinker these are nice. They have a very nice vanilla taste and there is enough sugar to satisfy your sweet tooth. Very good product without all the added yucky stuff.
