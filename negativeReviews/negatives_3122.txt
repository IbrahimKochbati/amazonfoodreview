There's not much to review here. It's good coffee. It has a slight after taste of flowers or sweetness, but it's otherwise an interesting medium blend of coffee. The package is a little hard to open (requires scissors), but the coffee itself tastes pretty decent.          I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a medium roast. `Well worth the money.
