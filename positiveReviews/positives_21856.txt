This is great water.  It doesn't have the nasty aftertaste that so many of the other bottled waters have.  This is the only unflavored bottled water that I enjoy.  When you drink it, it has a smooth taste and on the really hot days you can actually feel your body getting re hydrated without getting waterlogged.  It absorbs into your system quickly which is great while for runners or bikers. You don't get the water sloshing around in your stomach like with many other waters. The high mineral content is a nice added benefit as well.
