These Gluten Free  ownies are incredible.  They are so rich and moist they almost taste like fudge.  With so many GF products out there that crumble or taste horrible or both, these  ownies are about the best GF item I've tried so far.  They are easy to make  it is well worth the effort.  Highly recommended.
