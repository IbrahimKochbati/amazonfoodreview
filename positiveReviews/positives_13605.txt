I have been trying different types of green tea to find one that is not too overpowering and where i can still reap the benefits of drinking green tea.  this one is it.  i put a packet of splenda in the equivalent of 2 1 2 cups of tea and even when i steep for up to 30 minutes (i get sidetracked when getting ready for work in the mornings) it is great, much more tolerable and less viscus than sencha.  i think i could even drink this one with no sweetener added.
