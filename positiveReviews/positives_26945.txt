Definitely a moister, kippered style jerky.  Not the ultra dry kind that makes your teeth hurt.  I can see why some might find it too "oily", as I have found  ands like that before.          But it definitely works here, at least with the Sweet and Hot.  I haven't tried the other flavors.          And it's not too sweet or too hot.  Kinda like a Chinese spare rib, without the bone.  I'd buy more.
