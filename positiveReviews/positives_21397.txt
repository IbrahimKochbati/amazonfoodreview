This is my favorite coffee K cup. I have this every day. Cinnamon flavor this there but no over powering.          Pros          Great taste     Mild flavor     The Cinnamon scent fills the room          Cons          Does not really taste like a Cinnamon Roll only hints at it.          Conclusion          If you like flavored coffees that are mild. And if you love cinnamon flavor, this is the coffee for you.
