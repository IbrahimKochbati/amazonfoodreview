We have a Princeton Popper which we bought from this same company, and have owned for close to a year.     They are really great people giving excellent customer support, standing behind their products.     With that said, this popcorn is really, really great, and you don't have to have a "popcorn machine" to use it. You can cook it on the stove in a big tall pot like you would use for sweet corn. My only suggestion is not to put the lid on the pot but to put a mesh splatter screen over it. This will permit the vapor to escape keeping the popcorn light and fluffy and not moist.     This popcorn is so good you don't need to add butter either. It's fine just the way it is which is better for our health too. I have two family members that have bought Princeton machines and this popcorn because they liked ours so much, and any time friends come over for a movie or just to visit, they always ask if I would make popcorn.     The 8 oz. cases shipped free through Amazon really don't cost any more per oz. than you'd pay for Orville microwave in a grocery store and is hundered fold better. Ever eat left over microwave popcorn the next day?....Yuk, it's disgusting. And you're not suppose to  eath the vapor when you first open the bag fresh out of the microwave, and you want to eat that stuff? Great Northern still tastes fresh and good for days if you bag it up. After your first bag of Great Northern you'll wonder why on Earth you ever keep eating that junk from the grocery store.
