Our Jack Russell is a real chow hound and just `wolves' down her food.  We now serve Wendy all her dinners in the Tug a Jug.  At first she was quite frustrated but we mixed some small kibble with the regular size and she was rewarded enough to keep working on it.  Now we simply toss in a couple handfuls of kibble screw the top back on and dinner lasts 15 20 minutes instead of the 2 minute bowl feast.  Some reviewers didn't like the plastic rope in this newer version, but I find it cleans up easier and does not become frayed.
