I have read some really funny reviews about this product.  Some complain that there is noting left in the pod after it has filled the cup, so 'therefore' it must have been an instant mix!  Brilliant deduction, Sherlock!  What did you expect...to see choco grounds in the cup?  Yes, it is no doubt cheaper to go some other route, that's why 4 instead of 5 stars.          But the taste is what you want to know about, right?  The Dark Chocolate flavor is fairly robust with little 'grittyness' to it.  Plop a marshmallow in the cup before  ewing and you'll have a real treat!  It comes out strong enough on either the 6 oz or 10 oz setting of the  ewer.  Not surprisingly, the milk chocolate flavor is not as strong and a little smoother.  Marshmallow trick has a little different effect making the milk chocolate not only creamier and smoother but a little dilute too.  So, maybe a few mini marshmallows instead of a full sized one for this flavor.  Oh, and definitely go 6 oz cup.  My oldest granddaughter and I contest for the peppermint chocolate.  She wins, of course, but it's pretty good when I can get one.  No marshmallow needed.  The hint of peppermint is just enough.  6 oz cup on this one is the best way to go, too.          I think I got the cups sizes right.  If I didn't, you'll figure it out.  Btw, I'd imagine the reason it's always out of stock is because people keep buying it!  I've dipped into the supply well a few times myself.  Pretty good. Pretty cheap. Pretty hard to get at times.  I'll buy it again!
