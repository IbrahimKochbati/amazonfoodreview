I bought these for my husband for healthy snacking in the evening,and they are great! High in fiber and protein, but low in calories per serving.  Even my 5 year old (who does not eat anything!)will eat these pretzels.     They are crispy, and slightly nutty tasting. I will always have a case on hand.
