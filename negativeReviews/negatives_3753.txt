I have used this before, and like the coffee. But was not aware of the different strengths. Saw a statement about them as I reviewed today (in "product features" it says, "Please note: 'regular', 'bold' and 'extra bold' refer to the amount of coffee in the K Cup"). There is no way to make any choice during Amazon Prime buying (one click), or any other way i can find. So I am consuming this expensive stuff twice as fast to get the strength I want. Are you listening, Amazon? This proves to me that the arguments some make that buying in the store is better may have merit. if this were not a food item, already opened, I would return.          So: WARNING: don't buy unless you are satisfied with any strength (Ironic a product this expensive would not pay more attention).          Very, very disappointed!          PS, the box labeling did not match the warning anyway, what I got was "Light Roast". The other choice was "Regular". Leads one to wonder if they are clearing off old, outdated product.
