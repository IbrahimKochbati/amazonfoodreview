My one year old pit mix is incredibly food motivated and can clean out any kong, no matter how tightly stuffed, in 10 minutes. I got this toy to keep her busy, and while it does take her a long time to clean it out, the toy is simply too loud. Roxy likes to kick this toy across the floor, sending it flying into the wall or the table. The hard plastic of the toy scrapes across the hard wood floor and then makes a loud "bang" as it slams into things. Not only is the noise really annoying, but I am also worried she might  eak something because the bottle is very hard.
