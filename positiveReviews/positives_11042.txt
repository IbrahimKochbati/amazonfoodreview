These are my favorite creamers. I buy them for our work office (so they don't go bad), and they do not need refrigeration. Amazon has them reasonably priced (much cheaper then office supply manufacturers), and in my opinion, the flavor is better then other  ands. I will be buying these from Amazon from now on!
