My wife and I cannot stop eating these smooth, delicious chocolates.  Lindt makes the best chocolate in the world as far as I am concerned.  We purchase an assortment of truffles and bars for all of our sisters and  others for Christmas every year.  Now that they are in Wal mart and even Walgreens we can get them year round.  YUM YUM!
