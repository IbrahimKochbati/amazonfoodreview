I have a Melitta One:One machine and have been using Juan Valdez pods in it.  When I ran out I searched for pods for it & only came up with these Melitta  and ones. I figured (incorrectly) that the others weren't available & purchased these. VERY disappointing.  My coffee had been nice, strong & tasty, but coffee made with these is weak & tasteless.  I bought a 4 box package of three different types & am now stuck with them. Forget these & head to Juan Valdez (same price range) unless you like weak coffee.
