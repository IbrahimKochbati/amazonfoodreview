Nutiva's chocolate hemp shake is not your average tasting protein shake. It is definitely different and could for many have to be an acquired taste. It is not as sweet as some would guess but is versatile so adding fruit, honey, or another sweetener to it may make it a little more palatable for those who can't tolerate it's straight out of the container flavor. It is not completely water soluble so it does have a slightly grainy texture but that is part of the appeal to me. It has 11 grams of protein, 9 grams of fiber, and having only 90 calories would not make it a good meal replacer but a good compliment to a healthy one or a nice mid meal snack. It is organic which in my opinion doesn't mean a whole lot but the fact that it is GMO free and contains a simple and natural ingredient list appeals to me. I am not a vegetarian and love me some animal flesh but this would be a great addition to any vegan or vegetarian diet as it is an easily digestible protein source. I purchased the chocolate which I had tried a couple years ago (before they switched to the new formula  not sure of the exact changes that were made) it is great and I also purchased the vanilla that I have yet to try. I would definitely say to the newcomers go out and find the single serving packets before you commit to entire container  I love it but it just may not be to your liking.
