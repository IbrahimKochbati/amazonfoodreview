EVERYTHING I ever wanted in coffee: Full bodied rich flavor, low acid (I didn't even know this was possible) Organic,Free trade. I use Amazon's subscription delivery option (excellent service,even better price) and get 4 lbs monthly. It comes in whole bean only, keep in freezer then grind only enough at one time for my sealed cannister  EXCELLENT!! I've been enjoying coffee for 45 years and this is abosutely the best by every measure.
