Something is Very Wrong  The product is excellent.  I have been buying it for several years, first at Whole Foods, and then when they dropped the product, I have been purchasing it online.  In fact, I purchased it in its original larger size jar.  When the size was decreased to 8.82 OZ,  the selling price remained the same at Whole Foods.  I also purchased ALL flavors as this product is really delicious.          The price has been going up CONSIDERABLY. I purchase 36 jars per order to save on shipping. With each order there is always another price increase.          My recent order of September 2012 for 36 jars was apparently packed at the warehouse and sent to the store. The store did not repack it. Each box of six was sealed with warehouse tape identifying the item. It stated the name of the store it was shipped to as well as the flavor. The following information shocked me, and I quote:          RIGONI FRUIT SPRD 8.82 OZ Pack 6 Retail 5.99          Did you note the price? Retail 5.99!!!! It did not state wholesale, it said RETAIL PRICE. No one sells it for 5.99, yet the warehouse stipulates that is the retail price. Am I missing something here?  How many hundreds of dollars have I wasted???  I guess it is a matter of what the market will bear.....OUTRAGEOUS!  Of course there is the additional shipping chg.  On principal alone I will give up on this product. The GREED is beyond comprehension.          I gave the product a low rating, even though the product is excellent because it is incredibly OVERPRICED.
