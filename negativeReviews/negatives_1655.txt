First, I wish I had gotten two can samples of this product so I could try one with some bourbon. I find almost everything mixes with bourbon except tomato juice.          OK. What I liked: nice fruit flavor. Strong but not overpowering. The carbonation was OK. Not flat, which was nice. Did not tickle my nose as champagne does.          I did not care for the "can" taste. I felt there was a slight metallic aftertaste. Really, that was the only thing I didn't like. This product would probably taste better in glass rather than aluminum. Maybe I am overly picky...          Overall, not sure I liked it enough to order it again.
