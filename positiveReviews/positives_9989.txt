Purchased these on saturday night and received them on tuesday, the beans are SUPER oily, which i really like and the roast on them is a really good french roast.  Produces a full bodied coffee with a slightly sweeter note than im used to, but for 27 for 5 pounds this is great for my everyday coffee.
