I was a little scared to get a whole tub of these because i had previously gotten the hemp sample pack, with one of the single serve packets of this in it. But i figured it would be worth having around as a quick meal on the go. I was right. I put the recommended four tablespoons in, a little water, some soy milk, a banana and ice and blend away. It is not super sweet or too grainy. I like that it has a lot of fiber and the chocolate taste is noticably delicious. I plan on making this a monthly buy.
