I am delighted to find that Baker's Hot Chocolate is available. I tried a couple years ago to find it, to no avail. This is my favorite instant cocoa ever! I had it at a restaurant about 15 years ago, and my late husband surprised me with a large box of it from a restaurant supply company. When I ran out, no luck in finding it. Well, as the two prior reviewers have said, this stuff is great. Rich, creamy, and satisfying. Hope you like it, too!
