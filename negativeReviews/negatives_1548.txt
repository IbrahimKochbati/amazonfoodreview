Switch has "100% of what you want" and "0% of what you don't,"  according to the can.  Also, according to the can it is "100% juice."  According to the Amazon product page it contains soy.  Quoting the printed page:  "Ingredients: 100% Juice (Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, Apple, Grape, Tangerine, Orange and Acerola Juice Concentrates), Gum Acacia, Natural Flavors and Colors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C). Contains Soy."          There is an unusual taste.  It is difficult to decide whether it is the taste of the can or the taste of the soy.          The price is surprising. The calories are shocking. One can has 140 calories.          Who knows?  We may develop a taste for Switch.
