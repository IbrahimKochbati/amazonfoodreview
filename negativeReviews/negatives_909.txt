I've been looking for a long time for a beer sausage that was hot to the taste that I use to enjoy back in the Deep South when I was a kid growing up. So far, I've not been able to find the sausage that rang my bell. These arrived quickly and they are tasty and I am glad that I did order these, however, they are not as good as the ones I use to eat when I was in my teens.          I gave the product a 3 star rating because they were tasty, but not what I was expecting. I know many of you will enjoy these and you'll probably rate these as a 5 star item, but I must be honest to provide the best rating possible. The 3 stars were for the lack of qualilty in taste. They are not "hot" as one is led to believe. Hot makes you sweat, these do not.
