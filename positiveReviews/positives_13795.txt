I'm on Weight Watchers but I loooove peanut butter!! I've been craving it so badly but it's such a high point count, so I haven't had any, and when I saw this PB2 I knew I just HAD to try it! My husband thought I was crazy, but what did he know?! It actually tastes REALLY good! I was very impressed! I've used it so far by itself on toast, and in a PB & J sandwich and I'm very happy with it. I get to enjoy peanut butter again for half the points!!!! If you're on a diet and love peanut butter, definitely try this! The first time I added too much water, which made it way too creamy, but since then I've lessened the water and it has a natural peanut butter consistency.
