I used to buy this at a local health food store and then they stopped carrying it. Then I was thrilled when I found it Wal Mart, but then they stopped stocking the dry kibble and now only carry the Newman's doggie mush in cans. So, I couldn't believe it when I found it here   Amazon really does sell just about everything! My Shih Tzus like it and they do not get sick at all like they did periodically on the non organic but still expensive, "vet recommended",  ands.
