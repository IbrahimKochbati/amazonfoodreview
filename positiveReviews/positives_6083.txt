I am glad nail deco has become to be adult deco and not just for little girls.  I am not sure why it started out for adults and dove downward for little chicks and now back up to where it is alright for all sizes of females.  You can also use items from junkyards, wooden catalogs, and other places not usually on the same channel as beauty materials for jewelry and accessories.
