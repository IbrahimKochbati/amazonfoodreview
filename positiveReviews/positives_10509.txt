I absolutely love this soup mix for my roast chicken.  It's the only way I'll roast a chicken.  I actually got the recipe out of my Lipton soup mix cookbook and it's as follows:          Country Herb Roasted Chicken          1 chicken (2 1 2 to 3 lb.), cut into serving pieces (with or without skin) or 1 1 2 lb. boneless skinless chicken  east halves          1 envelope Lipton Recipe Secrets Savory Herb with Garlic or Golden Herb with Lemon Soup Mix          2 TBS water          1 TBS olive or vegetable oil          Preheat oven to 375 degrees.          In a 13x9 baking or roasting pan, arrange chicken.  In a small bowl, combine remaining ingredients;  ush on chicken.          For chicken pieces, bake uncovered 45 minutes or until chicken is done.  For chicken  east halves, bake uncovered 20 minutes or until chicken is done.          Makes about 4 servings.          I do hope you'll try it.  I had to purchase it from Amazon after all of my local grocery stores discontinued carrying it.
