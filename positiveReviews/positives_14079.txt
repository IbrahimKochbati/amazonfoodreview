I have a Boxer with a sensitive stomach. We could never figure out why she was getting sick so frequently until we thought it could be a meat allergy. So we switched to this vegetarian dog food and her stomach issues vanished. She loves it and she feels better, so I love it. It's priced in the mid range but well worth it. Whether you want your dog to eat vegetarian for moral reasons or health, it's great quality. I highly recommend it.
