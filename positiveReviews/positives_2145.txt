This soup lacks the key ingredients that make a canned clam chowder great: Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (soy cottonseed), dehydrated potatoes, modified starches of all kinds, hydrolyzed corn gluten, MSG, potassium chloride, sodium phosphate, disodium inosinate, disodium guanylate, and succinic acid. What good is a classic New England clam chowder without these classic ingredients?          Instead, the first ingredient listed is: Clams. Next you'll be telling me it's got butter in it (it does? Oh.).          On a more serious note. Bar Harbor makes a good tasting clam chowder. The first list of ingredients came from Snow's and Campbell's condensed New England clam chowders. This Bar Harbor stuff is worth it.
