I love that this is high protein, high fiber, low carb. Great nutritional content, and much cheaper than the grocery store. I have purchased this pack of 6 twice. I would give the first order 5 stars, but I give this order 2 stars. The reason: the second order was well within the expiration date, but has a musty smell. It tastes ok, but even after being cooked still has a musty smell. I will probably order again, but maybe try a different seller. In sum, I would recommend this product, but the quality was not consistent.
