I can't find this stuff in any of the stores where I live, so I had to buy it online. Now that I have it, I do think it was worth the purchase price! While this product is mostly devoid of the healthy fats found in natural peanut butter, this product is a GREAT way to get that peanut butter flavor into baked goods, drinks, and so on without the added calories and fat! I can even still make this into a peanut butter spread by just adding water, so it turns out just like the real stuff, but minus the aforementioned calories and fat ^_^
