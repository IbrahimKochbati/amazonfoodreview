I bought one of each color, blue, orange and green. I love this cubes. They are 2.5 oz, perfect portions for my baby. Now that he's eating more, for example at lunch, I thaw 2 cubes for his entree (salty) and one for desert (fruit). Once the cubes are frozen it is very easy to pop them out and store them in a zip lock bag, they are also very easy o clean. I highly recommend this product.
