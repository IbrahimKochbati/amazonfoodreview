OK, I failed to follow the directions.  I rubbed one shake n bake pork pouch onto four pheasant half  east filets.  Actually, I did the shake thing as instructed then just really rubbed the mixture in.  Then I fried them.  Yes, yes, yes, you're supposed to bake them and avoid all the evils of fried food.  I didn't.  Besides, pheasant is a pretty lean meat anyways.          The result was very good.  Good enough to repeat.  I'll likely try this with other wild critter pieces too.  Maybe I'll even try baking them, but prefer to fry so they are in plain sight.  It's too easy to overcook pheasant and get  eaded hockey pucks.
