I was hoping for the gift box, instead I got a cardboard box full of a mixed bag of K cups.  Don't get me wrong, if the price is right then I have no problem, but the price was a little misleading.  I was under the impression that this would be in a sampler box, not a warehouse box.  It looks like a mix and match of K Cups that fell out of other packages or were returned. Buyer beware.
