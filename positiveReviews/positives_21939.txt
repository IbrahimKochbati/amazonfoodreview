My wife is a celiac and I'm very picky about my pasta.  What to do?  We tried every dried rice pasta we could find, and Tinkyada has been hands down the best.  The texture is excellent and it is much easier to cook to a proper al dente than any other  and.  It has good flavor.  I personally find the Fusilli form the most appealing.  Indeed, I actually prefer this pasta to just about any dried wheat based pasta.  Heartily recommended without reservation.
