These Greenies are a great buy. I used to get the Petite size for my Bicon Poodle and my Bichon, but found that you get more treats with the Teenies and the dogs enjoy them just as much. So, if you have small dogs up to say 25 or 30 pounds, the Teenies are the best. I don't think you can find them any cheaper.
