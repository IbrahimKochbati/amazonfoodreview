Illy is the only coffee my espresso maker seems to like  I like it too, robust, not too acidic, makes an excellent crema when prepared properly.          However, the price here is not great. From Illy directly, a can of ground espresso is $14.50, with free shipping if you buy $75 or more. My grocery store has it cheaper than it is listed here. I'm just sayin'.
