I know this is supposed to be sweetened and creamy. But drinking a cup of it, I could not shake the idea that I was instead drinking a hot and melted tube of cake icing. Detecting the coffee flavoring which was supposed to allow it to be called 'coffee' was really difficult.          Buying it because of the pre made convenience (and okay the cheap selling price) is self defeating when the coffee does not taste like coffee. It was next to impossible for me to detect! So, I'd rather pay a little more for halfway deccent coffee, and have to obtain milk and sugar separately.          It's certainly not the type of product which you would want to serve in a 'high society' environment hoping to impress your guests about knowledge of coffee. It's international, but the coffee concept is not on par with Italian Cappuccino.          But on a plus side, you can drink several cups of this stuff without worrying if it will keep you up at night. It either is decaffeinated. Or the existing caffeine content in the product is so low that it does not affect people with sensitivity.
