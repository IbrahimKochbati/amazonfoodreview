I've been giving these treats to my dog for roughly 3 weeks now.  He is a Dalmation Hound mix and has joint issues in his back legs.  At 12 years old we have definitely noticed him slowing down.  He has food allergies so having this medication in the form of duck  east (something which dogs are rarely allergic to I am told) was perfect for our Buddy.  He's running a bit again in the yard and seems more inclined to go for a walk (something he used to love to do).  I highly recommend a try if you are skeptical.  I like it so much I went to a "subscription" status to save a little more money.  At roughly $20 month for us, it is well worth the "investment"   it just plain made him feel better!
