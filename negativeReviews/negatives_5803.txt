I used this product under the belief that it was really better than regular flour. Guess what. It isn't. Go to the isle on your grocery store and you will see that there is about a 5 carb  20 calorie difference between this and regular wheat flour. NOT TO MENTION, this is WHITE, REFINED, HIGHLY PROCESSED. Taste delicious, if you are on atkins or Dukans and you eat this, you may experience what I experienced. My experience is what made me turn around and realize the truth about this product:     1. INSANE cravings for more carbs. You will want them whether it comes from this product or junk. That is because a carb is a carb and regular store bought  restaurant style  vending machines  cafeteria food  etc will not use this product. You will seriously slip in your will power. The serving size for CARBquick is ONLY 1 4 a cup. You'd do yourself a favor and just spend the money on a regular slice of  ead.     2. ACNE golore. I have minimal acne. Wheat makes me  eak out. Atkins gave me the clearest skin ever. After a week of this product I had tiny zits all over my face! Unacceptable!          Considering the expense of this product, it is not worth paying for. Carbquick should be known as the Carb that will QUICKLY spike your insulin! You'd do better to get yourself some almond flour or if you are not wheat sensitive (which most people are the FDA just doesn't want to ruin the wheat industry) just buy some real flour!
