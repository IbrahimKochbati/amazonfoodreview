I have a cat with a heart condition that takes meds. twice daily. This is a little loose off the shelf, but after refrigeration it is perfect to wrap around a pill and feed him off a spoon. You want to use the least amount of food possible so the patient will lick it up in one bit, never noticing the hidden pill. I have also tried other varieties that are very soupy and are to messy for babies or pets.
