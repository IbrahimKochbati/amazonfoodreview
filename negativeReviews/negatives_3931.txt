Switch's Kiwi Berry drink I found a little on the light side, in many ways.  Only 8.3 ounces with very little in the way of kiwi or strawberry flavoring (the can claims raspberry also and it was MIA also).  The most stand out flavor I could detect was the apple juice, which is the major ingrediant.  While this is 100% juice (from concentrate though) and nicely bubble (I shook mine up prior to drinking, no massive explosion or anything and I'm at altitude), I'd rather drink something something with either a little more flavor or a little more of it.
