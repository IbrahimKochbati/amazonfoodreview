I used to buy this Mexican version at my local Wal Mart until they quit selling it.  The mexican version tastes better that the American version. This one ACTUALLY tastes like chocolate milk!  It is richer, and you can taste the chocolate in it. To me it tastes like the American version before they changed the formula to the new "less sugar" formula, which is strange because now the American version tastes way too sweet and it doesn't even taste like chocolate. It taste like plain ole nothing except maybe milk that is too sweet to drink. If you like "chocolate" milk, buy this version.  Its the only one my family will drink.
