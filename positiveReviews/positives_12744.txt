My household was going through 2   3 regular 5 oz bottles per month since discovering the best pepper sauce ever and were delighted to find this one gallon jug.  Even with the coupons I got in the paper and online this is a major money saver!  With a small funnel is easy to pour into the small Tabasco bottle.  We eat it on nearly anything and everything...latino foods, burgers, pizza, eggs (hard boiled, scrambled, fried, pickled), grilled cheese sandwiches, baked or grilled chicken, wings, steak, pork chops, and so on.          Just like another reviewer I had never really been a huge fan on Tabasco.  My husband regularly used the original, and I liked the milder green on latino foods, but then I tried the new chipotle flavor and want to put it on everything.  It is SO YUMMY.  My mouth is watering just writing this review.  Mmmmm...          P.S.  I ordered mine from Tabasco's website vs. Amazon.  The shipping was $5 cheaper on their site, plus I found a $5 off promo code online :)
