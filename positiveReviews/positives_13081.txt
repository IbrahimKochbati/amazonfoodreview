scooby snacks and fruit gushers are my favorite two fruit snacks. the greens and blues are so awesome, my roomate and i go through these a box at a time. the vitamin c will help your immune system, and they contain no fat. sugar content could be a concern for some but not me. these also contain a minor amount of pectin, a common ingredient in throat lozenges; somewhat helpful combined with the vitamin c if you've got a cold sore throat.
