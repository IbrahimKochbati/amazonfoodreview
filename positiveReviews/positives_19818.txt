I have friends addicted to these now which is fine since the 5lb bag is plenty enough for lots of sharing.     I was gifted these and the sender mentioned that she had found them on Amazon.  I was used to buying them by the 1 4 or 1 2 lb at a candy shop near where I used to work. To me they are more like a traditional gumdrop in texture and with the sugar crystal coating but the flavor is sweet and tart just like pink grapefruit without the slight bitterness that the white grapefruit tends to have.  Glad I found these here!
