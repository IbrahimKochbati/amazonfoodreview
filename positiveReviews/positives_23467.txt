I have had many dogs and cats throughout my adult life. I have tried many animal foods and always go back to Purina products. I just wish I would have signed up for automatic delivery for Fresh Step Kitty litter and dry cat food and Purina Dog and Puppy Chow since I also order pet food for www.canine comfort.org ,which I am the President of, the first non profit rescue organization in "bush" Alaska. We sure can use the help on the cost of postage out here...Thank You for this opportunity to share this review...Kathy Sweeney of Canine.Comfort@hotmail.com !!!
