This is a really nice dessert tea. It is reminds me of Celestial Seasonings' "Vanilla Hazelnut", but with a much stronger nut bouquet and flavor. It also has a very strong caramel type smell.          Since I wanted a more authentic chai flavor, this particular tea does not "pass muster". My first thought upon smelling this was "does this have chicory in it?" It could also have the roasted carob found in the vanilla hazelnut tea mentioned above, but chicory is more likely. It should not be advertised as chai.          Currently I  ew two different chais together (Tazo and India Tea's Cardemom Chai) together. After that I  put the seeds of two cardamom pods, one star anise, a chunk of ginger and a little freshly ground pepper before adding milk and honey. I was hoping I could just one tea bag upon receipt of this order. I'll keep this, but my search for the perfect Chai in one bag is still on!          This tea also seems very sweet. I don't know if they added Stevia or something similar, but I didn't need to add as much sweetener as I add to my other Chai concoction.
