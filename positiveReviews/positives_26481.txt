My two dogs really enjoy these chews. Their teeth stay clean. I had to have my older dog's teeth cleaned a year ago, which cost $198. The vet recommended  ushing or these chews to avoid abcessed teeth in the future. I also give them the Hextra ones often. One chew a day at bedtime is our routine. The high price is the only drawback.
