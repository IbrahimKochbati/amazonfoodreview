You know, I had wondered when clicking through to this product from Haribo's website    just how big is a 5 pound bag of Gummibaerchen?  Well, it's about as big as an adult human head.  Big! And heavy!  (And buying two gets you free shipping!)  The only better bulk price one can get (that I'm aware of) is at the Haribo factory in Bonn, Germany (and if you like Gummibaerchen, I suggest you visit).          As for the candies themselves, Frogs are not my favorite.  An entire bag of them yields no variety at all.  If Amazon starts selling the classic bears (which are a multitude of flavors and are smaller and easier to chew up) I would buy those over Frogs in a hot second.  (The sugar free kind are not the classic version, and some people have digestive problems with the artificial sweetener. NB this is not the case with Frogs   they are sugar sweetened.)          A note about the Haribo "catchphrase": the German "Haribo macht Kinder froh und Erwachsene ebenso" is better translated "Haribo makes kids happy   and adults likewise".  So, "The happy world of Haribo" is just a rhyming addition to English language packaging.  INFORMED.
