I used to buy this in Canada on vacations, but haven't been back in a few years. I couldn't find this in any U.S. store, so I was thrilled to find it here. This stuff is amazing. You simply add it to fresh cream that you are preparing to whip. Once the cream is whipped, it remains stiff for several days. This is particularly handy when you are putting a whipped cream topping on another dessert that you won't serve until the next day or one that creates leftovers. Whipped cream usually falls flat and gets runny. But not with WhipIt. You'll love it. It's a tad expensive, but worth it, I believe.
