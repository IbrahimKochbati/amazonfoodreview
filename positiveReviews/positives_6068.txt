Initially I was worried about loss of potency when thinking about a powdered pepper. This came out beautiful though! It is very finely ground, much like cayenne pepper is commonly found. The color is beautiful.          I am VERY happy with this Habanero Powder! I am so glad Angelina's Gourmet was there to provide such a wonderful product, and ship it out so fast! If you want some habanero for spicing up your food, buy this! It is great!
