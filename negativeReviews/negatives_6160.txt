This is probably the worst gum I've ever had.  Since I unwittingly bought so much of it, I  ought it to my workplace and shared it with no less than 10 fellow employees.  Nearly everybody thought it was disgusting, while some thought it was mediocre or bearable at best.          I bought it because I don't really like mint gums and I tend to enjoy more fruit flavored gums.  I was definitely let down.  It doesn't taste like strawberry shortcake.  It's a very unnatural, artificial taste that is very strong.
