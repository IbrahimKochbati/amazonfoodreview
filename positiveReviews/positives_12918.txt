This carbonated fruit drink reminds me a little of Mountain Dew Code Red, except this is 100% fruit juice (apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry, and strawberry) reconstituted from concentrate with sparkling water.  It has 33 grams of sugar in an 8.3 ounce can, but at least it's natural sugar from the fruit rather than corn syrup.          It has a rather strong sweet sour taste, I would think you need to like fruity sour flavors to like this drink.  I think they could reduce the fruit juice content about 1 3 and it would still be very tasty and have less sugar.          Still for me this would rate 5 stars except for the price, at almost $1 per can unfortunately I don't think I would buy it very often.
