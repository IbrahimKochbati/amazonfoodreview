I cannot give high enough praise for these incredibly delicious and protein packed little snacks. Even my very food fussy 5 year old likes them. They are the perfect light lunch or snack to throw in your purse for a busy afternoon. The flavour is delicious, sweet and smokey. At under 100 calories and packed with 10 grams of protein, you can't go wrong. I HIGHLY recommend these snacks, they are worth every penny.
