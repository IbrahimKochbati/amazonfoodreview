I have no qualms whatsoever with the product. Haribo gummy frogs are my favorite candies and will always manage to put me in my happy place. My problem is with the means by it was delivered. If I had known it was being delivered through FedEx, I would have gone and bought the product through some other means.          Here's my beef with FedEx. They are totally and completely unreliable and incompetent. Through the USPS, It take 4 5 days to deliver mail from New Jersey to New York City. FedEx so far is taking 7 days. What the fudge?!          If you're willing to pay extra bucks to have it delivered quickly then you're not going to have a problem. However, if you don't plan to spend that much money on a bag of candy, I suggest you have it sent to a P.O. box or buy it somewhere else.          UPDATE 9 10 12          Still no sign of my package. An order from the UK showed up in one week. I strongly recommend paying the extra dollars for expedited delivery and or ordering it through a website that does not use FedEx Smart Post.
