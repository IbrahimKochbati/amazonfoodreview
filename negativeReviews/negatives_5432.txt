I often get a sour stomach from drinking coffee, so I thought I'd give Puroast a try.          Just as methods of decaffeination often affect the taste of coffee, so does whatever technique they used to reduce the acidity.          It's a shame, because the fresh grounds had a wonderful aroma, but the  ewed coffee had a bitterness beyond what I normally associated with acidity. As a result, the flavor didn't have much dimension.          On the plus side, there were no negative stomach effects, so I suppose if I wanted the caffeine and wanted to avoid the possibility of a sour stomach, this would be a reasonable alternative. That's an unlikely scenario, though.
