It is very difficult to find a good Saucisson in the US, being French I am always looking for a good one.     This one is a pretty good one, even if it does not taste like the real Rosette de Lyon it is one of the best Saucisson I had on this side of the pond.     I would recommend it to everybody looking for a good shot of Saucisson. Overnight delivery in an impressive cooled package was perfectly on time.          Definitely a good choice.
