This is a rich and indulgent cup of coffee, yet not overwhelming with strong artificial flavor as so many other are.  I have purchased many flavors and then don't want to finish the box, not so with this one.  It is definitely not my morning coffe, but rather the type you come home and  ew after you've smelled and resisted a local Starbucks!  The main flavor is velvety rich coffee, with strong hints of raspberry and chocolate perfectly blended in.  I strongly recommend a "cozy up" with a cup of this and a good book :)
