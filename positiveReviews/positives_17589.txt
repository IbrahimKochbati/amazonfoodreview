While I am not a coffee drinker, I got this for a relative who is.  That relative is a coffee hound and loved it!  The relative went on to describe the coffee as having a "rich, earthy flavor" that was "very exotic" and distinct.  An added advantage is that it is low acid.          I smilingly think of Eric Clapton & Cream's classic "Strange Brew" when I think of this coffee.
