It would be hard to beat this variety of Ryvita for flavor and crunch.  Two make a satisfying snack and three make  eakfast!  They go well with sweet or savory foods or fruit.  Try them with a good soup for lunch or crumbled into salad instead of croutons.  Personally I much prefer Ryvita to the thicker heavier crisp eads like Wasa which are sometimes just too robust (though do stand up very well to spreading with nut butters)or the very thin type (like Primula  which is hard to find in North America). The box protects the crisp ead from  eakage and the whole package of 10 boxes was well packed and arrived with no signs of damage.
