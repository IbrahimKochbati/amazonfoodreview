I'm shocked that anyone gave this product a good review.  I've used Arm & Hammer Multicat strength for years but my husband bought a box of this... I couldn't even use the whole box I hate it that much!  If you don't mind everything within 10 feet of your litter box being covered in a huge cloud of dust, including  yourself when you clean the box, then you should definitely buy this product.  AWFUL!!!
