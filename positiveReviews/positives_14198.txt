I love this salt!          And for the reviewers concerned about it not melting quickly... it's not supposed to. It's a FINISHING salt. It's a complete waste to cook with it, plus it's hard to come up with equivalent measures if you were to use it when cooking in place of kosher or table salt.  But sprinkled on a rib eye fresh off the grill, on a pan seared salmon filet just before you serve it, on roasted aspargus right out of the oven, or even over a fresh, crisp apple half   it's "Na" heaven! If you already use finishing salts, you know what difference they can make. And if you're not, it's an easy way to take your dishes to the next level. Bon appetite!
