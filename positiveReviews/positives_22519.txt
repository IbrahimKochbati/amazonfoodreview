We bought a machine and pop corn from Discount Tommy. We served over 900 free bags of pop corn at a church function, coined Church At the Park  [...]  the premix is excellent and so easy, great taste and nothing but compliments. We are doing it again this year and where will we get our pop corn...... DISCOUNT TOMMY!
