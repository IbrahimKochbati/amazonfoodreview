I just received a shipment of Farmer's Market Pumpkin (12 15oz cans) and was very pleased with the condition of the cans.  Outside and inside cardboard cases were in excellent condition.  Of the 12 cans, 2 were slightly damaged (no worse than some found in my local grocery stores!) and the other 10 were unscathed.  I was worried after reading all the horror stories [above] and so I am very happy with my own experience.  Would not hesitate to order again.
