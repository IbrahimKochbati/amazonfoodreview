The white truffle oil seems to give an extra good flavor to salads, but this kind (infused), which is the real McCoy, (they have some made in a factory or lab) is very, very expensive.  Two bottles come in a package, but they are very small. The two bottles together are less than 1 4 cup of oil.  A salad for four persons would take an entire bottle and the cost is approx $8.00 per bottle plus shipping.
