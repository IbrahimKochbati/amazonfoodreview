I LOVE these cookies.  Most cookies are too sweet for me    not these.  However, since they follow the  European trend of using  natural ingredients, they are full of saturated fat from butter and cream.          WHO CARES?          They are the best cookies, for me, in the world, comparable only to     "Feullitees Doree," which can be bought on in France.
