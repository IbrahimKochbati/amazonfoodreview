I do not drink coffee.  But, I love tea.  I drink it the British way, with a little milk, and this tea is flavorful enough to stand up to adding milk. I love THIS tea!  English, Scottish and Irish and even decaf for after 6:00 PM.  I used to buy this at a tea shop, but Amazon Prime has made buying by the 6 pack more reasonable price wise and easy.          If you like bold, flavorful black tea, this is the one for you.
