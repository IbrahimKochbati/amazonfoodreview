Quaker Instant Oatmeal Lower Sugar Maple & Brown Sugar is what you should get if you're interested in this type of oatmeal.  It's still available for purchase and tastes MUCH better than this version.  Skip the box with the picture of the fitness guru giving you 'super' advice and go for the original.  I have no idea what they did to this version but the taste is horrible and very noticeable when you've had the version I've mentioned above.  It's edible, but so are some varieties of garbage, not recommended.
