After the doc said cut the salt, and tuna is expensive and pyekky with no sodium, and of little health benefit, I've been looking for eitzehs.     No salt?  Tasteless food?  I'll be a misery!~     I took this product, added some lemon juice and sprayed on some liquid smoke from an atomizer bottle I comanddered for the occasion, mished it up, and it tastes great on a matzah!~     I can even extend it a little bit by adding some shredded lettuce to the mix, and it is my fave  eakfast!     Low sodium means getting creative.     Mustard, balsamic vinegar, lemon juice, worchestershire sauce and liquid smoke have been staples for replacing salt, though none comes close.     If you have another salt replacement ingredient to add, PLEASE! Put a reply here!     Thanks! Bitayavon!
