These delightful cookies have enough orange filling to give it that oh yum sensation. I was a little hesitant about placing the order, because I was thinking these would have a huge glob of orange jam on them. Nope no glob. Just a small lay with sprinkles on top. I highly recommend any one who likes orange flavored stuff to give these a try, you won't regret it. I shared these with my husband and mom and they loved them too.
