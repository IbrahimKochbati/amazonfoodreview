I don't know... maybe I got a bad batch. The pastry was sandy in texture,  oken in a million pieces by the time it got here. I reconstructed one to give it a try. The filling had a strange, bitter taste; the bad aftertaste was horrible. Such a shame, because I have enjoyed other Mr. Kipling products. Try Mr. Kipling's Cherry Bakewells (yum!) or Battenbergs. I wouldn't even give these a second try.
