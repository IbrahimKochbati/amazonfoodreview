My husband and I enjoy a really good cup of tea. Lana's Snowflake Black Tea sounded so interesting and the five star reviews made it simply irresistible   I had to try it. The delivery was very fast and it was nicely packaged. When my husband saw we had new tea he had to open it. The next thing I heard, "Wow, you have got to smell this". The aroma is so wonderful, the sweet scent from the coconut and almond fills the air and the hints of vanilla are simply divine. While the fresh aroma is intense the smooth taste is beyond compare, a great substitute to after dinner desserts. Its calming essence makes it great for a quiet evening at home...be prepared to indulge your senses.          Snowflake Tea now has to be our favorite tea. I plan to buy it as stocking stuffers for my friends and family. Lana, keep creating this tea, I plan to buy a lot more.
