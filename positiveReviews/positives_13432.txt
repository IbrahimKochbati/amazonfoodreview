As far as Keurig coffee goes, you have like, a hundred choices.  If you're like me and like strong, smooth coffee, you'll discover that not many of those hundred will give you the flavor you're looking for.  Newman's Own Organics Extra Bold, for me, is the best way to go.  I've tried maybe 20 or 30 different K Cups that tout the word "strong" or "dark" etc...  This is definitely my favorite (Starbucks is pretty good too).  But at a reasonable price of about .65 a cup, you really can't go wrong with Newman's Own.          I  ew this EARLY in the morning, and it wakes me up.  I  ew it in the afternoon, and it gives me that last half of the day pickup.  Give it a try!  At least buy the smallest option available and see what you think.  If you like strong coffee, you won't be disappointed!
