Hiding gelcaps inside the pill pockets work very well for me. I grabbed the large kind and cut each one in half, then squish them between my fingers a bit to get the pill pocket nice and soft before shaping it around my dog's medicine. He doesn't love these, but he prefers them to raw pills.          The only con about this product for me is that a lot of the time, many of the pill 'pockets' arrive in the bags completely smashed together or torn up into bits and pieces. I guess it isn't a big problem since I cut them up anyway, but it would be nice to not have to pick out pieces of them from inside the bag to mold together.
