I bought these because I had decided I wanted to eat, and even snack, healthier.  These had so many good reviews, so I decided to try them.  I admit, it was a big mistake to order a whole stupid case without trying them first.  When I opened them, they looked totally unappetizing and then I tasted them......it tasted just like a rice cake styrofoam with salt on it.  They also have a very unusual texture.  The combination of taste and texture was very disappointing.  My teenage daughter tried them and felt the same way   not even the dog would eat them.  We tried them with a variety of dips and couldn't come up with a tolerable way to choke them down.          Luckily, I have a niece that is newly vegetarian, hungry all the time, and she took these off my hands.  I am still out $25 for buying the case of these to begin with...what a waste!
