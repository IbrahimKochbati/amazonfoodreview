It's been years since I have had real Maple Syrup with my pancakes.  Since I don't have pancakes often I splurged.  Ahhh wonderfu!  Actually when you think about it 32 oz. is a lot.  So it's really not that expensive when you consider the difference. It will last a long time in the fridge.  So now once a month some friends and I will enjoy the wonderful flavor of real maple syrup.  I was pleasantly surprised at the calories, thought it would be much much higher.  Life is short treat yourself.
