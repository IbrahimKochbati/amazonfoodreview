After reading the wonderful reviews of PB2, I was still skeptical but every rave review was right on the money!!          The reduction in fat and calories is a gift from the peanut butter gods.  The fact that you mix it up as you go (which takes, literally, no more than 15 seconds) is a great help for people like me who sometimes like to settle down with a jar of peanut butter and a spoon, only to realize a zillion calories later what I have done.  You can control the texture by adding or subtracting the water recommended.  There's plenty of peanut flavor and they've added a bit of sugar (I assume to offset the lack of fat) but it is a very small amount and still adds far less in calories than all that subtracted fat and oil.          The chocolate PB2 is also completely awesome.  I eat it straight and it's almost like chocolate mousse.  Sometimes I pop in a little regular PB2 if I'm not wanting it so sweet but any way you mix it, it rocks.          I ordered and received $100.00 worth and I love the comfort of knowing my PB2 is there for the forseeable future.          I hope that the word gets out to all the people who will love this product.          Give it a try, you won't be sorry!
