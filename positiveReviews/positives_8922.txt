While this was my first Ghee purchase I was looking to satisfy several criteria for my the type of Ghee I wanted. I wanted it to be organic and from grass fed, or pastured cows, only. This Ghee definitely fits both of those requirements. I had seen this specific  and receive high marks on Amazon as well as a few other sites in addition to the fact that it is produced in the US made it only better. With all of this said, this stuff is absolutely delicious. It has a wonderful nutty butter like flavor and cooks in an excellent fashion. Although I haven't tried other  ands of Ghee I can highly recommend this one...I will certainly be buying more, only wish Amazon carried bigger jars.
