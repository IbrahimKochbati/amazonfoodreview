I have three fairly big dogs    50 to 65 pounds    who all love to chew. They love these chips and they last long enough to give them a good chew. They have a little bit of an odor, but it's not unpleasant and it doesn't linger. They also don't leave stains on the carpet. The price is great compared to similar chips for retail outlets. I marked them down one star because you do get a few in every bag that are not as hefty as the rest.
