I am a big fan of chocolate and cinnamon, and was looking for a stronger cinnamon flavor than Stephen's Gourmet Chocolate Cinnamon (which is very good, but very subtle).          This one has way too strong of a generic spice flavor for me.  It almost tastes like someone  ewed really strong chai, then tossed in a little bit of chocolate for flavor.  The spice mix overpowers the chocolate, both in smell and taste, and I can hardly taste the cinnamon part at all, which is mostly why I bought it.          Also, I drank the first 1 3 of a cup, then stopped and cleared the dishes later.  When I dumped it out, there was over an inch of THICK goopy sediment.  I followed the directions when making it, so I don't *think* I used too much mix, but you might try using less than the instructions call for.          I'm going to try it again at some point, using less mix and keeping it stirred in between sips, to see if that helps.  But otherwise I have 3 more canisters to try and give away   if you haven't tried it, buy as small of a pack as you can for a taste test first.
