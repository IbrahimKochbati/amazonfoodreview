I really liked this tea. It tastes smooth and herby without bitterness (if not steeped too long) and also it can be steeped for the second time (as the instruction on the can indicate) and still produce a good cup of tea.          The price is in my opinion unbeatable, I'm a fan of adagio teas but their price on sencha was way more expensive than this one.
