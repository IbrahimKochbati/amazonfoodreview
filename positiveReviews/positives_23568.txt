A tennis player hubby of mine got this pack on the rack of his opel corsa and casually,I started cherishing the peppermint flavour. It's gotta lasting refreshing flavour but the best part is, its real mouth freshner and above all, keeps my teeth so whiter and feels good chewing for a long time. Normally, Indians prefer 'mukhwas masalas' after lunch or dinner but I prefer the chewing gum as it refreshes the taste buds. Good pick.
