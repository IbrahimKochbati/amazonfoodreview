My daughter LOVES these carrots.  I like to make my own baby food, but with all the concerns about nitrate levels in vegetables   specifically carrots   I choose to buy these pre made since I know that Gerber screens for nitrates in all their products.  These have a great consistency and are not too thick, and not too thin.  I've even tasted them and they are quite good.  They have a rich, fresh carrot flavor that doesn't resemble over cooked, canned carrots. I highly recommend these.
