I had just tried the Yogi Rejuvenation which is good.  But this one contains 0 actual tea leaves.  It has that artificial sweenter taste and i found myself wincing after each sip like it was medicine.  Not very enjoyable.  Really bad tasting as well.  Also, returns are not elgible for this item.  I would rather have a stuffy nose than put myself through a cup of this bad, bad tasting concoction of herbs.
