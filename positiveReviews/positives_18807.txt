Both dogs love these   my anything is delicious Lab and my picky no one knows what he is little mutt. The Lab gets a whole heart at a time, the lil one gets half a heart at a time. They'll follow me anywhere for these. No useless carbs means no useless calories, always a plus for my arthritic Lab. The dog food by this same company is a favorite, too.
