I usually drink Tully's French or Kona, but decided to get this since I had seen some really good reviews on it. It seemed like a lot of people were buying it, so I wanted to find out why.          It's great! Of course we all have different tastes and taste buds that we're dealing with, so my "Great" coffee may not be someone else's choice. However, it's GREAT!          1) I love the taste!     2) I love the aroma!     3) I love the combination of the taste and aroma!          I know that I'll be getting this one again and again.          UPDATED 3 4 12 to say that this is my absolute favorite coffee. This is the one I always want to drink when given a choice. I try not to run out of it.
