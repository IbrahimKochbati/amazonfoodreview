These jerky treats are my dog's favorite treats.  Recently my vet stopped selling them and I panicked for a few seconds.  I had the realization: "I can check Amazon!".  Truthfully,  this is the closest you can get to giving your dog jerky.  My vet is a holistic vet and I consequently don't give my dog just any treat.  Still, my tiny toy poodle is VERY particular, even to the point of knowing which flavor he wants when I hold up the bags!  I bought the lamb liver, chicken and venison and venison but he loves all of the flavors, even the fish.  I like the fact that they are all natural and I'd recommend them in a heartbeat.
