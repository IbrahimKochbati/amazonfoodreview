okay, it's true our dog was used to the few stale varieties of dog food available in our remote location, but I still think it's the quality of this dog food she likes.  At any rate, she eats it all immediately.  She looks better, her hair is shinier, and she seems to feel better.  So if she were voting I think she'd give it a paws up.
