These are the best K Cup coffee I've tasted, but every time they show up on Amazon, they're sold out within a week. I run an affiliate site, and it's like rolling dice every day to watch the product link change from available to unavailable.          So, if you can get your hands on these, and you have a K Cup  ewer at home or at work, I seriously recommend that you try these out. They're a dark roast, which is my only problem with them (darker roasts have less caffeine because it  eaks down under the heat of roasting). The fact that they're organic AND fair trade is a huge bonus as well. I'm glad that I don't have to wonder what chemicals are put on the beans and that I know that the farmers were paid fairly for their goods. Sustainability means a lot to me, in the environmental AND human sense.          The flavor is heavy and rich but smoother than you would expect. There's just a hint of acid bite in the after taste that I associate with all of the K Cup coffees. I drink it black, but it's certainly full bodied enough to handle even heavy cream. If you take sugar, it will probably  ing out the woody flavor that this coffee has. It might even hold up to honey or fructose for the diabetics in the crowd.
