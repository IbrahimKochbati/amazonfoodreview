This shows an older box but from what I can tell the dates of these reviews and the fact they mention the lower sugar and horrible new taste I assume they are selling the 'Lower Sugar, Heartier Texture, and New Great Taste" boxes. They changed it all. It is horrible. Please Quaker change it back! You already had a High Fiber MBS and another one that is 50% less sugar MBS and a Weight COntrol MBS    but you HAD to mess with the original?! I have ate this for almost 40 years. Not anymore. I have to go to store  ands now. Please change it back. Oh and if you want to join the movement Hehe...go to FBook and join, 'Change quaker maple and  own sugar oatmeal back' or something like that. There are a few groups on Fbk. Also go to the discussion site on the official Quaker Oatmeal Fbook page   there you can add to the disgruntled unhappy customers that Quaker has upset. Many discussions there on this.
