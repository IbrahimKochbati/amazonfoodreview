I remember growing up with pork chops done with Shake N Bake and they were the best!  We don't do pork very often so when I saw this I had good memories of my childhood kitchen and tasty chops.  We had 4 pork chops just shy of half an inch and used about two thirds of the package.  So, it should be able to cover up to six pork chops as the instructions state.  One thing I have to admit, unless you cook them way longer than stated, you'll have juicy, tender, pork chops with Shake N Bake!  As expected, they were juicy, but the flavor isn't as wonderful as I remember.  Not sure if that's because I have an adult's palate now or if the seasoning is lacking in the newest version of Shake N Bake.  I have made it other ways in the past for more flavor ( ush with  own mustard and add rosemary to the shake n bake) and may try it again.  But, it's still a great quick meal for those nights that we're in a rush.
