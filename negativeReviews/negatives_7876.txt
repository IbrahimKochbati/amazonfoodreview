The chews arrived on time, but they seem darker in color then the ones I ordered before. Plus they seem smaller and my 11 mos old black lab chewed on one and happened to eat it all because it was small and had softened up rather quickly before it could be taken away. He then threw up and his whole meal of dog food came up, but thankfully it was on the tile instead of the carpet. Don't think I'll be ordering from this company again. I specifically ordered large dog chews, but these seemed a bit smaller this time around. Plus the bag is just sitting in the pantry b c I only gave him one out of the whole bag since I don't want to have a repeat of the throw up scenario.
