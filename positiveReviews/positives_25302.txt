It's about time there were tea pods for the Senseo machine.  I ordered the tea pod holder but it was back ordered so tried the pod in my regular coffee pod and it worked fine.  It just means a little extra work to be sure all the coffee is rinsed out.          I usually don't like mint flavor but wanted the green tea so decided to try them.  Actually they have just the right amount of mint.
