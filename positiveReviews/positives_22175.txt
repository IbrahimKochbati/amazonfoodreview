If you are tired of wimpy tea you get at most markets and like a bold hearty cuppa in the morning, these teas are great.  The Scottish tea seems to have a bit more of a malty character but not obtrusively so    the English Breakfast is a clear strong note.  Let it steep  for 5 minutes.  Who needs coffee?
