Having been in the traditional coffee, espresso cappuccino business for 25 years I was very hesitant to try Keurig period. But I succumb to progress and bought a M60 tried 25 or so different types some very good some ok. But this one folks is a 100% winner. It is without a doubt the best cup of coffee I have ever had all machines, Europe, French Press, ect. ect. Acidity, body and flavor profiles perfect.          Save your time and money Green Mountain and Newman got this one right; now all we have to do is hope they don't change it. Buy it in the 80 count and you get the best value and you wont get sick of it its that good.
