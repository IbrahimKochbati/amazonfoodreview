My Black Lab has been eating Canidae All Life Stages dry dog food since we switched her from puppy food to Canidae in early 2006.  Our  eeder recommended this dog food.  She did well on the old formula, except for what we THOUGHT were seasonal hot spots where she would chew the hair off of the insides of her legs and also her behind.          Since purchasing my latest bag about three weeks ago she has been throwing up, having frequent burping which smells of vomit, having horribly smelly flatulance, and I had to clean my carpet from a poop accident two days ago.          I was initially just upset to find that my latest bag had been down sized from 40 lbs. to 35 lb.  I sent an e mail telling them that I would rather pay more for something than have it down sized.  Their response was :          "Our economy and industry is faced with challenging times, commodities and energy cost are at an all time high and continue to sky rocket."          They ended their response with this condescending comment :          "We have also had a lot of positive feedback from our women shoppers who love the new sizes as they can handle them much better when unloading them from their car."          After talking with my dog's  eeder, I discovered that the formula had been changed and that her dogs and many other  eeders' dogs had been having problems with the new formula.  The "Canidae Team" didn't mention the formula change when I asked them about the down sizing.  That would have been nice.          So, I started searching the internet and found more horror stories of dogs becoming sick with the new formula.  Plus, many dog owners were upset that Canidae did not make much of an effort to inform their customers of the new formula change.          I sent another e mail to Canidae regarding the formula change, their lack of informing their customers about it, and how my dog has been reacting to it.  They didn't address my comments about how it was making my dog and others sick, they just stated that they did their best to post their changes on the internet.  From what I have been reading in posts, that is not the case.  I also found out through forum postings on the internet that Canidae is now in partnership with Diamond Pet Foods.  Diamond was involved in the dog food recalls where dogs were dying from the tainted food.  Maybe since the recall and deaths, Diamond has cleaned up their act and has more stringent guidelines and inspections but who wants to take that chance when it comes to our beloved dogs?
