Overall, I found Switch Kiwi Berry to be tasty.  I do think that perhaps they could dilute it a bit with more carbonated water, as the flavor seems pretty concentrated.  This would probably cut down on the calories and add to the company's bottom line too, as water is cheaper than fruit juice.          I also think that the underlying apple juice flavor is bit too pronounced.  I'd like to taste a bit more of the berry and or kiwi versus apple.  But it is nice to see a carbonated beverage that's made from natural ingredients.  Overall, I do recommend this product, although they could likely improve it with a few tweaks.
