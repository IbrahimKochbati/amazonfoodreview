The flavor is not very good  tastes very artificial. Also I seemed to get a stomache ache after using the product, and I see in the reviews that I'm not the only one. Its only redeeming quality is that the texture was fairly good, in that it dissolved well into soymilk. Otherwise it would have only been one star.
