I really wanted a decaf product so didn't have a lot of options. This powder essentially makes a chocolate flavored blended drink, even when I use cold decaf coffee or espresso as the "base", the chocolate is what you taste. When I think of an iced coffee drink, I think of coffee with a hint of chocolate (mocha) not the other way around.          As other reviewers point out, the 150 calories is for half the packet and no milk added.          I will try a different  and next time. I'm still on the hunt for a mix that creates the same flavor I've experienced once in a great while at a coffee shop. Or like the iced blended at a west coast chain (CB&TL) that is overpriced to have shipped (and I think is available sugar free)!
