The O ring for the top does not seal properly with the pitcher and you have to tilt the pitcher more than other pitchers to get adequate flow.  This makes the top fall off and the potential for all the contents to spill out.  I just lift the top up a little when I poor to bypass this problem.  The glass is sturdy and the apparatus that holds it is sturdy.  I got some stuff in between the metal ring and glass, which looked terrible, but is easily disassembled to clean.  There is no stop for the screw so over tightening during reassembly could  eak the glass.
