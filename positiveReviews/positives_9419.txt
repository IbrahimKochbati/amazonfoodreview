I was making Valentine Brownie Pops for my Grandsons' classroom party. I dipped them in white chocolate and sprinkled with Wilton's Micro Heart sprinkles. After the chocolate set I put them in individual bags and tied them closed with a red bow.          I could not believe how many Moms asked me where I bought the Brownie Pops. I usually find fault with the presentation of my homemade goodies but I have to admit, these turned out awesome and did look professionally made.
