I got this snack on a whim. I was grocery shopping while I had the munchies, which we all know is a bad idea, but that sure doesn't stop me more often than I would like to admit. But this, unlike certain others which I won't name, was a good bet. These litte yummy cheese things are terrific. My 3 year old went nuts for them, too.          They were kind of expensive, but who can put a price on something with such appealing texture and irrestistible flavor? (Not me, obviously!)
