I used about 2oz of this ground coffee in my Bialetti espresso pot to make a 12oz cup of strong, good tasting coffee. It certainly does not lose anything from the removal of acid; it tastes as good as any "regular" ground coffee I've used before. Any coffee lover who has had problems caused by acid in the past might find that this product alleviates the problem without any loss of quality or taste.
