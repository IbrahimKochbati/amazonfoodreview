Hubby and I both have teeth that can't handle anything too seedy or hard. I also lost 81 lbs (so far) doing a lower carb diet (not LOW, but LOWER). I pretty much skip  ead these days  and cereal, etc  but I don't mind using up some of my starch carb calories on these. So versatile. To dip. To make cracker sandwiches. To use  eakfast type spreads on (when a craving for bagels toast hits). I love them with hummus, with cheese, cracked over soup, topped with egg salad, with neufchatel and sugar free preserves (I use Nature's Hollow). They are so nice to have with my  eakfast omelettes.          Even my super picky hubby likes them. We both adore the texture. Oh, man. How perfect. The lightness that preserves a nice, gentle crispness.          Wasa, please don't ever stop making these.          I like this one and the mild rye. Both are now staples here. Satisfy my  ead needs without a ton of carbs. And since I restrict myself to 1200 calories, two of these do little damage to my eating plan at 20 calories each. I also like to watch my sodium (middle aged and almost off blood pressure meds), and these don't pack on the salt.          Thumbs up!          Now, if they could make one that's like an everything bagel  an everything crisp ead light and crispy version with the onion garlic sesame seed poppyseed. How cool would that be? (Or maybe they already have, dunno.)          Update: I don't eat gluten anymore, so I don't buy this product these days. For those who don't care about grains gluten, I can still recommend it based on texture taste calories. But not for me as I'm trying to stay gluten free. Be well...
