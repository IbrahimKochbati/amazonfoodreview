Together with many customers, I was frustrated when Tassimo and Starbucks ended their relationship. My coffee was Verona.     Since that time, I have tried various alternatives (Gevalia Espresso, Tassimo Carte Noir, Tassimo Nabob & Kenco Med Roast) but with limited and varying degrees of success.     After reading a previous review, I sent off for a supply to test it   I love it!!!!          I was on the point of giving my Tassimo machine away   no more.          A great start to the New Year.
