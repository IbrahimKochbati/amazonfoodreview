I'd give it three stars for the approximately 50% of puffs that have little or no cheese on them, and five stars for the ones that have a lot (maybe too much?). I have been eating Michael Seasons puffs and curls for at least two years and can't help but notice how their production has shifted from full flavored to light flavored (after which I wrote the company) to mixed flavored. It seems they produce one batch of light and one batch of full flavored and then mix the two. Are they expecting nobody to notice? At least my wife loves to pick out the light flavored puffs leaving me the full flavored creating a kind of bonding experience if you will, but if I were eating this by myself I'd be annoyed. Still, because they contain at least partially organic ingredients, and because they taste so well overall, there's no other  and that beats them so I keep ordering anyway.
