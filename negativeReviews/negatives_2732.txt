I was anticipating a fragrant unprocessed, minimally oxidized tea that is unique to all white teas. This tea could not be farther from that description. Heavily oxidized with a very strong smoky flavor. Not even palatable on a second flush. Please save your money and consider paying a few more dollars from a supplier such as Rishi or Specialteas
