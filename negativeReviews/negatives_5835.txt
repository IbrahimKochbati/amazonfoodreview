I purchased this product after reading great reviews on here.  I really like chocolate   mocha flavors, and was interested to try the raspberry.  Got the two boxes, checked the dates (sometimes an issue with K cups I have found), and eagerly popped one into my  ewer.  Smell was amazing and I was excited.  But when I tasted it, I was so disappointed.  Not strong on either the chocolate or raspberry fronts, and the coffee flavor was weak as well.  Now I am stuck with 47 cups I don't want.  I wish I could recommend these, but I must dissent against the popular reviews.  I realize everyone's tastebuds are a bit different, but these are not for me!
