The best thing about this pho bowl is the soup base.  It comes out of the package looking like a reduced beef stock   dark  own, thicker than soy sauce, and with fine particles of beef.  It's not chock full of MSG either so you don't get thirsty from it.  The noodles are mediocre.  They have a decent texture, but they're slightly sour and they make the soup sour too.  It's not enough to turn me off from this overall.          Preparation is standard for Annie Chun bowls.  Loosen the noodles with hot water, drain, add fresh water and the seasonings, and nuke for 1 min 30 secs.
