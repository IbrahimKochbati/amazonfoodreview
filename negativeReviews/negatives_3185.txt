I like this item because it enables you to freeze baby food in larger portions than ice cube trays, which is a good thing if your baby is a little pig like mine is.  My biggest complaint is that it is difficult to get the frozen items out of the tray once they are done.  I usually have to run it under hot water for a few minutes, which is not a big deal but just one more step.  Also, the price is very high for what this is.  I could use a second one but at this price I'll make due with the one I've got.
