I have been growing this "Cat Grass" for my 3 little dog, however I don't have the nerve to tell them this is for cats.  I noticed our dogs would occasionally chew grass at the park or leaves from trees, considering the chemicals that may be used on other plants I decided to grow my own.     My little guys love this stuff, but there is one problem being dogs they can be a little messy and they tend to want to rip the grass right out of the pot roots & all.  I have taken to trimming the grass daily and placing it next to their water bowl.     Trimming just seems to stimulate the grass to grow faster, much like your lawn.  As with your lawn I find that adding nutrients (Iron) to the grass it keeps it's beautiful color and many months of fresh new grass.      Don't know the exact reason my dogs like grass, it might be just like humans we like a salad for a change maybe it just add something that is missing from their diets.  Guess you might say "Dogs can't live on meat alone" or something like that.
