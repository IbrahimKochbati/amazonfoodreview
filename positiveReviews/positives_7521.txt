I used to live in Winchester, KY as a kid...  I was actually born and raised there, but moved to Montana in my early 20's...  I moved back to Lexington, KY a while ago and can enjoy this anytime now...  I'm very fortunate in that aspect, but out west it was so hard to be w o...  Can't say enough about how good this product is...  Very good for mixing w  some good old Shine or Bourbon...  It's a ginger ale, but nothing like your typical variety...          give it a try and see for yourself!!!
