OK, so I sit in the Dawg Pound for NFL games and firmly believe that the Uga dynasty is the best mascot tradition in major college athletics, but my fandom ends at barking at officials and not demonstrating special mettle by munching on snacks designed for "man's best friend."          Earlier today, I put the treats to a taste test with a pair of dogs that run every morning with their owner....and they ate the biscuits with aplomb. The back of the package has a complete nutritional analysis, but the "Newman's Own" name means top quality in every product.          Nell Newman continues to do an oustanding job in continuing and expanding the company's vision. And that the good news can be shared with pets simply makes it even more enjoyable.
