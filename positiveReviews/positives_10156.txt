I have bought a couple of hundred bottles of this over the last several months, and find it to be of good quality and highly consistent in texture and taste. It will dry out after a few minutes of exposure to air but so will your home made version. I've just entered an order for 60 bottles a month to get the reduced rate, and wish I'd done that sooner!
