My three cats seem to really like this cat food, although I think they would be happy with any cat food.  Every feeding they act as if I never feed them.  As a pet owner I looked more at price and quality.  Decent price, decent quality.  I am on the fence weather I like this product or the new Purina One Beyond better for my cats.  I think I will stick with The Goodlife Recipe primarily because it is cheaper through amazon and it is just a lot easier to have food automatically at my doorstep when I need it.  Believe me, you don't want to run out with three cats swooping around like vultures at food time!  If amazon starts carrying the Beyond with Subscribe and Save, I could be swayed.          In the past, when my oldest cat was younger, I would buy the cheapest cat food money could buy.  This caused him to be over weight and his coat was dull and he just didn't look good.  Once I got him to a normal weight with a high protein food of Purina One Healthy Weight Formula, I began looking for a lower price food to maintain this new lower weight.  They have been eating this food for over 6 months now and coats are great and all three cats look very healthy.          I gave it four stars because, although it is a decent food, I know there are better out there, just not as convenient as this item on amazon in my price range.
