This GF  ead mix was not my favorite.  I prefer GF Pantry.  Pamelas was really dense and tasted like bisquits not white  ead.  GF Pantry had all the attributes of white  ead, unlike Pamelas, first it was actually white, it's fluffy and it tastes like white  ead.  So anyway I will be buying GF Pantry from here on.
