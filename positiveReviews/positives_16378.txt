I have two dogs, 22 pounds and 45 pounds. Got the large size which is supposed to be for 50 100 lbs. My dogs love these things. I mean within a few short minutes they are gone. I thought they would be a little more of a challenge. I guess the big question is are they in my dogs mouth long enough to actually do any teeth cleaning? Or are they just a delicious treat for my dogs to enjoy?
