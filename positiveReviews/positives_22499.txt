We have an in home cinema...so we have to have a floor standing popcorn maker.  When we have guest we like to make it a real even with "MOVIE" popcorn and Little Popper does just that.  I love the flavor and the convenience of the package that is premeasured for the perfect pop.  I do add just 1 2 of the salt while popping and the remaining salt I have placed in a shaker for those that like more.  If you are looking for that "MOVIE" butter flavor this is the one!
