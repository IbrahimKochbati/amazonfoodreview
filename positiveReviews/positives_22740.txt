We bought an old fashioned trolley popcorn machine for our children at church. These packages make popping popcorn in large quantities so easy. It takes about 1 package to feed 8 10 kids. We preheat the unit and dump the contents of the package into the bucket and that's it.  The popcorn tastes and smells like movie theater popcorn.  Everyone loves it and we've had no negative complaints.
