I took a chance on these and they are awesome.  They are crisp and not at all greasy.  I like the Lay's Kettle Chips, but these are really much better, less greasy, maybe a bit more crisp too.  The rosemary is good   it's not overpowering and it tastes like rosemary.  No MSG.  Hits the salty snack craving just right.  I like the size too   it's enough to satisfy a craving but keeps me from eating a whole big bag.  Which I'd probably do with these, if that's what I had.  I'll definitely order them again.  My husband and 16 year old both really like them too.
