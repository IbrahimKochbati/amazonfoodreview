I bought the 8 oz Black popcorn machine with stand and a box of 24 popcorn packs.  I've used this item dozens of times and just love it.  It works great with the pre mesured packs but also works just as well with store bought oils and popcorn.  We have movie night at least 2 times a month at my house and could not have as much fun with out our machine.  Excelnt product.
