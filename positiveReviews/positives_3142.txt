This device does one thing and it does it well. I use it to record demos and it provides a crisp, clean sound with zero noise! I have read some reviews where people complain about the durability of the icicle. While it feels a little chinsy, I hardly think it will snap in half. The price is right and the sound is great.          For the most part, setting the icicle up is incredibly easy. I had a few instances where I had to reboot for Windows to recognize it again and such, but no serious headaches.          Overall, this is a great device to have on hand of for the traveling musician who wants to quickly lay down ideas on the road.
