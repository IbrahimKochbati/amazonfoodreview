I was very excited to tear into this box of cookies when it arrived today, and I am sorry to say I'm left a little let down. The cookies are soft, but they are also rather dry and crumbly. I'd place it in between a Grandma's  and cookie (nice and tender) and a pecan sandie chips ahoy type cookie (deliberately, delightfully crispy). I really couldn't taste much almond or chocolate, either, which was sad.          So while they're not gross, I could definitely make a similar cookie at home and it would be *much* more tasty and tender   not to mention with far fewer ingredients in.
