The hubby & and I have sworn off microwave popcorn for some time as, regardless of  and, it tends to leave an oily residue in the mouth and hulls stuck between the teeth, all followed by a night of indigestion depending on how much "stuff" that particular manufacturer adds to differentiate their  and.          However, given the rave reviews we decided to try Black Jewell. It absolutely lives up to its reputation. It is flavorful, light and crunchy, with just the right amount of salt.   The hubby & I disagree on this point. He likes to add more salt.          While there has been some variation, of the many bags we have popped, there truly have been few "old maids" as we used to call kernels that didn't pop, fewer hulls lodged in the dental work, and no cloying aftertaste.          We're having a hard time keeping it on hand as we keep giving boxes away for others to try! :)
