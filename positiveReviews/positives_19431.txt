These couldn't be easier.  You pour one packet into a bowl, add 2 cups of cold water, and microwave for 3 4 minutes.  They are already flavored, although I did add butter to mine as I didn't initially anticipate that they would be flavorful on their own.          They have a bit of a sour bite which implies that there is some sour cream in the seasoning (I didn't bother to check).  It's not overbearing, but my first few bites took me aback a little as I was expecting more of the usual blandness from powdered mashed potatoes.  I also didn't need to add any salt, but I wouldn't say they were too salty; just right.          I thought the flavor, texture, and quantity were good and better than many instant mashed potato products I've tried.  Each packet says it makes 4 servings (that would be 1 2 cup each); I would usually eat more than that for a serving; but they are filling, like real potatoes.  I'd guess for most people a packet makes 2 3 servings.
