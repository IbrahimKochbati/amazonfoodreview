I absolutely love these! Seven of these sweet, very thin Graham Crisps are only 60 calories, but it's easy to eat a lot of them and there are almost 80 in the package. Delicious by themselves; wonderful with ice cream. If they are purchased using Amazon's Add on Program there is no shipping charge.          UPDATE:  I've seen mixed reviews of this company's products. The items I've purchased have not been stale or strange smelling.
