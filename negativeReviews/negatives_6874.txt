I got this item because the review said it tasted great and was easier.  I used to use a hot air popper, and will be going back to that method. The popcorn isn't terrible, but I didn't think it was great either.  This popcorn has a bit of a manufactured taste.  I prefer the hot air popper with melted butter on it.  I also find it easier to control the salt when I use it from a shaker.
