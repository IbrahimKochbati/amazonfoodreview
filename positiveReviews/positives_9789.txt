exactly what i wanted. looks great and have had many nice compliments on it. It made a great mothers day gift, as no place around here sells anything remotely close to it. Yes the flower is not real as bamboo plants do not flower, but it does look nice. The plant is real and has grown since purchased and it still looks great
