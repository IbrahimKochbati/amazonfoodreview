I am a chocolate chip cookie lover.  Once I learned that I had to give up wheat and other gluten products I started my search for alternatives.  That was about four years ago and boy were most of the gluten free products awful.  Then a couple of years ago I discovered Pamela's  and of baked goods and baking mixes.  I have yet to find one I did not think was wonderful.  Back to the chocolate chunk cookies.  This mix has huge pieces of dark chocolate and is delicious.  Some of the reviews that I have read state that it has too much sugar.  Yes it does, as all real chocoate chip cookies do.  I am a health nut myself, but when I want an occasional indulgence this is it.
