SweetLeaf Stevia Extract is the best tasting sugar substitute I've ever found, either for beverages or for cooking; but it's VERY concentrated, so it takes a bit of experimentation to get it to taste good; but after you've found the amount you like best, it is absolutely fabulous; it even has a nice slight aftertaste (that when adjusted properly), makes it taste even better than plain old sugar;          another drawback is that it doesn't mix easily into liquids, but with practice, that becomes no problem either; it's much better than another SweetLeaf product SteviaPlus that's supposed to mix more easily; but SteviaPlus has a weird taste that's not nearly as delicious as Stevia Extract & it doesn't mix that much better either;          I just wish Amazon would always keep in stock the larger size 0.9oz Stevia Extract containers; sometimes the small ones are all that's available
