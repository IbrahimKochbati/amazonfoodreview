I usually order Bustelo Decaffeinated coffee and I am used to the taste being the same as regular espresso. I tried this Lavazza decaf espresso and I am extremely disappointed. It's really obvious when you taste it that it is decaffeinated and tastes like it is processed. I ordered the 4 pack and would really like to send back the three that I haven't opened yet if I can do that...
