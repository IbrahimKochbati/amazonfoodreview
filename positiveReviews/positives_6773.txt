This is excellent espresso and works great in my DeLonghi EC155.  In a side by side taste test, I can barely discern any difference between this and the Lavazza inBlu variety.  Both have lovely crema, aroma and flavor.  I have been drinking a LOT of espresso lately and this excellent decaf allows me to do so without being jittery or losing sleep.          If you are new to making espresso, save yourself some stress and start with this.  One of the keys to gaining proficiency is reducing the variables.  Yes, grinding beans yourself will get you slightly fresher espresso, but when there are problems what do you need to fix?  The grind?  The roast?  Your tamping?  The espresso maker?  Once you are proficient with this excellent expertly ground espresso, you will be in a much better position to experiment with grinding your own.
