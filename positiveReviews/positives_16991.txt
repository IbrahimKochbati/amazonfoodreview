This is one of my dog's favorite toys.  It has entertained her for many hours.  Prior to her getting the rope out of it, she would swing it around like a mace or weapon and bang people on the knees if they weren't paying attention.  Now that the rope has been shredded, I strategically put a larger treat in to prevent the kibble from just falling out.  Good idea, but the design could be modified for safer play.
