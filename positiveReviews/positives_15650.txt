I tried these out with my cat in the hopes of finding something she would like!  She tends to not like canned food very much.  I was truly surprised when she showed immediate interest in the snapper variety and then actually ate the whole can.  She was not very fond of the yellowfin  she nibbled a bit and then wanted dry food.  I am thrilled to finally have found something she likes.  She will eat thr tuna, but not with the enthusiasm she has for the snapper. I also like the smaller portion size  no more covering cans and keeping them in the fridge  only to have to warm them up for the next meal.  Definitely try these out.
