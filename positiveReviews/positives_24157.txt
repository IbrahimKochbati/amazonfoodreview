The flavor of this chai tea is hardly authentic  it's more dessert like than anything, and perhaps thats what is so great about it. If you are looking for an ultra spicy, complex chai this ain't it. If you are looking for rich, soothing decadence, look no further. It literally tastes like a liquid snickerdoodle cookie (those sugar cookies with cinnamon baked in). My only criticism is that you need quite a bit of powder to make a flavorful cup, and it takes a moderate about of effort to make sure the powder has fully dissolved.
