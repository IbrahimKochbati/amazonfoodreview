Ghiradelli might not make the best chocolate in the world, but their chocolate mix is my personal favorite. It is rich and mixes easily without the residue in the bottom of the cup that lesser  ands suffer from. The mocha flavor is very good with a strong coffee flavor that doesn't overpower the chocolate. This is simply great hot chocolate and well worth getting if you enjoy mocha. It also mixes very well in milk shakes!
