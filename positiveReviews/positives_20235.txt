I've enjoyed other Crown Prince products so I took a chance and tried this.  The first bite said "unique taste", by about the 5th bite (quickly acquired taste) it was already a favorite.  This has a unique flavor which quickly grows on you AND can be eaten by itself directly from the can (no preparation required). I've already gone through most of the case in less than a week.  Wishing that I had ordered more of this one on the Crown Prince special.
