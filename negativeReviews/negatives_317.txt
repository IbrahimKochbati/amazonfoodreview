Me and my wife have tried a wide range of the Hormel compleats, and this is by far the worst tasting one of the bunch. I could complain about the lack of "Chicken" but the horrid taste even     overshadows that minor drawback. I know its a cheap meal,  but I do expect something at least a little edible.  If you are looking to the Compleats then go with something at least worth you money, pick up the far superior tasting Spaghetti or Turkey dinners, and feed this thing to the family dog.
