This would be a great soup if Health Valley  lowered the sugar content at least in half or more. The company took the Health out of the Valley with this soup.When one buys a No Salt soup they are doing so for Health Reasons, if one is watching their salt  intake they are  also in most cases concerned about their sugar intake .I buy health Valley No Salt Soups because  they are Organic , No or little salt  and yes low in sugar, 14 grams of Sugar is shameful.They do a good job with their No Salt Soups except with their Tomato Soup. Fix it Health Valley . Use carrots as a sweetener?? Give it some thought???
