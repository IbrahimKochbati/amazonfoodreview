Good value and features for the price.          Quickly warms up and has an auto turn off option after 2 hours.          Tank is big enough that you can  ew several cups of coffee before refilling.          Only gives 2  ew sizes, but you can add water to your cup if you want to make larger  ews.  Water is very hot, so some room temp water does not make a difference in the taste.          Quiet when  ewing and the removable tray makes it easy to use tall cups with their ice  ew teas.          Would be five stars if had more  ew size options...which you can get if you spend more $$$$.          ..and...the K Cup patent runs out this September, so the cost of coffee per cup should drop this year!
