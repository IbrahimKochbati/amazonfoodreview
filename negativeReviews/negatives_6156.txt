I was really hoping to use this as a substitute for  ewed iced tea, but for me it isn't.  The taste is only fair and the powder doesn't completely dissolve.  I had been thinking I would add it to bottled water when away from home but I have decided to order some Ito En Green Tea, a bottled  ewed green tea, from amazon for this purpose.
