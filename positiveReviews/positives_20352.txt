We liked this cereal a lot especially because of the nutritious mix of multi grains.  The only thing we found is that the cereal had a weird after taste in one of the cans we used.  It could be a totally random issue.          I am not personally a big fan of artificial sources of DHA, such as algae.  For mothers who are  eastfeeding,  east milk is the best source of DHA and benefits of external sources of DHA are disputed.  However, we do like the fact that cereal has probiotics.          We recommend this cereal to parents who are looking for a healthy organic option.
