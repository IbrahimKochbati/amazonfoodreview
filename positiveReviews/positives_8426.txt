As a perusal of comment about Verona Dark will show, the fans of regular Verona are terribly disappointed that their favorite coffee is being discontinued. It's your company and you can run it any way you please. Conclusion: Unless there is a specific reason to discontinue regular Verona, the decision to do so is (for me terribly) ill advised.          There. How's that for potentially positive and useful feedback?          PS: I cannot choose the product you want me to specify, because you mention only DARK Verona.
