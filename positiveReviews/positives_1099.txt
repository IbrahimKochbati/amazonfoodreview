I used to buy this product in this size at a health food store in Florida for 27 dollars. Where I moved to in NY I could not find it in the stores so I looked online. With shipping costs, it still cost under 20 dollars.          I use this product in tea and coffee and I like it better than real sugar. I don't find it bitter at all even when I accidently put a little too much in ice tea. Sometimes I forget it's not real sugar when it's in ice tea. I especially like that it has no other additives for texture or taste. I have used it in baking simple pound cakes and cookies and they were good.
