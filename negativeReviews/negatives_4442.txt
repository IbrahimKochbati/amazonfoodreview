We bought a small bag of Canidae to give it a try, as we are always trying new foods for our 3 dogs.  I normally serve 2 kinds of food for dinner and whenever we put Canidae in the dish, the dogs would always eat the other food first.  I'm glad I only bought a small bag.  For the price, the food should be more appealing.  But our dogs just didn't like it and we were glad when it was all gone.  I will never buy again!
