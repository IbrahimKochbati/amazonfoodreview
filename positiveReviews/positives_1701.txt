I adore this  and of peanut satay noodles.  Unlike the other ethnic foods in box, Ka Me's noodles and sauces are flavorful and delicious.  However, there's certainly a downside.  This dish is greasy, fattening, and high in calories.  If you read the nutritional information, you'll find that this tiny box contains two servings that are high in fat and not very filling.          My advice?  Split this dish with a friend and serve with a small serving of rice.  The sauce is flavorful and potent enough that it bleeds into the rice.  An instant and tasty multi dish meal!
