Now this is a strong cup of tea! But what a delightful taste. Unfortunately I have to limit my intake of black tea, however anyone who enjoys a real honest to goodness pick me up without the bitterness of other similar products, will really love this tea. The taste is wonderful and you won't be disappointed.
