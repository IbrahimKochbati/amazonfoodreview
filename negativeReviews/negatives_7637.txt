Each box contains 6 individually packaged ("Packs To Go") cookies.          The cookies list out at 1.48 oz each and 180 calories.          The cookies are anywhere from 3 to 3.25 inches in diameter, and uniformly about a half inch thick.          They do come out of the wrapper pretty soft and when you  eak the cookie in half it splits pretty well and doesn't crumble too much.          I noticed a great deal more almond pieces in my cookies than chocolate "chunks", but I also noticed some of the chocolate had melted int he wrapper and was maybe left inside.          The texture is good, but once you start chew the cookie just kind of come apart in your mouth, but in my experience that is how most "Soft Baked" cookies are.  Plus, these are oatmeal cookie so the texture is much looser, you do definitely see and taste the oats which is nice.          The flavor is okay, the chocolate is nothing special, I would say the almonds are of good quality and flavor.  The cookie itself is sweet, but not too, with an okay butter and vanilla flavor to them.  Which is surprising since there is no butter in the ingredients, I can only guess the flavor was added.          Overall a decent cookie, nothing special, but they are soft, and come individually wrapped so you don't have to worry about them drying out.  I think without much effort you could make something just as good at home, but if you are looking for something to throw in the lunchbox that provides some fiber (4g) and some nuts (3g protein) you wouldn't be too far off going with these.
