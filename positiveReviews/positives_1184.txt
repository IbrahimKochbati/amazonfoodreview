These pods are so much better than the Senseo pods!  At 10 grams, these pods are packed with more coffee than the Senseo pods, making for a better, stronger, more flavorful cup of coffee.  I use these in my Melitta One One.  Also love that each pod is individually packaged, so they stay fresh.  They come in a stand up box dispenser which is nice too.  I can't understand the other reviewer here who didn't like the coffee   I love this decaf!  It really is the best pod I've found.  Also the value here can't be beat.  Comes 3 boxes in each order, so in each order you get 54 pods!  And Baronet has so many flavors.  Do check on the other Baronet flavors, though, because all the Baronet pods are not 10 grams, and all the pods don't come individually packaged.  Stick to the 10 gram, individually packaged pods, you won't be disappointed.  I get three different Baronet coffee pod flavors, all on auto delivery.  Highly recommend.  Yum.
