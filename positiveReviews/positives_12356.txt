So about a year and a half ago I finally started changing my eating habits. Including cutting out the junk food. I was rewarded with a 160lb reduction in my weight, I have about 50 more to lose. And I was able to get off my medication for High blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. Which are both now controlled just with diet and exercise alone.     Still, I haven't lost my sweet tooth and so finding ways to satisfy it while maintaining my good eating habits is a must. One of the things I like to have once in while is low fat popcorn like this. I don't eat it too often because of the salt but it's great for those times that snacking urge is undeniable! I've had other  ands of kettle corn but this one is pretty good, if not the best. I also like that the whole bag which is the large kind is only about 100 calories. So no guilt if you eat more than your fair share. ^_^     Other  ands I've had were only half this size but had the same amount of calories.          Great tasting popcorn, great size!
