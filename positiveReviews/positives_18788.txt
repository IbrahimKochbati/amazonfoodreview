The tea has a smooth pleasant taste.  I leave the bag in the cup until the last drop.  No matter how long the time , it never tastes bitter.  Also, I leave the paper holder attached so its weight stops the tag from flying into the tea.          I used to be able to buy this in local grocery stores but they all stopped carrying it.  It was cheaper in the stores and it would be nice if the price online was $1 cheaper per box.
