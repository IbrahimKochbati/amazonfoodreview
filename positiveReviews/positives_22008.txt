I really love this rice! I work days and go to class nights, so I have to put forth an effort to keep healthy, quick options for  eakfast, lunch, and dinner for me at all times. This stuff stores well in my desk at work, and all I have to do is  ing a package of frozen veggies and some soy sauce for a really fast and semi healthy lunch or dinner.          As for the comments about the "plastic flavor", I've never noticed that. However, you don't have to keep the rice in the bag to cook it   you can just as easily pour it into a bowl and heat it that way. I've cooked it in the bag (add a little mzithra cheese and butter  YUM) and other ways, too, and it always turns out great.          As options go for "fast food" this is one of the healthier options I've found. I totally recommend this (probably not from amazon, though, you can usually get these packets cheaper at your local grocery store...)
