If the container wasn't so loud and we could find the correct size shaped treats to put in it this product would get 5 stars. It keeps our Pit Lab mix busy and gets her thinking which let me tell you is amazing since she's quite "thick" in the head... I've found a few smaller sized treats at Petco and put a handful in at a time. Make sure to put different sized treats in it too or else the dog will dump them all out and then fill up way too fast. The plastic has held up fine on our tile floor except for the teeth marks but I'm not too worried about it  eaking like other people have posted.
