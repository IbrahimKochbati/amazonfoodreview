I was surprised to find out the coffee from my sampler had coconut in it.  I bought a sampler of k cups to try different flavors and would sit aside the ones that I liked to order in the future.          After drinking Jamaica Me Crazy not realizing the ingredients just knowing I liked it.  When ordering, reading through the reviews realized it had coconut in it and that was what made the taste so yummy, leaving me wanting more.  I was hesitant to buy but decided to go for it and am really glad I did.  Everyone I have shared my coffee surprise with loves it too.
