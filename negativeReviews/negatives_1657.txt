This is a beverage that is different from the other beverages out there.  It starts with a nice citrus zing but then finishes with a little sweet.  I was hoping for the zing to continue or get more full but it died.          The overall taste is not as sweet as an orange soda and not as citrus as an Izze or similar citrus beverage.          Overall, this is in between and as such is not going to be my pick as I will usually want one or the other.          Not bad, but not what I want.
