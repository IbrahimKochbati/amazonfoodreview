Our old dog has dental problems and arthritis.  She LOVES her Greenies and reminds us that she "deserves" one a day.  Since starting on her "senior" Greenies, she is much more limber and agile.  She has also started chewing on her chew sticks again (after several years of not being interested in them...and yes, we take her to the vet to have her teeth cleaned).
