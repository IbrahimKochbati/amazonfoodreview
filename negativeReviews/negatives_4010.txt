I ordered this product because I have enjoyed Crystal Light since it first came on the scene. I was really looking forward to enjoying all the packettes of drink. I have high blood pressure and imagine my dismay when I discovered the Strawberry (which I was very much anticipating) was an "energy" drink with caffiene added. I had always relied upon Crystal Light because I did not have to worry about getting ingredients which would be harmful to my health, however if I had not noticed the caffiene in the packettes and drank them my blood pressure would have shot up and I could have had ill effects from it. I threw all the Strawberry packettes in the trash so I did not feel I got the value that I paid for because in the discription there was nothing about caffiene.
