These treats are excellent. I have a chihuahua who has done obedience training and is now in agility training. I use the treats to aid with his training as they are easy to  eak into small pieces yet big enough for me to carry in my pocket and grab easily.          They have NEVER made him sick no matter how many he eats during a training session and he goes absolutely NUTS when he hears me open the bag.          I've purchased the smaller sized treats by Zukes, but they seem to be harder and are too big to offer a small dog as a treat, yet too difficult to split into smaller pieces. So, I find the square shaped ones to be much easier to use for training.          They CAN get hard if the bag is left open so you need to make sure to close the bag immediately. I read another poster mention that putting a damp paper towel in the bag will restore the moisture to the treats, so I'll have to try that if I forget to close a bag, which happens.          Overall a healthy and practical treat! I'm really glad I found these.
