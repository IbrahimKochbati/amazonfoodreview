I have been enjoying this tea and reordered. It has a spicy, sweet flavor that makes drinking it very pleasant. Drinking it seems to stop cravings for sweets and between meal snacks. I know it's not a "diet tea" but I find drinking a 2 cup portion several times a day keeps me hydrated and much less likely to overeat. It has a gingery, licorice taste that is great.
