I knew there was something wrong when I opened the outer packaging from Amazon an it contained loose coffee grounds.  I found the Breakfast Blend box to be leaking the grounds.  When I opened it I found several of the K cups had lids that were applied off center, thus not sealing the K cups and the grounds were spilling out.  I have used LOTS of K cups and have NEVER seen this before.  Poor quality control by Green Mountain with this batch.  Shame on the folks at Amazon for packaging up a box that was obviously leaking it's goods.
