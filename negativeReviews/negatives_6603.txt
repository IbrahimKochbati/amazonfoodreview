the bag is made of plastic which is not compostable. I wanted to give this tea a higher grade especially after reading about Lipton's commitment to sustainable growing and certification by the RainForest Alliance, but then they blew it with a plastic bag. Since tea is the ultimate soil enhancer, I regularly discard my used tea leaves on house plants and then outdoor plants and pots (even in the dead of winter awaiting spring). I've cancelled my Subscribe & Save and will return to loose teas especially the Rishi and Octavia organic white flavored teas and Celestial Seasonings in a paper bag.
