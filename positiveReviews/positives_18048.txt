At home we have premium coffee in a french press. At work I have Newman's. Although it is not a freshly ground  ew, it is still pretty amazing. Bold, dark and delicious. I used to think Keurigs were for lazy people who couldn't discern good coffee, but I'm quite content as long as the kcup is as good as these.
