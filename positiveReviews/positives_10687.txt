I received one 10 Ounce packet of Lamb and Barley dog treats from the Vine program. The treats are fairly large but they are creased and can easily be  oken into two treats. My Dobie is a big boy and eating the treat un oken is his preference. Actually, eating anything is his preference. He doesn't really "eat" in the true sense of the word as much as he "inhales" anything he considers edible. The treats have a very slight odor but sufficient for him to gulp them down in a NY minute. He would never be mistaken for a picky eater.          Like most dogs I have ever seen or owned he is not driven by a gourmet mentality but performs more like a vacuum cleaner when it comes to absorbing anything he deems worthy of ingesting. That makes it very difficult to evaluate this particular treat. Based on his performance when offered one of these goodies I can find no reason to deduct any stars and therefore must award this product the maximum five.
