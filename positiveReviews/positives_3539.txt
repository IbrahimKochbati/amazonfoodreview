Was glad to find this procuct on line as it is not sold in stores around here.  Found a jar at a grocery outlet and decided to give it a try.  Sure glad I did.  I researched this company and they have been in business since 1898. This is the only preanut butter I really like. It is made with peanuts with no sugar and chemicals added to make it taste better.  It doesn't need to add anything,  Great product and seller was prompt and shipping was reasonable.
