I got this coffee hoping to get one that would allow me to enjoy more cups a day, without the acid. I didn't notice any difference with my regular coffee. The taste reminds me of Hi ic coffee, is as strong and dark. Sadly, it didn't help to avoid heartburn either. I'm giving it four stars because of the taste, which is good and the aroma, which reminds me of my grandmother's kitchen.
