Although I think this pen is great...I didn't receive the entire roll of polytape..even after calling customer service...and I think the height of the posts is misleading..hence the 3 stars.  If I wanted to buy a new energizer and more polytape then it would be great to own, as my review below states:          Easy one page instructions and everything fits nicely back inside the bag, without struggling...          I needed this portable paddock for my goats because I have a lot of unfenced acreage beyond the barn area.  I was worried about the fence being suitable for goats so I called Customer Service...The rep went to a lot of trouble and checked this for me and said it would work fine for goats as well.  However, several days later, I called back and spoke to another rep and he said that goats needed much higher voltage.  This particular energizer is 3,000 volts and that goats needed 5,000 to 8,000 volts. But he said I could just buy another pulse type energizer and it would work with the tape that I have.  I have older, very mellow goats so the 3,000 volts are working so far.          I have different  eeds and therefore different heights of goats and one concern was that the clips on the post wouldn't be low enough to the ground for my mixed  eed goats but on the post, it has clips all the way down so that the tape can be hung at various heights.  However, even though the post is listed as 4ft high, I measured and they are actually 47 1 8  inches tall and after you push the metal tip into the ground, you are left with a height of 38 inches.  The tape rests at the bottom of the top clip which holds the tape at 35 inches off the ground.  Seems awfully short for horses but I don't know anything about horses either.          The instructions are clear and has helpful diagrams, making it all very easy to put together.  I did have problems at the end tying it to the last post.  I had to call Customer Service, and the rep said that you CANNOT unroll the whole spool of polytape if you are hanging it to the last post via the spool, which is per the instructions.  Since I had already unrolled it to the end, I had to tie the end of the polytape to the post or to the empty spool container, which he said was okay, but then it's not easy to untie that knot.          In lieu of posts, you can hang the guy wire around trees and then slide the electric tape through the loop.  Guy wires, which are similar to tent stakes give the posts extra stability, but I saw no need for them at all since the clay soil held the posts very well.          My ground is hard clay but the fence posts sunk in easily, despite that.  It had rained within the last week though so it may be different depending on the dryness of the soil.  The posts are sturdy, and strong enough to not  eak with normal use.  I did have gravel in some spots which made me have to relocate a few posts, since the tips would not go past them.          There is no mention of the tape being allowed to touch weeds and grass, so I called Customer Service back to find that out. He said that that only a low impedance energizer can be used near grass and this energizer is NOT low impedance.  So, I had to mow where I wanted to put the fence to avoid any problems with grounding.  Not very practical when out on the road.          Planning the fence was harder than I imagined because I couldn't make a perfect square and I thought I had measured correctly but still fell short of where I wanted the fence to end.  I then discovered that I was only given 126 feet of polytape rather than the 200 feet.  Doing a trial run of setting the fence up is recommended.          I wanted something that was easy.  I'm a small middle aged female and needed something that wasn't too much trouble so I could move it around without a lot of sweat and tears.  This is perfect for my goat situation if they had just sent me the correct length tape.  It seems too short for horses but I posted the measurements in case it helped someone who has horses.
