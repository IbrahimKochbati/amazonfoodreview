My dog loves these treats.  He gets one every morning after he goes outside, and waits by the treat cabinet to get it.  They seem to be working great for his teeth.  We never  ush his teeth, he's six years old, and the vet just said he doesn't need to have a teeth cleaning as his teeth look great.  I wish these were available on a subscription so they'd just come automatically!
