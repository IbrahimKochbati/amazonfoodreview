The first "Switch" carbonated drink I tried from the amazon vine program is the watermelon strawberry and now, here I am trying the "kiwi berry" flavor. I've said before that I am not a fan of carbonated drinks and this flavor just reminded me why.          There's no taste of berry nor kiwi in it, and the thing just flat out tastes like carbonated plastic. For a drink claiming to be "all natural", no sugar, or preservatives...it sure tastes quite like the opposite. Now I don't know if I just received a defective can, but it isn't it sure didn't quench my thirst and I needed to eat a "hot pocket" just to get rid of the odd after taste. Cool packaging, less than good taste.          I didn't like it! [2 Stars]
