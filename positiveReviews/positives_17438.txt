I am Canadian and live in the States and these cookies were a staple in our house as my father was Scottish. I could never find short ead cookies (Walkers) down here in the store except at Christmas time. When I found them on the Amazon website I bought 6 boxes and I am not sharing them with anyone. They are so good and they are mine all mine.
