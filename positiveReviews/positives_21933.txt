Here's a great bean dish that's a  eak from the ubiquitous canned bean products and yet not too exotic for those who cling to traditional American fare. The beans are firm and the sauce is thick and zesty with just a little bite to it. One package amounts to a side dish for two; two packages could make it a main course. As a bonus, the heated product exudes a pleasant, slightly flowery aroma, a pleasant reminder of Indian restaurants for those of us who live in neighborhoods not yet blessed with any.
