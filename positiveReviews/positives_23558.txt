I grew up on Folgers coffee. It was simply the best affordable coffee that could be drank on a daily basis. I was glad that Folgers has formulated there distinct coffee for the K Cup. A few years ago I did try using folgers ground coffee in one of those Keurig My K Cup Reusable Coffee Filter and it just did not come out right. I have had no luck with the refillable K Cup with any  and of coffee. I honestly believe that a lot of product testing goes into these K cups. It's not as simple as fill it up and run water through it.          Folgers Columbian K cups taste exactly like I made it way back when with my Mr. Coffee. Becuse you are able to adjust the amount of coffee used in the Drip  ewers this may or may not be as perfect of a match for your tastes. The one constant is the all important aftertaste. The Extra Bold Newman's own and Doughnut Shop K cups have a long, strong aftertaste that I really enjoy but they give you strong coffee  eath. By comparison This Folgers has less of a aftertaste which Is nice when you know you will be in conversation with someone.          There are many Columbian coffee K cup choices and in reality they are all good. If you loved Folgers in the past. You won't be disappointed.
