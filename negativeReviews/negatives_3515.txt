I bought these because of the good reviews and I now think the reviews came from employees or some such thing.  They are not the color of chestnuts, plus they are wet in the package and the taste and texture is way off.  I had to order 24 packs of them and they are not returnable and yet I cannot even finish the first pack.  I would really suggest either get your chestnuts fresh and roast them yourselves or do without because if you are like me who has been roasting and enjoying for 50+ years you will be terribly disappointed.
