I can't say enough good things about this variety and  and of tea.  The bergamot and other citrus elements in the tea and the delicacy of the tannins make milk, sweetener or lemon completely unnecessary.  The color and aroma are just lovely, making this a fantastic treat for the novice or experienced tea drinker, and it has just enough caffeine to get me through tedious afternoons without making me jittery.  I carry the bagged variety everywhere I go.
