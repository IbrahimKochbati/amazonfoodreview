Bought a couple jars of this just last night for a dinner party, thinking I was getting the product I was familiar with. What I was familiar with was a wonderful product, with a delightful "popping" texture, a strong, salty bite, and a lovely presentation.          What I got, to my vast embarrassment and disgust, was a fetid, sweet taste and a runny, slightly greenish goo the color and texture of goose plop.          I actually thought the stuff had maybe gone bad. Then I noticed the "ingredient list."          Really? Lemon Juice? Xanthan Gum? What on earth are these ingredients doing in a jar of caviar?          I know this stuff is not exactly high end, but come on! It was previously a very nice product!          I was gonna toss it, but the hostess ended up giving it to her cat. Do not know if he ate it or not.          Bitterly disappointed in this. Seriously, it's not edible. It's absolutely disgusting, both in looks and in taste.
