My dog loves these things, and I love that you can get almost 100 for about $20, if you went to a pet store you'd be paying at least twice as much for these things.  I have a Yorkie, and I only give these to her every so often (I try to remember to give one every other day so she doesn't get fatter).  I really hope that Amazon keeps them this cheap and I'll keep buying them
