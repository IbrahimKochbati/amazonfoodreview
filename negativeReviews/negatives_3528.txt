I do not have a green thumb.  Thankfully I'm great at feeding things, animals, children etc.  This plant arrived with minimal bud damage.  However once "fed",  she sprung back to life.  If you're squeemish around insects and worms, this is not for you.  If you enjoy nature at its best but live in suburbia, this offers a mini escape into the jungle :)
