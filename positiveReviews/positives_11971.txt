I am a white, white Maltese. Before Mommy started giving me the Pro Treat Beef Liver, freeze dried, my tears were black and stained my face. With my enjoying one treat per day, my beautiful white face is so beautiful.  I eat only natural, non colored food and drink spring water. But Mommy says the treats were the icing on the cake. AND, I love them too.
