I just got my order and it's (one of) the worst things I have ever put in my mouth! Something went horribly wrong when they made this batch. I think they spilled sodium nitrate or something all over this batch! It had white powder all over it and my even my dog turned his nose up at it! I give it one star because I've received two other orders that were so so tasting but cancelled my subscription right after I got this... Buyer Beware!
