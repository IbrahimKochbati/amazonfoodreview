I got the 3lb bag and the recipes on the bag call for "scoops." A scoop was not provided in my bag, but they say that 2 scoops is equivalent to about 8 tbsp. However, the nutrition information is given by 38g serving, not by tbsp or "scoop." I measured it out with my food scale and 38g came to exactly 3 level tbsp, so if I made the Iced Chocolate as directed (2 scoops 8 tbsp), I'd be getting almost 3 servings of chocolate mix (420 cal before the milk!). I cut the milk in half (3oz hot and 4oz cold) and use one serving (38g 3 tbsp) chocolate, served over ice, and to me it is delicious with a nice strong spicy chocolate flavor, and it is a reasonable 217 cal when using skim milk.          Different palates are going to have different preferences as far as the balance of spice and chocolate, but I can tell you that I like it. My husband does not care much for cinnamon but he also likes it, and my children like it too. We have only tried it cold so far and are looking forward to trying it hot!
