First, I want to review the product itself. I've used this  and of canned pumpkin before, so it was not new to me. I find the flavor to be a little more like a fresh pumpkin and the texture to be a little less creamy than mass market  ands. But not to a degree where it causes problems in any of the recipes I use it in. The cost per can of ordering here on Amazon is less than what the local natural food store I usually buy it at sells it for. And since they were very low on stock last time I bought it and had no expected restocking date, I figured the savings and availibility made it worth the risk of ordering online even after reading the reviews.          Which leads me to the packaging. Yes, as many other reviewers have reported, cans were dented. The outside packaging along with the other items in my order were in perfect condition, it was not until I got to the "ready to ship" flat of cans that were pre packaged by the manufacturer that I found any damage whatsoever. 8 of the 12 cans had dents. However, they are only small dents and don't affect the safety or quality of the product in any way. I wouldn't have hesitated to purchase the cans off of a store shelf in this condition since the product is in very short supply, so it isn't a problem for me.
