Yes   I suffer from heartburn.  Something about aging that I'm just not enjoying.  So when this came up to try, I thought it was a great idea!  As a caffeine addict from way back, I can't give up my morning cup of joe just because of a little stomach acid!          I have to admit, I'm not a fan of French roast.  I refer to it as "French burnt" because it really tastes burnt to me.  So, though this still tasted burnt, it didn't taste different than any other French roast I've had.  So no marks off for that.          It comes already ground, and wow, is it ground!  It's like powder, which I don't like.  I usually use K cups, but when I get "real" coffee, I prefer it whole bean because it 1) lasts longer and 2) I can grind it the way I like, which is quite a bit more coarse than this is.  Puroast has taken care of the "lasts longer" issue because this comes in small bags.  I don't like the powdery grind though.  I use a French press, and the powder tends to get through the filter.  This should work well on a regular coffee maker with a paper filter, but this really isn't the best for a French press.  (Puroast does make whole bean as well   yay!)          I didn't notice an increase in heartburn, which is really great.  Of course, I didn't notice much of a lessening either.  It's possible my morning coffee isn't my problem, so I'm not going to mark off stars for that either.  (The product description says it helps 90% of customers   I'm apparently special.)          A coffee snob probably wouldn't go for this (Pre ground???  Really???  Please!) but for the rest of us, it's not bad.  Again, I don't like French roast much, but if you do, then this should taste all right.  (My husband likes it.)  There's a strong flavor, but it's not bitter.  It comes in small packages, so even though ground, it shouldn't get stale.  It won't make your heartburn worse.  The price seems a little high ($24 for 30 oz or 10 packages), but you can save with Subscribe & Save, and if it helps with your heartburn, then it's worth the price.
