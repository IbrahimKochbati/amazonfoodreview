I bought this for my husband because he wanted a  eakfast blend and isn't too fond of the Newmans. He likes the Dunkin Donuts but it's pricey. he said this blend is up to par with the dunkin  and. You only get 12 in the dunkin package and it's over $12. he likes this better than the donut house also.
