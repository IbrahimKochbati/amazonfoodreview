Green apple flavor cough syrup.     No, that isn't a compliment.     It's ok, just not great.     It's nowhere near as bad as other drinks I've had.     The tiny container that it comes in rocks and I love the fact that I don't have to refrigerate it either.     All in all, not bad.     It just needs some tweaking in the taste department.     I'll give a halfhearted recommendation if you need to spruce up your plain water without adding more inches to your waist.
