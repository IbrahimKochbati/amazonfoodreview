We just changed to Gerber Good Start Gentle due to sugar in this product.  This did seem to work better than a couple other formula but I decided to try something else when I read about sugar.  We just changed over to Gerber Good Start Gentle and it does (so far) seem to be working better.  He is still gassy but he has less pain and doesnt seem in nearly as much discomfort when eating (he is a little colic but still loves to eat).  I do this this is a good product and I'm sure the sugar is safe, I just would rather not give extra sugar at this age (8 weeks).  Good luck!!
