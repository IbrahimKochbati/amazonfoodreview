LOVED Caribou Blend.  Found a great price at Amazon, ordered enough to last 5 or 6 months.  K Cups had a different logo than my previous purchases, and tasted sooooo bad I couldn't drink it.  After opening several boxes and  ewing several cups from each box, each cup as bad as the last, I decided to return the unopened boxes.  BUYER BEWARE  I had no idea that the seller would refuse to take back or refund anything on "consumable" products.  I'm out a lot of money for really bad coffee and can't find another  and that is as good as my old Caribou Blend.  Any suggestions??
