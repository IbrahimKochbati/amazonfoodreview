If you're looking for a coffee that is kind to your stomach, you may wish to try this. I make decaf iced coffee each morning with almond milk, a tablespoon of cocoa and stevia for sweetener. This coffee is tasty, satisfying and smells good. I love hazelnut and french vanilla coffee so will be exploring any flavored coffees this company makes, along with this French Roast. I enjoyed it as a base for my daily iced coffee. What a great idea to design a low acid coffee!
