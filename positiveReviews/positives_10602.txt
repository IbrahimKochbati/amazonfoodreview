This was such a great find!          I am working on a gluten free diet at home and several recipes call for rice flour. It can be hard to find where I live.          I was excited to see Amazon had it for a great price!          It arrived promptly and in great condition.          I have used it in recipes that call for it and it is delicious!          This is the most well known  and (I am told) and it really is great.          A must have for anyone wanting to be gluten free!
