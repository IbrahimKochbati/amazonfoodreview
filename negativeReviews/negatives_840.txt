I don't know the deal is here but they are terrible.  I love Cracker Jacks and not just cause there is a prize, especially now that the prizes are pointless compared to what you use to get.          These arrived and the first box I ate seemed very stale, checked the date and was not expired and the date was a long ways away so I figured maybe it was that box.  But I'm a few boxes in now and they are all the same it's like chewing on cardboard.  I event went to the local 7 11 to get some to compare and those at 7 11 were 1000 timex better.          Since it was so cheap to get them it's not worth the hassle to send them back so I think I'll just give them out for halloween.
