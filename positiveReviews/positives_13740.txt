I have tried several of the Asian Home Gourmet spice packets, and so far I have been pleased with them all. The Korma curry was fantastic. You just saute onions with some oil and the spice packets. Add your chicken and stir until it is  owned, add water and let it simmer for 15 minutes. Finish off with some coconut cream or yogurt. When I mix yogurt into this dish (or any curry dish) I mix a bit of flour in with the yogurt. That keeps it from curdling. Give it a try. It is a smooth, mild curry.
