Maybe my taste buds are impaired, but these cookies taste like nothing!          No oatmeal taste, no chocolate taste, and as for the almonds, all you feel is the crunch when you bite into them, but no almond flavor.          I normally LOVE the taste of chocolate and almond, but not these!          I wonder who in the company tested these, or tasted these BEFORE they were put out for sale?          It makes me wonder how good their taste buds are!!          It's very disappointing, because this is a Quaker product, which has been around as long as I can remember.          On the back of the box they show Granola Cookies. I wonder if those taste any better, or if there is any taste to those either?          The best thing I can say about these cookies, is that they are individually wrapped, and fairly high in fiber, 4 grams per cookie, which is 16%.  The sugar content of each cookie is 9 grams, so not too bad. The carbohydrates are 26 grams, which is kind of high, at least to me, per cookie.          Calorie wise they are 180 calories per cookie.  The total fat is 8 grams, of which 2 of those grams are saturated fat, 15 milligrams of cholesterol, which is 5%, 160 mg of sodium, which is 7%.          What really bothers me is that there is a LONG list of ingredients.          I tried two of these cookies, to see if I felt any different about the taste.  Unfortunately the second cookie tasted like the first one, which was actually no taste.          If you like beyond bland foods you may like these cookies, but if you think a cookie should actually taste like something, I would pass these cookies by!
