Yes, tasty    but it takes a little getting used to.  You have to like coconut to like this snack item.  That taste quite overwhelmed all else, for me.  I found few chocolate chips    maybe they were all taking a rest when my snacks were baked.  Anyway, it's a chewy but tasty item worthy of your consideration.  Give it a try.
