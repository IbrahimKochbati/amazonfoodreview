It sounds delicious, but the taste is just too fruity, and not all that good tasting.  It just tastes weird, for lack of a better description.  I enjoyed Van Houtte French Vanilla and Creme Brulee flavors, but this one will be re gifted:) I wish you could get smaller samplers without having to commit to this many.
