The seeds came in a plastic bag with a baggie tie.  About 90% of the seeds germinated.  This mix is a bit spicy if eaten alone.  However, it tastes great when eaten with other vegetables or in a sandwich.  One of my new favorite ways to eat these sprouts is add a spoonful of hummus to the sprouts.  It adds flavor and cuts the spiciness of the sprouts.  Give it a try!  I top my salads with these sprouts as well.          I used 3 tablespoons of this seed mixture to sprout in the Easy Sprout.  My house is coolish in the winter (55F   65F) so I put the Easy Sprouter in the oven which is a bit warmer than the rest of the house.  If you need to make it even warmer, turn on the oven light to add a bit more heat!  NEVER turn on the oven itself as that would cook the seeds and melt your Easy Sprouter!          Here are my sprouting steps for my sprouter:          1.  Since there are small alfalfa seeds in this mix, put in the small slit insert to the inner slit cup to prevent these seeds from washing out.  Put the inner cut into the outer cup.  Soak 2   3 tablespoons of seed in the sprouter for 12 hours.  Put on the slit dome cap to allow aeration.  Put the sprouter in the oven for a warmer environment if needed.  Otherwise, leave it on the kitchen counter.  (You do not need light for sprouting.)          2.  Pull out the inner cup (with the slits) to drain out the water. Turn on the faucet to give the seeds a "shower" and allow the water to drain out completely.  Shake the inner cup and tap it against the sides of the sink to drain out all water.  Put the inner cup back into the outer cup (solid cup without slits).  Put back on the slit dome and put the sprouter back into the oven.          3. Repeat #2 every 12 hours for about 4 5 days.  It's necessary to give your sprouts showers to wash off any potential mold and to maintain moisture around the seeds.          5. On the last day, you can also put your sprouter near in indirect light to get some greening of the leaves.  It's not necessary but it sure is pretty to see the little green leaves on the sprouts.          6. To store your sprouts, just take off the dome lid and put on the vented lid.  It'll keep for about a week or so.          For videos and recipes, check out SproutPeople.
