This coffee smells really bad   there is definitely no "delicious" smell as it  ews or as you take sips from your mug.  It tastes just as awful too.  The first couple sips that I had, with my nose closed so I couldn't smell it, wasn't too bad but the more sips I took the more disgusting it was.  It is absolutely stomach turning (to me at least) and unfortunately I will never drink the whole bag. It tastes like a weak, poorly  ewed, cheap cup of coffee (though not cheap!).  The only positive note is that it did not irritate my bladder   just irritated my nose and taste buds.
