This is a very flavorful tea. The pomegranate flavor comes through. It isn't as earthy as plain green tea.  It is fruity.  I don't feel like I'm missing anything a traditional tea bag has to offer. I've made green tea using whole leaf, tea bags and k cups. The k cup makes it all the more enjoyable because it is fast and there is no clean up.  I think the tea tastes fresh with every cup because it isn't like opening a box and having it sit around waiting for me to use the rest of it. I will definitely purchase this tea k cup again.
