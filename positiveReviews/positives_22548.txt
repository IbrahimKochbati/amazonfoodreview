The concept of the "Portion Pack" is great. Great Northern has great Popcorn!! really the only issue I had was the sheer amount of salt!!! Yes, I took into consideration my normal No Salt lifestyle and leaned to the salt Connoisseur's taste, Yet even still!! Wow!! too much salt!!          Hey Great Northern!! Can you make a Low Sodium Portion Pack???? Please!!!
