I wanted to like this..maybe its because I can drink regular coffee     without the nasty side effects of acid problems, that this did not     taste so good to me.  I love dark roast coffees but this one really     was not what I had hoped for.  It was odd tasting to me, more bitter     than other dark french roasts are.  I usually drink my coffee black,     but even the addition of 1 2 n 1 2 didn't help save the rest of the     pot from being poured down the sink.  I gave it two stars as I also     know that taste is like art...subjective.
