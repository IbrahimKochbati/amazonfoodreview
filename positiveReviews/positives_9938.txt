Funny thing about this order: I thought these were a different kind of strawberry gummy that I like from a different company (and which I have yet to find to buy in bulk). So I ordered these gummies by mistake thinking they were the strawberries I was looking for and it turned out they weren't. However, I was not disappointed that much since I do like Haribo gummies in general and these strawberries are tasty nonetheless. I've nearly finished the entire 5lb bag from my order on Jan. 4th, but I don't plan to order these particular strawberries again. Not because I didn't like them, but because there is another strawberry gummy that I like more over these (sorry, Haribo!). But don't let my preference dissuade you from purchasing these. The price is right and the 5lbs will last you a while and they are of great quality.
