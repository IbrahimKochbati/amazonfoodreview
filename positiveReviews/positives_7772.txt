Pork rinds are the delicacy of the South and among various Latin American, Carribean and Asian Cultures.          My friends introduced to me the fastest way to cure my cravings...Microwave Pork Rinds.  I was a little skeptical, at first, but since I ain't too picky when it comes to eatin', I said, "OK."          Just put the package into the microwave and 2 minutes later, you're about to feast on fresh tasting crispy pork rinds.  Be careful when you take them out of the microwave, though.  They're hotter than a Coal Miner in the Month of June.  You can see the steam emanating from the package, and they're cracklin' hot.  But, Guys and Gals, this is the real deal!  They're crispy and Oh, Sooooo good, that you'll be heating up another package before you know it.          Now, I can get them and eat them when traveling (as long as I have a microwave readily available).          This innovation is as good as microwave tater tots.          Mmmmm Mmmmm, Good!
