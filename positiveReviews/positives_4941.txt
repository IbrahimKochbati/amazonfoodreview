According to my cat, this stuff is just great.  He just licks himself for hours after eating this one and just loves the taste.  He will lick the bowl clean on this one and eats it usually pretty quickly.  But, he still doesn't want it more than 2 3 times a month because it's fish   not exactly his favorite food.  It's a great diversion from his regular fare and one that he truly appreciates.
