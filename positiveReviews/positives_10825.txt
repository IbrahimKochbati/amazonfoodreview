I can't give a truly detailed review since my dog refuses to talk, but by his actions I can tell he really likes these treats. Of course for full disclosure I must state that he tends to like any food, or even non foods (such as paper towels, backpacks ... you get the idea). But he really wolfs these down and begs for more. I plan to buy more of these, when they go on sale.          My only problem is that they are a bit expensive. Perhaps not more so than other "natural" snacks, but more than I am used to paying for treats. Had they been a little less expensive, I would have rated them five stars.
