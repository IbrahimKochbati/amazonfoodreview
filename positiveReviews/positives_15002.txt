I was afraid I would never find it in the States. I don't know why I should be surprised I found it on Amazon. Parthenon Foods mailed it to me so quickly I think I got it the next day. It was carefully packed and with a cool pack, which was spent from its trip, but it had done its job: the candy was in perfect condition. I hadn't even stopped to consider that the candy might melt in shipping, but the folks at Parthenon did, and it arrived intact and delicious. I will definitely buy from them again.
