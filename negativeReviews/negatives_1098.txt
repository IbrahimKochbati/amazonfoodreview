I feed my dog Royal Canine  and which I typically have to mix with chicken stick or wet canned food for her to eat   I thought this stuff would be more flavorful and easy to serve.  Upon opening I could tell I made a mistake   smells like cardboard   my dog won't eat it no matter how I dress it up, much less could I get her to eat it plain.  Plus, it has none of the science behind it like higher end  ands like Royal Canine   the Newman  and is spreading itself too thin here   they should stick with pasta sauce.
