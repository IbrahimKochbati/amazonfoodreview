I have a special needs teen, newly diagnosed that loves these crackers. I have eaten them also, pretty good! I save the  oken crackers for his soups. We pack the whole ones for his tuna and crackers for at school. If you buy a case (6) I believe, at Whole Foods it is cheaper. Love 'em!!!     We even do PB and J with them. (You know how most of the  eads are!)
