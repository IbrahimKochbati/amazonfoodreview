I had the pleasure to taste the real deal in Mexico.  I loved it.  When I came home I sought out the real deal here in the states, I guess I did not look very far but I did come up with this pretty good substitute.  I also like the other  and of Mexican chocolate, I tried them side by side and they are almost exactly the same.     I love the texture and I often, more than not, eat it just the way it is right from the package.  But to make a good Mexican cocoa you need to use a paddle and put the chocolate in the cup, pour over the hot milk and paddle it till it is melted and foamy.  You do not need to microwave it, yuck!  You do not have to put it in the blender, Mexican people, for the most part, do not use blenders for their hot cocoa.  I buy it at the store it is too expensive here.
