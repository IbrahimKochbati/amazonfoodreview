I really love this stuff!  It tasted kind of weird at first but I got used to it real quick and now I look forward to drinking them.  I bought 1 case each of berry, orange and coke and like them equally.  I had been getting up at 4:30 am to make myself walk a couple of miles on the treadmill but now I take one of these with me and by mile 2 I just don't want to quit walking.  I started this about 2 weeks ago and have lost 5 lbs so far, and that's even with partying in Reno for 3 days.          I feel great, full of energy!  I'm up to 4 miles on the treadmill in about an hour. I will drink another celsius around lunch time and it keeps me going for the rest of the afternoon.  I highly recommend this drink.
