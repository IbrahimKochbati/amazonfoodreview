Absolutely delicious cookies   crisp & crunchy, but not hard; sweet, but not too much so. Since a lot of the gluten free foods I've tried have left (IMHO) something to be desired, these were a very pleasant surprise. The grandkids love them too   a true test of cookie goodness.          I can buy these locally for about $3 per 5.5 ounce box. I offer this info so that buyers can decide if Amazon's current price, whatever it may be, is a bargain.          Highly recommended.
