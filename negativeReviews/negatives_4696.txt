This cat food looks and smells a lot like the Fancy Feast premium  and, Garden Medley, that comes in the green cans. (Amazing that Fancy Feast, already an expensive, premium  and, would have an even more upscale variety that's even more expensive.) It almost looks like people food. I have eight cats and two ate it immediately and the other six walked away. In the morning, I would find the bowls empty (this is not always the case with other foods, even when they're hungry, they'll ignore some things). I don't know if others changed their minds, or the two who pretty much eat anything came back and cleaned it up. I can't compare prices with this  and because I have never seen it in any store (I live on the East Coast in Virginia, it must be a West Coast  and.)          I was put off by the big Made in Thailand lettering on the box because I lived there for two years and it's not a clean country. I was a little worried about what actually was in this food.          Since I don't buy Garden Medley because I can't afford it, and I suspect this is in the same price range, I can't honestly say I would buy it. But if your cat loves Garden Medley, and this is a better buy, then it's a good deal.
