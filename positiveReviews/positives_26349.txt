i used to give a piece of wood for a toy. My dog has been 7.5 years now... His teeth got plagues so i need to clean up becuase he can't... after survey, the c.e.t. enzymatic chews was my choice and think it is perfect decision.  It works very well... after two pieces, his teeths become whitening... and the smell also fresh... it is good to improve your dog's teeth condition better, i think...
