This GF cereal is decent.  Doesn't get soggy easily and is relatively good.          I was a huge fan of Apple Cinnamon Cheerios before going gluten free, and these really don't compare well, but the cereal doesn't taste like cardboard and doesn't have the weird gluten free taste to it, and is actually pretty good.
