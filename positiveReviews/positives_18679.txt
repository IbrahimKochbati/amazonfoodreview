These chips taste delicious, but if you're going to eat a lot of them (and you will, once you open the bag), I would recommend buying them in the 1 lb bags from Amazon instead   a much better deal.  The flavor is crunchy and I love to eat them as a substitute for regular chips.  The only problem is that they are pretty small.  I have bought a bunch of bags and there has never been one single full apple chip, they are just pieces.  Still, you can't beat the flavor.
