though when compared to the usual white  ead bun you might not choose this, if you are diabetic or a low carber, it is a no  ainer. As with their hamburger buns, it is better to refigerate and the microwave for a few seconds to warm them. With regular  ead microwaving makes them rubbery but with these it softens them just right. heating over bbq or toasting makes them too dry. also use more condiments than you would with regular buns. All in all the diabetic or low carber can have a hot dog on bun without raising the sugar unduely. Though they are expensive with shipping, it is worth it for your health.
