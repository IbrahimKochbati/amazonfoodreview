I always liked to consider myself a tea drinker, but I really wasn't until I found these tea bags.  Delicious!  I was skeptical at first since Lipton, while a well known name, doesn't really make artisan teas all that well.  I was so wrong.  The tea is a perfect balance of sweet and savory, with each sip lending itself naturally into the next.  Because it's a white tea, there are very low tannins.  And the tea bags themselves are fun.  These are not your mother's teabags.  Way cool mesh with a pyramid design allows for better steepage (plus it just looks awesome).  I definitely recommend this to anyone, tea lover or not!  It will make you a convert.
