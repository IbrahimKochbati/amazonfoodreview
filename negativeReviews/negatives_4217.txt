We repotted about a dozen houseplants a month ago with Miracal Gro potting soil. I've sprayed the soil with indoor insecticide and these little bugs just look up at me a laugh. Insecticidal soap doesn't faze them either. Let's see... Miracle Gro is a division of Ortho and Ortho sells bug spray. Conspiracy theories anyone?
