This is the first time Lily ever saw this toy. She was able to move the parts and figure it out easily. She continued to play with it until see finished her dinner. It took a little time for her to figure out how to remove the pieces without them falling out but she stayed with it so it wasn't frustrating just stimulating. She finished her meal in 20 minutes and then grabbed a chew toy and jumped on the couch. I know Lily likes this toy and so do I. The price makes it extremely likable also. I will point out that Lily thought the yellow pieces were chew toys so I had to take them away when she was done with it. It's a fun quiet meal dispenser
