We have been giving our 100 pound shepherd lab collie husky mix Hip Action since he was a pup. Our vet believes this is realy going to help him prevent all the hip problems that shepherd's usually have. Eventhough I cannot buy it locally, I make sure to buy it on line so my boy will remain healthy and happy!
