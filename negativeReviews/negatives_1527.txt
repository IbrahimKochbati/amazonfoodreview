Like the SWITCH beverage I previously reviewed, this is a moderately tasty drink.  The balance of the carbonation and the fruit juice is decent enough, giving more of a tickle to the tongue than the rush of bubbles that soda usually gives.  It's definitely a lot more like juice than soda, which goes against its purpose of being a replacement for soda.  Overall, it's pretty drinkable, but I would never seek this beverage out.  There are better juices, and there are better sodas.          One major plus, though, was that it wasn't as thick and syrupy as the Watermelon Strawberry SWITCH.          6 10
