Ever since my first taste of Highland Sugarworks Dark Amber Grade A Maple Syrup, I fell in love.     This stuff is pure gold.  By far one of my favorite things in the entire world.     This on pancakes, waffles, or bacon is just magical.          I will never buy regular High Fructose Corn Syrup ever again in my life. Once you go Maple, you never go back. I could never see myself going to IHOP or Denny's and attempt to order pancakes, it just wouldn't be the same.          Highland Sugarworks has gained a customer for life.     It's just that good.
