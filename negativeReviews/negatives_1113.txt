As other viewers have pointed out, this dog food contains pesticides and grains, among other questionable ingredients. The experience with this  and has been disappointing. I appreciate Newman's Own  and but I no longer trust them with dog food and have questioned some other products from them.          I have since switched to Blue Buffalo, as they seem to have the best reputation.          "Stacey"'s review sold me on it:          "Dog food has changed ALOT over the past few years. As pet owners were willing to spend more money feeding their pets, larger corporations bought out the smaller dog food companies and changed the ingredients without notifying the customers. This was particularly true of the more expensive  ands that contained the higher quality ingredients. Real meat and rice were substituted with "meat by product" and cheap imported grains (particularly CORN) that were determined to be "unfit for human consumption". They are taking ingredients that used to be considered "waste" and packaging it up as "healthy & nutritious" food for your beloved pet. Our once healthy pets are contracting debilitating diseases and dying because of the toxic waste materials that are currently being marketed as pet food.          Blue Buffalo is one of the few remaining companies that, at least to my knowledge, has not "sold out" yet. The food really is nutritious and still contains real meat with no by products, fillers, corn or soy. We switched our dogs over this past summer after having lost one to an autopsy toxicology verified case of "aflatoxin poisoning" from the "healthy & nutritious" dog food we were buying and feeding him. This was NOT cheap food folks. This was a well known  and, highly marketed as "Natural", that we were paying $60 bag for. The FDA analysis of this food verified that it contained toxins, but NOTHING was done to the dog food manufacturer. They are still producing their "high priced waste" and heavily marketing it as "natural".          My advice to pet owners: Read the ingredients labels thoroughly and often! Blue Buffalo a great product that you can still feed your pets with confidence. Because it doesn't contain any cheap fillers, it's more satisfying to your dog so you don't need to feed as much of it thus making it still relatively economical. Don't wait until it's too late for your beloved pet. "
