I was crazy about these as a kid! They are tubes simply filled with a flavored powdered candy that has tons of sugar in it. I first tried their cute little wax paper tubes that were about 8 inches long when I was about 7 years old. Goes to figure that my 8 year old is nuts about these now. We used to take our change to the local conveniance store. They came in grape, cherry, and orange, lime and other fruit flavors. Those were very good. But there are also the big 21 inch thick plasitc tubes that hold the equivelant of 20 of the paper ones. This offer gets you a case of 48 packs of 3 tubes each in grape, maui punch, cherry, and orange flavors. Lots of fun from the Willy Wonka factory.
