These cookies are INCREDIBLE! I can't believe my grocery store stopped carrying them. I'm gonna have to get them on amazon. Normal oreos are not the same, the chocolate cookies have too many crumbs. Unfortunately, the GROCERY STORE stopped carrying the golden oreos with the chocolate filling and the white filling is just too sugary and creamy for me. The golden cookies have just the right texture. Make sure you don't leave the easy open package open, as they will get stale. I LOVE YOU GOLDEN OREOS WITH CHOCOLATE FILLING YOU ARE THE GR8EST!!!!
