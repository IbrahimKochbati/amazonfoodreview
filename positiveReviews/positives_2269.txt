Buy these cookies. You will not regret it.          They are, hands down, the best store bought chocolate cookies out there, and I buy every new  and that comes out (from Mrs Fields to all the permuatations offerred by Pepperidge Farms).          These are much better than Entenmann's recent incarnation of "new recipe" chocolate chip cookies, the milk chocolate chip and "soft baked" chocolate chip cookies. Both of these newer cookie species are awful: the milk chocolate tastes like rotting bananas and the cookie part tastes like all the other crappy store bought soft cookies out there.          In contrast, Entenmann's Original Recipe chocolate cookie is a mind blowing experience: delicious dark chocolate chips and a soft mouth watering cookie with a unique but ineffable taste. They seem to have perfected the ratio of flour to sugar, so that the cookie is delicious without weighing you down with excessive sugary sweetness (this is again in contrast to their horrible new cookies).          I have absolutely no idea why Entenmann's decided to nearly eliminate their sales of the classical recipe and replace it with these disgusting  ands. It seems to have happened when the Entenmann name was bought by a larger multinational company, so it was probably a money saving opportunity. The Original Recipe cookies likely have expensive ingredients.          The only problem is they are so hard to find: thank goodness they are now on Amazon!!!
