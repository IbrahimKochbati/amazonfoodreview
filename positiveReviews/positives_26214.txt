I bought this because I heard about the benefits of Sage tea. I got used to the taste pretty quickly and love to pour it in a glass of ice to enjoy during the summer days.          I took a star off because I've been drinking it for several weeks and I'm not seeing the work of benefits that is claimed of Sage tea (but then, I've always believed that you lose some benefits when the teas are in bags as opposed to still being in leaf form?).
