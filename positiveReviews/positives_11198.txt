I have ordered about 20 boxes of this coffee.  Seems in 3 4 of the packs in each box of 50 clogs up and gives me issues on my machine.  For some reason it punctures the filter bag and grounds clog up everything.  I will normally tap the k cup on the counter prior to insertion to try and get the filter away from the punture mechanism at the bottom but it still clogs at times.  I have a wire that I use to clean out the jet when it gets clogged.          Outside of this issue the coffee is the best on the market if you like a good bold     cup of coffee.  I still highly recommend this product.  And..it is a great value.
