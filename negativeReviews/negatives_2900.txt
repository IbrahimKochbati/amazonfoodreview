These had been my dog's favorite treats. BUT when she developed vomiting and diarrhea, the vet strongly suggested that I reconsider these treats because, quote, they have been tied to some serious health problems. She asked, are these the ones made in China?  I said yes, and she said she wouldn't take the chance.  I just threw the last (full) bag into the garbage. Please don't take a chance with your pup!
