Lipton does taste good but it's not a good quality tea! If you open the tea bag you'll see their not tea leaves but tea dust (cheep). Even the loos lipton tea is described as being " oken down so you need a fine filter to strain it." When you steep good tea it should unfurl and look like spinach!          They say this tea comes to $0.57 an oz?!?!?! Lets do the math. $27.54 devided by 8oz   $3.44.     I buy my tea from Set to a Tea [...]). It's really good tea with flavoring and dried fruit pices. It comes to $3 an oz for a tin or $2.57 for a refill. Weather you buy it loose or in bags you get the same quality tea! I went to a tea party last year (like a tupperware party but more fun) where the chick told us all about the different kinds of tea and gave us samples.
