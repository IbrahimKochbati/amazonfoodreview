This mix works very well for making bagels.  The recipe is on the side of the package.  I haven't had great success with making  ead with it.  It's too heavy and it falls after baking.  Maybe that's an altitude problem or something?  Anyway, I use it frequently for making bagels and toast the bagels and use them to make open faced sandwiches or anything that I need  ead for.  The flavor is very good   a little sweet with a whole grain flavor.  I've used it to make pizza crust too and that's pretty good too.  The bagels are my favorite though!
