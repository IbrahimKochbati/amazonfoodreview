First, I can say these cookies are very easy to prepare and I am proud to say I made all 6 units without a single failed batch. :)  So they are basically fool proof as long as one follows the instructions.          The cookies do not flatten a lot while baking, so I was able to fit more per cookie sheet than normal    about 16 cookies on a 13x18 cookie sheet vs. the typical 12.  In fact, if you drop the dough on the cookie sheet and don't flatten it a little, you will end up with cookie mounds.  Uneven edges around each cookie will remain so    these do not flatten out into smooth edged discs.  The texture reminds me of homemade oatmeal cookies, actually.          I realized after the first batch I didn't even need to butter the cookie sheet. I use aluminum bakeware yet the finished cookies came off the un buttered sheets as if they had a non stick coating (they don't).  I typically baked the cookies for about 14 minutes and they were soft and moist but set.  At 15 min. they were still soft, not quite as moist but not dry.          Second, I admit I wasn't sure I liked the taste much at first. The one thing I could definitely pinpoint about the taste after the first batch was that they seemed too salty.  So for all subsequent batches I used unsalted butter and this was a big improvement.  These do not taste the same as non GF cookies, IMO, yet they are pretty good (very good with milk) and for me they did satisfy chocolate chip cookie cravings**.          **These cookies have far more chocolate chips chunks than I find in typical cookie mixes, which helps with my evaluation, I'm sure. :)
