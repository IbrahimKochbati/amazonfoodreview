I originally got this  ead thru amazon but now buy it directly from the manufacturer so I can get free shipping when buying $75 worth (that's a lot of  ead mixes).  It's truly delicious, easy to make in my  ead machine and there are a lot of different flavors.  The yeast does come in separate little packs   in both the individual and the multi packs.     It's a little more expensive than the Hodgson Mill  ead (also very good & available thru amazon), but a much greater variety.
