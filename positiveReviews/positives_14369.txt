I read the reviews and was dubious but my dog had stopped walking up the stairs and not jumping on the chaise to sleep at night. I started Zuke's Hip Action  a little over 2 weeks ago. Yesterday for the first time in months she came upstairs during the day while I work in my office. And today she jumped on the chaise for a nap.  I figure there is no placebo effects for animals so that can't be it. The treats must have had an effect on her mobility and pain. I will be a repeat customer.
