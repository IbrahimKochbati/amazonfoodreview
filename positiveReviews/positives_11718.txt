I don't suffer from Celiacs Disease or any other dietary problem, so from my average person standpoint these bars are pretty okay.  I feel that they are kind of high in calories and very low in protein for me to be eating "whenever".  I'm more of a Zone Bar or Atkins Bar kind of person in that I need the high protein punch of at least 10 grams, a lot more than the 2 grams provided with this bar.  The part of the taste that stuck with me was the oats.  I love oats but I kept feeling them in my mouth like it was plastic or something hard.  I just felt it was a little too "oaty" for me.  I love coconut, but I didn't even notice it.  I'm sure someone who hates coconut would definitely notice, but the overall taste was quite sweet, so it just mixed in with everything else.  These bars withstood the heat test   the box was sitting in my mailbox for at least four hours in the South Texas heat in the middle of July.  I did stick them in the fridge when I got them, but when I ate the bars they were not melted or deformed in any way.          I like the ingredients in the bars   lots of organics, real food products and not many undecipherable ingredients.  I would say if you need wheat free, gluten free and or non dairy snacks, give this a try you may really appreciate it.
