I received this product as a Christmas gift, and was pleased when I tried it. The chocolate is of decent quality, the gelled liquor filling is flavorful yet not too strong, and eating a few chocolates is effective for relaxing after a hard day at work (if you drink alcohol infrequently). I thought it was a pleasantly unique and thoughtful gift.
