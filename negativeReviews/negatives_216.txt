These are good sunflower seeds at a good price if you prefer the unsalted variety, which can be hard to find.          One thing to keep in mind though, is the expiration or "best by" date.  For example, if you order these in April and the batch you receive has a June "use by" date, it may be a stretch to consume the 300 bags before the seeds start going rancid on you.  Since they're roasted in oil and unsalted, these seeds may spoil more readily than the salted variety, even if refrigerated upon receipt.          Amazon doesn't seem to specify "use by" dates for the food products they sell, so it's a gamble for the purchaser.  I'm assuming that Amazon won't ship stuff that has "expired", but they probably ship out the oldest stock first, and the "use by" date on the item may not be what you would select if you had a choice.
