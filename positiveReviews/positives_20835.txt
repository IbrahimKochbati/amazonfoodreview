My Heeler had itching and sores and I had to start cooking for her, and then we tried First Mate and she has eaten it for a year and has no sores and doesn't itch like before.  Now she is starting to itch a little and we have had her allergy tested so we can see if she is developing any allergies to the ingredients in this food... then we may have to find a new one... otherwise, we will continue on it.  I don't know who that one person thinks they are calling this low quality organic, how the heck do they know what kind of quality it is?  I think they are a competitor.  Well, since anyone can say anything, I say First Mate is high quality premium dog food.
