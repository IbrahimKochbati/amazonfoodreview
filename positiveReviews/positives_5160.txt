There's nothing wrong with this drink, but it really just tastes like any other orange soda.  Kudos to The Switch for not adding artificial flavors, sugar, or corn syrup, though.  It tastes pretty clean and refreshing, but a bit expensive for what it is.          Don't let the small sized can (8.3oz) fool you, this isn't an energy drink, it's just an orange soda.
