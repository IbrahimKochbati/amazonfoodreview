And it's a good deal if you can't find them locally. There aren't many chestnuts per package (about a dozen) if you're snacking on them, but a couple of packages will nicely flavor stuffing. You can also try (a different stuffing) water chestnuts in  ead stuffing. I've had reasonable luck with them as well.
