I have had seasonal asthma ever since I was a child and have tried rather unsuccessfully to overcome it with excercise, inhalers and medication.  NOTHING has worked as well as Yogi's Breathe Deep tea.  It's like a miracle:  When my  eathing is feeling restricted, I drink a hot cup of this delicious tea before bed and it sends me into a nice, deep sleep.  When I wake up, my  eathing is 100% better and I feel great for the next 1 2 days.  That's no exaggeration.  I reccommend this tea not only for asthmatics, but anyone suffering from stress, anxiety, lack of sleep, or just anyone who appreciates a good tea.          Thank you, thank you, thank you Yogi Tea people!  May your success flourish so I may always keep my cupboard chocked full of your wonderful teas.
