Pure, real mint jelly is far superior to the usual apple mint jelly combination but is often difficult to find. Sure enough, Amazon had it, supplied by OXBO. We use it often and so ordered a case. Though it arrived in only a few days, the packaging did not protect the 12 jars inside and only three jars remained whole. The packaging was leaking and I am sure the FedEx truck smelled good!     I called OXBO Customer service and the very nice OXBO lady took the information and immediately promised to send a repacement case. This box arrived soon afterwards and all jars survived. Thanks to Amazon for listing this special jelly and many thanks to OXBO for their prompt replacement of the order.          Jay Davis     Kirkland
