I ordered this product to send to my friend's husband. They had just moved to Alabama in the end of March, she could not find ANY Diet Peach Snapple that tasted the same as what they had bought up here in New Jersey. He said that the water that was used down South made the Diet Peach Snapple taste different ! So, now she is happy because she has found  a source that they can buy his Snapple from ! Thank you.
