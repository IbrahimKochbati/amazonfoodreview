SWITCH KIWI BERRY carbonated juice is a pleasant surprise.  Although I don't drink carbonated juices as much as I used to, I have been disappointed in the few that I have had in the past year.          KIWI BERRY SWITCH is a nice carbonated juice.  The bubbles are very fine.  The flavor is not too syrupy, but with lots of impact.  I can taste the strawberry and the kiwi, but it is not overwhelming.  There is a touch of raspberry that I find stronger than the strawberry or kiwi.  I can taste the apple and grape slightly but the berry is much stronger and does not fight with it.          There is only 8.3oz per can which can be good and can be bad.  I like it because I rarely want a big can of anything, so it is a nice size for me.  For a thirsty person on a hot day, one will not be enough.          This juice stands up to some ice too without becoming flavorless which I also like.
