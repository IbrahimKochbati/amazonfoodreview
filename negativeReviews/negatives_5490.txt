I was interested in trying this low acid coffee, as I sometimes have difficulties with "regular" coffee. Brewed up a pot in my drip coffee maker, and gave it a try.          It was OK    decent flavor, comparable to my local grocer's "upscale" store  and. I tried a cup black, and a second cup like I usually drnk my coffee, with "pink packet" sweetener and a splash of creamer. I could tell it was low acid    the negative effects I sometimes get didn't happen; not even a hint of stomach upset.          But I'm not sure it's good enough to warrant the much higher cost.  I wanted to be wowed by it, and I wasn't.  Your mileage may vary, of course, as coffee is a rather personal taste.
