I've been buying this item at the grocery store sometimes. If you like rice noodles, this is a good choice.     I like to prepare it with sauted veggies, stir fry sauce and either tofu, tempeh or mock meats. Recently I decided I would buy a couple of staple foods I like to use frequently online and this was one of my choices.
