   class "tiny"  Length:: 1:10 Mins              My dog's favorite treat is vitalife chicken poppers.  I did a video taste test with 3 treats (this one, the chicken popper, and a regular milkbone biscuit) expecting her to take the popper first, but then see how fast she came back for the Newman's Own Dog treat.  To my actual surprise she took the Newman's Own first.  This was the first time I ever offered it to her.  I usually give her a few treats in the morning and she smells them all and grabs her favorite first.          I will definitely be buying more.  Check out the video.  I asked her to give the treat back to me (she's a good dog) and choose again just to make sure.  She chose the Newman's own again and gobbled it.  She did come back for the chicken popper when she was done with the Newman's Own.  She left the Milk Bone where it was.          In addition to her liking it, I liked that the ingredient list was so simple without unrecognizable ingredients ... i.e. it was Barley, Lamb, Carrots.  If I like the ingredient list and she loves the treat, that's all I need to know!          Very very happy with this product!!!
