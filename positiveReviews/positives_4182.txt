I love Earth's Best. My son eats almost all of the Earth's Best single and combination foods. This pack in particular has two of his dinner lunch favorites: Summer Vegetable and Brown Rice and Lentil. Some of the dinners and a lot of the first purees are very runny so we mix with some cereal to thicken.
