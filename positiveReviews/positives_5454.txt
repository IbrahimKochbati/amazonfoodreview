When I was in high school, my mother would always have these around the house. Living in the dorms, I usually only ever find small, overpriced packages of chocolate covered rasins. This is perfect for satisfying my cravings! It stores very well   I've had mine about a month and they taste the same as when I first opened them   delicious!
