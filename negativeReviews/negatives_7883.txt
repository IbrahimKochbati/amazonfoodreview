First let me say my dog loves these, and I want to love them but the quality control on these remains a problem.  Every bad I have bought has at least 3 and often 6 7 chews that are about 3 times the thickness of the rest.  Anytime my dog has had one of the thicker ones, she has always vomited it up several hours later.  I contacted the co about this, and they said they're aware of this problem, and are changing the supplier.  I have continued to buy them and throwing away the thick ones, 10 30% of the bag over a period of several months, and the problem continues.  They are too expensive to throw so many away.  I don't understand why they don't correct this.  This would be a good product if this problem didn't continue.
