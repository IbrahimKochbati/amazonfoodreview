Unlike another product I reviewed for Vine, at least this product does not have sugar per se in it. It is carbonated water added to a concentrate mixture of (in this order): apple, grape, tangerine and last   as well as least    acai concentrate. The first two on the list, apple and grape are two of the most common "fruit" sweeteners used in beverages etc. That is why the product tastes sweetened.          It has 140 calories    quite a lot for 8 oz of flavored carbonated water    and all of it is from carbohydrates (36 grams) and over 90% of the carbs (34 grams) are sugars. Apple and grapes have some of the highest concentrations of "fructose" a fruit sugar that not only commonly appears in commercial beverages because it is sweeter than regular cane sugar and thus it is cheaper to use, but it is also known to cause diarrhea, particularly in children.          So another drink on the hit parade of "pretend" healthy drinks  appealing to the masses' concern for their ever growing girth    and deluding them that this will help forestall continued growth.          You are better off drinking diet coke. You would be even more better off buying the sparkling flavored waters with no calories. My favorite is Bella Familglia    in pomegranate, lime, lemon and orange flavors    and is sold from time to time on Amazon as well as your local supermarket.          Better yet, buy some organic pure fruit juice    such as pomegranate and pour  1 8 cup in a glass of your favorite sparking water or a quarter cup in a 16 oz bottle of your favorite sparkling water. At least it is the actual juice and not some fructose extract.
