We are coffee lovers, and my husband is a heartburn sufferer hence my excitement to try the Puroast Low Acid Coffee.  It wasn't horrible, but wasn't as good as we would have wanted.  It just didn't have that good coffee taste that we love.  If you don't like strong tasting coffee, then this might be okay for you, but it isn't for us.
