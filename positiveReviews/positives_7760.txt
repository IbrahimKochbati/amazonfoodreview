These are soooo good but make sure you shake the bag and evenly spread the pieces out within the bag and micro for about 70 90 seconds depending on  your microwave. Always keep an eye on the bag once it blows up to its full area DON'T let it go for any longer than 20 seconds or they will burn and with the hot and spicy your kitchen and your eyes will feel like you have been pepper sprayed. Little more difficult to cook but its worth it. Enjoy
