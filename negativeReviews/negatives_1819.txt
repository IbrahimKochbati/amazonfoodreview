I really do not know what the issue is with this goat milk. My one year old daughter has suffered horrible constipation since switching to cow milk on her birthday. After a month of us both suffering (because I had to help it along if you get my drift), I switched her to goat milk. After 2 days, she was passing perfectly soft stools. The goat milk definitely cured her of the constipation, but each can I open seems to be different. Sometimes when I reconsitute it, I know right away that it is going to taste terrible because the smell is so strong. Other cans, I hardly notice it. She will not drink the bad smelling milk, and when I have tried it, I have nearly vomitted! Majorly salty and gamey tasting.     Compared to fresh (Meyenberg from the fridge section of grocery store), well, it really doesn't compare. I have found the fresh to taste sweet, like cream, and then there is a little gamey after taste, but nothing like the slap you in the face taste of the powdered. I was hoping to save money with the powdered, but since it is a 50 50 chance she won't drink certain cans, I am really wasting money. I am thinking I will have to stick with the fresh from now on.     If anyone has any ideas about what the difference between cans could be, I would love to hear it! I always have prepared it with Britta filtered water (warmed on the stove) and mixed it up in pyrex, then stored it in a large Ball jar in fridge. (I know I should prob call the company and talk to them, but that would require me to actually remember to do it at a time that they are open and I am able   never happens!!)Thanks!
