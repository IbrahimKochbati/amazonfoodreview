I have a dog who until we adopted her never had oral care,so her teeth were in bad shape. We  ush her teeth every 3 weeks and give her 1 booda bone weekly . Not only are her teeth cleaner but some of the staining has gone away. Our vet told us that these are the best thing for her because they digest easily and do not contain plastics.
