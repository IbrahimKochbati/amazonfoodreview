I find this to be the best Chai mix.  It is smooth and creamy even when made with water.  It also works well iced, which I recently discovered this summer.  I have heard mixed things on the caffeine content, but I'll go with the labeling and trust it is 99% caffeine free.  With subscribe and save, you can't beat the price, either.
