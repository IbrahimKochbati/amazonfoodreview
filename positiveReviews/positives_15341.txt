This has renewed my addiction to coffee, and tea. Once set up(~5 minutes) and warmed up(~2 minutes) you can have a hot cup of coffee, tea, cocoa, or a few other things in just a matter of seconds! This really has changed the game. Would you rather a fresh hot cup of coffee or that last cup from the bottom of the pot that's been on the burner for an hour? This allows you to have that fresh hot cup every time.          I've read some reviews that talk about it making too much noise. I don't see what they are talking about. The only think I can imagine would be when the pump sucks the water into the heater. While noticeable, that sound is a dull hum at best. I can't see it being a reason not to get one of these.          With so many great options for coffee and more this machine has been in constant use since it arrived. I'm trying out different types of coffee one cup at a time, and enjoying more tea than I've had in years. Thank you Keurig for making a product that is trouble free and simple to use.
