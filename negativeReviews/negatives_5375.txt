I got a sample French Roast and it was not heavenly as some French roasts can be but rather a middling flavor. I do have to say there was no issue with acidity even when I used the package     and used less water than I should have. Coffee taste is so personal and I'm sure you will get     mixed reviews on this. I remember the first time I made a pot of French Roast at one job someone     in accounting started to pour it down the drain saying it had "gone bad"!
