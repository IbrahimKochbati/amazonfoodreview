Very loud.  We have a larg dog that likes to counter surf and is always hungry.  Thought this would be good for prolonging his mealtime and making it challenging for him.  Even though I put small dog food in, it was extremely difficult to get the food out.  He gave up after about 5 minutes.  Was disappointed in product.
