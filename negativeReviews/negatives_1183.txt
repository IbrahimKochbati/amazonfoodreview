(First of all, somebody is chasing me around and negging all my review so dont pay any     attention to those NO votes, they both arrived within minutes of posting this review.)          This sickly sweetish molasses flavored thing is NOT jerk sauce, doesnt even remotely     resemble a bad facsimile. I dont know what World Harbors is thinking, cause this stuff     is horrible.          BTW, I like their Teriyaki sauce, but this..... its as bad as it gets.
