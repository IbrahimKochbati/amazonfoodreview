I have tried many different  ands and flavors of instant oatmeal, over the last few years. I stumbled on this by accident and decided to try it. I love it. I add some chopped walnuts, dried cranberries and raisins. Voila! a great  eakfast that is fast and nutritious. Thanks Dr McDougall for a great product.
