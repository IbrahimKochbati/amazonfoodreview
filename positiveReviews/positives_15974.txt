I like it as a straight espresso shot   great aroma, not bitter with subtle sweetness, but not as much for cappuccino. Supercrema in my opinion holds up better for those who like to add milk to their espresso drink. I don't think these beans will work at all for those who like latte. I wish all these would come in smaller size because I normally go through 1 Lb of coffee every month and this bag will last me two months.
