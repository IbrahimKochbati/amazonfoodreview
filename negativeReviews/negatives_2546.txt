For the price you pay and size of each cup (you can really only make the smallest size) you are getting taken with this purchase. Buy the traditional mix from any other company, you will get a better value, better taste and a richer texture. This snot a horrible mix, it tastes ok, but it is nothing more than a decent cup of chocolate flavored water. It has no thickness to it. Swiss Miss or any other grocery store hot chocolate beats it hands down.     All you are getting with this is convenience of using K cups, which is not much of one to begin with.     Avoid it.
