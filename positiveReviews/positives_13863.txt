This stuff is really good added to oatmeal or greek yogurt.  As for a PB sandwich?  Not as sure.  I've mixed it with jelly, and it's pretty good, but I missed the texture contrast that you get with real PB.  I mitigate this by adding a very thin layer (I have a problem with putting WAY too much PB on) of real PB to my  ead and then supplementing with the powdered stuff.  It works better that way, I think, and I don't get all the calories from using all regular PB.  I probably wouldn't buy this from amazon again because of the price, but I'm glad I tried it, and if it's on sale at whole foods or something I'd buy it.          Oh, be careful when you're opening the jar for the first time...no sudden movements or you'll be covered in PB powder, and at this price, every grain is precious!
