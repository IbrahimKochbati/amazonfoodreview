Not Flat or old  looking, like some other canned pumpkin  ands. This can is full of promise   the texture is vi ant, the color is great    a nice orange color (no food coloring here)    and can be used in so many types of recipes    from soup to pie and everything in between.          And of coures it's great to know that the pumpkin is organic.
