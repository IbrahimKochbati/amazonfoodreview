I try to always have a loaf of  ead in the freezer for my daughter who has a gluten intolerance.  We prefer the taste of this gluten free flour over others I've used so far, so I also use the mix without yeast to replace almost anything that I used regular flour for in the past...to make gravies, hush puppies,  eading for things like chicken fried steak, etc.
