Harney & Sons Paris tea is what first got me hooked on tea, so I thought I would try a couple of their other flavors.  This one is pretty delicious. I'm not sure how, but the vanilla flavor somehow makes the tea taste thicker.  I know that sounds weird, and maybe not super delicious to some of you, but I mean it in a good way. :)  I guess it makes it taste more luxurious...like the consistency of good hot cocoa.
