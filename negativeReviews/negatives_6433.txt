Whole wheat pasta is better for you.  However, this  and, Davinci is an absolute ripoff.  It is about $3 per box for only 12 oz.  To give a perspective, one could buy 16oz boxes of whole wheat spaghetti for $1 per box and it will taste just as good.          One would think that the pasta is organic at this staggering price, but no it is just regular whole wheat pasta in a small 12oz. box.  This is definitely a case of not getting what you pay for!
