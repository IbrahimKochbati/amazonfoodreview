The add on program makes this a great deal for a natural, very tasty sugar.          You can add to any order over $25 or buy 8 (like I did) and have all 16# delivered free. Either way an outstanding value!          There are lots of good reasons to eat natural sugar. I use in my coffee and making  ead. Use 1 to 1 instead of "white" sugar for your needs. You may find that yeasts will proof faster and more bubbly with this type of organic sugar.          The zip loc bag does not seal all that well. So I store in a quart mason jar in the dark cupboard. Each bag is sightly more than one quart. The balance is added to the sugar bowl.          Give this sugar a try. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
