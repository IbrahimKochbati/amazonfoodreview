My son is not a picky eater, but he really doesn't like this flavor.  I love the HappyBaby  and in general and so does my son, who is 11 months old.  I'm not saying this is a bad product, but I definitely would not buy it in bulk before you let your child try it.  You are much safer doing that with the fruit veggie mixes.  Try before you buy seems like common sense.  However, the only store that carries this  and locally for me (Target) has a very limited selection so I couldn't let my son try this flavor before I bought it.  I imagine that is the same for other people shopping on line.  I thought I could mix it with something else if he didn't care for it, but he will have nothing to do with it, mixed or otherwise.  I have to say that I agree with another review that says it looks & smells like cat food.  I try all of the food I feed my son and thought this product was bland, bordering on bad tasting.  I give it 3 stars, because I think this product is definitely not for everyone, and more of an acquired taste.  I highly recommend HappyBaby though!
