These bear cubs are great! They're just like the kind you can get at novelty candy stores only much cheaper than their $8 9 lb. In my opinion, the flavors of Albanese gummy bears are much better than Haribo's bears. I haven't experienced any powdery residue or a melted goop as previous reviewers had. My bears came to me in perfect condition and perfect packaging. If you like mini gummy bears, I suggest you give these a try.
