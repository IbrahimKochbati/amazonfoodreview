I bought this for my teething 5 month old Pitbull and she seems to love it.  Of course, I don't think she quite uses it the way its intended.  She mainly just chews on the bottle but I think she might also be trying to open the end that screws on because she opened it once and got the treats and since then she goes straight to that part of the toy.  Either way it keeps her busy.
