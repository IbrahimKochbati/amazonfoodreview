As those reared in the South know, there are different kinds of cornmeal and different ways it can be prepared.  My granny used to fry up cornmeal biscuit style in a cast iron skillet half filled with grease.  It was faintly salty and went perfectly with fried fish or chicken (or really just about anything she cooked.  Granny was a kitchen wonder.)          This Jiffy Corn ead mix produces something entirely different.  It's sweet, almost like a grainy cake mix... and my family loves it.          I usually make corn muffins with it, although on occasion I'll make Johnny Cakes for them for  eakfast.  (These are like pancakes, no syrup though   at least not in our household as the little critters don't need any more sugar    but melted butter or a fruit compote, finish them off perfectly.)          To make the mix, all you need is one egg per box and a small amount of milk.  The recipe calls for 1 3 cup, but years of making this has taught me that the proper amount can vary a great deal.  The proper consistency should not be stiff, but not runny either.  It should flow slowly when the mixing bowl is tilted.          A fun and convenient product.  You can be eating in under about 15 minutes.          Pam T~     mom blogger
