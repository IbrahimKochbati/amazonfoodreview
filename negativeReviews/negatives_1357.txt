This candy was obviously old. Each chocolate was discolored. The Krackel krispies were not crispy and the chocolate wasn't right. Peant butter cups and Goodbars nasty, the nuts are horrible. Hersheys pulls their candy off of the shelves in the stores when it is getting old. Seller must have bought it up & sold it here last year or the year before. It has to be at least 1 or more years old. Do not buy chocolate from ZANY Values, it isn't good for you!!          I'm sure that if the candy were FRESH that it would have been just fine. I have re ordered from a different vendor and will let you know if theirs is fresh (as it should be) or not.
