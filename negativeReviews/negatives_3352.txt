I have been looking for alternatives to made in China jerky. Because of   I presume   the amount of meat required to make real jerky, this has been a difficult endeavor. Even product lines like Milo's Kitchen source jerky from China while making the rest of their products   the ones they can process with fillers   in the US. True Chews markets US made jerky treats but the meat is processed with other ingredients into a jerky shaped chew that doesn't much resemble actual jerky.          Likewise, when I received these treats they were not what I expected. "Jerky," to my mind, means plain, dried meat. I thought the other mentioned ingredients would be added as a coating for flavor, but I expected a largely unprocessed product. In fact it is a cubed, compressed product containing significant amounts of grains and other ingredients as filler. My dog liked them but for the price there are other treats he likes better.          Maybe my expectations of a treat labeled "jerky" are out of line, but I know a lot of people besides me are looking for a US made jerky treat, and in my opinion this isn't it. On to Blue Buffalo Wilderness jerky. It is several times more expensive but so far the only "real" US made jerky I have found.
