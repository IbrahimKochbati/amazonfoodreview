When a beautiful young vixen from work offered to buy me lunch, I was elated.  But, at the time, I was unaware she was not willing to spend more than three dollars.  So instead of going out, we went to the store, where I was unsure about which flavor soup to get.  She recommended the Chunk Chili with Beans, Roadhouse Style.  This was a delicious, hearty meal, and I certainly plan on buying it again, partly to  ing back that nostalgic moment of its purchase.
