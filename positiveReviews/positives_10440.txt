I love sour candy.  The more sour, the better.  And these sour belts are SOUR!!          They also turn your mouth completely blue.  Lips, tongue, and even your teeth.  Especially if you overdo it, like I tend to do.  They so addictive!          The blue food coloring is easily  ushed off the teeth, but expect at least a full day before your tongue and lips turn back to normal.          These babies contain malic acid, the secret to their incredible sourness.  Taken in too great a quantity, malic acid can have an odd effect on the taste buds.  Nothing you eat later will taste right.  The effect goes away after about a day, too.          Sounds like an awful lot of fuss just to have sour belts, huh?  But if you like sour like I like sour, it's definitely worth it.          These belts are not delivered in a hard plastic case, but in a clear plastic bag.  You get a lot of them!  Store them in a resealable container to keep them soft and fresh.
