Although the cereal is a great tasting cereal I gave this one star because the price of $41.50 that they are selling it for here on Amazon is rediculous!!! That's almost $7 a box. I don't know about you but I know I've never paid $7 for a box of cereal. Wal Mart sells the 21 oz. (6 pack) of Life Cinnamon cereal for $19.68. Just make sure you shop around because when you see a deal that you think may be to good to be true, it probably is NOT a good deal.
