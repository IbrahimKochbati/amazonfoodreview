When I saw that this product was being offered to us as a VINE product for testing and feedback, I immediately ordered it.  The reason that I consider it a cheat because this is already a product I know and love and this was a chance to get some MORE.  LOL     I love the ease of opening the packet, adding water, putting it in the microwave for two minutes then stirring and adding some milk and ENJOY!  I love this oatmeal and the maple  own sugar is my favorite flavor.  This is definitely a recommendation to buy and enjoy.
