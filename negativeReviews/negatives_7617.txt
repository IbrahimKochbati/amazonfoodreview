It's hard for me to understand how Equal, which is a good product, could be packaged in such defective dispensers for as long as this has gone on.  I noticed the problem a year ago and in a dispenser that my wife  bought last month.  Is anyone at the company listening?  The product should have been recalled.          I like the product, but the tablets would not properly dispense, would get stuck in the outlet, and create frustration.  I opened the top and tipped them out by hand.          The result is that I now use Splenda.  It's an equally good sweetener and the dispenser works just fine.
