These arrived quickly.  I was eager to try them.  I put less than 1 4 cup on a paper plate and microwaved on high for 2 min.  Several of them were puffing up, but many needed more time, so I added 1 1 2 min.  Finally took them out.  The few that puffed correctly were good, however, many were still hard.  I have a new microwave, but perhaps its wattage is not high enough. I heated some lard in my fryer and tossed the under cooked ones into the hot fat.  They puffed some more, and some of them were edible.  Then, I put a few of the uncooked chips in the fryer, and finally I had the pork skins I was hoping for! Hot, puffed, crispy, delicious. I used a spider to keep them in the oil until puffed all the way through. I would order these again for use in my fryer.
