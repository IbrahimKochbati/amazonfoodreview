I was a big fan of this product since it was the only baby food that contained salmon until the ingredient was changed. The decrease in the protein content from 4g (old) to 1g (new) makes me wonder how much salmon is actually in this pouch. I can even tell from the smell of the new version which doesn't smell like fish at all that there is very little salmon in it. Also, the new version added apples and increased the sugar content from 0g(old) to 3g(new) which I am not happy about.     My son still loves this pouch, but I purchased this product for nutritious reasons   very disappointed with the change!
