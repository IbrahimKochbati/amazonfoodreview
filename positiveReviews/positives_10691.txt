I must admit that I have not tried the product myself.  However, I have an eighty pound Golden Retriever that will eat anything that doesn't eat him first.  Therefore, I tried the product on him.  After sniffing the first one I gave him, he now comes running whenever I open the sack to allow the aroma to escape.  He seems glad to have them added to his menu.     I would caution, however, that they are hard, somewhat like hardtack.  Therefore, if your dog has a tender mouth, or cannot easily chew hard treats, you might want to skip them.
