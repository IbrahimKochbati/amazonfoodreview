I almost didn't buy this from my local high end grocery store because the price was so outrageous, but I'm glad I decided to go for it.  This is one of the better gluten free cereals I've had.  It is not just like Cheerios, of course, but it has a pleasant taste of its own with just the right amount of sweetness added to make it flavorful.  It doesn't get soggy immediately like some gluten free cereals, nor does it have that familiar "cardboard" texture those of us with celiac know all too well.  This product seems to have avoided the usual gluten free problems, and I give the makers credit for that.          I think it could have a little more cinnamon taste to it    of course, I can always just add some myself    and the price is still high compared to similar gluten free cereals, regardless of where you buy it, but I think it's definitely worth trying if you're on a gluten free diet and need something palatable.  I'll buy this again.
