I will never order from this person again. They took what would be 1. pig ear and cut it into 3 very small strips. Instead of my dog getting one full pig ear he got  strips of a pig ear. What was even worse is that I got 25 pieces of the strips which was equivalent to maybe 8 full size pig ears. I'm sticking with Sam's or Costco. This place ripped me off by charging $17 bucks for strips instead of a full ear.  Additionally, the strips had the hair still attached. My dog loved them anyway but I had to give him 3 at a time to make up for the 1 so the bag lasted for a week. Terrible!!!
