Being the lone Celiac in the crowd makes for challenging entertaining. Most of the crackers I've had served leave a fine dust coating on the pallet, or they have an aftertaste. This cracker does NEITHER. It's a little strong on the sesame flavor, but it really is a great cracker to serve with Alouette cheese, etc.  It was a real crowd pleaser at our holiday gatherings, and several non Celiac family members and friends now keep it on hand in their pantries just because of the taste. One of the things that I just couldn't keep plated was when I put a little garlic onion cream cheese on one of these crackers and topped it with a tidbit of smoked salmon. ; ) The only bad thing (and the first reason I won't give it 5 stars) is that the cracker gets soggy if you plate the stuff even just 30 minutes before serving, so you really have to make it as needed, or let it be self serve assemble. The other reason I only give it 4 stars I'm listing as a cautionary statement...          CAUTION: it's not certified gluten free, and to my knowledge, it's not tested. There are no gluten ingredients, and I have not reacted, but if you are one who has an instant and severe reaction, contact the manufacturer first to verify whether their production methods, etc., are safe for you.
