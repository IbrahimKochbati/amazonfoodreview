Someone here mentioned that this tea is "more pleasing to the palate than your average bagged tea". Actually this is the exact reason why I don't like it. It's too mild for my taste. Tea should have a distinct flavor, but sadly this black tea doesn't. I wonder if any of the delighted reviewers of this product ever had a cup of really good black tea. Probably not, because this product essentially makes a cup of slightly tea flavored boiled water.
