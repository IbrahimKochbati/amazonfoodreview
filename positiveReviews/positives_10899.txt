The real reviewer   Indiana Jones (aka Indy Bear) a 13ish mix that came straight from the humane society.  Over the last 12 years Indy has been through cancer, hip displaysia, severe arthritis, and several tummy issues that his vet referred to as "garbage gut" and now he's lost his hearing.          Did I mention that he's a pudgy dog?  Maybe its spending the first year of his life in a pound, but even now   he LOVES to eat.  So when the opportunity to try a new snack came along, he informed me that it was my only choice.          I do like that these are organic... not that my dog cares. But I still would prefer if the first ingredient was a meat or meat based product.  My dog has canine teeth made for gripping, tearing, and scissoring which means that the rest of his body is set up for the consumption of MEAT.  Not corn, potatoes, barley etc.  Now granted the ingredients in here are far better than a milkbone, but you pay for them as well.          These come in a nice little rectangle shape that is scored down the middle (like a short fat graham cracker) I didn't bother  eaking it at the score because he would know and not leave me alone until the other half appeared.  Needless to say   they are VERY hard, but apparently quite tasty.  I don't know that a little dog, or a baby puppy could eat them but since Indy is a 60lbs Australian Shepherd Springer Spaniel mix (with a smattering of other doggies in there too) he had no trouble eating them.  Much like all food it disappeared quickly with little to no facial expression so I can only assume that they must be okay.  I don't know that I would go out of my way to purchase these   I did like that they came in a bag rather than a box, but would have preferred a more "green" bag rather than plastic.  If you are going to go organic, then go all the way and give me some eco friendly packaging.          Much love to Newman's for being on the right track and trying to offer us healthier food for our four legged family members.
