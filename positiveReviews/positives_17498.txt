My Shih Tzu loves this treat. She will not eat any other kind of pet treat. I ran out and was awaiting shipment. In the meantime, I bought some cheetos cheese puffs and cut a puff into fourths. She noticed the difference. Needless to say, she had to be without her treat for almost a week. I promise to be a better mom next time.
