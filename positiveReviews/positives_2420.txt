This water is delicious. I'm not picky, but I can taste bad water with chemicals or metal taste and this has none of that. And at 50 cents per bottle, delivered to your door, it's a great price. I have a teenage son and he drinks these all the time and it's a okay with me. Better than drinking a coke.
