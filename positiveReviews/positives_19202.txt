My dogs LOVE this game!  As soon as I pick it up, they get excited.  It is not too hard that they loose attention, and it is not too easy either.  The compartment covers are probably too big for a very small dog to remove...I have a Red Heeler and a Rhodesian Ridgeback.  Really good entertainment for my dogs for a very small price!
