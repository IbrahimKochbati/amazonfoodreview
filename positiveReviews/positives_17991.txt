If you can't have a real chai latte this is the next best thing.  It's pretty darn good for a powdered mix.  It's great for travel, camping, or to have on hand at home in case you have a chai emergency and must have chai NOW!  I am a chai addict and must have it every day, so believe me, I know my chai.  Of course the real stuff is better, but again this is pretty good for powder.
