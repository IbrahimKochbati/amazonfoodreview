Don't be hesitant to try this coffee because of the name. I was looking for a good MEDIUM ROAST NON FLAVORED kcup and this is it. Just right for an everyday cup of coffee. No bitterness, and low acidity. Perfect coffee for adding your flavored liquid creamer. The  ewed color strenght is just like a regular pot of Community Coffee or Folgers.
