I've come to expect good products from the Newman's Own franchise and this product was no exception.          The list of ingredients, with the exception of Palm Oil (but at least it was organic AND the second to last ingredient listed), were very good.  The fact that they contain NO wheat or corn is absolutely excellent as those are two of the things that I avoid completely for the puppy.          They are large ish squares (about 1 1 4" and 7 16" thick), with two of them attached and easy to  eak apart should you choose, and very hard and dense.  For my 50+ lb Golden Retriever puppy that is a good thing because he is a major chewer.  For a very small dog, an elderly dog, or one who might not be much of a chewer at all, they might be a bit much.          I cannot attest to the taste, as I didn't go so far as to taste them myself (I'm pretty sure they would not have been pleasing to me anyway), but the puppy seemed to really like them a lot.  It actually took him several minutes to get through one square and he is a mondo chewer, but he was not going to let me take that from him!  He was enjoying it a great deal.  Of course, that said, dogs will pretty much eat anything that fits in their mouths but he seemed to have a particular enjoyment for these so I'm happy with them as an occasional treat for him.
