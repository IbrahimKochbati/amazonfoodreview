This may not be the best tasting thing I have ever drank but man do I feel instant results after drinking some. I would best describe the effects as very close to the good feeling you experience when you drink coffee. I notice that my circulation feels fantastic like my whole body is warm, a very healthy dose of energy and I dont notice any jitteryness like coffee or energy drinks give you.  The only reason I didnt rate it 5 start is because a 16oz bottle is $3.00 which I think is a little steep. But for the great feeling I get when I drink some I would highly recommend it to anyone else who wants to feel a boost of energy as well as a general sense of well being.
