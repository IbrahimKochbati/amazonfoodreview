My ship and I, (the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish named after the 12th Duke of Devonshire), were traveling the Bay of Bengal in the summer of 1938.  King George IV, had taken reign the winter prior.  His royal majesty from the House of Windsor still had a tentative grip on the British colony of India.  Hearken back to olden days of yore when imperialism was a goal, and not a mangy politicians word.          We were making headway up the Hooglhy River into Calcutta under the guise of His Majesty's Royal Trade Mission with peace offerings to the Maharaja of Bengal.  Calcutta was a dicey place round about that time, being our capital in colonized India you know.  The locals had grown weary of the legendary British hospitality.  A fortnight later, it was near the mouth of the Hooglhy River that we met a blind street beggar who promised us visions of prosperity.  At first we questioned this diminutive cheeky fellow, but alas, we listened to his tale.  We offered the blind beggar six British royal pounds in exchange for his gift of visions of prosperity.  And that is when it happened.  The blind beggar offered us this strange, yet edible fruit.  "Eat the fruit of this Pomegranate", the blind beggar said, "and the visions of your prosperity will come to light".          For good penance, the blind beggar gave us seven pomegranates for our continued journey.  Boson's Mate Micklegal, a fine purveyor of English tea's, and the second most knowledgeable of my sailor's had a unique idea.  Boson's Mate Micklegal decided to steep some loose black tea leaves with blueberries we picked up from our travels along the coast of Palestine along with the strange edible portions of the blind beggar's pomegranate.  Much to our extreme delight, what an explosion of flavor!  I informed Boson's Mate Micklegal that he was definitely on to something.  While this delicious concoction was certainly no Earl Grey (as any honorable Britain would tell you, there's no comparison to "The Earl"), it was certainly divine, chamomile be damned!  Though summer's on the Bay of Bengal were most treacherous, with a cup of Blueberry and Pomegranate Tea by your side while fixing the  aggywinkle's on the bowline, the fresh smell of the salty air on your lips, a better day one cannot achieve.          Unfortunately, Boson's Mate Micklegal found a bottle of Glen Fiddyich stowed away in one of the hold's.  Boson's Mate Micklegal ended up getting pissed off the fine scotch and forgot his wonderful concoction.  In his plastered stupor, Boson's Mate Micklegal heaved the six remaining Pomegranate's off the aft deck of the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish, losing the wonderful recipe forever.  What Rubbish.          Until the hack tea makers at the Lipton company devised their own version of Blueberry Pomegranate Tea.  While not as divine as the tea Boson's Mate Micklegal concocted in that summer of 1938, they came darn bloody close.  Cheers Lipton!  Thanks for the memories.
