I am a huge fan of mayonnaise on sandwiches, and normally I wouldn't go against that principle, but this is a rare exception that I found so amazing that I am writing a review.  Lemonaise is hands down the best tasting stuff ever!  We received a jar of this from a gift basket we won from Whole Foods, and thought we might as well try it.  I tossed out our regular mayo, this stuff is here to stay.  Toasted homemade rye  ead, a few pieces of lunch meat and Lemonaise... BLAM!
