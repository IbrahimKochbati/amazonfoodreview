These drinks are pretty good.  Nice to have something different to drink rather than the usual soft drinks filled with sugar and syrup.  This one is also more refreshing than soft drinks, and a little more interesting than just regular fruit juices.          Everyone's tastes are different, but in my opinion they are surely at least worth a try!
