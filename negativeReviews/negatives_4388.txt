This is supposed to be a pretty basic and standard cup of coffee for the Krups machine, but was undrinkable.  I will take Green Mountain coffee over this any day.  Even my husband who is not picky with his coffee at all could not drink this.  He even tried putting creamer and sugar and could not disguise the taste.
