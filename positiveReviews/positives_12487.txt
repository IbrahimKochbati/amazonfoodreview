This is not only one of the best tasting green teas out there, I absolutely swear by it for when you're getting a cold or have one. It works miracles. Everyone in my family got sick this winter & I did for a bit (I didn't have my tea) and then I got it & was better within a couple days. As a mom of 4 that's imperative! My husband got sick several times & I kept telling him to drnk the tea!  The last time he finally listened & ended up not even missing any days at work. He keeps a box for himself at work now. You don't have to be sick tho, it's a great tasting tea...even if you don't like green tea. And the bonus is that it's good for you!
