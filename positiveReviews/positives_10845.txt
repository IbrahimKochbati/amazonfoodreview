I opened the packages, and pulled out one of the biscuits.  They are shaped as two pieces that can easily be  oken in half.  Each 1 2 piece is a bit large for training, I would prefer smaller bits, but the 1 2 piece makes a nice mouthful for a medium sized dog (45 lb).  The biscuits are a rather drab  own, a simple rectangular shape, very utilitarian, favoring function over form.          Now the real test.  I gave one to my dog.  She was hesitant at first, but gave in and attacked the treat with gusto.  Her normal behavior for getting a treat is to sit.  Once she finished the first treat, she got into the sit position, and stared intently at me and the bag, eager to earn another.  I gave her a second, and it was gone in moments.  I then placed her regular treat (a Milkbone) 2 feet apart from one of these treat, made the dog wait for 15 seconds.  When I let her go, she went first for the Newman treat.  Once gone, she went just a quickly to the Milkbone.  Hardly a scientific test, but interesting all the same.          As for the packaging, the item says it's a 6 pack of treats, but I received only a single bag of treats.  For the price, this is in no way worth it for a single bag.  For 6 bags, however, this would be competitive with "name  and" snacks, and the ingredients list would cause me to choose this first.
