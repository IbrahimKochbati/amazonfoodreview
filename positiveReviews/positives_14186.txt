I first tried this tea at my Naturopathic Doctor's office waiting area.  It was soooo good!  I looked for it at our local supermarket chains but they only had the Egyptian Licorice herbal tea (minus the mint).  While that one is good, this one is my "Favorite".  I introduced it to my son and his wife and they also loved the taste.  Amazon's prices and service can't be beat.  Whenever I am looking for a product, I always check with Amazon first.
