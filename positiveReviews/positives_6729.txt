I have never been a fan of instant coffee, so the only reason I purchased this was to use in a homemade kahlua recipe.  The kahlua turned out great so I decided to get another jar to have on hand.  As a tea drinker who has lived for years without a coffee maker, it is so nice to have an instant option that tastes great and has a good kick.          Delicious!
