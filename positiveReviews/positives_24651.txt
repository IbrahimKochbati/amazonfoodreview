I have tried several  ands of canned pumpkin for my dogs (and cat).  My veterinarian recommended it to help them naturally express their anal glands, which saves them a lot of pain and discomfort at the groomers.  (And helps the cat move hair through his system).  Using pumpkin has helped them a lot.  I like this  and because it is not as pricey as those that are sold specifically for pets, and it is a solid consistency (not as loaded with water as some other  ands), and it is organic (just makes me feel a bit better), and it is reasonably priced (especially with the 15% discount for setting it up as a subscription item).  And there you have it!
