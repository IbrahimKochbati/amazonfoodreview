I take care of this cat for a friend of mine.  The cat is very friendly, but is an extremely picky eater.  I put this product in front of her and she ate the whole thing!  So, all I can say is this has to be good.          The can are convient, but are single servings.  If you have more than one cat, the packaging is not "green" friendly, but the cat cats will love the food!
