My wife and I love this delicate wafer rolled round a delicous chocolate paste. The only problem we encountered is that it was poorly packed for shipping and as fragile as the product was, we had many soft globs of chocolate surrounded by wafer flakes. There was at least 75%  eakage.          We will try it again soon, but if it comes damaged, it will be return refund time.
