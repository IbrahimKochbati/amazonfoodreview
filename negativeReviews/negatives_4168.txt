I really wanted to like this product. I really, really did. Having to cut back on fats and sugars, this seemed an ideal product for me. However, I just can't cope with the flavor. Mixing the powder with sugar free jelly produced a water mess that seeped out the sides of my sandwich. Plus, the flavor was completely overwhelmed by the little bit of jelly I threw in, despite using two heaping tablespoons of powder. Using it on its own, mixed with water, produced a consistency that was more what I'm use to encountering with peanut butter, but again the taste was lacking. It tasted like an echo of a slightly burned roasted peanut. I'm sure the product is a great one for what it is, but I just can't see using it as a substitute for non powdered peanut butter.          I gave it three stars because the texture,when mixed with water, has a nice consistency, and it was very finely ground which made it easy to mix. I also think that it would be great for baking...maybe for rolling truffles in to give it a powdery hint of peanut coating.
