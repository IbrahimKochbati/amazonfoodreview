I've tried a lot of energy drinks and for some reason this one, in this particular flavor, lights up the receptors in my  ain like Christmas Eve on State Street.          Red Bull, RockStar, Amp, SoBe and all the rest don't compare in my opinion. This is the stuff.  The Big Green Monster.          As I write this I'm listening to DJ Splash and I'm about to start my second 16oz. can.  There was a time when I hated trance dance music and didn't drink "soda,"  but now the two seem like a marriage consecrated in the holiest of heavens.  By the way, it's only noon.          My path to Monster Enlightenment was born out of my video game addiction.  Playing until 4am and getting to work by 7am was turning into a bit of a hassle.  Coffee can only do so much, and that's when I started to drink rocket fuel like a meth addict.  One can a day used to do the trick    and best of all    it satisfied my appetite too.  Who needs nourishment when you can get by on sugar and caffeine and a few vitamins sprinkled on top for fun?  I wasn't a tub before by any means, but I'm about 15 pounds lighter than last summer.          But the days of single cans are in the past. I'm currently trying to ween myself of satan's nectar.  A 16oz can is around $2.35 at most stores, so if I have two a day it's pretty similar to if I had a moderate smoking habit.          The withdrawl is pretty unpleasant, too. I'm not sure of the addictiveness of Taurine, but Caffeine isn't something to be scoffed at. Your body adapts to Monster's boost pretty quickly, and before too long your body expects it, longs for it.  It becomes harder to get through the day without it.  I have been known to drink it warm and or flat.          So why the five star rating?  Because this stuff is awesome and I love it.  I love it even though I'm probably going to end up with intestinal cancer because of it.  I also like the flavor the best out of all the energy drinks.          Just be wary, drink it when you need it, not as a substitute for your regular drink. This is   by no means   a health drink.          [...]
