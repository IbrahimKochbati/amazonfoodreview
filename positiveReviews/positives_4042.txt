I planted this grass and in 8 days I had 3 4 inches of grass!          The price hurts since you're basically paying for shipping. The cost of the seeds themselves are $1.59 as shown on the package. I couldn't find oat grass seeds at Lowes or my local independent garden center. I'm hoping to find somewhere local to buy them so I can buy more seeds in the future without having to pay a premium and wait for them to ship.
