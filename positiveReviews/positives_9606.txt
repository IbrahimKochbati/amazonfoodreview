I just love this tea! I only drink decaf after 6pm or so or I cannot sleep. I'm always on the lookout for a great unique tea   and this one fits to a T!          I thought the vanilla flavor was not overly strong but you can clearly taste it. No bitter or strange after taste and it is suitably strong but not overly so.          Enjoy!
