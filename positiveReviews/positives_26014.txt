I like them so much I'm a repeat customer! Here is my original review; it still stands:          Liking my coffee strong, I tend towards the dark roasted or bold K cups. Having tried many different  ands, I've come to appreciate Green Mountain the most. I had previously been consuming their Dark Magic K cups, but Lake & Lodge is my new favorite. It has a nice, nutty flavor with being acidic or bitter and it is incredibly aromatic when it's  ewing.
