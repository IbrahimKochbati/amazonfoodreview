I like to use walnut oil in salad dressings and in baking.  It's delicious when added to pancakes and muffin mixes in lieu of regular vegetable oil.  It adds just a hint of flavor without being overwhelming.  And with the price that Amazon offers it for vs. what my local grocery store charges for a smaller amount, it is a definite bargain.  Would highly recommend!
