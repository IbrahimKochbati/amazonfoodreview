I am always on the hunt for a good lower fat salt and vinegar chip and I have to say, it is a very hard thing to find! I actually wrote to Pringles once and asked if they had any plans to make a reduced fat salt and vinegar chip...to my disappointment, they said no. For whatever reason, the big label  ands (Lays, Pringles, etc.) have not made a reduced fat or baked salt and vinegar chip. I have no idea why   salt and vinegar chip lovers are very devoted to their favorite flavor (as illustrated by me actually desperately writing to Pringles!). Anyway, I gave this  and a try and I am really happy with it. It has a nice strong flavor and a light crispy crunch. It have tried the Salt and Vinegar Pirate's Booty, which was ok, but more like a cheese puff and the flavor was a little strange. I have tried a couple baked salt and vinegar chips from small  ands and they were all disgusting in flavor and texture. This is the only way to go that I have found so far. I would recommend it.          Yes, I know, I appear to be obsessed with S&V chips...it is a little scary.
