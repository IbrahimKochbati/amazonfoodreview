My husband and I are diabetic and we search for sugar free no sugar added goods and beverages.  My husband loves iced coffee, but it is hard because those you can buy in the store or at retail establishments include sugar.  This is delicious.  We make it with fat free milk, add decaf coffee, the mix, and ice.  You should try it.
