Melitta does a good job with this medium roast coffee.  If you need coffee for the office where you can't grind fresh, this is better than supermarket coffee (that often includes cheaper Robusta beans) by a long shot  Brew it a bit stronger than recommended to get a full taste.  You can't get it to taste like dark roast by making it stronger   that just makes coffee bitter.  If you want dark roast, buy dark roast.  Medium roast offers pleasures of its own, and can let the individual qualities of coffee come through nicely.          Fine grind coffee is meant to made in a filter cone, and this stuff is pleasant and smooth with some personality when done that way.  So if you're looking for a  convenient ground medium roast blend for weekday mornings and don't want to go through the hassle of picking out some fancy coffee and grinding it at the store, this is a good reliable solution.  Melitta has a good reputation for a reason.          Oh, and it is Kosher, too.
