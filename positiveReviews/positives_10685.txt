I live in a small apartment with no deck, no patio, no backyard. I got a packet of these seeds as an experiment, to see if i could grow a small tomato plant in one of my sunny west facing windows.          I planted a single seed in a single peat pellet. Within about 5 days it germinated, and it has grown rapidly ever since. It's thriving in the hot summer weather, and has already put out two flowers even in a 10 inch pot.          Update:     My tomato plant has reached to about 3' tall. It grew two lovely, reasonably large, delicious tomatoes. After i cut those down and ate them, it sprouted a new round of flowers, and now has two more tomatoes growing. It looks like, in a 10" pot, this plant can support two tomatoes at a time. In a bigger pot, i'm sure it would grow more (both times it flowered, there were over a dozen buds).
