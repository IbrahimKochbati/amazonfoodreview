My husband suffers from heart burn and takes antacids daily, so I had him give Puroast a try. His thoughts are:            the Puroast is tolerable if there is no other alternative, but it does not compare well in his mind to regular coffee. The taste was somewhat bitter            given the price   almost $18 for 10 packs   it's almost better just not to drink coffee at all            if you must absolutely have some sort of coffee and cannot at all have regular coffee, this might be an acceptable alternative.
