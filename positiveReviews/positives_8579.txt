I need to watch my sodium   but I'm not really a fan of salty foods in the first place.          These almonds are perfect, at half the salt.  I would prefer them over the regular salted almonds any day!  I have no idea why anyone would want to put MORE salt on these delicious nuts.          The three count 16 ounce bags (with Prime shipping) pop on and off of Amazon   buy them when they are available.  Otherwise you must buy the six pack of small cans, at a higher price per ounce.
