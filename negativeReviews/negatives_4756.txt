For some reason, the instructions say to only cook this in the microwave.  I don't know why since it's not quick oats, but more like the old fashioned oatmeal that you have to cook on the stove.  It takes about 5 minutes to cook in the microwave and you have to make sure to use a good size bowl or it will boil over and make a huge mess.  As for the taste, only one of my kids likes it.  For the rest of us, it's just a very strange flavor for oatmeal.
