I have a 10 month old golden retriever and this product, while I liked the bottom opening for easy loading of food treats (some toys dont even have that), the rope is not very long lasting for a heavy chewer. It only lasted &lt; 24 hours before the strands got unraveled and i had to cut it off. Now i'm just using the bottle itself as a food treat dispenser, which is just like a Kong Wobbler. My dog, after just 2 days with it, has already figured out how to get the food out as quickly as possible   by grabbing the bottom of the bottom with his mouth and lifting it upside down. Putting large treats or pingpong balls inside will help make it more challenging.
