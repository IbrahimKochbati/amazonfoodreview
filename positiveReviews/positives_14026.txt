When I first tried this I was skeptical, I mean powdered anything doesn't sound too appealing. But I have to say I was pleasantly surprized by how much I really like this peanut butter. It doesn't have any "weird stuff" in it and it actually tastes like peanuts. I cant say it tastes exactly like jarred peanut butter but it is very good. At a difference of 45 calories vs 190 calories for same serving size...it's well worth it!
