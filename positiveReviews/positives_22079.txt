I have ordered four 5lb bags from this seller total, one on each occasion. I'd give a four and a half star review if I could, simply because the second bag of peas had quite a few hard peas inside. The other 3 bags have been consistently excellent! Unlike a few other  ands I've tried, they taste very fresh, and very well seasoned. I will be purchasing more from this seller in the future, but I am always looking for new  ands (that are comparatively priced) to try. If you have any you recommend, leave a link in the comments! A++ seller and A+ product.
