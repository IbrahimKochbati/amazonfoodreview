The name of this flavor sounds fantastic, and I wondered why they didn't include them in their multi flavor assortment. Then I tasted them. These chips are terrible, there is no parmesan flavor to speak of, and they somehow messed up the garlic as well. Avoid these and the also no incuded assortment flavor of "jalapeno". Very disappointed.          The cheddar, vinegar & salt and peppered flavors are FANTASTIC!
