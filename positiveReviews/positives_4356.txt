I love these so much I'd give them a 10 star.  I love them so much I have an Amazon subscription so they get mailed to me regularly.  I discovered them at Henry's but they're the only cracker on the shelf that are always sold out so when I saw the 10 pack here I was so happy.          I eat them as a  ead substitute with everything!  Can't go wrong with the calories and they don't have a strong flavor to mask the food so really they can be eaten however way you like.  Endless possibilities ...
