I like low acid coffees for the reduced bitterness, as I dont general have acid induced stomach problems. This coffee was very smooth and had little to no bitter taste   great features of a dark roast.  However, the flavor was not as deep or rich as I would expect from a gourmet French roast. It was pleasant, but I prefer a slightly more robust, complex flavor in a dark roast.
