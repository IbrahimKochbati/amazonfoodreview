This is, by far, the best  ead mix I've had, and I've tried quite a few. I have found pre baked  eads that are better than this, but they are few and far between, and I find that this mix is actually better than many of the frozen  eads out there. Try adding herbs and spices to the mix (rosemary and a little extra olive oil is really good, or Italian herbs) or any flavor you like, it's a great base. It also makes great pizza dough, though it's a bit hard to work with in terms of texture. I definitely recommend this mix, it's tasty, has a great texture, and pretty easy to make, all in all.
