"It tastes better than it looks" was the first thing I said the a skeptical co worker looking at my peanut satay as it came out of the microwave.  Unfortunately, it's as fattening as it looks, so I likely won't be purchasing it often.  I could see this mixing with chicken or beef and tasting even better though!
