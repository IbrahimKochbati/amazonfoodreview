So, I have never been moved to write a negative review for Amazon but felt forced to with this waste of money and time...Having been a person who has had vivid dreams in the past and keeps a daily dream journal, I was very excited to receive this herb after all that I have read. The first night, I filled 3 gel capsules with the tincture and went to bed and felt NO EFFECTS WHATSOEVER!  If anything, I remembered less dreams than I usually do on any given night and had more disturbed sleep.  I had read another review about this herb requiring more of it to perhaps experience lucid dreaming... Emboldened by the fact that I wasn't allergic to it, I measured out 20ml and this time drank an over the counter sleep drink that contained melatonin with it and went to bed after 45 minutes... Nothing. Again. Waking up in the middle of the night over and over again with no dream recall which is LESS than my day to day.          So, I figured that maybe it has a reverse tolerance...So the third night, I took 30ml on a mostly empty stomach...By now, the taste didn't bother me as I have been used to tinctures before and this is by far not the worst. I had noticed some muscle soreness the nights before and started to get some of this this night as well...Still, no dream recall; and this coming from someone who recalls a dream daily.  Some sleep disturbance but not tired because of it...So much for third time's the charm...          I waited for a few days and figured one last go around; a fourth time...I had dreams that I recalled on the days without it in between the third time and the fourth time...I tried 30ml again and on mostly an empty stomach...Not only no dream recall but woke up earlier than I normally do...I don't feel overly tired from waking but certainly no dream recall, much less any lucid dreaming...          This may work for some folks, but at price over $30, with no return policy and the bottle more than half gone, I am disappointed thoroughly. BUYER BEWARE!
