#1  The shipping is more than the item.          #2  I just received this "orgeat".  Orgeat is an almond infused sugar syrup.  The Fee Brother's "Orgeat" is corn syrup, artificial flavors and preservatives.  Not surprisingly, it had a bland flavor.          #3  Good cocktails are made from good mixers.  This is not a good mixer.
