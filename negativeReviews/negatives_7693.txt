Could the sauce use a little help? Sure.  I added roasted onions.          I roasted some chicken tenders on the George Foreman Grill , added some onion and grilled then...then served with a little of the Walden Farms Calorie free Thick N Spicy BBQ. tasty...and I licked the sauce with my fingers...(he he).          This is not "thick". If you want THICK. ..roast & then puree some onions, green pepper, garlic, and even lettuce in the blender...VOILA. That thickens "spagetti" sauce or whatever (if you are on the HCG diet).          I bet a little of the sauce would make a nice marinade.          IF you are NOT on the HCG diet..then try something with more calories.          But if you want zero calories and like HOT Tangy & sweet..this Walden farms can't be beat.          IT is fantastic for what it is...          I downgraded to three stars due to their refund policy... and it is  just OK.          UPDATE: KEEP YOUR RECEIPT.     The product is guaranteed...but the process to get a refund is onerous (in my opinion).          "I am sorry that you were not satisfied with our Mayo.
