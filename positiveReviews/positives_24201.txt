I just started using this about 2 months ago and I love it!  It has really transformed my baked chicken from so so to a well seasoned, tasty dish.  When I first tried it on fish, I used too much, not realizing the sodium content.  Next time, I just adjusted accordingly, added a pat of butter and ended up with delicious tilapia.  I recommend it as a staple to your spice cabinet.
