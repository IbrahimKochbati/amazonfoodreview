My kids just absolutely LOVE these Buddy Fruits. They are easy to take along, don't bust open in the school bags.  They are nourishing and healthy but also fun and a cool snack.  They also don't make a mess with the lid and the thick pouch.  Great product!  Wish more stores would sell them in single packs and in boxes.  We also buy some of the other flavors they come in.
