I love Amy's because you can actually pronounce all the ingredients she uses  no chemicals, no preservatives, nothing you need a chemistry degree to decipher  and she makes pretty tasty food.  Normally, I'm not a big fan of canned soups, but the Alphabet Soup is an exception.  It's a rich tomatoey  oth with a few vegetables and pasta alphabets.  I like soup without a lot of "clutter," so to speak.  My sole complaint is that the alphabet noodles are a bit mushy, but then what do you expect in a canned soup?  Still, if you're looking for something to warm you on a chilly or rainy day, Amy's Fat Free Alphabet Soup fits the bill.
