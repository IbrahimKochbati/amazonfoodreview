Kellogg's Raisin Bran contains unlabeled genetically modified ingredients and Kellogg doesn't want you to know this. They contributed $632,500 to a propaganda campaign in California to try to trick people into voting against Prop. 37, which would require that genetically engineered foods be labeled. Raisin Bran contains GMO Bt corn and GMO sugar derived from GMO sugar beet. Both were developed and patented by chemical companies. GMO Bt corn is an EPA registered pesticide. It has been genetically engineered by forcing a foreign gene that makes its own pesticide into the plant DNA. Every cell of this plant is a pesticide factory. When corn worms bite into it, their stomachs explode. Both the sugar and the corn have foreign genes for herbicide resistance forced into their DNA. The plants are made to resist high levels of RoundUp. The active chemical ingredient in RoundUp, a chemical called glyphosate, has been linked to birth defects, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer and more. These GMOs have been snuck into our food supply without telling us. 50 countries around the world require that GMOs be labeled (including all of Europe, China, Russia, Japan, Australia, Brazil and India). In the US there is currently NO labeling law. The FDA does NOT require long term, peer reviewed studies to determine if GMOs are really safe. They let the chemical companies that patent these "foods" decide. How can this be when the FDA is there to protect us? WRONG. Just google Michael Taylor, Food Safety Czar and you'll see that he's setting food policy. When it suits him, he uses the revolving door to go back and forth between the FDA and the largest chemical company that is patenting and trying to monopolize our food supply.  Should people be eating this stuff? I wouldn't feed it to my pets. My family is boycotting ALL Kellogg's products.
