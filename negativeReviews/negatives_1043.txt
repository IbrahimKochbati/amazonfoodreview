Not much of a decaf drinker (unless I am craving a cup late night for some reason). I have to say, this coffee tasted average at best. I am a WAWA coffee fan, and coming from them to this.. well it missed the mark. I gave some to my mother in law and she seemed happy with it, so 3 stars in that respect. I might try mixing it with my non decaf coffee to see how it tastes, but I am not holding my  eath. If the price was a few $$ cheaper, definitely would bump it up a star.
