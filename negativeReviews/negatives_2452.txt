I ordered this product   Lowry's Pork Rind   and received it promptly   within two days.  I have not been able to pop one bag!  They all stay flat   nothing works.  My microwave is not the problem as I cook lots of other things in it.  Looks to me that the product is not longer any good, by the comments.  They may have started out great, but it NO LONGER IS WORTH BUYING!
