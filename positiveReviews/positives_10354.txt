To those who believe these Onion Rings doesn't have enough 'FLAVOR'; that flavor is what we call sodium.     Want to eat 20 bag of high sodium funyuns? Be my guest. In my opinion, these  ing the subtle balance between     highly saturated flavor with 150% dosage of sodium in one bag vs more decent amount of sodium with just enough flavor     to taste it. Yes,  inging the health factor in the chips section is hypocritical but in the end everything counts right?          Bottom line is, you will like these alot! Give it a try and you will more or less love them!
