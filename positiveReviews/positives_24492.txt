Why don't more places sell this product?  I have a hard time finding it.  This stuff is DA BOMB!!!!  White sugar is no good for diabetics and that stuff they have for diabetics is nasty.A few kernels of this in your tea or coffee makes all the difference in the world.  I love it so I bought a case.  Very happy.  The price is reasonable too.
