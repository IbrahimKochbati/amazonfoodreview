I'm constantly looking for healthy dog treats that are not crazy expensive.  These are one of the better deals I could find when considering cost ounce.  My Lab absolutely loves them and they are good for him too.  The treats are soft and moist, which is a plus for my dog.  They could easily be  oken into smaller pieces, but I generally just give my dog a whole one when he does something good.  I wouldn't keep them in my pocket because they do smell a bit.  It's not an overly offensive smell, but strong enough that you don't want to carry it around with you all day.          I definitely recommend these for all dogs.
