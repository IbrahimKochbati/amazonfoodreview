This is really the next best thing to homemade pasta; especially Artichoke pasta which is very expensive to make. This is also a much healthier pasta than the average with 28g protein per half pound box. It's just amazing the flavor in this dish   when served simply with olive oil and garlic you can really get the flavor of an artichoke with the contrast of bitter taste and sweet aftertaste. Likewise it stands up to a full red or white sauce also.          1 disclaimer: by no fault of the pasta manufacturer Amazon once sent me a box of pasta that had passed it's expiration date so just make sure to check the lot date on the side of the box and the end of all the individual packets.
