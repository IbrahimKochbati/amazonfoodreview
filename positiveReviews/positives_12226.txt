Green Mountain's Nantucket blend is a great cup of coffee for almost any occasion. It can be your morning coffee, your afternoon wake up, or even your after dinner  ew. It has a medium body with a smooth flavor. I don't care for dark roasts but I also wanted something that packed more of a punch than a light roast; the Nantucket blend definitely fits the bill.          My only complaint about this coffee is that it does have a stronger aftertaste than I would like. I enjoy drinking the coffee but I am sometimes left with a bitter taste in my mouth.
