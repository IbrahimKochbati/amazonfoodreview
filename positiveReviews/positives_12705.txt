We tried the tea hot and really liked the taste.     So we tried it as iced tea and it comes out great in the iced tea maker using 3 bags per pitcher.     My previous favorite was Stash peach black tea and I usually don't like the peach teas that are not from black tea.     Stash is still a close 2nd.
