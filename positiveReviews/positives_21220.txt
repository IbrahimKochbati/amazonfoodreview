I have been using store bought yogurt to make my yogurt. However I have found that Casei Bifidus Acidophilus Probiotic Yogurt is so much better than the store bought variety. The flavor is purely delightful. I like to eat it as soon as it is cooled off. My yogurt is now much thicker and tastier than it was with the store bought yogurt. There is another benefit. I have been trying to regulate my digestive system......have had a problem for years. I have taken probiotic supplements with absolutely no success. My system now is perfect.....thanks to the Probiotic Yogurt Starter.
