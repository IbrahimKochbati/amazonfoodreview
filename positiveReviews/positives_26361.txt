These chews have been a staple for us for about 8 years.  Our Tibetan Terrier would be miserable without them.  He gets one each evening and it is ceremonial.  When this ultimate treat is given, he takes it and goes off racing around the house.  Still doing it at the ripe age of 12! His enthusiasm hasn't diminished even one bit in 8 years   its amazing.  I have often wondered what the heck they have in these chews   but I am just glad to see him sooooo happy each evening when he receives it.          Oh....I almost forgot....the other tangible thing is that his doggy  eath is decent and his teeth are in very good health   so I guess the enzymatic nature of the chews is working!
