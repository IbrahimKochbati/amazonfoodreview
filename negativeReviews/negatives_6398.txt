UPDATED REVIEW (10 7 2012):  I am disappointed to see that Merrick increased the price of this food 50%!  The 8 pound bag used to be $8.69, but is now $16.00 and some change.  Whole Earth Farms is supposed to be an affordable way for responsible pet owners to feed their pets Merrick quality, but it seems Merrick has decided to up the ante based on this food's popularity.  I'm very disappointed by the decision and may have to switch back to my previous  and.          ORIGINAL REVIEW:  After deciding to switch from Nutro Max to Merrick Whole Earth Farms Adult Dry Dog Food, my dog literally does circles when it's time to eat.  The food is loaded with good stuff for my dog and it even smells better than our previous  and.  It obviously tastes better, too, because my dog just can't contain himself when it's time to eat.  His coat is shinier and seems really healthy, and on a semi gross note, but important one, his stools have been much smaller; that tells me his body is absorbing more of the nutrition in this food than the last one.  I actually ended up reducing his food portion because he was gaining a little weight.  That's always a sign of a good dog food...the ability to feed less and the dog still receive great nutrition; that tells me there are much fewer fillers in this food than most.  I recommend you try it.
