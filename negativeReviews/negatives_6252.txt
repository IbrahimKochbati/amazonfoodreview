I do like this better than the Earth's Best Oatmeal cereal (made my baby constipated). However, I will not continue to buy this product. THIS IS COMPLETELY MY FAULT FOR NOT DOING MORE RESEARCH. The company claims that none of the DHA used in their products was produced using the "hexane method". However, the company that produces Life's DHA, claims that they only use the hexane method, because it is the only FDA approved method. I tried questioning both Happybaby, as well as Martek (makes Life's DHA), but didn't get a response from either company. If you are wondering what's so bad about Life's DHA, and the Hexane method... Google: Hexane method Life's DHA.          I have the grain blender for my Vitamix, so I will make my daughter's cereal that way from now on.
