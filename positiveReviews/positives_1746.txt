I have two terrier mixes and they love this product. I mix it with their dry grain free dog food and they just gobble it up like no tomorrow. I am happy that Amazon has this product on Subscribe and Save. It's one less thing to worry about since I know it's going to arrive every two months.          When I know I'm going to be out of the house for a long time, I take this product and smear it inside a Kong toy. Oh Em Gee. Talk about keeping these ADD pups occupied for a period of time. :)          Like the other buyer said, you occassionally see a piece of carrot or potato here and there.  I like looking at the ingredients on this product. There's no added water, mechanically separated meat or other by product. Good job!
