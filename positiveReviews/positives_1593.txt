This was the best pancake waffle mix ever! Wonderful for  eakfast or dinner. It was a great price and worth it! My husband and boys kept complimenting the waffles I made and ate them fast  I could hardly keep up. Definitely recommend Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse pancake and waffle mix! You do have to add a few ingredients, but it is well worth the effort.
