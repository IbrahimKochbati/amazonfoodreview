For price alone this is a good deal. I picked this up for $13, and considering these things normally retail individually in gift shops for $4 $5 each. So just that alone was pretty nice. The other cool thing was just the fact that it contained more than the Neapolitan ice cream. I've never actually seen the chocolate chip, or the ice cream sandwich for sale anywhere else.          Neapolitan: If you've ever had astronaut icecream before I'm sure this is the one you've had. It's a bar segmented into chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. It has a texture comparable to a lucky charms marshmallow. It's very light, and almost chalk like in texture. Hold it in your mouth for a moment and it will start to melt. This is where you'll really get the true flavor of the product. Once it starts melting it tastes exactly like the flavor of icecream you're eating.     I give it a 4 5 stars. It's pretty good, and a great treat for anyone who has never had it before.          Chocolate with Chocolate chips: This is just one big block of the chocolate ice cream from the Neapolitan bar. The main difference being that is it filled with chocolate chips. There's not much to say about this one that would differ from the Neapolitan. The texture, and flavor is all the same, and the chocolate chips don't taste any different than normal chocolate chips do.     I give it a 5 5 stars. This one is my favorite mainly because I just happen to love chocolate.          Ice cream sandwich: This one was my least favorite of the bunch. I just am not too fond of ice cream sandwiches in the first place, and this really does taste like an ice cream sandwich. The chocolate sandwich part takes a big longer to get soft than the ice cream itself does, so you're likely to end up with a piece of the chocolate  eading in your mouth with no ice cream.     3 5 stars. I just don't like the chocolate  eading that much, and I felt like that was mainly what I was eating with this one.          Chocolate space stick: If you've ever had a slim fast bar, or most any other chocolate protein bar you'll already know what this is like. It's pretty much identical to a slim fast bar. It's very chewy, chocolaty, and it'll stick to your teeth. It's pretty good, but it's not something I'd want to eat all the time.     4 5 stars. If you're the kind of person that hates eating things that get stuck to your gums, and between your teeth I'd stay away from this.          Peanut butter space stick: This one is the sister bar to the chocolate space stick. I'm not sure if I like it quiet as much. It seems to mostly be a slab of peanut butter coated in chocolate. The closest thing I can think of to describe it would be if you've ever had those reese's peanut butter cups that come out around easter, the ones shaped like eggs. That's pretty close to what this is like. Very dense low quality candy bar peanut butter. It was easily my least favorite of the box. I wouldn't say I hated it, but I certainly didn't like it, and if I were given the choice I would never purchase it on it's own.     2 5 stars. It just tasted like it was of a lower quality than the rest of the snacks. I'm sure it was packed with protein, but I bought these for novelty snacking reasons, not a long space voyage.
