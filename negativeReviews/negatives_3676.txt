I love walnuts so I thought I would save some money and buy them here in bulk. But what an unpleasant surprise. These were horribly stale and had a very distinctive bad bad bad BAD taste. I had been told that Emerald nuts were very good and maybe I just got a bad batch(of 6 canisters?? unlikely). But I will definitely never buy these again nor will I ever recommend them to anyone.
