This rice is very delicious, I have grown to love it and indeed use it as my go to side dish when preparing a meal. Its easy and it tastes great every time. I was purchasing this at my local grocery store fairly regularly, at a cost of $10.00 per 20 ounce jar. Amazon is selling you 4 28 ounce jars at a mere $28.00, that's nearly half the cost I was paying. As usual: I LOVE AMAZON!
