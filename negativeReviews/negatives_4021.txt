I bought the six pack case and after baking the first two boxes I am confident that I won't be purchasing this again. If you are looking for chocolate decadence, you won't find it here. The next box I will try with regular oil not melted butter margarine as directed. Maybe then I'll get that chewy, gooey richness that this products claims. There is a strange aftertaste, not one that I wish to linger. Betty Crocker G F  ownie mix is by far a better tasting  ownie and less expensive. My vote is G F with Betty C!
