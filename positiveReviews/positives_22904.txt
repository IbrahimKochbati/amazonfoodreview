Every day, whatever the season, I have to have my pot of Plantation Mint tea.  Finding it had become a problem, though.  The one store that sells it for $2.19 a box seldom has it on the shelf, and the other store that carries it regularly sells it for $2.99 a box!  Living in a rural area (a national forest, actually) a long ways from the nearest large town that has more than the two groceries in the closest small town, I've had to depend on just these two stores, getting frustrated with either not finding the tea or paying an exorbitant price.  BUT, now that I've found it here and can have it delivered at regular intervals, no shipping charges, and at a savings over the store prices, I'm ecstatic.  No more running from store to store and hoping, no more getting strange looks when I stand in the coffee tea aisle and cuss because the shelf is empty, no more wondering what I'm going to drink to feel good when the Bigelow box is empty.  My favorite tea now comes right to my mailbox, reasonably priced and automatically...like magic!  Life is good!
