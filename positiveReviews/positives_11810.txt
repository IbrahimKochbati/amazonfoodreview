If you want an easy way to make great tasting  own gravy this is it.  You can make any amount you want, just put three teaspoons of granules in a one cup measuring jug and fill with hot water and stir, stir, stir. It will thicken by itself and be delicious.  Once you get used to it you can make small amounts, say for one person just by judging the amount of granules as you stir hot water in.  I can't say enough good things about Bisto, all my American friends love it too.
