I received this as a gift for Mother's Day. Had been looking at them but hadn't decided to purchase yet. I highly recommend this coffee maker. You can do two sizes and with the assortment of different K cups available you could make a different type of coffee everyday. It is faster than I could have expected and the coffee is very good too. It was the perfect gift and I will enjoy it for years to come I am sure.
