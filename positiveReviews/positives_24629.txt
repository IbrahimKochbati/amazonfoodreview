Libby's Pumpkin filling was not available in our area (maryland) and through a search Amazon.com helped us by suggesting a replacement of "Farmer's Market Foods" canned pumpkin.......          One might ask why is pumpkin so important...We have a rescue pet dog since nov 2009 that has a tablespoon of pumpkin mixed in with his dry food and it provides regularity for him.......He is neither constipated or has dyeria.......          Thank you          Roger Evans
