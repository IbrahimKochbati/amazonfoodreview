I am a non coffee drinker who orders coffee for the office.  In the past   I haven't gotten too much feedback on which coffess are good not good, etc  and they all taste the same to me ick, so I look around for different things I think the guys might like.  Surpriseingly enough not only did several of the guys tell me they love this stuff they even asked for more of this flavor.  It must be pretty good!
