So far I've had no problems ordering this product and receiving it as promised. I am a Nantucket lover and occasionally will buy a specialty seasonal flavor on the side.Green Mountain is extremely expensive at most local stores! I've been buying bulk online for years. (I'm a coffee holic) I suggest buying trying a sample at your local store. (some even will let you  ew a free cup!) Then, you can decide where your taste takes you! Happy sipping!
