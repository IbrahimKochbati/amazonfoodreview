This flour is great.  I have used it to make whole wheat  ead, whole wheat tortillas, whole wheat sour dough pancakes, and whole wheat cinnamon rolls.  The texture is fabulous and it is a joy to work with.  I have mixed it by hand and also with a kitchen aid mixer.  It also makes me happy to know that I am providing healthy  ead products for my family.  For where we live, the price is perfect too as I can buy this floor on Amazon with free shipping cheaper than I can buy non organic flour from our local store... we live in a very small community.  We are getting ready to start in on our second 25 pound bag.
