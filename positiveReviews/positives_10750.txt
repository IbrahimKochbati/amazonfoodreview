My terrier mutt Ray loves these.  I haven't tasted them myself so I can't comment on the taste.  They are very hard which Ray loves.  My only complaint is that I wish they were either smaller or scored so I could  eak them in half.  They are too hard and thick to  eak in my hand...          I love that these do not smell and seem just as good to ray when I have left the bag open... he doesn't complain of them being stale.
