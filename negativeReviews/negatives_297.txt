This product, described as organic raw cacao powder from Peru, is clearly inferior to all other raw cacao powder I have had.  The taste of this product is definitely not as good    this product has a bitter, muddy, thin taste as compared to the fuller, richer taste of the real thing from other vendors.  As soon as I tasted this product, which is destined for the trash bag, I understood why it was cheaper than organic cacao from other vendors    it is nowhere near as good.  Spend a few dollars more and get the real thing.
