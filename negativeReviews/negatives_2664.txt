I bought the top sirloin hoping to finally get a "good" steak at home.     The first ones we cooked....could hardly cut with a steak knife.     The second time we tried them, I tenderized for quite some time.     They were more edible that way, but still nothing better than I could have bought at the local grocery store.          Except for the packaging, there is nothing good I can say about these steaks.     If you figure the price per pound, these steaks should cut with a butter knife.          Will never buy again.
