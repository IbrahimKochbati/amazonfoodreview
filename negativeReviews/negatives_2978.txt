I liked just about all the Capri Suns up until a few years ago. For some odd reason (possibly because tons of people in the U.S. have a mild to severe problem with being overweight) they decided it was a good idea to subtract most of the sugar in these drinks and leave us with a near flavorless, almost diet like drink to suit the kids better. Was this a good idea? Maybe health wise yes, but not if you actually want to enjoy one of these. What the hell happened? These drinks used to be good! Now all I can say is that I will only reach into the fridge for one of these when there is nothing but water and cranberry juice available! They taste nearly as bad as the new and "improved" "flavor sucked dry" Huggie drinks. Yuck! Absolutely dreadful.          2 (deserved) stars.
