I have to admit I was a bit disappointed in this cookie  the marketing promises whole grain Quaker Oats, plenty of fiber, and "natural" chocolate and almond flavor. Plus it comes from the good folks at Quaker Oats. And yes, whole grain oat flour is listed first among the ingredients, and yes, each cookie contains 4 grams of dietary fiber (16% of the RDA). The taste, however (and let's be honest, here  why else does one eat a cookie?), leaves much to be desired. It's superior to run of the mill hard baked chocolate chip cookies, but that's not really saying much. As soft baked cookies go, this one is just mediocre. The chocolate flavor is not especially rich, the almond flavor is so subtle that it's almost undetectable, and the cookie's overall texture and flavor are decidedly bland. If I'm going to eat 180 calories worth of cookie, I'm going to opt for a much tastier indulgence than this.
