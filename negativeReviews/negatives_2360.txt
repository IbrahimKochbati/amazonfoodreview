Only one store in my area, Sprouts, sells wheatgrass in their produce section. Whole Foods sells it, but it is a goodly distance from my house so I only get wheatgrass from them once in a great while. I have a bunny who enjoys wheatgrass as a treat, so I go to Sprouts to get it for her, but wanted to grow my own since it is expensive and requires frequent shopping trips. So I bought these kits and decided to grow it myself. First I have to say I was impressed at how quickly they shipped my order. So I planted the seeds on Friday and by Sunday night, I had wheatgrass sprouts like crazy. The instructions are clear and easy to follow, and deliver abundant grass as promised.          I have to say, though, that the grass doesn't look at all like the wheatgrass in stores. The blades are way taller (8 inches) and about twice the thickness of the wheatgrass I am used to buying for my bunny. I took pictures but discovered that my camera's memory card doesn't fit this new computer, so I can't show prospective buyers a picture of it. Rats. Since bunnies have sensitive digestive systems and you have to be careful what you feed them, I don't feel safe feeding this grass to her. I can't return it because I aready cracked open the kit and grew grass from one of the three seed kits. The grass is probably fne, but as a bunny owner, I want other bunny owners to know that this grass isn't like the wheatgrass in stores, jut so they aren't surprised and disappointed like I was.
