My son whom is 7, loves his gumball machine.  We purchased the Gumball refills for him because he was out.  We always have a ton of friends over, so we go through them quick.  The gumballs seem a little stale, when you bite into them they crumble.  Adults may not love them, but kids do!  We will purchase more, when he runs out!
