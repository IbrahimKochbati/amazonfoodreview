I bought this because the ingredients seem to be ok but for some reason it made my dogs have to go outside at least 3 times each night, overnight for the 2 weeks we gave this to them.  We changed back to Origen, a food they do well on and the middle of the night bathroom trips stopped in 2 days. Also, my older dog tends to get really "diggy" when she is eating something not good for her and with this food she was constantly digging at the couch!  I have no idea what is wrong with this food, none of the ingredients stand out to me as being the cause but something in it really messed my puggies up!
