What can i say, I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it, and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets. I am also a big fan of Stash products, or rather of all the other stash products I have tried.     I purchased a case of all 4 varieties,  (when i say i drink iced tea, i am not kidding) and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my 16 ounces water bottle.     I finally found that i needed to dissolve 2 packets in a small bit of hot water first (if not the tea clumped on me), and than add a packet of sweetener before adding the rest of the water just to make these palatable.     Over all I am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other  ands that are out on the market.
