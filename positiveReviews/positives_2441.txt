I am so happy that Amazon got these back in so I could order my second case. I don't eat wheat, it packs the pounds on me around my middle. Most  eads have wheat or if they are gluten free, they cost way too much.          I have eaten all kinds of rice cakes. I have found that most will  eak apart if you're spreading a nut butter on them. Not these! Also there are generally 13 rice cakes in a pkg of round regular rice cakes... this package of rice cakes has 27 pieces in each bag. Also, it's much like consuming a slice of  ead without the crusts and they are nice and thin so you don't eat too much of a good thing.          Try these if you're dissatisfied with regular rice cakes or if you must have gluten free  ead!! I don't believe you will be sorry and Amazon's price is so good and FREE shipping... though the box is sort of big, it's pretty light and stores easily away. I live alone and I'm on my next to last pkg from my first case and they are not at all stale. I stored them in my cool dark garage in their original cardboard box.          Also they are made in Belgium if that helps anyone. The packaging is air tight and they come 12 pkgs in a box and are in the perfect sized box, and mine arrived without a sign of any damage and I have yet to find even a single cracked rice cake! They are rather neutral in their taste... I make a special butter spread that I like on them real well. You take equal parts of room temperature butter, olive oil and water and blend ingredients until smooth. You can refrigerate this, it sets up but doesn't get hard so it is always spreadable and tastes really good! I use organic butter, olive oil and filtered water, but you don't have. This spread is so good and I believe it's better for you than straight butter.          Also, I only use one cake to make a single sided sandwich, as with any rice cake using two as you would two pieces of  ead just doesn't seem to work as well. But a single sided sandwhich with these rice cakes is very enjoyable!          Hope this helps you decide to try them. Everyone I've given some to, have had only good comments about them.
