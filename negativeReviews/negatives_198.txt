I liked getting this one for my twin 10 month olds because it has such interesting ingredients, particularly the zucchini and the garbanzo beans.  I like the fact that it's vegetarian yet I believe it has a complete protein since it also has  own rice.  This list of ingredients looks excellent and it's a green color naturally.          The babies liked it.  They have liked everything that has carrots.          I have the subscription for this one as I really like the ingredients and the fact that I'm giving the babies food that is naturally green.          Ingredients per the label: Water, organic corn, organic zucchini, organic green beans, organic  own rice, organic carrots, organic garbanzo beans, organic canola oil.          This has 70 calories, 8% protein, 40% vitamin A, 10% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 2% iron.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.
