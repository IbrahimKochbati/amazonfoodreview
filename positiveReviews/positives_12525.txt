My wife likes her coffee really weak and finding that in a K cup has been a tough job. I like stronger coffees than the Breakfast Blend but I also enjoy this. It's still too strong for my wife but it's as close as I've been able to find to satisfy her taste (she adds water to every cup no matter which setting it's  ewed on). I've been unable to find a "lighter" K cup so we've been drinking this blend for years now. If anyone knows of a "weaker" K cup coffee, let me know!
