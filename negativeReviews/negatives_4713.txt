My kitty loves tuna and dry cat food.  I've never tried to give her soft food until this.  She didn't eat it until it was in her dish for most of the day when she had eaten her regular dry food.     It looks like it would be good.  It looks like pieces of fish, but for some reason this didn't excite her as much as tuna.     I'm getting a new kitty soon, and I'll update it when I try to give new kitty this food.     Edit: New kitty likes it fine.  This isn't her favorite choice.  She likes tuna, chicken, and beef all better than this.  Unlike the other cat, she likes this more than dry food   about as much as she likes the Iams wet food I also feed her.
