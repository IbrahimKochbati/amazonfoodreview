Taylors of Harrogate Irish Breakfast Tea is a true quality blend of this type.  We have drunk Irish  eakfast tea for many years, and this is an excellent blend, especially for a bag (which makes it easier).  Other  ands we've tried in stores are weak imitations of the type because they tend to cut the blend with cheaper black tea in order to make a higher profit.  ToH doesn't do that and the rich flavor speaks for itself.  This tea is a definite flavorful replacement for coffee... just add cream or evaporated milk... mmmmmm...          Do the math on this 6 box x 50 bag count and compare with what you see in stores.  Especially if Amazon offers free shipping, SNAP it up.
