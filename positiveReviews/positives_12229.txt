I've tried several varieties of coffees for my Keurig Coffee maker and the     Green Mountain Nantucket Blend has emerged as my Number 1 favorite for my     first cup of coffee in the morning and an occasional "pick me up" cup in     the afternoons.  Not too strong, not too weak  a nice, medium blend with a     wonderful aroma.  Buying it in the 50 count size gives me a better "per cup" price     and allows me to order less often.
