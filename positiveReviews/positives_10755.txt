My 13 yr old lab developed gastro issues over the last 6 months, so I've had to become very picky about his treats. I received a bag of Newman's Own through amazon's vine review program. The ingredient list is tummy friendly and my dog loves them. When I tested putting this treat next to another that he likes, he went for the Newman's first. A true lab, he is not picky about what he eats, but he will gobble up things he prefers 1st when there is a choice. Since the item is offered by amazon through its subscription program, I decided to take the plunge. 34 cents an ounce for 6 bags of a high quality treat delivered conveniently each month to my home is a good deal for me.
