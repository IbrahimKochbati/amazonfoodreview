I wasn't expecting much, having found a box of these for $2 at Big Lots , but they're actually quite tasty. Most of the boxes were pretty dented, so I suspect that's why they ended up at the close outs store). I thought I'd have them all to myself, but it turns out all three picky eaters like them, too  probably due to the pizza like flavor with the crunchy cracker appeal that kids can't resist.
