My children can not have wheat, gluten, soy, dairy, eggs...  It is very hard to find products that they can have.  We use this for pancakes, pizza crust, cakes.  Basically we just use it in place of flour.  It is so nice to be able to buy Bisquick in the grocery stores now; however it is much cheaper through Amazon!
