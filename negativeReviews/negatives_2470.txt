Being a gluten sensitive individual, I was lured into a false sense of security when I read the simple ingredients on this Amazon info page.          Because I didn't first do my homework, and read the labels before I began consuming these, I ended up having a massive asthma attack.  Just wanted to let everyone who has these sensitivities allergies to avoid this product.
