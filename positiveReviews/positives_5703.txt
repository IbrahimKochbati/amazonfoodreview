Grandpa Po's Originals scored big on our party's fun factor. These half baked nuggets of organic popcorn blended with dry roasted soybeans were a surprise hit with both kids and adults. Our young nibblers approached this snack with a quizzical, "what is this? caution. But once tasted, the bowl was quickly emptied and our partygoers were eager for a refill. Grandpa Po's come in Slightly Unsalted and Slightly Spicy.
