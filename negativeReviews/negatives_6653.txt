I wasted a little over $15.00 because the reviews were so good.     This has no taste cold or hot. It states to use 16oz of cold water.     Well, I used just a cup and it didn't work out for me.     I tried adding more packets and it helped but very little.     I am an avid tea and coffee drinker and can only resolve     that the other reviewers have never had a good strong cup     of green tea  , or I am missing something here.     I do not recommend this tea.
