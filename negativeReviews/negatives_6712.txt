its sugar. sugar is sugar. and sugar will forever be yummy. however you dont get what you see. i gave it three stars because you dont get that pink box like how its displayed in the picture. instead i got a cardboard box full of the pixie stix all scattered and not secured at all. there is no internal packaging. you open the box to find the stix in there, but thats all. i guess its no biggie but its annoying.
