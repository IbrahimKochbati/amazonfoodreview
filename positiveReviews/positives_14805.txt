I bought this at a local store on clearance and was really pleased with the quality. It is far better than the tea bag varieties I have tried such as Twinings and Stash  ands. I'd place it slightly higher than the Twinings Aromatics, which is a better quality than the yellow boxed Earl Grey version.          I've bought a high grade Rishi Earl Grey at a higher price from a tea store, but this organic version is as good and at a lower price.
