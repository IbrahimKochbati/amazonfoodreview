While my family really enjoyed the country ham, they were not fans of the bacon at all. It had a little bit of hard rubbery texture, even though it was cooked in the oven. We prefer a thick cut bacon that reminds you more of "meat". This cooked up more like a jerky. The flavor of the bacon wasn't there either, just didn't seem "right".     Thought the price was a little high for what you got as well.
