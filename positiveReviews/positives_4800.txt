LOVE these chips.  I think there are so many GF baked goods (be they less than exciting rice chips, heavy  eads, grainy cakes, etc.) that just fall short of taste and texture.  I am knocked out by how crisp and tasty these are!  They are much like a popular orange triangular chip but better, even "fresher" tasting.  If I don't take a serving and put the bag away first, I'm very likely to mow through it in one sitting.  Products like these make me feel like I'm not sacrificing anything at all for the sake of going GF.
