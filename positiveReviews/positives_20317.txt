I am very passionate about food quality and wary of what I feed my baby.  This is a great basic product that I am using to start my baby on solids.  I like that it is  own rice and that it is fortified.  I have mixed it with  eastmilk as well as to thicken food purees.          To be honest I have not done a lot of price comparison but I feel that at a little over $3 per 7 oz cans (with subscribe and save I got 6 7 oz cans for $20), there are plenty of frivolous things I have spent $3 on so I think it's worth it to feed my baby a high quality food.          I was running low and had forgotten to order a can, but even without expediting shipping, my order came faster than anticipated.  It was shipped via USPS.
