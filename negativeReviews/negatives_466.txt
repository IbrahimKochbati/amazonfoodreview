We definately got a nice assortment of K Cups but were really looking forward to trying the Peach tea which was not included in our shipment. I overlooked the line stating some flavors may be substituted but one of our substitutions was a hot coffee mix of Eggnog, French Toast, and a third winter type flavor. Slightly misleading from what is pictured.
