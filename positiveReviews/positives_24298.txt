This is a wonderful powdered chai mix.  It is mixed with hot water, can be iced, can have milk added.  A local shop here served it and sold it for home use.  I really like it.          That said, I subtracted a star because of the "99% caffeine free" statement in the product listing.  While it may be technically correct (I'm not sure how I'd calculate whether the can contains only 1% caffeine, and whether by weight or volume), I think it is misleading.  I use caffeinated products, but seek decaf for my son.  I do not feel that 65mg of caffeine per serving counts as "caffeine free," and would suggest that this part of the product description should be amended or removed.          Meanwhile, I see that at least one other reviewer has noted the caffeine issue, and I will call attention to it, as well.  Still great tasting chai mix, would just like to see an improved product description rather than a misleading statement and a legal disclaimer.
