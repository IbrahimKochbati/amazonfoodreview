One of the best decisions I have made was to match my Keurig coffee maker with Emeril's Big Easy Bold K Cups. Keurig makes sure each cup of coffee is hot, fresh and eliminates the odor of coffee siting in a pot for hours. Big Easy Bold is the best tasting coffee I have ever had. Bye Bye Starbucks   no need to run out when you need a coffee fix! The new packaging reduces waste, and with Amazon's subscription service I can always have inventory at home.
