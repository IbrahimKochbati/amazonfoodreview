I ordered this Pack of 20 1 pound full leaf tea which looked like a great deal. Well....          1st, it's not 20lbs of tea, I received only 1          2nd, it's not high quality full leaf tea, but rather the ground tea leaves you'd expect from lipton          Strangely enough, I ordered the non decaf regular version and it arrived as full leaf tea and doesn't taste half bad. If someone receives something different than I or rather if someone receives what was advertised, I'd like to know about it. Maybe I'll try again.
