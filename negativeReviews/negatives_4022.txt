This  ownie mix came to us in a gift box and we loved them so we bought a case.  Since then we have problems with them.  Are they supposed to be oily and come out bubbly and liquidy? i don't remember them doing that the first time. It's like they separate  baked on the edges and goo in the middle  and it doesn't matter how long they are baked.  We still eat them but i wonder if there's something wrong or if we're doing something wrong?!!
