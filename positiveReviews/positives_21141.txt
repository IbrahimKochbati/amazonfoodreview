No caffeine and tasted wonderful. Glad I got the 12 pack of this. I take 2 cups of water to a boil and remove from heat. Drop in 5 tea bags and steep for 5 minutes (don't let it go much beyond 5 minutes, or it can get bitter). I drop that in a 2 QT pitcher and fill up the rest with filtered tap water and let sit in the fridge for a couple hours before drinking.          I am sure there are better ways of  ewing iced tea out of this, but it was the first thing I tried and it worked out quite well for me and continued to do it. I will definitely purchase this over and over again. Much healthier and better than drinking sugary soft drinks with empty calories and yes, even fruit juices (even the natural kinds without artificial chemicals and corn syrup, etc) as those are just high quantities of sugar regardless.
