I have a rescued greyhound and he was doing great on Canidae until we got our last order just last month.  Now he's a mess digestively.  I'm on an email discussion group for greyhounds and have seen lots of complaints as well as confirmation that the formula has changed.  Definitely not working for my dog anymore.  Also be aware that these used to be 40 lb. bags for the same price they now sell a 35 lb. bag for.  I know everyone's hurting financially, but I think in this case the dogs got sold down the river for a few bucks.  Disappointing.
