I enjoy coffee, but frequently have to limit consumption due to acid reflux and other issues, that can be exasperated by coffee, particularly on an empty stomach.          To test this product, I waited for a Saturday morning,  ewed the coffee normally and chose not to eat, while then following up with some outdoor activity.          In instances where I previously would have suffered acid burning in my throat, I felt none of that, after drinking two cups of coffee.          The taste is not the strongest French roast I have ever had, but the trade off, particularly for someone who has to speak a lot in the morning, and hence avoid coffee when I speak, is well worth it.
