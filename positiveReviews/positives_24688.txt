Good product, nicer than the big name  and we had been buying. Better flavor and texture than Libby's. The price is great; I set up the subscribe and save option for delivery every couple of months so I can have pumpkin year round. Why do I use so much pumpkin? In addition to making delicious soup and baked goods, it is a great food suppliment for my dog. It helps keep his system moving right along, if you get my drift. It also works for cats. Most dogs and cat love pumpkin almost as much as I do.
