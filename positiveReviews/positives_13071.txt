My best friend (from Canada) turned me on to these; addictive isn't a strong enough word. REAL cheese, not sprayed on dehydrated cheese flavored chemicals! When you first open the bag, the powerful cheese aroma hits you right where you live.          One word of warning: bookmark this store, because once you have Hawkin's Cheesies you will never want to sully your tastebuds with any other cheese snack. Ever.
