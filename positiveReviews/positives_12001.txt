I have ordered these a number of times for my terrier mix (part pit bull?)   usually a little cheaper than in store.  I initially used them for training only and then found that with the larger pieces I could jam a piece or two inside a chew toy, hide a treat toy or hollow bone that has already stood Travis' test and this can give my dog hours of enjoyment.          My issue with them   and why I went with a 4 instead of a 5   is the size of the pieces are inconsistent.  My first couple times there was a good mix of some larger squares   3 4"   1" cubes and smaller that I use for training bits.  My last order was completely smaller pieces   making it difficult to use it inside a toy  bone as they come out too easily. Play time no longer lasts as long.          I am hopeful that my next order in line with the others and have a mix. I would have given it a 5 prior to my last order.          As a training treat these are AMAZING.
