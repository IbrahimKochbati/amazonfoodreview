This reminded me how much I enjoy Indian pickle.  It was basically good pickle.     Problems:     * it seemed a bit stale     * it was fairly pricey     But it did remind me that I really like Indian pickle, and told me that I could get it on the internet, so I poked around a bit and found a place (ishopindia.com) in another suburb of Chicago which was closer (Skokie; I live in Oak Park) so instead of it coming from Texas, it came from Skokie (less than an hour's drive away).  That solved the staleness problem.  Their prices seemed to be about 2 3 of Amazon's prices.  I thank Amazon for reminding me that I should look.
