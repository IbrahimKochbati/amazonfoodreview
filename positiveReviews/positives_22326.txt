QUALITY     In my opinion, having used a dozen or so  ands of olive oil, Colavita is simply the best reasonably priced olive oil which is widely available.  I've been using Colavita for several years now, and have never been dissappointed.  Colavita is excellent quality, dependable, and reasonably priced   the perfect combination for a daily general purpose olive oil.          FLAVOR     Although not an "olive oil gourmand", I'd describe Colavita as "rich and smooth".  Connoisseurs probably have other silly terms for the flavor, such as "nutty" or "fruity" (but a "civilian" would never describe the flavor as nutty or fruity). It is not  spicy like Whole Foods 360, and NOT strongly "olive oily" (i.e., "herby").  Colavita is an evoo ("extra virgin olive oil"   to us non olive oil snobs), which means "first pressing".  Most olive oil nuts consider the words "extra virgin" to be sacred.  Practically speaking though, the mere label "extra virgin" is not a guarantee of quality   most grocery store  ands (evoo or not) are harsh and bitter, but some are good cooking oils.          PREMIUM OILS     Botique premium oils are are as variable year to year as wines, comparably expensive, and have to be bought the way you buy fine wine (that is, ideally at tastings, where you confirm the quality and flavor before purchase).  Some are genuinely (as in NOT gourmet speak) buttery and nutty   great for dipping.  Some taste like the fragrance of flowers   great for salads.  Never cook premium olive oil   use it for dipping or drizzling, or on delicate salads.  Colavita is a very good general purpose oil, perhaps the best common grocery store olive oil, but is not quite a premium oil.          Although heresy (comparable to suggesting fruit wines to a wine connoisseur) there are inexpensive alternatives to premium botique olive oils, including pumpkinseed, almond, sesame, and walnut oil.  I particularly love pumpkinseed oil as a dipping oil (by itself, no vinegar, and with a little salt). The following are examples   I can't vouch for the specific  ands as they are different from what I use.     "
