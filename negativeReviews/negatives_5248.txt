I've always loved this cereal ever since I was a little kid ,I'm originally from Mexico, of course back there is called "Choco Krispis" but is the same stuff. I've purchased 2 packages of 4 boxes each about two weeks ago ,the first boxes were great and I have no complaints ..but when I opened the second 4 boxes the cereal was either over baked or under baked ,because it had some really hard cereal pieces and when chewing it felt like I was eating hard candy with milk ,I thought that maybe it was just one box that it was like that but no ,I checked all 4 boxes and they were all the same ,not what I expected at all,I'm disappointed at Amazon for not having a higher product quality check and offering defective boxes like that and since I can't return groceries ..makes it a very frustrating experience ,that's why I'm giving it 3 out of 5 stars ,the cereal itself is my favorite ..it has the greatest chocolate flavor and a unique taste that in my opinion has no match ,this is a great product indeed ,though I would not recommend you to purchase it from Amazon ,better buy it at your local grocer to avoid frustrations.
