I picked this up at the store after reading mixed reviews online. I am on a diet that is low calorie, sugars, and carbs; I've been missing a lot of foods as per usual so I was hoping that this would mix it up. Well it did.          When you pick it up you can see that it is runny, which is a con in my book, but the flavors are pretty spot on. I added some extra seasoning like cayenne, paprika, and a pinch of salt. Possibly cooking it down would make it a bit thicker.          If you're expecting some awesome hearty bbq sauce, this isn't it, but its a good substitute. I will definitely be finishing the bottle and would buy again.  (The 4 5 is for runny factor)
