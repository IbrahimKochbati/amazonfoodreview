I bought the Whirley Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper several months ago, which (of course) the Wabash Valley popcorn came recommended (same company). I thought...what the heck; I've always wondered how "gourmet" popcorn differed from Orville or other everyday popcorn  ands.          Let me tell you...IT IS WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY! I can really taste the difference in quality. AND, "normal" popcorn just doesn't taste right when you make it in the Whirley Pop.          This popcorn is so tender and tasty. It was a little weird to see and eat at first because it's about half the size of regular popcorn. But, I believe this characteristic is essential in helping the seasonings completely coat the corn.          My favorite prep methods include using the Whirley Pop and Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (see my review for that for more details!) I add a little peanut oil, sea salt, black pepper, and a good amount of Vegaline Garlic Mist Cooking & Seasoning Spray. YUMMY!!!!          I've tried the other Amish Country popcorn, and they're all good. This is my favorite, though!
