I'd been hearing about the product for a couple of years and finally ordered some, but inadvertantly ordered lite! Yuk! After much anticipation, waiting for it's arrival, and then finally opening up the (cheap plastic) jar and putting some on a piece of  ead to try it with.... it tasted like wall spackle. Ok, I've never eaten wall spackle, but I'm pretty sure it tastes like "lite" baconnaise. Then I realized after careful examination of the label that I ordered the "lite." Dammit.          Determined to finally taste the ORIGINAL baconnaise, I went back on amazon and (very carefully) ordered the ORIGINAL baconnaise. And it's pretty dang good! I'll leave a review of the original, non lite product there.
