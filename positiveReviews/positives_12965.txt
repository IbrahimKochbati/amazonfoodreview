This is a great alternative to regular soda in the sense that aside from being carbonated just like a regular soda, it contains vitamins and no added sugar making it really a healthy alternative. Its sparkling appearance also adds to the attraction to this juice. The only downside I can think of for this is it is expensive. Other than that its very satisfying.
