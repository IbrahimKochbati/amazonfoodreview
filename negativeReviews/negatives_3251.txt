I found this at Wholefoods for $2.50 and bought it mainly because of the cute bottle design. I had tried acai berry drinks before and aren't crazy about their flavor, and this doesn't change that. This product has a taste that reminds me of Chinese medicine. White tea is already by itself very subtle. The combination of white tea, lemonade, and acai juice just doesn't work together. I also found it overly sweetened (28g sugar in the bottle). One bottle is 140 calories.          In addition to white tea, acai juice, cane sugar and lemon juice, it has soy lecithin. It's a common food additive, but I'm not sure what it's doing in a tea. Maybe to keep the lemon and acai mixture from separating out. That's nothing a good shaking can't fix.          The bottle is too nice to throw out, so I'll reuse it for my own beverages. (The cap screws on.) Brewed and bottled in Chicago. I won't be buying this flavor again.
