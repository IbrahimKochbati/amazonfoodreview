I have had Green Mountain coffee before, but had not tried the French Roast.  I am just realizing that there is a taste difference between different manufacturers, even with the same types of roasts.  The Green Mountain French Roast has the flavor I like and was expecting.  The price was reasonable and my order shipped quickly.  My only disappointment was in the shipping packaging.  I knew that I was ordering 2 boxes of K cups but was surprised to see how big the shipping box was.  There was room for 3 boxes, with the extra space filled with bubble wrap, which seems wasteful to me.  But on the whole, I am very happy with my coffee!
