Note: I bought these from a grocery store, so i don't think i had the problem of a 'stale' product as in the other reviewers.  However, i bought both an unseasoned  and (a CVS  and) and this Emerald seasoned  and and i vastly prefer the seaseoned version of these walnuts.  It's unbelievably tasty.          I'm going to try to order from amazon soon and hopefully i won't have a problem with staleness, but my initial reaction is: WOW, these taste great!
