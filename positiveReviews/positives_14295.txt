This product has made my life easier and more delicious.  I use the salts in my everyday life and for entertaining.  I get home after a long day and rub the Himalayan Pink Island on some fish and have great flavor on a healthy dish.  When I am being more indulgent, the smokehouse blend is perfect for  isket.  The porcini mushroom makes a great risotto and I save a fortune not having to buy porcini mushrooms.  I highly suggest visiting the Artistic Taste website and checking out the all recipes.  It is my go to place whenever I am entertaining.  I am sure to make great food with relative ease.  Also, the well designed jars look great in my kitchen.
