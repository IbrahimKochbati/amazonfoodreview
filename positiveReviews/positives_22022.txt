We like this popcorn for its taste and texture.  Although it is black, it pops up whiter than other popcorns, and is more crispy IMO.  We used to buy it in stores, traveling about 15 miles to the nearest one.  However, it costs much less at Amazon.com when you buy two cases   no shipping and no taxes. The bags are always consistent in popping quality: 2min., 10 sec. in a 1200 watt microwave. It is a good product for a small gift on birthdays, when visiting friends for dinner and at Christmas time.
