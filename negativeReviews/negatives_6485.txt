I guess it's my fault for ordering chocolate online... but these arrived completely melted. I am not sure whether I can return this or not but I was really looking forward to eating these. I ate samples at the Sony Ericcson Open this year. And watching the Roger Federer airport commercial on TV made me really want to get these. I got so excited when I got the package only to be super disappointed :(
