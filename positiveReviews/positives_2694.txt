In my trip through the health area of my local food market I stumbled upon Enjoy Life Boom Choco Boom Dark Chocolate Bar. I just can't resist trying things such as this. Into the cart it went. It's rather good. It says it's dairy, nut and soy free, and I'll take their word. The question is taste. Well, it's a good tasting bar. I have a couple others that I would regard higher. but this one is quite good. It's a bit high in calories (170 per bar) but has no cholesterol or sodium. Not bad. I'll pick it up again.
