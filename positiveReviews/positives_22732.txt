Not the healthiest thing on the menu but when you want the taste of Movie Theater popcorn there is really no other substitute.  The portion, flavor and salt are all perfectly measured so we have never needed to add anything else (except maybe a dash of tobasco or some cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit.          I would highly recommend this product but wished it was a little cheaper (hence 4 instead of 5 stars).  I guess you can't have everything.
