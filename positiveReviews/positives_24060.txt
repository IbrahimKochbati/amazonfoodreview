I've never been a big fan on chips. When it comes to snack foods, I'm more of a pretzel guy, or maybe something cheesy. Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.          If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these "chips" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.          While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's "good" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.          I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG. Rice flour, dry sweet potatoes, and tapioca are the biggest ingredients. As far as processed foods go, not bad at all.          I will definitely buy these again.
