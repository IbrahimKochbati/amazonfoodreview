I have seen delivery truck for this drink driving around town.  On the side they had "Natures Sport's Drink".  I never thought of Coconut Water as a sports drink but I thought I would give it a try.          The package the drink comes in is "Tetra Pak"; which is a fancy way of saying juice box.  Because this seems very similar to the way I used to drink my Hi C Juice when I was in grade school.  No straw here though, just a foil covered hole in which you peel off the foil to drink.          Ingredients are as follows: Natural coconut water, pink guava puree, cane juice, vitamin c, and natural fruit flavor.  Not too bad, sounds good, you have to add vitamin c to give the drink a little zing otherwise it comes off too bland, and they at least admit to adding "natural fruit flavor" which if you read the FDA website doesn't really have to be that natural at all.  But all in all the ingredients list looks good.  One container is 8.5 ounces, one serving, and you have 78 calories, no fat, 128mg of sodium, 302mg potassium, 18.8g of carbs, with .5g of that being fiber and 16.6g being sugar.  You also get 0.8g of protein and the added vitamin c gives 183% of your daily value.  Let's move on to taste:          Serve cold, shake well, and open...tastes like coconut and guava.  I guess I should have expected that.  It feels fairly light on the tongue, not that oily mouth coating feel you get from regular coconut water.  O.N.E. claims they get the water form green coconuts before the meat forms, so that accounts for the lack of oils and fats.  So you get nice tropical flavor.  Like a really watered down pina colada.  Sadly I am unable to perform blood work and tell you if my electrolytes are being replenished but I am enjoying the flavor.  So if coconut and guava appeal to you, and you would like those flavors in a natural sports drink, this may be the drink for you.
