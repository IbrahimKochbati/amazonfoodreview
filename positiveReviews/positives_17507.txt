My doctor recommended the normal 5 hour energy several years ago when I was having mid day slumps and required naps. It worked great while I needed it. Now I have switched to this. I add it to a smoothies about half an hour before I hit the gym and my workouts are great, I have tremendous stamina and do interval treadmill training with no problem, even if it's been a long day.          The great thing about it is that you don't really know it's working. After I finish at the gym I realize how much energy i had, but when I am actually doing the routines I don't really notice the energy, it simply happens.          I recommend this for anyone, particularly if you don't like, want and can't ingest caffeine.          One caution, it has a citrus flavor that, even in a smoothie with mixed berry yogurt, cranberry juice, banana and mixed frozen berries comes through. It's a good taste, unless you don't like citrus.
