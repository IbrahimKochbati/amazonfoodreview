My toy poodle was quite interested in this toy, but it proved difficult for him to play with.  He has a small mouth and it was hard for him to pick up the yellow pieces to get at the treats.  It was also hard for him to rotate it on its base to expose the other treats.  I think this is a fine toy for bigger dogs, but Liam is only 7.7 lbs.  My husband also didn't like all the noise.
