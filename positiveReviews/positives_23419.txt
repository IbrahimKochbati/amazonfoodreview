I first tried this chutney about 10 years ago out on the west coast, then found a source in Philadelphia....I hear it's available in NYC (where I live) but I haven't been able to find it!     It is a fantastic addition to any store bought sandwich, or a home made one as well, that adds a zip and freshness to an otherwise bland and ho hum meal. I love this stuff. Great on salmon, eggs, cold roast chicken   so glad to have found it again.
