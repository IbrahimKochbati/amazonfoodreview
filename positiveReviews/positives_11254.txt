Another home run from the people at Pamela's Bakery!  My family loves this  ownie mix.  I make these  ownies at least once a week.  I've made them for dessert and no one guesses that they're gluten free.  We make the "fudgy" version and it really is just too good for words.  Nice chocolate chunks, also!     Another great value with Amazon's "subscribe & save".  This product is approaching $5 per bag at the foodstore.  Now, we can have  ownies as much as we want!  Y U M!!!!
