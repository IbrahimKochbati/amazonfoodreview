I must say that I was sceptical about the possibility of a low acid coffee.  I love my coffee.  But after two or three cups, I start to get heartburn, so I've had to learn to limit myself to one cup, two at most.  Well, it's time to rethink my limitations.  The smell of the Puroast dark french roast was wonderful when I opened the package, but that doesn't always equal good flavor.  I used a regular drip coffee machine, and invited a fellow coffee lover with a serious acid reflux condition to share the pot.  We were both floored!  The flavor was excellent, deep, rich and, well, just like a good pot of regular old acidic coffee.  I take mine with cream and sweetener, my friend drinks his black and we both were extremely pleased.  Pleased enough that we split the whole pot between the two of us with no subsequent heartburn. I can say with certainty that without being told in advance you would never know it was low acid.  Unless you struggle with heartburn, and then you'll know after the fact.  My friend was so impressed I had to give him the empty package so he could go online and order it for himself.  Two mugs up!
