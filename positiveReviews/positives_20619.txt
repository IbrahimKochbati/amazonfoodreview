I recently discovered Darn Good Chili Mix at a local store.  It is tasty just using the directions on the bag, which is just the chili mix, water, and a can of tomato paste.  It makes roughly 8 cups of chili, which is enough for the 3 adults in our family.  If you're following the new 2011 Weight Watchers plan, 1 cup of chili is 2 points when made according to those directions.          However, I like it better as a base for my own chili.  Here is how I make it:          2 lbs of ground sirloin (90% lean)     1 lbs of ground venison (or substitute more ground beef)     1 large sweet onion, chopped     2 large green peppers, chopped     5 or 6 heaping teaspoons of fresh minced garlic (I use the jarred garlic that needs refrigerated)          Toss all of the above in a large skillet, and cook over medium heat until meat is done.  Drain any grease and sit aside.          In a large pot, add 14 cups of water.  Bring to a boil.          Whisk in 2 bags of Darn Good Chili Mix, and 2 cans of tomato paste.  Simmer for 15 minutes, stirring every couple of minutes.          After 15 minutes, add:     15 oz can dark red kidney beans, drained and rinsed     15 oz can light red kidney beans, drained and rinsed     28 oz can of diced tomatos     28 oz can of Rotel tomatoes     Meat mixture          Stir together and continue to simmer for another 20 minutes, stirring every couple of minutes.          This makes a lot of chili.  My 8 1 2 quart pot was nearly full.  I always make extra chili so I can freeze part of it for a future meal.
