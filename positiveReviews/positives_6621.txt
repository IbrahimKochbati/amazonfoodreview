I tried this coffee on a half dozen quests this weekend and they all loved it.  For those that like their coffee mild, I  ewed 7 oz cups.  For those of us that like it bold, I  ewed 5 oz cups.          As an earlier posted noted, it does have a slightly flavored quality to the taste that makes it stand out from other coffees.  The taste isn't obvious enough to turn off drinkers who want their coffee "regular and black" but strong enough to note for those of us that pay attention.          I plan on trying all of Wolfgang's line.  Wish he'd offer a variety pack.
