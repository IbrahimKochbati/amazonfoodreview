I bought this device and use a  and new sure 52 with it.          The noise and feedback I received with this device was horrible   I might have a bad unit.          When I called customer service, a real person answered right away and offered to expedite getting me a new unit. (Very cool and is why I gave them 3 stars for now)          I'll see how that process goes and update my review.
