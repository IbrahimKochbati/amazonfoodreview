These work fine. All I really wanted to try were the paper filters, the plastic is not environmentally friendly. I have a reusable Keurig filter but it is messy to clean after use. The paper filters work great in it & I can use my own coffee, which is not available through Keurig.  I've asked if the paper filters could be bought  separately but never got a response.
