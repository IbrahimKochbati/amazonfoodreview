This is a wonderful, versatile product for people who need to keep their carbs low, particularly diabetics who must restrict carbs but still want to eat well. It works in practically any recipe for Bisquick or other baking mix. The taste is just fine, a little more buttery than usual flour. My kids love it. It's extremely high in fiber, and getting kids to eat fiber, well, you know. So this has been a really excellent addition to our pantry. I hope they never stop making it!
