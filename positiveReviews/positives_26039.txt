I LOVE THESE! If you are someone who likes dried fruit but not all the crusty sugar thats on it you will love these. If you are someone who wants to eat dried fruit as a healthy snack instead of candied dried fruit, you will like these. You will not like these if you are expecting the traditional dried mangoes you buy everywhere else that have sugar corn syrup sucrose rice syrup etc. listed as one of the top ingredients. These are a great snack with only 2 servings and 110 calories per serving per bag so you cant go too overboard. I have shared these with my coworkers, some of which dont like fresh mangoes let alone dried ones, and they loved these.
