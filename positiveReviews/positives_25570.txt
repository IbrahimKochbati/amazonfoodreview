"To protect the integrity of our ingredients, we screen for foreign materials, pests, proper sizing per approved specifications and heavy metal, which must pass stringent EPA and FDA levels.

These quality control measures and records begin in our receiving department and end in our shipping department, with strict controls all along the way."
