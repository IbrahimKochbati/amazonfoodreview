I agree with the other reviewer   the new lower sugar formulation is awful ... it tastes like aspartame.  We're never buying this again, and I'm faced with a similar dilemma: this has been my favorite for years.          Note: Since writing this review, I have tried McCann's Maple & Brown Sugar oatmeal (available on Amazon), and it's great.  I highly recommend it as a substitute if you're equally unhappy with Quaker's reformulation (or don't want to waste your money trying it).
