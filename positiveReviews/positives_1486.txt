I was looking for a quality, low points (Weight Watchers (WW)), crunchy, salty snack.  I cannot stay on a diet if I feel deprived. WW's website had a coupon for these pricey chips.  Never had a "popped" chip before, so I gave it a whirl.          Wow, the best crunch and flavor of all reduced calorie chips I have ever tried.  Better than other  ands' popped chips I have tried since.  I need portion control help and these little bags for 3 points do it for me.  The variety pack helps to  eak up any monotony.  My favorite flavor is the BBQ.  I am not a vinegar kinda guy.  The Salt and Vinegar flavor tastes like feet to me.  Love the rest of the flavors.  I love salt, so the saltiness is just right for me.  Thank goodness my blood pressure is not an issue.  I need these snackies.          Lost 30 pounds so far in 3 months eating these.  Will probably buy them by the case in the Amazon auto order system to save on shipping.  I guess I plan on being a life long fan. ...until something better comes along.
