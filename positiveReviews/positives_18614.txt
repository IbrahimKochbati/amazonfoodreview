Plant shipped almost immediately, and arrived in excellent shape. (I was worried; a heavy frost hit while it was in transit, but it was glossy and happy right out of the box.) The pot was also labeled with clear growing instructions. Now it's up to me to baby the new arrival until she's old enough to make vanilla!
