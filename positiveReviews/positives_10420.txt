They replace the sodium chloride with potassium chloride, with is arguably healthier while still being salty tasting, however they replace the free form MSG with hydrolyzed soy and corn protein, which is arguably worse then MSG and certainly contains MSG. It's against government regulations to say something has NO MSG then have hydrolyzed proteins as ingredients, but if you can get by that, the stuff tastes great!
