I love the taste of maple syrup. Well, that's not quite true. I love the taste of maple, period. :D          I've been buying pure maple syrup for many, many years and was thrilled when I found out about Grade B syrup several years ago.          Contrary to most rating systems, with maple syrup, the higher the grade, the more intense the flavor. I've seen some say that this syrup tastes too much like molasses. That wasn't my experience at all. I did find that to be true the one time I bought Grade C..that was too strong for sure. I've purchased several gallons of maple syrup over the years. This  and was right up there with  ands that are much higher in price.          I also use this syrup for regular applications like pancakes and french toast. I enjoy the strong flavor and the fact that it's not watery like grade A syrup can be. It's a must for cooking. I make a maple walnut praline ice cream with it that is simply luscious. I've also used it to make maple  eads, cakes and candies.          A caveat: Please be sure to refrigerate the syrup after opening it. Mold can form in maple syrup if left at room temperature too long after opening (weeks, not hours). If you do forget and get mold, you can strain the syrup through cheesecloth and then boil it for 10 minutes or so, but it's better to avoid it altogether.          If you like Log Cabin, this may not be the sryup for you.
