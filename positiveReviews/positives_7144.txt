I've read so many reviews on the many  ands and varieties of K cups... coffee preferences are so subjective.  I did like the flavor of this coffee    bold but not bitter.  As to "strength" I wish that there was more coffee in each K cup... I am accustomed to Starbuck's strength, and I have to set my Keurig to medium cup size to get the strength I need.  This is not as cost effective as    say Jet Fuel (but I found Jet Fuel too bitter.)     If Wolfgang Puck would add more coffee to its K cups, this would be a perfect coffee for me.
