Been munching on these for now 10 or so years. Can't believe I didn't write a review earlier! Basically these are your healthier, organic alternative to regular popcorns. You might be surprised by its much firmer texture (than popcorn) at first, but go through a couple, and if you're like me, you'll appreciate the quality crunch and just the right balance of sea salt! I was hooked so fast, I was just chugging the ziplock bag into my mouth for a mouthful of tasty treat, and no, didn't need to reseal the pouch! The spicy version is just as good   it isn't that spicy (it's "slightly spicy") and highly addictive. Try both and you will not go back to those greasy popcorns! Yay for Grandpa Po's!
