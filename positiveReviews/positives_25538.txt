I think this is a very good deal for the price. You receive a really large bag of leaves, and they seem to be very good quality. I bought this product for its benefits in lowering high blood pressure, and my last test was normal. Not sure if it was the tea or a combination of natural remedies, but it can't have hurt. The tea itself is a little bitter if you're just drinking it by itself, so I use a sweetener and it ends up tasting quite good.
