Normally I don't use jam, the consistancy of jam usually seedy and chunky, too sweet for my taste.  The exception being huckelberry jam, from huckelberry haven.  The perfect balance of jelly & jam, the huckelberries are not overpoweringly sweet.  The only jam to use with peanut butter for a great tasting sandwitch.  Thank you huckelberry haven.
