After recently finding out my daughter has food allergies, I have been searching for foods that she will eat and love, especially  ead.  As a mother, I don't want her to feel deprived.  I made this  ead on the weekend and it was gone in 2 days.  It's wonderful!  In order to make the experience less traumatic we have removed all of the foods that she cannot eat from our household... wheat, dairy, & egg.  Pamela gives specific instructions for making this  ead dairy and egg free.  We all love it.  In fact my younger daughter (age 2) was extremely [read fit throwing] upset this morning that we were out of the  ead we made. We're instant fans.  Thanks Pamela!
