I bought the ICICLE because I have been doing a lot of hip hop vocals and I was using a Samson C01U and the thing with that Mic you can get close to studio but with so much work and you can always tell that you messed with it alot.          Well I always wanted to buy a expensive Mic but didnt want to spend $200 more on a USB Pre Amp so I see this on here the other day and went to Guitar Center and after deciding for a while I went with it. I also already had a MXL V 88 which is a pretty high end condenser mic, although now you can find it for cheap but original RSPV $700 and average selling price after it being out was $349 400. But I am very happy.          I use Reaper to record vocals with a ASIO driver (AND IT DOES WORK WITH MY ASIO DRIVER) someone put in their comment that it doesnt. For those of you that arnt familure with ASIO it is a driver program that runs and samples your audio going in, you basically use it with anything that is MIDI or MIDI MIC to USB. It makes your audio not lag and sound more professional. Also for the people that said the volume was too low, go into Sound in windows and turn the mic up a little, I keep mine on 5%. Also your recording program will let you turn up while your monitoring the record or after.          GO AHEAD AND BUY ONE!
