First off, I don't usual spend time to write product reviews, but I felt obligated to in this case. Despite the few negative reviews I had seen, and the low expectations that ensued, I found myself pretty pleasantly surprised when I received this gift basket earlier today.          The packaging itself is solid. You get a dark chocolate colored basket with just enough plastic wrapping to keep everything in pristine shape without being a hassle to open. There were no signs of re purposed Jello boxes    only a dense amount of straw lining the bottom to serve as a cushion. I thought it was a very nice touch.          Now for the part that actually matters: The candy. You get a pretty well organized assortment of chocolate themed products, varying from chocolate covered peanuts and raisins, to peanut butter cups and and marshmallow cups, and yes, there's even a few pieces of individually wrapped dark and milk chocolate for the diehard choco holic. This variation is well balanced so your tastebuds don't feel tired of any one particular confection.          Of course, a couple items featured in this basket probably do have their comparable counterparts in your local grocer. But that's beside the point. You'll be hard pressed to create anything of a similar caliber yourself in terms of presentation and overall packaging.          Executive summary: This basket was made by chocolate lovers, for chocolate lovers. I'd buy it again and most likely will when Christmas rolls around.
