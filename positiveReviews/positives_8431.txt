These inexpensive little rewards for dogs seem to be a good quality and very palatable.          I've had problems pleasing my dogs as far as tasty treats, some snacks are just completely ignored.          I've had no problem with my dog accepting these snacks and actually they consume it eagerly and quick, so it passes the taste test.          Sergean't's is an established and trusted name in pet care products and this is a fine product your dog will probably love.
