The first picture of this was very deceiving. The tree I was delivered was nothing like the first picture which greatly disappointing me but the thing that made me angry was the fact that the trunk of this small tree was slightly  oken. It may have been the way it was packaged because it was awkward to look at but I got to get it out without further damaging it. The shears I bought were the only thing that was just like the picture though and works like a charm. I just don't recommend buying this if you don't know what your getting yourself into.
