I am not a diehard tea drinker and am a diet coke junkie.  That said   I liked the idea of trying the health benefits of green tea and, lately, have found a hot cup of tea a great way to start end the day.          This tea is fruity and not bitter.  I add a packet of sweetner in the AM and it is perfect.  I highly recommend this one!!
