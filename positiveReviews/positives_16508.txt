Well, the ingredients list is a little questionable to me personally.     However, after comparing to most other  ands, such as Nylabone, Pegetables etc, they all seem the same.     This is economically priced so it does not  eak the bank.     My dog loves and goes crazy for it, and I haven't heard of any problems recalls with this product.          So overall, it's great I guess.
