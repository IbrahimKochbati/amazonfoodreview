... would taste pretty good, and not even out in the wilds of Katanga! I bought a case of Juanita's pozole (some pork, some chicken) to stash in my cellar as 'emergency rations' after the 1989 earthquake near San Francisco, and I finally opened a can of it at a campsite on Labor Day. Of course you can't just gobble it as it pours from the can; it needs the traditional fresh condiments: chopped onion, oregano (dried or fresh), chopped green chilis, red chili flakes, and lime juice. And then it's close to delicious. The can holds enough for two good portions.     This price is a few cents higher than what it costs in most ethnic corner groceries, and shipping makes it quite a lot higher. If there isn't an ethnic corner grocery that would carry such a product in your neighborhood, I have one piece of advice: Move!
