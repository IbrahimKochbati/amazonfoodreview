To be honest, I don't care if my food is organic and would just as soon die early as eat most health foods. But I do like oatmeal, and have enjoyed other Dr. McDougall's products, so I gave this a shot.          I wasn't disappointed. It tastes better than most other instant oatmeals. The fruit bits add plenty of sweetness and there are enough to get some in every bite. The portion size is substantial and has 300 calories for the whole cup which is not too much for  eakfast.          My only advisory is that if you do not like your oatmeal too "soupy" add less than the recommended amount of water.
