I bought one of these bones for my lab shepard mix, 65 pound dog, and she loved it.  I bought the first one from Petco and the large size was 8 dollars.  Amazon is over 50% cheaper and there is free shipping.  Before committing to 8 bones, you can do what I did and head on over to your local pet shop to see if they carry these bones and then see if your dog likes them.  It takes my lab about 1 hour to eat the whole bone.  I really like that it  eaks into small pieces which eliminates my worries about my dog choking on a big piece of bone.
