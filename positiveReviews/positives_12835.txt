I absolutely Love this drink. This is the best carbonated fruit drink I have ever tasted. This has a crisp, clean taste of fresh strawberry with just a hint of kiwi. This tastes just as you would expect a pure fruit juice to taste, except without the pulp and a carbonation that makes it fun for both kids and adults alike. I found a new fruit juice that I love and I'm making the switch to "Switch."
