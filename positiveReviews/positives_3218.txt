My husband is gluten intolerant and as with all gluten free products out there the results are not always the best.  He loves this product and since I only really make the pancakes I can't say how the other Bisquick recipes would turn out for any of you.  And yes he has this texture and taste thing with gluten free products as well...  gritty, sandy or off tasting.... etc. etc...  So I am happy he likes this one!  With gluten free products you really have to test them out one by one as some perform in the taste and texture area better than other blends.  My advice to anyone searching for gluten free products they want to try that it is best to buy them in the single packages, if possible.  I know on Amazon they sell them in bulk but if you find that you don't like it you are then stuck with alot of packages you no longer want!  Just a tip for all of you out there.  It may cost more for one package but the waste will be much less unless you donate them to the local food bank...  Good product and great results!  Thank you, Bisquick!
