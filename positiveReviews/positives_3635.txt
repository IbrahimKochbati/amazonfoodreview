I buy Newmans Own adult dog food for my two chihuahuas.  I've always fed them natural, human grade dog food, even though most  ands can be a bit pricey.  Like most pet parents, I try to do the best I can for my dogs which starts with feeding them right.  Most dog food can be disgusting and the practices behind it are disturbing.  Newmans Own is more affordable, and I feel good about the company's ethics and practices so it was worth a try.          My dogs love it so it was easy to switch from the other  and.  They gobble it up! I now have it on subscription so we don't run out.
