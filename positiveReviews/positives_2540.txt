I feel like I've tried every hot cocoa there is in the k cups.  While I do think this is the best hot cocoa so far, it still isn't great.  I'm not sure what it is, but all of the cocoa k cups seem to have a weird taste to them.  It's almost like there is artificial sweetener in them,, but I know there is not.     I set it on the smallest cup setting for cocoa.  This has more body to it than others.     I'm still waiting and hoping that Dunkin' Donuts will put out their hot cocoa in a k cup.  There really is nothing better than that.     If you want a k cup hot cocoa, I would def. recommend this over all the others.
