I think it's a fair to say that on at least the last 3 new year's days I have spent the entire day hungover, telling myself "I'm never drinking again." This year, I attended a giant party where I drank more than my body weight in booze THEN finished off a fifth of Jameson with 3 others...all in all, I drank for about 7 hours and was well on my way to a "Never drinking again.." kinda morning.  I managed one more shot (of Party Armor) before bed and woke up thinking "Did I even drink last night?".  Seriously, aside from a slight headache which I quickly got rid of with some excedrid, I felt amazing on New Year's day.  Dont drink and drive, but also dont drink without Party Armor.  (As a side note, they might not advertise this, but it gets rid of hangovers if you already have one, just drink it quickly and try your best to keep it down.) Awesome, awesome, product.
