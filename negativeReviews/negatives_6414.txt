This product gets 3 stars from the taste alone. Most protein shakes taste like chalk mixed with milk. But this one has a very good taste that makes you want to drink more of it. It is high in protein o it would be a great drink to have after a rigorous workout. The biggest downfall for the product is it has a lot of sugar in it. I try to avoid a lot of sugar so this wouldn't be the drink for me.
