Prior to ordering I misunderstood what truffle oil is... I warmly encourage potential buyers first to google "truffle oil"  you'll discover that there's no such thing. The "truffle essence" put in this and other truffle oils is a synthetic ingredient, whipped up in a lab, that mimics just one flavor of truffles. The aftertaste this (and any truffle oil) leaves is chemical. In order to make it work in a dish, you'll have cover it with garlic and other seasonings: basically, hide the flavor.          There are some oils available through Amazon in which actual truffles are infused, but the problem is that oil doesn't easily absorb real truffle essence, so the presence of authentic truffle flavor is very weak and nearly undetectable.          If you like this artificial flavor, then the price is right ($). But if you want real truffle flavor, get the real thing ($$$).
