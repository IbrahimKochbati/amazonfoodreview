YUMM!! And it's Lactose, Gluten and Soy Free* (*Save Soy Lecithin lecithinan, which it seems that many with soy allergies can tolerate)     Ingredients   per package (3 # bag)     Pure Hawaiian cane sugar, Premium Forestero cocoa, ground chocolate (sugar & Cocoa processed with alkali, unsweetened chocolate, soy lecithinan emulsifier, pure vanilla), spices, all natural flavors & salt     &     Although the tins come with the scoop (which holds about 2.5 3 T.), I get a better price buying the 3 Pound Bag and using a 2 T. coffee scoop. I found the secret to using this in a manner I can enjoy it, as I find the original instructions make it way too intense.  I only add 1 scoop (2T.) to a cup, then add enough hot water to fill the cup half full, stir, then top off with almond milk or coconut milk.  Yummm!!  And, being Diabetic, I get my daily cinnamon!             "
