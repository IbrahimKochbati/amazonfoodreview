It's hard to put a *star rating on this.  I like the crackers a whole lot and think they are super.  They are hard to find in our local stores and I use Amazon a lot for good pricing and hard to locate items.  However, this purchase experience was a little disappointing.  The crackers came quickly and in great shape...no  eakage and the price was fine.  But, when I opened the first box, I found they had weevils...not a huge infestation but still...once weevils get a foothold, it's all over but the shouting.  I suspect that these boxes have been stored in a southern location as we don't have weevils up here in the north.  Usually they come up in flour and flour products that originate down south.  I found them in southern biscuit flour that I bought at one of the discount grocery stores.  I pop the product in the freezer to kill the weevils and their eggs and then sieve them out...gross, but you can't save money if you toss everything that doesn't meet your approval.  Anyway, can't sieve crackers but I'm still tossing them into the freezer for good measure.  Don't want them to spread to any of my other pantry items.  This review is just a heads up to anyone buying these on Amazon.  Inspect them carefully, pop them in the freezer if in doubt, and enjoy.  The crackers get a 5 star rating; the purchase on Amazon gets a 3 star for warehouse storage.
