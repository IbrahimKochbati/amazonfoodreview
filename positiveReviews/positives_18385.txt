I love potato chips and when I go at it I always eat more than I should.  A whole bag of chips can be more than 1000 calories and 80 grams of fat.  Pop chips are a partial solution.  They are very tasty, crunchy and satisfy my chip urge.  A whole bag of chips (3 servings) is 360 calories and 12 grams of fat.  These chips are not fried but they taste very good.  Try em.
