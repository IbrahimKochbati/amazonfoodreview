I buy these from a different online retailer for my large (over 50lb) dogs. They absolutely love these bones! I feel that they last as long as (or maybe even longer) than the very large, long bones you can buy. I've noticed that my dogs lose interest in those types after they eat most of the end caps off. This is just one complete end, so it keeps them busy.          Cons:     This WILL leave grease marks on fa ics.     Lots of crumbs.     Sometimes smaller pieces can splinter off from the bone. If your dogs are not used to eating smaller pieces of bone then I would supervise.     Dogs WILL hoard these and fight over them! :)
