If anything can actually be better than food, this snack certainly fits the bill.  You gotta try them.  They're tasty, crunchy and just plan corney.  Like the "bottom of the pot" kernels we used to fight over as kids, these kernels fit the bill.  However, we no longer have to fight over them cause the bag is full of them!  Great job in creating these things.  Now excuse me as I nibble on some more.
