I love light crispy salty snacks, and Soy Crisps is the best one of those I've found.  At only 100 calories per serving 350 calories for the bag, you could literally eat the entire bag (which I do on a regular basis) and not feel bad about it.          There are several flavors but Deep Sea Salt is my favorite because it is subtle and just enhances the natural flavor of the rice and soy.          So delish!  Shipped fast with all crisps in tact.  Great purchase, re ordering.
