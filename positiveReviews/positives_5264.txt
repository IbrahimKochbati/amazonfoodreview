The Switch Orange Tangerine, 8.3 Ounce can packs a big punch in a teeny tiny can. Touted as a healthy alternative to soda, I couldn't help but taste the similarity between Switch and Coke's Fanta orange drink. The difference however is more than plain. Switch is supposedly 100% carbonated fruit juice with no added sugars. It actually has a pretty good taste    if it is all natural, then I think kids would love it. I liked the carbonation    it had tons of bubbles and a light airy feel to it. All in all, I would buy this product again.          Natalie S. for Amazon Vine
