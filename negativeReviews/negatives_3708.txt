Not a pudding by American standards.  But then again, the name itself is somewhat obscene by American standards.  I found this treat very very sweet, and it has been a long long time since I have seen  ead in a can. It tasted much better heating in the microwave and then pouring some cream or half and half on top.          I give this out as a gift for Christmas and birthdays, and almost everyone loves it!!!  But don't give it to anyone at work or where there is an HR department   I learned the hard way.
