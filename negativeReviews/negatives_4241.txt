What I like about wafers is the lightweight effect. Thought these would be similar to Manner wafers, with many exceedingly thin layers, however they are very different. The three wafers per piece are thick and crunchy rather than lightweight and paper thin. In addition, the filling is scant and dry. The wafers lose their crispness very quickly when exposed to air, so must be eaten immediately upon opening. Given that these wafers have ingredients similar to those of the Manner competitor, they are overpriced and inferior in taste and texture. Other household members don't like them either, so I will have to give them away. Will not buy again.
