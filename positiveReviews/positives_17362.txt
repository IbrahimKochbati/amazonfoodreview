What a difference this tea is from bagged teas, even the organic bags!  As mentioned by other reviewers, it is very GREEN.  The leaves, the tea... GREEN!  I wasn't expecting the natural sweetness to it, it's almost weird and grassy to me.  This probably means it's better and I just need to get used to it.  Heed the warnings to not steep too long   the bitterness makes it quite awful.  I was, however, able to save that first pot by diluting it and drinking it iced after adding sweetener and lemon.
