I loved this great purchase at less than ten bucks, and they're M&Ms!  What's to say about them?  If you haven't had them, go out and buy a pack, they're a fantastic candy!  I prefer the ones with almonds best, but considering how cheap the milk chocolate version was, I wasn't going to pass up a great deal like that!  Thanks Amazon, I will keep coming back!
