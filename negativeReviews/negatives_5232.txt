To be fair, I've only tried this as a sweetener for coffee.          I thought a toffee flavor would be a delightful addition to my coffee, so I picked this up. It has a distinct and unpleasant aftertaste  which is not unusual for artificial sweeteners.  This, however, is much stronger than other sweeteners.  I'm sticking with my Sweet 'n Low and shoving this in the back of the cupboard.          For the seller, though, I have nothing but good things to say.  Prompt shipping and no problems.
