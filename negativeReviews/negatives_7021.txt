The preceding reviewer gave this "chocolate" two stars.  I am not feeling nearly as generous.  I am thankful for two things: one, the retailer that I purchased this "chocolate" from has a generous return policy and two, I am not shy about returning "unused portions" when they fail to meet my expectations.  Yes, I returned the "chocolate" to the store with a bite missing and no one looked at me sideways; I strongly suspect that I wasn't the first customer to do so.  Incidentally, I tried the milk chocolate variety and this is supposed to be a review about the dark, but I can't imagine that it made any difference. For what it's worth I love Polish sausage, but chocolate?  Not so much...
