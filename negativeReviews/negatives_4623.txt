I got sent a holly bush instead of a Bonsai tree.Funny part of the receipt for the correct flora was attached inside. Slightly funnier, because it was Christmas morning. Then I saw that the plant was sealed and a paper that said refunds were void if it took it out and watered it. However, another piece of paper said, "If you don't water this immediately, it will die." SO, I just took the poor thing out and watered it. Now I have a 23 dollar potted plant of something that grows like weeds outside my window. Gee, thanks.
