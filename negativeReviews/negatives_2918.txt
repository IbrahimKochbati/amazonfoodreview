I wonder if I got a bad batch?  I go these with the "Gold Box" deal they have going.  Maybe they're not quite as fresh, been around in the warehouse too long or something?  Because these were not near as good as the other Virginia Peanuts I've had or ordered from Amazon in the past.  The "Royal Oak" in the blue can is what I got last time and they were much larger, not  oken, crunchier, and just better tasting.  Seemed silly to return 2 3 of the order, and they are not really awful, completly fine actually, but my expectations were for a premium product. Fairly decent peanut, but these are suposed to be the best.  They were not.  Going to order the Royal Oak next time.
