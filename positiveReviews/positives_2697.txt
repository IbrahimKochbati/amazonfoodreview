That is right, open the bag and just get your nose close and smell it. You know this is a quality product instantly. Some of the tastiest tea I have had and the Oolong and orange are a great mix. Even if you aren't a tea drinker at all, once you smell this tea you will want to try it. I am very glad I bought this product it is a favorite of mine.
