I bought this flour because I thought it would be low carb.  It is 43 net carbs per 2 oz serving.  This product this not suitable for diabetics or those on a low glycemic diet.  The first ingredient is white rice flour, coconut flour is the forth ingredient.  Also, to use this flour in gluten free recipes, you need xanthan gum.  All of this should have been in the product description.
