Delicious Taste & so.......Convenient!  I bought the 6 oz. popcorn packets,  just to "try it"  on my new popcorn machine.  Little did I know I would get hooked on the delicious movie theater taste, with none of the fat issues of other  ands!  There are a fair amount of unpopped kernels, but the volume and extraordinary flavor, allows the user to overlook that!  If you are a diehard popcorn lover who goes to the movies for the popcorn, you'll never have to leave home again!
