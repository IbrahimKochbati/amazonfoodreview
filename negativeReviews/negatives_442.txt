I have been using these treats for quite a while and both my dogs love them but both dogs are also way off their food and have been for quite some time and both have been acting kind of "off"...nothing major but just not exactly right. Well, I just happened to quit using these treats for a week or so and noticed both dogs came back to life and they're eating like crazy. I cannot for certain pin it on these treats but it's something to keep in mind if you are using them and your pet seems a little off kilter.
