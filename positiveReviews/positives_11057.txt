the creamers where delivered very quickly to my house. Although the only thing I would have a slight complaint is that a couple of the creamers where opened making the other creamer containers a bit sticky. All I had to do was put the containers in a big pot of warm water for a couple of minutes. I did this three times until the water looked clear. Other than this I would say it's a good product.
