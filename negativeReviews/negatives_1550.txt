I love juice and I love carbonated beverages, but it is difficult to see this product having a long retail life.          Essentially, this is a good drink that doesn't really do anything well.          It doesn't taste good enough to be a juice replacement  and is there really a need for a juice replacement?  It might have limited value in camping situations or during other times where small cans make better travelers.          It's not exactly a post workout recovery drink.  Juice would be better.  Minute Maid juice, for instance, has less sugar and carbohydrates, even though Switch doesn't add any sugar.  And there are plenty of other juices that have more nutrients, including Calcium and other vitamins and supplements, including potassium.  So, it's less healthy than most juices.          Switch isn't exactly a diet soda because of the natural sugar content comapared to zero sugar in diet drinks.          As a regular alternative to sugared soda, it tastes good, but there is nothing really to distinguish it from other fruit based sodas.  And, $22 a case, it's more than twice as expensive of sodas that come in bigger cans.          So, in the end, Switch is worth a try but likely not something you will habitually buy.
