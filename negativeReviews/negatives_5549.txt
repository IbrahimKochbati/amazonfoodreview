While I had not tried the pork variety of Shake N Bake in years, I wasn't really expecting anything too different from what I remembered. Therefore I was neither surprised nor disappointed when it was basically just as I had remembered.          For whatever reason, the pork variety of Shake and Bake seems to have very little taste other than mildly salty.  That is why we generally use the Chicken variety of Shake N Bake on both chicken and pork, even that we tend to blend and doctor with other coatings and herbs.          As it stands by itself it makes for a decent coating mix and if your pork is good and you like it crispy, this will do the job.
