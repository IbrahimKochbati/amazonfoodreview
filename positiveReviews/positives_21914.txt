I have a friend and antique shop owner who I normally visit weekly and like others I stop by even if I know I am not going to purchase a thing solely for this coffee. With the holidays coming around I became so busy I was unable to get my fix so I  oke down and bought a machine for my home that was approximately $230.00 here on Amazon. I am addicted to both the Breville machine and this amazing blended tea. It is not overly sweet or artificial tasting. It is the BEST!
