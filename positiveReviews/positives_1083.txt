I have tried various  ands of stevia, but I always come back to NuNaturals.  I buy the 12 ounce container because I use it to sweeten everything.  If you have a sweet tooth as I do but don't need the added pounds, then this is the ticket for you.  I drink a lot of tea, and this is my sweetener.  A lot of other stevia  ands leave a bitter after taste, but this is the best that I have found to resolve that problem.  Highly recommended.
