Overall, if you're looking for a low acid, "he man" coffee, then be SURE to grab this!  It's quite amazing the difference this low acid coffee can make to your stomach and I could even drink the entire pot of the stuff! Normally, I take coffee completely black, no additives whatsoever.  But, with this french roast, it's quite strong.  REALLY strong and definitely, less is better in the pot. If you're a fan of Starbuck's Verona coffee and have no trouble drinking that stuff black, this is your best bet for a low acid coffee.  Combined with cream and sugar, then no problem.          I tried this coffee just wondering if I could really tell the difference between regular and low acid coffee.  There IS a difference! The flavor is quite good but doesn't end smoothly like oh, say, Folger's might, but this is a gourmet coffee and will carry a stronger punch than a commercial coffee like Folger's will.  I plan on trying a different roast too since my tastes are more towards a full bodied coffee instead of the kind that tastes like it was made in Texas during the Wild West days!  This ends a bit rough, kinda like the Starbuck's Verona, not as smoothly as I would prefer.  I made it with bottled water, not tap, to get the full flavor and aroma, so keep that in mind when deciding on which flavor to choose.  I am going to continue to play with this flavor to see if I can get it to suit my tastes better.  If you try it and it's too strong, then I suggest you dump the pot onto your roses!  Makes them quite gorgeous, actually!          This is a great product, particularly if you're looking for the low acid variety.  I sincerely doubt you'll find a better low acid coffee out there.  But, if you're like me and prefer a more smooth, well rounded roast, then I suggest you try one of the other roasts.  Great product, highly recommend!
