i got a jar of this in a gift basket and wasnt sure what to do with it. I decided to try it on some crackers and it was delicious. Its sweet with a nice kick of jalapeno.Since I've had it on burgers, potatoes and vegetables. I quickly went online to order more and found they were sold out, so i signed up here on amazon to be notified when more come in.
