My wife lived in London for three years and developed a variety of British tastes. One such item was for rice pudding or creamed rice. Not too long ago I spotted Am osia Creamed rice (in 15 ounce cans) on the shelves of my local Fresh and Easy Store (a British company). Well, I just had to try it.          Creamed rice is not bad. It's rather bland for my tastes and perhaps it's meant to go with certain types of food.. It's low in fat and sodium and not particularly high in calories, so I don't feel guilty at all.I prefer it chilled. It's smooth and creamy and I'd judge it to be a good product. But, it might take me a while to develop a taste for it. Right for the moment, I find it overly bland.          Gary Peterson
