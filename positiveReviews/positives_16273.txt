I buy these directly from amazon because they're always cheaper than I can find them at local pet stores. My dog goes absolutely crazy for the Greenies Lite. I'd originally started him off on the normal greenies but switched to the Lite about a year ago and he loves these just as much. I recently had to get the normal greenies because they were out of Lite and my dog wouldn't go near them; thank goodness I purchased the normal ones at a place where they took returns.          I give my guy a few throughout the day as treats so I just bend and twist them in half; otherwise my dachshund pekingese mix will demand more and at roughly $30 a box, I'd go  oke if I gave him as many as he could eat. As long as the box is fresh, the greenies will be nice and bendable... I have purchased a box on a few occasions where the greenies were rock hard.          My only complaint is the price. I just wish they were a tad lower. Even still, I will keep buying these as they're my dog's fave treats.
