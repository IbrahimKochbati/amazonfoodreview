I purchased the largest Tug a Jug for my 2 dogs, both around 60 pounds.  They love it.  It didn't take long to figure out how to get the treats out, but it still takes work to actually get them all out.  With previous toys, once the puzzle is solved, you go from 30 minutes of doggie entertainment to 2 minutes.  I love that this toy continues to keep them occupied.  While it IS durable, I don't leave it out when it's not play time.
