I'll keep it  ief.  First, I usually don't like whole grain, multi grain, or whole wheat pancake mixes.  I bought this mix to put in a  eakfast gift basket I was putting together and since I had to buy a 3 pack I decided to keep a box for myself.  Christmas morning when the cakes were on the griddle the whole downstairs was filled with the gentle aroma of butter milk and honey.  The texture is a little more than a regular pancake but in  a good way.  And the flavor.........oh my they're good.  Little butter, little Highland Sugarworks maple syrup and I was in heaven. The only negative I would point out is that if you use even parts mix and water it makes the batter a wee bit too thin for me.  No biggie, I just reduced the water by about 1 4 and all was well.
