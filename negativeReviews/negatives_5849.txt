I love creme  ulee. If I were to drown in a vat of it, I think that'd be a pretty good way to go. So, naturally, when I see something that is flavored like creme  ulee but without the calories, I get excited.          I got excited about this coffee.          Now, it's good coffee, as far as coffee goes. Nothing wrong with that. But if someone served me this and asked me to identify the flavor, creme  ulee wouldn't even make it on the list. It's almost got a bitter taste to it    even Splenda didn't help much.          Unfortunately, I ordered two boxes and will be lucky if I get through one. Guess I'll sell the other one on ebay or something. Dunno. What I *do* know is that I won't be drinking it.
