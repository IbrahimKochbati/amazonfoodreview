I had a hard time finding organic single grain cereal at the store.  All the grocery stores including Central Market and Whole Foods were completely out of the Earth's Best, and I don't really like the Gerber organic.  My baby was exclusively  east fed for the first six months, and I felt like this was the best transition to solids.  I also like that it's  own rice.  I feel good about giving it to my baby, and he likes it!
