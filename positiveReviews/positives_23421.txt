Rooibos tastes just like black tea but without the caffeine! I tried a couple other  ands, and H&S seems to have the best one. I find myself reaching for this tea more often than any other, because there's no caffeine, which means I can have it as many times a day as I want or late at night, without compromising my sleep, and it's a nice change from chamomile.
