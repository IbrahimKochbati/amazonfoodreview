The Dolce Gusto Caffe Lungo capsules are awesome. This is a strong coffee, a caffe lungo is a "long coffee" or big coffee that Europeans drink. It's like their everyday coffee. The caffe lungo is meant to be a stronger tasting, somewhat bitter coffee. It means business. So if you like a strong, slightly bitter coffee in the morning like I do, it's wonderful. Now. Because the Dolce Gusto machine lets YOU decide how much water to add, you can further control the strength and therefore bitterness. Obviously, the more water you add, the more mild the coffee will be. I suggest that when you first get the machine, you experiment with strength by using a pyrex measuring cup. They suggest adding 4oz of water, but obviously you can add however much or however little water your heart desires to suit your tastes. Apparently, Europeans are not sitting around enjoying big mugs like Americans are. I think they simply drink more cups throughout the day.          At any rate, this is a wonderful, full bodied and slightly bitter coffee. I makes a wonderful crema layer. (the froth you get from a pressure  ewed coffee) You certainly can't get this from a k cup or Keurig (drip  ew) system. I love this first thing in the morning when I need a sock in the eye to wake me up!
