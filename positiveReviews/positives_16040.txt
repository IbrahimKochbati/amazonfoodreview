0 STARS for the packaging.  It was borderline acceptable.  Not completely taped shut and was possible to reach inside package without disturbing existing tape.  In this day and age that is poor form.  In addition poorly padded inside.  Biscuits  oken but packages intact.  Enjoy them so much I ate them anyway.  Glad that they are available widely in the US now.  Will continue to buy biscuits but find different shipper.
