I have been a dog owner for three years and for two years I tried to give my dog his monthly meds with little success. While walking Dasher, I ran into a fellow friend waking his Dog. After chatting for five minutes I said I had to get home to try to get Dasher to take his flea capsule. He mentioned Greenies pill pockets to hide your pill in this treat Chicken pill pocket. He said I will give you a couple to take home with you now. We walked to his house, he put two in a baggie and said this will change your life. Needless to say my dog LOVES these pill pockets. Thanks, Big A for carrying this product at a great price. Sincerely, John M Wiesend.
