I'll give you three different thoughts on this coffee:          1. As a coffee: it's not the world's best cup of coffee. If you're not dealing with the acid issues, you won't find this worth getting for the flavor. The package I had was not bad. It was ok. When I  ew coffee, though, I'm looking for a little better than ok.          2. As a value: I'm not sure this is good in terms of value. First of all, I typically make coffee in a 4 cup mini  ewer, so I only need about half the package size here. Second, most of the time the extra packaging for single serve raises the cost a little bit. So, it's not a real good value.          3. As coffee for someone with heartburn: Here's the kicker: Puroast doesn't claim it's the best coffee in the world. It claims to be a coffee that is processed in a way to reduce acid effects from drinking it. To my senses, it does just that. (They claim to have published research that supports it, so trace their links for science.) Usually I don't drink coffee in the evenings because the acid feel just churns through the night. Not so with the Puroast. It performed for me just as advertised.          So: the flavor's not exceptional, but that's what sugar, flavored creamers, or other add ins can help address. The value's not great, but it is cheaper than a trip to Starbucks. And if you can't have the full acid of a normal coffee, this one is worth a try.
