If you've read the other reviews about Stephens hot chocolate, well, the same for this one. It tastes rich and good. I'm diabetic type II and there is nothing else in hot chocolate that comes close without being loaded with sugar. Diabetes really narrows the field when it comes to things you can eat or drink so am glad that Stephens makes this product. In every shiny white cloud there is a bit of soot hiding somewhere. The lump of coal is that they don't sell it in Canada and won't ship across the border. That is so sad. Canadians having to deal with yet another item they can't get. Not sure why this is whether US government, Canadian border guards with a grudge, or Stephens just don't want extra paper work. Thank goodness for friends who go on trips down south and  ing it back for me. Good stuff.
