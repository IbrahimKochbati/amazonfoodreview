I invited guests over for dinner and made 8 large pork chops in the oven using the packet. I added a few panko  ead crumbs and I added salt, pepper, parsley, garlic salt and onion salt for more flavor. I put the pork chops in the oven and cooked them for nearly an hour and they came out moist and flavorful and there were no leftovers. The guests said they loved them and I even taught my daughter how to use the packet so she could make them too one day. I would buy these and use the chicken version too. I love that baking is healthier and is less fuss than frying too.
