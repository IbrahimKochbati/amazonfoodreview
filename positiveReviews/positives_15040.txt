I ordered this kit for my 11 year old cousin as a Christmas gift.  She was so excited to get the pearl from the oyster.  My 27 year old helped her remove it from the shell.  She was completely mesmerized!  And it was a black pearl!  Such a nice set to give!  It was truly the hit of the party!  Her sister can't wait to get one when she is old enough!
