For a microwavable meal, it's great. The meat is indeed a mystery, but expected for the price. If it had higher quality meat, we'd be complaining about the price increase for the product.     If you're looking for a cheap, quick alternative meal at work, this works nicely. Add some sour cream and eat it alongside rice for a more fuller meal.     I'd prefer a home cooked chili, but who has the time to shop prepare it when working over 40hr wk. I've had worse chili in restaurants for much more.     I just purchased Campbell's Firehouse Hot and Spicy Chili because I do prefer some heat. Will review them later this week when I receive my shipment.
