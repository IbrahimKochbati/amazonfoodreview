We love coconut water.....some  ands are really ICKY....Zola sold at Von's Safeway is really awful:  sweet and sickening, made from concentrate.          O.N.E. is a very good tasting product though ZICO is always my first choice, but has a history of being 'out of stock'.  So it is often a case of purchasing O.N.E. 'cause ZICO is unavailable.  O.N.E. ships well, I've never had one arrive leaking (as I have often with ZICO).
