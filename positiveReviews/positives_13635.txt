Now Foods' erythritol is a sugar substitute made from corn. By fermenting the corn's sugars, the manufacturer produces a naturally occurring sugar alcohol product. Sugar alcohols taste exactly like sugar, but without the calories and blood sugar spike. And they are alcohols in chemistry terms only, not to be confused with the kind of alcohol one finds in adult beverages.          PROS:          * Tastes just like sugar and has no unpleasant aftertastes, unlike stevia.          * Has a glycemic index of zero. Great for diabetics or those simply wishing to eliminate excess sugar from their diets.          * Contains virtually no calories.          * Made by a manufacturer committed to a wide range of sweeteners and food products, so the company is experienced and trusted in its field.          * Erythritol occurs naturally in many foods. The FDA recognizes it as a viable and safe sugar substitute. Erythritol based sweeteners have been on the market in other countries for years.          * Unlike some other sugar alcohols such as xylitol, mannitol, and sorbitol, it will not cause gas if consumed in large amounts.          * Not only does erythritol not promote tooth decay, it actually prevents it, inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria in the mouth.          * Can be used in baking.          CONS:          * Not quite as sweet as sugar. You need about a quarter to a third more erythritol by volume for an equivalent.          * Though it tastes exactly like sugar, erythritol has a slight, mint like, cooling effect on the tongue. In foods where that effect would be undesirable, erythritol would need to be combined with another sweetener to diminish the effect. (This effect seems to vary from person to person, too.)          * In some clear liquids such as tea, adding erythritol will initially cloud the liquid, though the cloudiness fades quickly. (That issue probably comes from the release of oxygen bubbles as the product dissolves.)          * Though it dissolves, erythritol does not do so as rapidly as sugar. It will retain its granularity in some foods. (Some people recommended powdering it to compensate.)          * Because it involves more steps to make than corn syrup or sugar, this is not a cheap product. Perhaps in the future, economies of scale will drive the price down.          Many companies are discovering the benefits of erythritol as a natural sugar substitute that lacks the nagging questions that dog artificial sweeteners like sucralose and aspartame. Now Foods' erythritol is one of the best values in this natural sweetener on the market, available at a much lower price point than some competitors' products. Though not cheap compared with sugar or some artificial sweeteners, as a healthy alternative, it more than makes up for its higher cost.          Definitely recommended.
