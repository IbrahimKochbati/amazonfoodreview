I'm a casual coffee drinker who is more likely to like McDonalds or Duncan Donuts coffee than Starbucks, which I find too burnt. I also like sugar and milk so I'm not obsessing over subtleties of flavor. This coffee was noticably better than supermarket  ands and, in my opinion, milder and superior to the fancy  ands as well. It is a good quality coffee at a good price and, as a result, a good value. I'd recommend this and would consider this as an every day  and.
