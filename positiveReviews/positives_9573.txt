Kids love it, Mom & I love it, and even the dog loves it!  Whether it's for  eakfast or just munching on a couple of handfuls for a snack, Cinnamon Life satisfies the hunger crave in all of us!  The sweet cinnamon taste seems to really appeal to  eakfast cereal eaters alike.  The only slight complaint I have is it gets soggy really fast, so I try not to put a lot of milk on my cereal.
