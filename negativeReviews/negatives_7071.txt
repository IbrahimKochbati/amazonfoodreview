These apples taste fine, since there are no artificial additives, but they sure are small.  The average piece is 1 2 an inch by 1 2 an inch, which is quite pathetic and unsatisfying (for me).  I have to eat multiple pieces at once to notice any apple like aromas.  I do appreciate the crunch but they also detracts from the sweetness, because its harder to dissolve and release the sugars when the pieces are this dry.  It's not a bad product, but I would not buy it again.
