I have usually ordered my K Cups direct from Green Mountain, but thought I'd try Amazon's larger package and subscribe save. The box of 50 works out to about a month's supply of coffee for me, with drinking a couple of cups a day.          The taste is good  it's not a strong coffee, for that you need something like Green Mountain Coffee's Extra Bold.   "
