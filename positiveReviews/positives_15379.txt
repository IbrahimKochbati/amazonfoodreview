One of my cats has had a chronic constipation problem most of her life.  The Friskies Indoor Selects Classic Chicken Entree is her favorite flavor of all.  Since this has  own rice and spinach as some of the ingredients it has helped keep Stinky a little more "regular".  My vet believes all cats should get *some* wet food per day   he gave his approval on this  and over some of the others, even though it's a grocery store  and.  Occasionally I still have to help her along with an 1 8 tsp. of Miralax mixed into this, but she doesn't even notice the Miralax, she still laps this up and begs for more.
