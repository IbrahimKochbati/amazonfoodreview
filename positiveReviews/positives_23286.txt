I just baked a loaf of this  ead in my new  ead machine (the machine is zojishuri or something) and it came out FANTASTIC!  It is light and fluffy, but NOT crumbly like so many store bought GF  eads.  I added some italian seasoning and onion powder to make it a savory  ead.  I can't wait to make more  ead with this mix!!          I gave this product 5 stars because as far as I can tell it has no short comings!  (I did slice and freeze the loaf because GF  eads are notorious for going stale quickly).
