Well, I have to say that I thought this would be pretty bad. I admit it.     Deconstituted peanuts   wow. Dry, tasteless, useless, but less fat.          I have to say that I was wrong!     It smells pretty darned good when you open the jar up. It is powder, so     I used a knife to only cut half the lid off. That way, if my fumble fingers     dropped the jar, I would not spill as much of this   it is pretty pricey.          I like peanut butters, but don't eat enough of it to really use it up before     it separates into oil goo.  This is the answer for me. You just mix up what you need!          Basically, this is just powder that mixes with water. While directions say two Tbls of powder     to one Tbl of water, who wants to really measure peanut butter? Best eyeball judging that I could     say for advice, is to get a small bowl, and put enough water in it to be about the amount     that you want to have of peanut butter. Use a spoon or fork, either one. Sprinkle the     powder over the water generously and mix, mix, mix. If it is too runny for your desired use,     sprinkle a little more powder and mix again. Repeat until it is just like you want it. I did find     that I had to mix it more than I thought I would to get the desired consistency texture. If you     don't mix it enough, it will feel grainy to the tongue.          The freedom to have it slightly runny for dipping, or thicker for spreading, is so nice!     While I honestly thought I wouldn't like it, I really do. I made a small batch up, intending to     dip my finger in it for taste testing. This is how I learned about not putting so much water in the bowl.     I had more peanut butter than I really wanted. So, son and I whipped out a package of Ritz crackers     and thoroughly enjoyed dipping spreading it on the crackers. There was only the color of the bowl     left when we were through!          If you've been on the fence about it, especially since it is a little costly, just jump in.     I can't see any waste in this product (except maybe spilling it). If you are trying to watch your     fat intake, this is the PB to eat.          I have ordered a jar of the PB2 Chocolate tonight. I simply have to try it too. I hope it is as good     as this one!  YUM!  Now, I wonder if the same company might want to make this in almond or cashew     versions?!  *HINT TO THE COMPANY*
