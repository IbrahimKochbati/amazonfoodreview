If you like fresh pork rinds these do a great job and hit the spot. They require no extra seasoning, or preparation. Dump a handful on a plate. Spread them out a little bit so they have room to  eathe, and pop them in the microwave. A little while later you have perfectly seasoned pork rinds nicely salted. If you want to add a little flavor, a bit of hot sauce does wonders.          I would like to warn you however you need a certain wattage microwave. I originally tried in a 700W microwave and I got partially popped pork rinds which looked like crackling pork rind hy ids and tasted horrible. I'm not sure what the minimum wattage would be, but a 1200W microwave made perfect pork rinds. I would suggest you put your first batch in, set it for 5 minutes, but then watch the batch closely to get the proper timing down for your microwave. Adjust slightly for larger and smaller batches.          For alternatives to the microwave I also tried using the oven which works but takes more time than I'd like. If you don't, or can't use a microwave, frying in a little oil is a great option for these pellets as well, and makes tasty batches extremely quickly.
