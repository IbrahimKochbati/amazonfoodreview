I bought the pack of 6 box.  When it arrived and I inspected the nutrition label I saw that it has sugar in it.  This is the reason why I gave this product such a low rating.          The other organic cereal I use does not, and I would like to return this.     As this is a grocery item, I am not able to.  I wish amazon gave nutrition information on the products they are selling so I didn't have to be stuck with this!  (My fault really, could have gone on another website and checked it out).
