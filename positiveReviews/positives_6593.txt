I am trying many different coffees to see which one's I like best. This coffee was good, but a little stronger than I had expected. I know it say's extra bold, but others I've tried have not been that "extra". I ended up putting it on my larger cup setting and it was perfect then. There was a little after taste, but not much more than other coffees. I would recommend it if you like stronger coffees, but it is not as strong as an espresso. I intend to purchase this again.
