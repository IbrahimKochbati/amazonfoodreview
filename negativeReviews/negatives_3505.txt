As a long ago Philadelphian, I never lost my taste for snapper soup.  I was happy to find this product under the  and of Bookbinder's, an old and well respected Philly restaurant, and I bought a case.  Unfortunately, the soup doesn't taste anything like what it's supposed to.  It's bitter, and has an off smell and  taste.  The few small bits of turtle are hard to find.  The soup itself had the consistency of paste, and didn't taste much better.  I ate this stuff just because I was taught not to waste food, but it was a struggle.  I guess I'll have to wait until I visit the city for some of the real stuff.  You should, too.
