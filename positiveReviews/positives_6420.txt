I bought a Wolfgang Puck sampler and this was certainly one of my favorites, so I ordered a bigger box and have truly been enjoying it.  This is a classic, medium roast cup of coffee.  It's very smooth, with no bitterness.  I would say that if you enjoy Donut Shop, Tully's Kona, and Caribou, you will like this blend.  The label is adorable and makes me smile when I pop it in the Keurig each morning.
