Even though this appears to be intended for dogs, I bought this for my cat Digby. He is very smart and likes puzzle toys (the ones that conceal treats of course). The problem with this toy is the depth of the 'bowls' that hold the treats. Digby cannot get his snout deep enough into the bowls to get the food. I could see a large dog with a big toungue being able to do it, but not a small dog or a cat. This is too bad because it looks like someone put some thought into this thing, they just perhaps only had one size animal in mind when they designed it. If your pet can lick the inside bottom of a jelly jar, perhaps this will be a good item to get them.
