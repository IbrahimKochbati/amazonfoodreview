I've been a consumer of "Chips" candies for over 40 years;and thankfully,nothing much has changed.(used to be colored green many years ago) They are as delicious as ever! Menthol eucalyptus is still my favorite flavor.When fresh,these candies have a hard,rubbery texture,that will give your jaw muscles a workout.Let them age a year or more and the candie is  ittle at first but then softens up as you chew.I honestly think that they never go bad, so don't be worried about buying the 4 pound bag for better value.          aztropic     Mesa,Arizona
