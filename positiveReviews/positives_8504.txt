I have three children and seven nieces nephews (ages 20 to 10 months). Lucy's cookies are the staple snack dessert treat in our household b c of the allergies a few of us have. The cookies, the taste flavor, the packaging and the crunch are loved by all of us. We always have them on hand and glad to have them ready for us to order 24 7 on Amazon. Lucy's Cookies A+++ (P.S. During the school year, they're great to pack in my daughter's lunch box b c they follow the school rules!)
