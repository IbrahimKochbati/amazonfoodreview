I found this package of red quinoa at a local health food store. I'd never bought quinoa before, so I thought it was a little expensive. But now that I've taken a trip to another natural food store    the kind that carries food in bulk    I realize it's the going rate.          That said, I really love this red quinoa. The Eden Organic  and is much more tasty than the more expensive kind that I got at the bulk health food store. After having regular quinoa at a picnic last week, I must say that both of the  ands of red quinoa have more flavor and interest than regular quinoa.          I have two all time favorite recipes now, one that mixes the quinoa with craisins, sunflower seeds, feta cheese, scallions and cilatro with a mustard vinaigrette (my own recipe). The other salad (on the Wegmans website) mixes the red quinoa with avocado, corn, tomatoes, scallions and cilantro in a lemon vinaigrette.
