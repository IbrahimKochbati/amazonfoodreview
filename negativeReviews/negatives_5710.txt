I used to love Shake N Bake when I was a kid. I also remember my mother not caring for it. Now I see why after trying it for the first time in years. There are pros & cons. It doesn't taste bad, but it's very bland to me. I just feel like it needs a little something extra. The pro side is that it is extremely fast & easy, just wet the chicken, throw it in a ziploc bag with the packet contents & shake it up. Once in the oven it bakes up nicely with a crispy exterior & keeps the chicken moist. I just wish it had more flavor. As for shipping, you get a clear plastic bag with 12 pouches inside. Someone else mentioned using this to flavor dishes, I could definitely see this as a crispy topping on baked mac & cheese.
