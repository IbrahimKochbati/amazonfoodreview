I absolutely love popcorn, but hate how the kernels get stuck in your teeth. If you make your own, you inevitably get the burned popcorn at the bottom of the bag, or are left with unpopped kernels at the bottom. These taste just like popcorn but without the need to worry about those pesky kernels! Better yet, they are gluten free, for people like myself who crave chips but can't have the gluten. I have tried all the flavors and the white cheddar is my favorite. Similar to "Pirate's Booty" snack, which I also love.
