My family went to eating all whole grains several years ago while doing the South Beach diet. We gave up mac and cheese reluctantly and tried several "other"  ands to satisfy the craving. None could compete. If you grew up on Kraft mac 'n' cheese with the  ight yellow might be cheese sauce, you miss it.  My daughter loves mac but would only get it at "Grandma's" house because I didn't keep it around much.  I was excited to find out about this product, but only to find no local stores who carried it. Thank you, Amazon! It is well worth the price and tastes just like the original, just with a stronger wheat flavor.  I felt the cheese sauce should be made a little stronger to compensate for the strong wheat flavor of the pasta. We don't mind the wheat taste, but some other people aren't as fond of it. If you don't care for the taste of whole wheat pasta, this probably isn't for you. We, however, will definitely reorder.
