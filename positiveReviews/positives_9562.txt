This is the cutest make up traveler!  I would have given it 5 stars, but it is smaller than I expected...so if you have a lot of makeup, I wouldn't suggest this product.  But if you're like me, and just want just the necessities when going on a small trip, it's perfect!  Color is fantastic, shiny and  ight!
