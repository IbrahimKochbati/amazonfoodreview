I have ordered and not received yet but I'm a little worried. Some say its horrible and bitter, some say its great.. strong and not bitter. Which is it? I guess I'll find out soon. Maybe a resell on Ebay. Stay tuned ......I'll review once I receive.          UPDATE: I received the coffee and while it's not horrible it does have sort of a bitter after taste especially first thing in the morning. I drink it black so I can easily distinguish it. I will say that it definitely gives you a major boost so if you can get by the slight bitterness it will do the trick.          I had a cup when I first got home from work and did not notice the bitterness as much as I did in the morning and it gave me a nice pick me up. I actually watched a movie until 11:30 and did not fall asleep on the couch by 10:00 as I usually do.          It's worth keeping around for the kick and maybe mix with my regular Starbucks House Blend but I can't see ordering it again. Maybe just the REVV would be better.          FURTHER UPDATE: Its starting to grow on me and while it may be a little rough for  eakfast it really does give you a nice boost. If you like a bold coffee you will like this.            Rick
