I purchased two orders of these as gifts because it looks attractive in the photo and there appears to be a reasonable amount of nuts.          CONS:     Turns out there is very little nut meats in this product.     The illusion was created by the the cellophane (wrapper or bags) folded underneath the nuts.          I thought it was odd there weren't many reviews of this product, but I took a chance... unfortunately. Live and learn.
