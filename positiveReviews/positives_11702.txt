My family went 'gluten free' for about six months earlier this year, so finding new GF products is somewhat exciting...!  I really liked the mixture of coconut and chocolate chip, it led to a different, but satisfying flavor.  The cookies did seem a bit  ittle though.  I hesitate to call them 'grainy', because they didn't have a grainy texture when eaten, but they did crumble fairly easily.  I prefer chewy cookies, but I understand the limitations of cooking with largely organic ingredients.  Just a heads up... Still, the taste is great.
