I started out by purchasing the 4 oz trial package of Summer Brushtail and my little girl absolutely LOVED it!!  Now I am getting the larger package so we don't run out.  My Chinese Crested suffers allergies to poultry and grains and was pretty much limited to a red meat diet.  Since she is a hairless variety she was on a red meat formula coated in herring oil for her skin.  The herring left her with fish  eath all the time.  This is a great alternative to the fish because the richness in omega 3 and 6 fatty acids and no more fish  eath!!  Since she has been on this her skin quality is much better.  This is also great to mix with kibble if you have a picky little eater like I do, just mix a tbsp up in the kibble and you end up with a happy plate every time.
