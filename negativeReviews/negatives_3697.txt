One bowl (2 servings) makes a filling lunch for one.  The highly spiced chicken flavoring (definitely not for wimps!) is quite tasty.  The extra long, curly noodles are delicious.  There are no vegetable or chicken bits in the bowl  the ones shown on the package label are apparently garnishes added for the photo shoot.  The ingredients list reveals more beef flavorings than chicken flavorings.          The food prep couldn't be easier: (1) pull back the cover, (2) open the seasonings packet and dump it in, (3) fill the bowl with room temperature water, (4) microwave for 3 minutes, and (5) let cool for at least one minute before eating.  One is wise to heed the instructions to wait a bit before eating  my microwaved noodles were still too hot to eat after three or four minutes.  The bowl can also be prepared by adding hot water and letting the mixture steep for three minutes.          Unfortunately,  the 2 serving bowl  and who eats only half a bowl of noodles?  delivers a whopping 1780 mg of sodium, even though this particular product has 30% less sodium than the manufacturer's regular product.  The FDA recommended daily intake for sodium is about 2300 mg of sodium, so if you eat the whole bowl, you have consumed about 77% of your day's recommended sodium.  (The package label is reasonably honest, stating that 1 serving delivers 37% of your daily sodium.)          Because my diet is generally a low salt one (by choice, not for medical reasons), I could tell that some of the spicy flavor was coming from salt rather than from other seasonings.  However, the product did not make me immediately thirsty, as most high salt commercial food products do.  For me, this product is worth only three stars ("it's okay"), because I can't eat it on a regular basis and still keep my salt intake down.  That's too bad, because a product like this is great to have on the pantry shelf to pull out for a quick meal.
