Santanders 53% semi sweet dark chocolate bar is by far their best bar in my opinion. The 65% is pretty good also, but it's more smooth and balanced, whereas the 53% is just goodness from start to finish and has a wonderful creamy flavor.          I've tried their 53%, 65%, 70% and also their espresso 70% one   the 53% is the best (by a long shot), then the 65% comes in 2nd place. The others are very good too, but don't quite have the amazing overall rich creamy wonderfulness of the 53% bar.          If you are not sure which bar to buy, the 53% bar is an excellent choice. If you like See's candy and or Godiva, then you'll be right at home with this bar. It's one of the single best dark chocolate bars I have ever had in my life.
