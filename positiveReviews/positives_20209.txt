Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ; ) & our 60 LB German Shepherd AND our 40 LB we have no clue what she is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do   the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.          But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.          Our small part Chihuawa part something else, first 2 times in a row, threw up repeatedly w rawhide pieces and w foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.          So, now... It's Booda Bones!          Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever they are dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon flavored, and the yogurt flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.          And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!          ** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of "Brian Amazon" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [ ief... LOL] comment, with some editing).
