It didn't cause any stomach upset, but was pretty good. It's not as robust as one might like, and the aroma was not very strong either, but I would not go so far as to call it bland or anything. If you have a need for a low acid coffee I would say it might be a viable coffee option. I used the whole package to make one pot   that quantity was about right for me.
