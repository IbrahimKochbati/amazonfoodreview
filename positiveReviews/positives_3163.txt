Going from the $600 Digidesign Mbox to this $15 tube made me feel like I got back at Digidesign for screwing all of us who had XP computers that they refused to support after we bought their over priced gear for recording voice overs.     I could wish that the Blue Ice converter was made of heavier materials and came with a CS department that one could reach. But, for $15... well, 'nough said.
