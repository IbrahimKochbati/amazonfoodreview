I bought these the last time I was in the US to  ing back with me to share with family and friends.          These are not hard gummies, be aware of that if you haven't tried the Haribo gummies that have sugar or sour coatings. They are chewy, but not like a gummy bear. They're about 1 step up from the gummy factor of a fruit slice. Chewy enough to last a bit, but not hard enough to pull out your dental work. :D          I was suprised by how real these grapefruit slices taste. I've tried others and they were bland, these have a very strong, yet natural tasting, grapefruit 'kick' to them.          Can't get these in Mexico, so I was very popular when I  ought them home with me a few months ago. I gave away all but about half a pound of them.          I still have about half of what I kept, which have been stored in a heavy ziplock bag. After about 5 months, they are still soft and fresh, so don't worry too much about buying such a large quantity, they do hold up well, even in the high humdity of the tropics.
