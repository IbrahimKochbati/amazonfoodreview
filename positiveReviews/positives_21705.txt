This paste was an item I needed to make chili sauce. I cannot comment on the quality of the paste, I have not tasted it any where else.  It was perfect for my recipe and provided a unique tartness I expected from the tamarind.  It is thick, quite thick, as I would think a paste should be.  I will always keep it on hand, now that I found it.  I can think of several uses for it.  Thanks for the product and for the large list of specialty ingredients available on Amazon.com.  Tamarind is not to be found in my small town in any medium.  Rather than travel to the nearest city and find an ethnic grocer, I chose to buy it here.  Shipping costs are always a concern, so I looked for the item with Super Saver Shipping and grouped this item with others.  Free shipping makes ordering grocery items on line a pleasant experience.
