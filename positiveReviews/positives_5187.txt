I really liked the tatste of this.  It actually tastes like you're getting the juice from a tangerine...I think the carbonation gives it that zing taste you can only get biting into an tangerine, orange, etc.     My daughter, however, really didn't like it.  Not sweet enough for her.     I think it's a little pricey, not sure I'd be willing to plunk down that much for it~~the can is very small, 8.3 fl. ozs., which is a proper serving of orange juice, which makes it around $1 a can, or a little less.     But overall I truly enjoyed that zinging tangerine taste!!
