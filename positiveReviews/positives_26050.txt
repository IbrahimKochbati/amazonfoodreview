I tried this coffee for the first time recently    and love it! But then I like medium roast coffee. I do not like dark roast coffee at all. So if you're looking for dark roast, this is not a good choice for you.          This coffee is a combination of chocolate and floral flavors. To me, it is highly flavorful and aromatic. It is now one of my favorites.
