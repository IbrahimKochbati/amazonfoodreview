The noodle itself was clean, bland, and fresh in flavor.  The fishy odor in the packing liquid rinsed off quickly and completely.          To prepare I drained the packing liquid then filled the package with warm tap water and poured it off three times.  Next I poured the noodls in a strainer and rinsed for about two minutes under running water.  Last, I soaked them for half an hour in warm tap water changing the water twice; then rinsed and drained.  This was over kill as the fishy odor was gone after the first rinse but I had heard so much negative about this I took no chances. Even so, rinsing was quick with each step taking two or three minutes.          I cooked these using a dry roasting method.  In a no stick skillet pre heated on high, I cooked the drained noodles for exactly one minute. After cooking I removed the pan from the heat and added half a tablespoon of canola oil an a tablspoon of prepared stir fry sauce along with a sprinkle of dried seasonings.  Mix and serve.          That's it.  One package was about a cup of noodles.  They are not pasta so if that's what you are looking for you will be disapointed.  They are a lot like celophane noodles found in some Asian recipies.  These were neither tough or chewey but had some 'bite' to them.          I will definetly buy these again for Asian style noodle dishes.
