Annabelle (my three year old Persian mix) absolutely adores these. She does not like any other treats. These are perfect, because they're chewy, so they feel and taste different from her food. She does tricks for them and always comes running when we  ing them out. Definitely try them. They are healthy (grain free) and perfect for any kitty! To the comment about the bag, just buy a treat jar. Works much better, and it looks cuter on your shelf or counter :)
