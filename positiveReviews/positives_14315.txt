If you like chocolate.....this is the only way to go.  The best chocolate in all  kinds of flavors.  The soft insides are to die for.  Love, love, love them.  I wouldnt buy them in the dead of summer tho.  The package comes with a small ice pack but it's barely enough to keep them from  melting in excessive heat.  Prices are good too.
