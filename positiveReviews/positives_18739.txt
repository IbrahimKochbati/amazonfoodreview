Wow. I had this long, terribly witty review that I was about to post about this Shake N Bake stuff, and then my son interrupted me to ask for seconds. Now, dinner has been over for at least an hour, and he wanted seconds! Not popcorn. Not candy. Not a trip to get ice cream. He wanted more of the chicken I made tonight.          Before anyone jumps on me, let me say this: I'm old enough to remember when the Shake N Bake commercial involved a child  agging about "I helped!" Yes, it really IS that simple that a child can help make it, or even make it on their own. And, no, we don't take our kid out to buy snacks after dinner very often, although occasionally we do take a trip for a family ice cream run. (C'mon, it's ICE CREAM!)          But, as a budget conscious Mom, I have to admit that I get very tired of finding ways to make boneless, skinless chicken  easts interesting. This? Wow! I remember now why, as a kid, we looked forward to pork chop night: because my mom was using Shake N Bake. (Seriously, it was only one of three dinners she made well.)          I love, love, love how easy this is to make. (Hello? We're in a heat wave here in the Midwest. This took 3 minutes of effort and, WOW!, I was out of the kitchen.) And, having tried a number of "baked fried chicken  east" recipes? Wow, again. This was AWESOME. I'd cut our chicken  easts into 3 oz servings, pressed them down with the palm of my hand, and expected to get something tough but at least low calorie. How wrong I was.          Bottom line: stop searching for 'oven baked fried chicken'. Start using this. Amazing, yummy, wonderful stuff. And, because I grew up eating it with pork chops when I was a kid, this is a GREAT comfort food for me!
