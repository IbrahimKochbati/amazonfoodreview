This is a great product for a finicky cat. It's really very rich as the ingredients are pure and there is no filler, which is great. Our cats love it more than Fancy Feast or any other higher end cat food!!! A can is eaten up in minutes!!!!          Our dogs, of course, love cat food and want to partake in the feast!!!
