My child was re diagnosed with a gluten allergy a few months ago.  I had went through changing his diet when he was an infant toddler, but I knew that doing it again as a six year old was going to be more difficult.  It is important to note that my child also has Aspergers; so change for him has been difficult.     I, like any other mother, frantically searched to find foods that my child could and would eat.  I am embarrassed to tell you how much I spent on  eads alone.  I couldn't find any that he would eat. After resolving that we just wouldn't eat anything similar to  ead, I stumbled on this mix in a different health food store.  I have been familiar with Pamela's products and recommend their products to anyone who hasn't tried them.  I was amazed by the outcome.  This  ead has great texture, looks like the real deal, and a taste that rallies the real deal as well.  Amazon.com also has the best price if you use its free super saver shipping.  HIghly recommend
