This ground coffee is almost as good as fresh ground coffee beans.  My husband is a coffee snob and he loves this coffee.  I have to admit the fresh ground is better, but Yuban makes a really good ground coffee.  Don't waste your money on Folger's or Maxwell House, this is the best ground coffee out there.
