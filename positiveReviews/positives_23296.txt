My children were diagnosed Celiac 3.5 years ago and the search began.  I have made  ead from scratch, bought different mixes (Bob's Red Mill and more) and just couldn't find one that smelled or tasted good.  This is the one!  My kids LOVE IT!!!  They want to eat it as soon as it is coming out of the machine.  Very easy to make and it doesn't last long in the house before they are asking me to make another loaf.  Thank you PAMELA!!!  They take it to school and have a sandwich like all of their friends again.  LOVE LOVE this product.  AND her Pancake mix is great as well.  We use that for pancakes and anything that calls for flour.
