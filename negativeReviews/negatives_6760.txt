I live in Florida and according to research I've done, these can grow in this area. I received 8 seeds in a timely fashion. The company provided a page of basic information about seed growing. The seeds themselves had a sentence of instructions which I've followed. I've begun attempting germinating 4 of the 8 seeds with 4 different techniques including soaking for 18 hours, and using a damp paper towel, etc. It is week 4 and the seeds have not germinated yet. I've done research and I can't find any answers. Perhaps they're just duds? If anyone can help, please contact me. I will update this review if I get any new results.          Couple of months and no germination. Perhaps I'll have to do more research, but I believe the seeds were just duds.
