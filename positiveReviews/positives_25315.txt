We have two 4 year old Great Danes, and our vet recommended these for their teeth   and they LOVE them! It's hard to find treats for them that are big enough for them to enjoy (rather than just eating them in one bite!), and these keep them chewing for a while.  We've been giving these to them for nearly their whole life, and their teeth are in excellent condition! Plus, I feel good about giving them a treat that actually benefits them in some way.
