Ordered this item as a birthday gift and "thought" I had allowed ample time for shipping however that didn't end up the case.  Arrived 2 days after it was expected & needed and the box was delivered & sat outside in 90 degree heat for several hours...not so great for chocolate coating!  I would have thought they'd package with a cool pack during the summer.?.  This tin size does hold a lot of toffee though!  Just wish the toffee had been more fresh tasting but I'm sure the heat didn't help the stale texture   like when you get an old Butterfinger bar.  Perhaps if it hadn't been summer & sat outside in the heat it may have been better.  Can only give it a 3 star rating because of the negatives.
