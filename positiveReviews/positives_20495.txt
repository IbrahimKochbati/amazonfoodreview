We've used Swheat for at least 10 years, and have never had a 'bug' problem with it. We've lived in the east and now in the desert southwest, and no problems in either climate.  There has been virtually no smell   even when we come back from vacations and the clumping action is remarkable.  We've also disposed of the clumps in the toilet and have never had a plumbing problem.  If it sticks to the bottom of the litter pan, chances are you don't have enough in the pan. We use a pan with a sifter insert (same pan for 10 years too!)and they seem to be made for each other.
