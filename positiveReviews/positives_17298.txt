I agree that this is a great alternative to those other "instant noodle soups." I definitely prefer Annie Chun's Soup Bowls to the greasy and overly salted take out around my college campus. However, other than it being better than the other choices I have, it's not that traditional and the tastes are a bit too strong for my liking. I will try to put in less seasoning but I doubt it'll taste anything like my dad's pho. I'd recommend it though for those looking for a "healthier" alternative to ramen.
