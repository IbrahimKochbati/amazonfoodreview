Both of my dogs love these treats! My border collie has been having problems with stiffness in her back legs so I thought I would give these a try. I have been giving them to her everyday for about a month and just last weekend she racied me down the stairs outside!!!  And she won!!! I really think these are helping her, so I'm on "Subscribe and Save" and will keep giving them to her forever if it keeps her out of pain. I also give one to my yorkie. No hip lep problems there but maybe we can head em off at the pass!! They LOVE how they taste and both sit patiently waiting for their treat!!! Thank you Zuke's!!!!
