Just served this large can of wraps to a picnic group. Recommended best at room temperature, these were a quick and unique finger food. Sprinkle with lemon juice and red peppers. The only drawback, they can be very delicate, a pinch mushy. I will definitely serve these again. They thought I slaved over them....big hit.
