This comment refers to ALL OF THE DO IT YOURSELF K CUPS.     My K Cup by Keurig     Eko ew     EZ Cup.          They products above ALL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.     You have to get the correct grind on the whole coffee bean.     And it's NOT what you think if you are familiar with grinding espresso.          If water is coming out the top, (of the products listed above) the grind is too small and or too much volume.     The coffee is too weak and you jump to the conclusion it's because the grind is too coarse or you do NOT have enough coffee.     Wrong, it's because the water went over the top and NOT THRU THE GROUNDS is the reason it is weak.     Start off with about 1 3 4 tablespoons (do not exceed 2 tablespoons)     The grind will probably be MORE COARSE than what you typically use for BUNN type drip.          Once I got the right combination of grind setting and amount of coffee, ALL OF THESE FILTERS worked.          I have the capresso infinity conical burr grinder.     For Duncan Donut Whole Bean I use the     MEDIUM #4 position.     I use two tablespoons.          There are 16 grind settings     Extra Fine 1 4     Fine 1 4     Meduim 1 4     Coarse 1 4          Note that for Bunn drip coffee I use Medium #2          For espresso I used from fine #3 to other settings ... (adapted to get a 25 second draw)          Once you get the right RECIPE they all work.          But .....     Where this product comes in handy is NOT IN BREWING coffee, but in storing your recipe in an AIR TIGHT CONTAINER.          Grind a weeks worth of coffee and store it in these cups with the lid on and no holes in the bottom.          Then during the week, grab one of these already premeasured cups,     remove the lid     and pour into the My Keuring K Cup          I found that if the grind is toward the fine side, all these will leak. The My K cup was the best of the lot for not leaking,     But like I said above if the get the grind more toward the coarse side they ALL WILL WORK.          Bottom Line:     This product is great for storing pre measured amounts that you have ground earlier in weekly batches.     Make your measuring and grinding mess ONCE and then fill up 14 or so of these cups with your own recipe.          If you want to get more accurate, instead of using tablespoons get a good digital scale for weighing.          Note that if you are in a hurry then go ahead and DO USE THIS PRODUCT as advertised here.     I just thought that these were too expensive also and that you had to keep reordering them.     But yes go ahead and use them if you want to do that.
