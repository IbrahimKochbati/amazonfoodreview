We are pretty happy with these product. the dog doesn;t have nearly as much gas as she did on other KIbble diet. The only thing that was better was a completely RAW diet, but with that you never know if the product you have purcahsed is the freshes it can be, and the pet suffers for that. where as the ZIWIPeak stay fresh for at lest 30 days after you open it and longer if you serve from the freezer.
