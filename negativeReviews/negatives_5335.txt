This was included in an expensive shoe stretcher package. I finally realized the reason it doesn't spray is that there is no hole in the cap. I tried to make one but was unsuccessful. I have to pour the liquid into my hand and dump it into my shoe trying to hit the correct spot, or dump it on the outside of the shoe. Very annoying.
