Best pancakes I ever had that I have made from home. The best part is its 100% whole wheat and has far less processing involved in its ingredients. I was always a big box name  and buyer, but I am a Kodiak product buyer for good now. I highly recommend this product. It does not taste bland, and if you cook it according to the directions they are truly wonderful. My 5 year old daughter prefers them over others I have bought.
