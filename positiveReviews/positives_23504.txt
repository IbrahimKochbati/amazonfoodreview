This was a Manager's Special for cheap (two bucks a box) that I gave a try. It has milled cane sugar as the second ingredient BUT that is soooo much better than High Fructose Corn Syrup for the human body. It's sweet enough to satisfy a sweet tooth or two. My teenager will eat ONE bowl and be satisfied versus "inhaling" bowls and bowls of fruity loopy stuff. I enjoy it because there's 26 of the recommended daily 48 grams of whole grains per serving, it's all natural, no preservatives, a good source of protein, and a "good" sweet taste. Kids and grown ups BOTH like this straight out of the box, as a hot or cold cereal with milk, mixed in yogurt, and sprinkled on ice cream!
