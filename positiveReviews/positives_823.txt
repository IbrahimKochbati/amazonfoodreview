Riba foods based in Houston, Texas makes this awesome black bean dip. It is pretty much all natural and without the lard that regular refried bean dip has in it. I am not sure why in Dallas TX it's so hard to find   maybe because Riba has SO Many good flavors??? I make the traditional 7 layer dip with this instead of the refried beans, and am thinking about creating a  eakfast quesadilla with this and some verde sauce. Try it, it's not too too spicy but is very good!
