I have two big cats that are over 15 lbs. each.  For  eakfast, I give them each a packet of Whiskas Choice cuts.  They inhale the food in about 2 3 minutes.  This food doesn't have that catfood smell that most canned foods have.  There's a lot of gravy so the price is pretty high considering the amount of liquid.     "
