I started feeding my chocolate lab his dinner in this toy and it worked well.  I really enjoyed watching him figure out how to dump this kibble out and he seemed to enjoying the challenge of getting every last piece out.  He took to picking up the empty jug and dropping it, as if to ask for more food ... and after 3 or 4 instances of this, the lid  oke.          If the lid were better protected from this type of damage I would definitely buy another one.  It's not dog proof enough for us.
