This pudding is delicious and I guess because I grew up in England and didn't emigrate to the US until 1964, I couldn't understand what all the fuss was about regarding Dick; it must be the spotted part that made people so silly.  The name was changed in 2001 to Spotted Richard because, apparently, some women were embarrassed to ask for this when shopping.  However, after the name change, the product sat on the store shelves.  No one was buying Richard; too bloody boring.  Heinz realized it had made a mistake so changed the name back to Spotted Dick and the rest is history.
