This is a copy of the email that I just sent to the avoderm company:          You changed your formula for the vegetarian dog dry food a few months ago.  The smell was completely different. After a few months my dogs developed MALNUTRITION!  You should be deeply ashamed of your negligence.  Vegetarian dog food must be of the highest quality and carefully monitored for it's value..  I will let all dog owners know of this horrible experience.
