I was skeptical about buying plants online but took a chance because this looked like what I wanted at a bargain price.  The Baby Staghorn Ferns arrived in three days.  Each plant consisted of an inch long plug of soil with three or four leaves the largest being at least 3 inches long.  These were easy to plant and I look forward to watching them grow to full size.  The Orchid Gallery recommends that new plants be kept between 55 and 85 degrees.
