Having liked the various types of Ghirardelli chocolate and premium hot cocoa's I decided to try some Ghirardelli Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa Mix, Chocolate Mocha. After trying several cups of this I started to wonder what happened to the Ghirardelli Chocolate as myself I thought it was overpowered with the coffee taste. Not my cup of hot cocoa!!
