My friend and I were so happy to find this product at Amazon.com. Locally all the stores have stopped carrying it. Not sure why? Shipping from Lipton's site was atrocious so we ordered from Amazon. The tea is exactly what we expected although in the one box that I have opened so far, the tea bags seem to be slightly wrong. When you pull the string topper off the bag, it pulls off the connection between the two sides of the bag. I have not, however, and any tea leakage so this is a small price to pay for the tea that I love so much!!!
