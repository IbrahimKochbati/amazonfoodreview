Bought this  and because it was featured on Dr. Oz (like the fact that it has a lower gylcemic level). Decided on coconut sugar as it had a 1:1 replacement for regular sugar, and I use sugar primarily for baking, so this was important to me.  Have found that it's virtually indistinguishable from regular sugar. I haven't noticed a difference in taste. This coconut sugar also reacts similarly to regularly sugar in baking, so my cakes,  ownies, cookies, etc. have all been fine, and I don't feel like I'm sacrificing quality. The sugar is more granular in nature, i.e. larger crystals than regular or  own sugar  sort of reminds me of the fake  own sugar. It doesn't come in a resealable bag, so I end up putting it in a container. I bought it using subscribe and save, and that's the cheapest price that I've seen. I will definitely buy it again.
