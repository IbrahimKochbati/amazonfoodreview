I bought 2 of this item for our (2) 14wk old labs and was shocked at how big they were!! They didn't seem to be too worried about the size once they realized treats were inside of it and it is a toy that they can grow into! If you have a smaller  eed of dog, I would recommend getting the smaller size. I tried using larger treats at first (size of large  eed chunk dog food), but they had a hard time figuring out how to get them out. I decided to use some of their puppy kibble instead since it is relatively small and they had a much easier time managing it. Now they have mastered it so well that I am going to have to resort to the larger treat sizes! It keeps them busy for about 30 45 minutes at a time! Overall, very pleased.
