Hi! I could eat a box of this vegan jerky at one sitting. Delicious! The hickory smoke flavor is mildly hot without burning. There's to be a hint of maple syrup or similar tasting spice in the flavor. Texture seems right. Chewy but soft enough. The strips came in an outer paper box. Easy enough to open. The individual wrappings are easy to open with scissors. Tougher to open by hand. Individual wrapping has a cut at top for peeling open. I had no luck that way. For taking these on a hike it's a good idea to  ing scissors. I recommend this jerky for a great snacking experience. I hope to buy other flavors in future orders.
