I received my white peppercorns today. I was very happy with them. They were sealed in an airtight plastic bag. And the shipping package was secure so as not to damage the products. When I opened the bag the smell of the peppercorns was amazing. They were all whole(none  oken). I can't wait to cook with them. I use white pepper in potatoes,salads of any kind; just about anything you'd use regular pepper on. The white pepper adds a buttery taste to all foods.
