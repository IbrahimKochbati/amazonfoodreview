This Barista Prima kcup is my favorite of the four Barista Prima varieties that I've tried (House Blend, Columbian, Italian Rost & French Roast).  It has a nice dark, moderately bold flavor that creates a smooth wake me up in the morning.  There is no kick to it   just a even, enjoyable experience.          My coffee preferences are medium bold blends.  I  ew a 10oz cup & this coffee maintains its flavor in this size cup.          This is a kcup that I would put on my shelves.  Recommended.          Disclosure:  I received this kcup in a sample variety pack sent our by Keurig to its customers.
