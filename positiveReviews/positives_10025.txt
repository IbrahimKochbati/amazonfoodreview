My husband's officemates take turns providing coffee for the machine. He took this in for his turn (without telling them anything about it) and probably half the office commented how good it was and asked where he got it  and requested he  ing that variety again. So it looks like this will be a regular purchase for us.          Direct from hubby: A very smooth and robust tasting coffee. I prefer the stronger varieties and this one does not disappoint! The first pot I mixed as I normally do for a new coffee, wow intense! I then backed down to a normal mix and enjoyed the pot more. I highly recommend this coffee to anyone that is seeking the deep, robust taste of a European coffee.
