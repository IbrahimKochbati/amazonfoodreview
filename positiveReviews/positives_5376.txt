Not at all happy with the instant coffee taste of my cute little  ewer , I began hunting for a solution . The DisposaKups were it !!  My own fresh ground coffee   packed in tight in the DisposaKup   makes a good cuppa joe . Easy to use and no mess . Love them .  Shipping was fast and they are a good value in my opinion . Thanks
