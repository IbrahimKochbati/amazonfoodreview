My family prefers food made from scratch  eads, soups, jams, pickles, etc. The taste has more depth, better spices, texture & freshness. So, I thought I'd give making my own yogurt a try. I have used the Yogourmet  Starter with excellent results in a EuroCuisine maker. I use a combination of skim, 2% & powdered milks & a long overnight processing time  for a thicker, Greek style product.  All of us love the "tang"  & texture of the fresh yogurt. Since we started eating the homemade yogurt, we have noticed better digestion & less between meal hunger,too.
