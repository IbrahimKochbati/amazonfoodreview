I had these candies at the Ethos Greek restaurant in NYC.  I grabbed one from a candy bowl and walked out, thinking it would be a mint.  But when I popped it in, the intense anise flavor bursting throughout my mouth, I immediately wanted to turn around and grab a handful.  They're absolutely delicious, they cleanse your palette, and make your  eath smell like sweet licorice.  Don't let their small size fool you, they pack a punch.
