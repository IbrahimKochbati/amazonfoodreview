This product is fairly expensive, for what you get. It would be fine if you had guests coming and you are not a wheatard, so you need something to feed them.          Ingredient list: Brown rice flour, baking powder, vanilla bean powder, salt, baking soda, xanthan gum.          Vanilla powder aside, anyone who is GF has these ingredients.          I added quite a few things to it to help it out: eggs, olive oil, almond milk, a little sugar (it's not sweet), and a little tapioca flour. I did this because I was having trouble with the waffles I made being soggy. I don't think it would work with out eggs, or egg replacer, as it's just rice flour. You can get rice flour cheaper than this. Save your money.
