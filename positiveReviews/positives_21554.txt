Instant oatmeal is my go to  eakfast whenever I have to work the very early morning shift.  I just pour the packet into a mug and add hot water from the dispenser on the coffee maker.  Quaker's Maple Brown Sugar is pretty good, but I think the Safeway  and is just a little tastier.  Quaker's version just doesn't have quite enough  own sugar in my opinion.  Since I had a box of Safeway's, I decided to compare.  They're pretty similar with the same calories and grams of fat, but when it comes to nutrients the Safeway version is slightly more nutritious.  For example, Quaker has 15% Vitamin A and 8% Calcium while Safeway has 20% Vitamin A and 10% Calcium.  Going down the list, Safeway is either equal to or better in each category.
