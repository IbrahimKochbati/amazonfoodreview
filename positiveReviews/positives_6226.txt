Sharp orange flavor with a tolerable spearmint taste. I've tried many of the less expensive  ands and haven't liked any other except this one and Good Seasons Tuscany. I'm not crazy about all of the Tazo drinks, but this one is nice. I love drinking this tea with chocolate. It comes in an orange package. You can also smell the other spices. Don't make the mistake I make, by adding too much water. As with many products, amazon is over charging.
