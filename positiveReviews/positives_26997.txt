I like to say all of you that I got this item today and I really like the strip were thick and they weren't dry or hard.  I actually like the teriyaki flavor one the most, I also like the original. I really recommenced this product. If you like meat then you will like this.  I SAY BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT lol. I know I'm not an expert on food but i do like meat so this is just my opinion.
