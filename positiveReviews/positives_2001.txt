We are typical Americans who know we should eat better, but often don't because "health" food is usually expensive and frankly doesn't taste that good.  That is why we are so thankful to have found Mrs. May's products!!  They are all very healthy and quite tasty, and ordering them from Amazon keeps the cost down.  My son's a golfer, and I am always looking for portable, healthy snacks for him to tuck in his golf bag.  Mrs. May's products fit the bill nicely.
