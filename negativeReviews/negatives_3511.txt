I was excited for these.  Got them on a Monday, on Tuesday I came in and my husband tells me you have to try these they are excellent.  So I'm like Ok, I reach in the bag and I'm like ewwwww they feel slimey but none the less popped one in my mouth.  I almost puked, I spit it right out terrible, disgusting, don't buy these.  I love Amazon and buy a ton of stuff from them but these are a definite NO!  I might add this was a joke to my husband because he had ate one and had to spit it out!  He was just wanting to watch me eat one.  :(
