It has the best taste I use in smoothies with my protein shakes or plain I use it twice a day, you can use just in milk with ice cubes blend in blender better than a malt but you can use in many other things too. I'm so glad I found it a friend gave me my first package I like the chocolate one better but for those who don't like chocolate they have it without. Wish I'd of known about this sooner. Hope to keep ordering it here, don't ever stop carrying it.
