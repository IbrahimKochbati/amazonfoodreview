I was anxious to try this, but upon the first sip it was apparent to me that this drink was not going to go well for me.  It has a very sharp harsh citrus y metallic flavor and combined with the overwhelming sweetness, the two seem to battle it out in my mouth for dominance.  After awhile it seemed like the drink was going down more like syrup more than a carbonated beverage.          The can is small at 8.3 oz (a regular sized pop can is 12 oz) and the cost of these little guys seem a little bit astronomical.          I also am a bit dubious of its attempts to seem like a healthy alternative to pop.  It still has loads of sugar in it.  So when they claim "no additional sugar" this may lead you to believe no sugar or low sugar... but it does in fact have 34 grams.
