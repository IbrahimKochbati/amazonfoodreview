Premium Ghiradelli chocolate mixed with just a hit of coffee makes this a great drink.  I've gotten to where I add a heaping spoonful to my Starbucks coffee every morning.  It gives it an extra coffee flavor and the chocolate for Ghiradelli far exceeds the 'mocha' chocolate you get at most barista stands.
