I wish I had read the other two reviews here. I picked this up at a local store for about 6 bucks. My dog just ate half of it in 5 minutes and would be done with it now if I had not taken it away. And he is only 5 months old...so an older bigger dog could destroy this even quicker. I can't believe they actually sell these...at that price at least. He absolutely loved it and is quite mad I took it away...but not worth the money.
