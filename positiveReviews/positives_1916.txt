I LOVE THIS STUFF. Really, I do. I have tried all of the flavors, but I haven't tried the original. I have to say, by far, pineapple is my favorite. Guava is a close second. Who am I kidding? I love them all!          Despite what others say about it tasting best at room temperature, I find it tastes very refreshing and even better when on ice. If you want a natural, tasty alternative to water, this is for you.
