It doesn't get easier than Shake N Bake. I've tried to concoct my own coating for pork chops, but I never get the seasoning ratios right, and end up with bland  eading. Shake N Bake has great flavor for chops and it is so easy. I love keeping it in my pantry for quick weeknight meals. If you're as busy as me you know how tempting it is to run for the drive thru on the way home from the kiddo's activities. Shake N Bake keeps it simple and helps me offer my kids home cooked meals even with our crazy schedule. This is good stuff!          I also prefer the cute little pouch over the box because it takes up less room in our tiny pantry.
