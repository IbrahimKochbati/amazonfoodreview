The Switch Juice is pretty good!  It is 100% Juice, and LOADED with complex carbohydrates!  It has to be loaded, considering the 135 calories (at a little over 8 oz), and the 33g (!!!) of sugar.  I did like the sweet tart taste which reminded me of the candy with the same name.  I also liked the fact that it's carbonated, but not too noticeable because of the sweet tart taste.          The pros of the Switch Juice are:     No Sugar Added     No Corn Syrup     No Preservatives     No Artificial Colors     100% Pure Juice     All Natural          The cons:     The price per can (considering 8.3oz size)     The calorie load     The sugar content          So, if you like juice and are looking for something to drink after a long workout, this one is a good choice.  You get energy and great taste in a somewhat small can.  Gatorade is much cheaper and a better choice for quenching thirst.
