This sauce may seem a little expensive, but it goes a long way and it is absolutely delicious. Hot but not painful, with so much flavor and it's sweet but not too sweet. The garlic is there but not overly dominant. Awesome on fresh salad rolls, anything with chicken in it, great as an ingredient in peanut sauce,fried fish, etc., etc.
