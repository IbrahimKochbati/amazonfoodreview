I have seen many comments about the packaging, but have found my favorite treat to be packaged very well.  The biscuits tend to  eak up very easily anyway.  I am so happy to be able to find a steady supply of Digestives.  I order once a month, love these things, not too sweet but enough fiber to have a great texture!
