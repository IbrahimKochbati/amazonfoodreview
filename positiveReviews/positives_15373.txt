I have to say that once again I'm impressed with Spring in the Air.  The order was shipped almost at the speed of light and I got their beautiful flowers faster than I expected.  Fortunately the vases I ordered to put them in arrived at the same time.  Price is right, service is fantastic and delivery is number one.  They are my first choice now for flowers.
