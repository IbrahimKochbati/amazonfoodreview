This Melitta decaf Riviera Sunset coffee has an excellent taste.  There is none of the weird aftertaste you get with some other decaf coffees.  It's a smooth, mellow taste, even a little sweet and with a hint of cocoa.  I really enjoyed this.  The grind is listed as extra fine, but I didn't find it particularly fine myself.  When I grind my own beans, I have a finer grind than this, but I still expected a stronger taste from the Melitta than I would from other store  ands.  However, the Melitta decaf was actually slightly weaker than other store  ands we have tried.  We like our coffee strong, about 1 2 cup ground coffee for 4 to 4 1 2 cups water (using measuring cups).  This ratio was not quite strong enough for me with the Melitta, but that is easily adjustable.  The nice thing about the coffee is that, even when I made it very strong, the smoothness remained.  I will definitely be trying other types of Melitta coffee in the future.
