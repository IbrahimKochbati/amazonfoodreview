We've had this little plant for about 2 months now and it trucks along.  It is relatively low maintenance.  We just have to add water to it every now and then.  It needs to sit in about 1" of water and stay virtually swampy, but that's it.  He sits in the window sill and catches unlucky flies that happen his way.  The plant is constantly dying on one head and producing another one.  (That seems like a healthy plant to me).  I have 8,6 and 4 year old boys and they love to watch him catch things.  Every now and then we'll kill a fly with a fly swatter and hand feed the plant.  :)
