I like the idea of a healthy soda type drink, but this flavor just missed the mark. The tangerine overpowered the orange and left a bad taste in my mouth. Carbonated juice is a great idea, they just need to tweak the flavors a bit.          Ranking the Switch drinks from best to worst:          1. Watermelon Strawberry     2. Kiwi Berry     3. Black Cherry     4. Orange Tangerine
