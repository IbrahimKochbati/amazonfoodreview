I had seen this on Amazon and wanted to order it but was appalled at the shipping +cost of product, but put it in my wish list cart. Later I was at the store and found a different no calorie peanut butter and took it home and tried it and found that it was chemically tasteing and i threw it out. My husband bought me PB2 as a stocking stuffer (seeing that it was on my wish list) and I tried it that day and was AMAZED at how good it was at such a low calorie count. I mixed mine with water as per the directions and ate it with a spoon it was so good. I am fully intending to give up full fat peanut butter for this as I need to watch my calorie intake. I am going to the Bell Plantations website to order a full case. It's THAT good. I plan on adding some to my morning protein smoothies and experimenting with stir fry....but just off the spoon and on a PB & Jelly sandwich has been so good. My husband even says it's good...and he hates ALL diet food type stuff. Just try it once....you may love it.
