I absolutely love Bigelow Decaffeinated French Vanilla Tea.  One sip and I was sold.  The wonderful vanilla flavor is like no other.  I love that my  ain is tricked into thinking there is a sweet taste so I never have to add sugar   saves on the calorie count!  My students have even commented on how wonderful my room smells when they enter in the mornings   it's that warming vanilla smell.  Yum!
