If you want to serve a tasty rice, this is the one.  It is healthy wholesome rice compared to a mix style box that adds lots of sodium.          Recommend to anyone to create a restaurant style quality to your meal.          It take 45 minutes to cook, so I start it first thing on the stove and prepare the rest of the entrees of the meal.          Amazon also offer this rice at a very good price compare to my local grocery store.  Thank you for an affordable price.
