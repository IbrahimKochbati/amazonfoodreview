I'm not sure I'm qualified to review dog treats, but my little dachschund beagle mix Bella is, and she scarfed these up with gusto.  I was somewhat surprised because she's pretty picky, especially about dry treats, which these are. So I'm happy to recommend them to anyone with "picky eater" type dogs and I'm sure it will  ing a smile to your face when you see your pup wolfing them down with gusto.  A perfect training treat as well.
