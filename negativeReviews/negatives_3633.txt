This product is pretty nasty. AND you have to get three jars at once. We ended up putting one in the fridge to be ignored indefinitely and the other two will go as gag gifts. It tastes a little like the fake bacon bits that you can sprinkle on salads, but nothing like real bacon. The consistency is like the mucus that you hack up when you have a bad chest cold. Perhaps the regular is better, but I wouldn't recommend this product. I ordered the Lite on accident. However, I have been so displeased with the Lite product that I will not bother with another three bottles of the original.
