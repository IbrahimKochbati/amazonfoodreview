I have to admit that I bought this on a gluten free foods web site and completely missed the 0 Calorie description.  I was expecting a tasty gluten free Ranch dressing that is at least recognizable as Ranch (or dressing for that matter).  I can't believe that two reviews imply that this stuff has flavor.  Well, that's true, but the flavor is something like what you might get if you took a dirty dish rag dipped it in latex paint and wrung it out on your salad: This is vile and nasty stuff! Don't waste your money on this one.
