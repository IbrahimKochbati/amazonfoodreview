I thought these were good.  They are not as good as homemade, but I didn't expect them to be.  I haven't had the other canned  ands to compare them with, but I was surprised at how good they actually were.  It's true they are on the mushy side, possibly because they are sitting in oil, I assume to keep from drying out.  And some of the leaves were torn, but none were falling apart and I had no trouble getting them out of the can intact.  They were wrapped very tightly.  The directions say to drain the oil, and that's good advice.  They tasted even better after doing that and refrigerating them.  They have a lemony taste, but not too strong.  Couldn't even taste the mint.  They use sunflower oil, which I don't think is as good as olive oil, but most of the canned stuffed grape leaves seem to do the same, probably because it's cheaper.  The recipe I prefer has a lot of dill and onions and lemon and uses extra virgin olive oil (a Greek recipe), and the Roland  has no dill.  But for the price I thought these were definitely worth buying.  I certainly won't have a problem eating them in a few days.  I've never frozen grape leaves before, but I don't see why it couldn't be done.  I doubt these are the best canned stuffed grape leaves out there (the Al Wadi and Divina have better ratings), but they are good enough for me, especially for the price.  And they are vegetarian.
