Our dogs (30lb and 40lb Corgi border collie mixes) love it, it's about the right level of difficulty.          It was evident pretty quickly, though, that as soon as our bigger dog figured out how to sink his teeth into the plastic enough to pick it up from the bottom and bash it against things to shake the contents out that it was going to have a rough life, and so it's proven.          After a couple months of fairly regular use, the body of the jug has split all the way down from the mouth to the bottom cap on two sides.  It still works, but the pieces are only held together by the bottom cap and the rubber ball at the mouth.
