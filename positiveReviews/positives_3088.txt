these are really good, the sodium is ok based upon the daily allowance. It is a great fast meal when you do not want to cut on the stove and it is really good when added to a salad. so far the  low fat sardines has aided me in my weight loss, I am going to continue Roland's product until I reach my final goal weight. They taste good, a litte coarse and dry but I normally add the juice to a fork full. I love them. I learned not to be too critical and enjoy the little things in life.
