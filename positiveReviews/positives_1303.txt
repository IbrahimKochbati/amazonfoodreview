The original flavor would work fine with any dip and are okay on their own     The salt and pepper flavor is AWESOME.  Really tasty and a great snack for only 100 calories     The sour cream and onion is a little chemicall y but decent.     The barbeque is good but not tasty enough.  The flavor doesn't go as well with the texture.          Haven't yet tried the other two flavors.  Will update as I do.          If you haven't tried popchips they are sort of a cross between pringles and rice cakes.  Less like styrofoam than rice cakes and made with the same potato flakes kind of texture as pringles without as much fat.          So far I have this on subscribe and save and will keep that subscription active.  These definitely beat a 150   300 calorie bag of potato chips as a snack.
