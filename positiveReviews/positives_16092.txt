I just put this on subscribe and save.  It has been one of my all time favorites for a lot of years, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and at a good price, especially with the "subscribe and save" option.  Several folks have commented on the price; remember that there are a number of vendors selling this product on Amazon, and many of them do overcharge, both for the item as well as the shipping.  Amazon's own price is EXCELLENT compared to my local supermarket.          This cereal is not too sweet, and quite filling.  I'm on Weight Watchers, and the points value is quite reasonable.  The added raisins, dates, and nuts contribute to the texture, which I find very satisfying (a little chewy, a little crunch ... ).          Really good stuff!
