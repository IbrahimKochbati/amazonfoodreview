First time I have ever reviewed a product at Amazon. My wife, who is always one step ahead of me, bought a bag at Costco. I like Oatmeal but it can be mushy and unappealing after awhile...plus it does take long to make. I try to stay away from the small packages that are flavored and full of fake flavors and probably sugar. This oatmeal is different. It takes only 4 minutes to make a big bowl and the texture is amazing. I dump a bunch of blueberries in it and even leave out any milk...and it's filling and tasty. This morning I added some nutmeg and cinnamon and it's even better. Filing too. Healthy  eakfasts are always a challenge so this is great!!!
