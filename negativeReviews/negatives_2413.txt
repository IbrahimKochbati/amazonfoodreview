I was so excited to receive the product I immediately cooked a bag.  What a disappointment!!  The taste of the pork skins was there but it was buried by some spice that I didn't enjoy.. I couldn't finish the bag!  My dog wouldn't eat them either ans she eats everything   including  usell sprouts!  I have had microwave pork skins that were good but I don't remember the  and so I'll just have to do without
