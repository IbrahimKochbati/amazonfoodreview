I have purchased the Oskri dark chocolate with coconut bars and absolutely loved them! This time the dark chocolate was not available so I tried the milk chocolate. I figured they wouldn't be as good as dark chocolate since i prefer dark but thought they would still be tasty. The package I received was dented and the chocolate bars were melted. It makes it hard to open since each bar is bent and chocolate is stuck to packaging. The bars themselves taste a little stale. Needless to say this purchase was a big disappointment as I love coconut and chocolate.
