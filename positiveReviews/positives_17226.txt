Another great Roland product!  I cannot say I've been let down by this  and.  Like the mussels, these, too, are packed in water and are already pre cooked.  A little rinsing may be necessary, but there's no pungent or fishy odor; the water will run clear after light agitation in a strainer... or you can just pour into and dump out water from the can before using.  There's hardly any grit to be found in the clams themselves (as sometimes happens with the shelled critters like these, mussels, scallops, etc.).  Add them to whatever you want (I've stirred them in with a homemade marinara sauce and a few spices) or eat them separately.  My one concern was that they'd end up being rubbery, as clam bits tend to be, but these are very small, pretty much yanked whole out of the shell, and quite tender yet firm.  I'm thinking that perhaps they get rubbery if overcooked, but I haven't had that experience yet.  Highly recommended.
