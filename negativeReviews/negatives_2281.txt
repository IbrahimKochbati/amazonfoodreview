   If you buy this from Amazon, you'll be disappointed at the shipping.  My box of 12 came in one cardboard box, with the 12 container boxes loosely in a plastic bag.  One was smashed, so leaking into the bag, two were dented, and one was coming open from the bottom due to the puddle of leaking water in the bag. I opened the bag, and it smelled awful from the rancid, leaking water. If Amazon wants to continue selling the 12 pack 33oz, it needs to package the shipping better. [NOTE, however, I was able to Live Chat with Amazon and get a refund, even though the item is a "non returnable grocery item".]        AND, review of the drink:  The drink itself is SUPERIOR to the taste of Vita Coca("good") or Zico(too sweet), so as a drink, the O.N.E, really IS like drinking from a real coconut out in the tropics.  I am going back to the individual single serve containers of O.N.E., shipped from Amazon.        AND, In a second comparison, the multi pack of Vita Coca 33oz comes SUPERBLY packaged in the shipping box from Amazon (as EACH 33oz container is invidually protected in a cardboard sleeve).        Hope that helps (and, Thank you Amazon for letting me have a refund on the damaged box, but it will be more helpful if you can protect the boxes better for shipping it to us).
