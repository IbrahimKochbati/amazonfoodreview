I received this as a gift for xmas of 2007 and I really liked it. The insanity sauce will rot before I ever finish it but the other sauces are really great. In the year since receiving it I have kept stock of Dave's products and I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys spicy food. The wood 'crate' did fall apart though it didn't affect my rating.
