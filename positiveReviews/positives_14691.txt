Good quality sprinkles.  Pricing seems pretty decent.  Love the way they make my cupcakes look   takes me back to my elementary school days, long ago!  Only gripes: the "partially hydrogenated" ingredient and non resealable bag.  By the way, the advertised bag looks completely different than the one you get   it's not black.  Tastes like classic Jimmies too and isn't so sweet that it'll over sweeten your frosting.
