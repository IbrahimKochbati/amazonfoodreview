After using Almond Powder in Europe, I decided to try my luck with it in the US and couldn't find it anywhere. Finally I bumped into this and decided to try my luck. Personally I thought it still too coarse to be called a "powder". But so far I still haven't found any other company that holds this product around here so if I am ever in need of Almond Powder again I'd probably go back to this company for more.
