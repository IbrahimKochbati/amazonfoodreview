I bought this mainly out of curiousity, and it sat on the shelf for a while until I started experimenting with it.  It has a very concentrated tomato flavor, so if you are looking for a quick way to impart more tomato flavor to a dish, this will do it.  Add a little at a time until you get to know how it works.          But my favorite way to use it has been on home made pizza in place of tomato sauce.  A light sprinkling before baking yields a delicious tomato flavor without the soggy crust that sauce can often create.  Just sprinkle it on the pizza dough, add oregano and any other herbs and spices,your favorite toppings and bake as usual.
