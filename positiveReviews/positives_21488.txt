I ordered the 4 large bags. I received them in a timely manner and appreciated that they were shipped in a minimal amount of packaging. The four bags were simply shrink wrapped together and put in the box with my other items. I have only opened one bag so far but the M&M's were in great condition. Great price, delicious product, excellent service.          Edit (10 01 10)  The price for these is now $35 more than when I bought them the first time. I can buy these for less than $10 a bag at the store. So the price is now closer to ridiculous then great.
