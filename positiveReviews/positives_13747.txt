I love this product.  Being sugar free is wonderful and best of all, it is thick and taste very good.  I have used it over all the veggies both in cooking and freshly steamed.  I could use any product as I don't have a medical necessity   but I use it because of the high quality and taste above all other things I have tried.  Saving sugar calories is a bonus.  Also it is so convenient to just look it up on Amazon and order it without fear of who is handling the deal or any reprisal there after.     If you haven't tried it   give it a try   it makes the veggies "oh so good"   lol
