I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this, but I was more than pleasantly surprised.  It tastes like regular French Roast Coffee, but it's easier on your stomach.  Suffering from acid reflux disease myself, I can see that there would be extra benefit to drinking this  ew.  I love my coffee and don't want to give it up.  If regular coffee upsets your stomach with reflux, you should give this product a whirl  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
