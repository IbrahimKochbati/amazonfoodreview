I've purchased 1# bags of dried porcini previously from a very expensive gourmet food purveyor in NYC.  I tried this product   the price was a bit lower, but the shipping was MUCH lower.

I immediately put about a third of them into an airtight glass jar on my counter. Packaged the rest up in a doubled freezer bag and put them in the freezer.  They keep well for over a year.  The pieces are large, sliced well, clean and  ight.  The aroma is beautiful.  Tossed some into a pot of  aised lamb shanks the day they arrived   fabulous...
