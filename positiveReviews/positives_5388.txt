Great product.  I was looking for a way to use my coffee in my krueig machine (by cuisinart) with out having to use the supplied filter.  Let's face it, the whole point is to make a cup of coffee using the k cup and not have to fill the little filter, then clean it afterwards.  Kinda defeats the purpose.  I was looking for this type of item and hoping that I could pre package my  and of coffee. I was skeptical at first, but thought for the price, I'd give it a try AND the product works GREAT.  I fill up the 50 cups with the filter, lid and store it in an old K cup box.  The lids fit tight and it works just like the more expensive k cups. The only issue is that on my 12 cup setting, there is a little spill over, but there are no problems with the 10 cup setting.  Once in a while when you open the top to put in another cup, it will stick to the top of the machine where the hole punctures the cup, but that's in once in a while.  In fact I am about to purchase again.  I only wish the shipping wasn't as much as the product.  It arrived earlier than scheduled I believe. All in all, I will be using these on a regular basis.
