I drink this tea all winter long.  It is my favorite of all hot teas.  It is best chai tea I've found.  I drink mine without any sugar or milk in it so it's zero calories.  I've also heard people say how good it is with milk and a little sugar.  I can't find this anywhere in Colorado Springs so I always order it online.
