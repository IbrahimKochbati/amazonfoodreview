If you like mild sprouts, like alfalfa, you might not like this.  The Radish and Broccoli sprouts taste similar to their adult counterparts and pretty much rule the taste of the mix.  Personally, I like it, but my wife was disgusted.  To each their own, I say...  Just be forewarned.          Also, start small!  These produce a LOT of sprouts.  I started with about a tablespoon and that was plenty for the grower I used.
