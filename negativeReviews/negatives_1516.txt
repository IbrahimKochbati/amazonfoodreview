I had to try this Orange Tangerine flavor because I had tried the watermelon strawberry and didn't like it very much, but wanted to give this company another shot. I do prefer this Orange tangerine; it has a nice citrus flavor with that carbonated fizzy on the tongue sensation. I give it a 3, better then the watermelon strawberry and on ice I drank the whole can.
