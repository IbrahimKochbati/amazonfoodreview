I am extremely satisfied with both Hodgson Mill Bread Mixes that I purchased online.  The potato  ead mix actually rose and stuck to the top of my  ead making machine and became entangled in the mixing blade, so it was difficult to remove.  Otherwise, the  ead tasted great!!  The Rye  ead was also delicious.  It didn'nt rise as much, and I had no trouble removing it from the  ead machine.  The rye loaf was much denser than the potato  ead loaf.          The only drawback to purchasing these products online was the shipping costs.  I have since found out that I can purchase the same  and products at HEB and Kroger grocery stores, and will not order online, again.
