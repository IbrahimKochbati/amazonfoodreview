Slate Magazine has a review on table salts and this was the winner.  So I ordered some from Amazon and compared it myself to the  ands available where I live, including Celtic Sea Salt.  There is no comparison... Maldon is the standout winner. It is big flaky, crunchy pieces of very tasty salt.  This is not a baking salt.  It is more of a finishing salt to go "on" foods.  It's wonderful on avocado, steamed yellow squash, baked potatoes... etc.  The Slate reviewer said he loved it the best on chocolate H&auml;agen Dazs ice cream!  It's that good.
