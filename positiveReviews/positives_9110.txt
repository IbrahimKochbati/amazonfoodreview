This product is wonderful! Just apply it with a nice paint  ush to almost any creation and watch it sparkle! I have had so many ooo's and ahhh's over my cookies because of the sparkles. I add some to the leaves of my royal frosting flowers and they turn out gorgeous as well. I cannot wait to try the other colors! Even though fondant is sick tasting..it can look stunning! It almost makes me want to eat it..almost.
