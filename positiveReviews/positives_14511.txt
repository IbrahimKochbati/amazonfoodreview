I bought this oil for my hair.  I've been swimming a lot and the chlorine has depleted my hair form its natural oil. The avocado oil added the shine and softness back to my hair.  All I do is wet my hair and towel dry it.  Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of avocado oil to my intensive repair cream (I use moroccan oil  and repair cream) put it on my hair and either sit under a hot cap or leave it overnight.  works wonders!!!! I grew up eating and using avocado for beauty treatments...I used to mash up avocado and put it on my hair...I like the oil better...less messy.     I am also cooking with it.  The popcorn comes out so much better!!!! LOVE IT.
