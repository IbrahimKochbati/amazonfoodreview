This tastes so good that apparently our cat thinks so too    he's constantly poking his furry face around every time we pop open one of these. There is absolutely nothing bad to say about these. I know some people have complained about the poor packaging but I believe that must've been fixed b c I've not had any problems at all    in fact, they securely bubble wrap these, then place them in an air cushioned box and it all arrives perfectly every time.
