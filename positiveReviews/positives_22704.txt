We have one of the smaller 4 foot Nostalgia popcorn kettle poppers and the kettle doesn't seem too big and finding popcorn portions for it is not as easy as I had thought. Amazon to the rescue!    I found these smaller portion packets (2.5 oz) and these packets seem to do the trick.  The popcorn was very good   just the right amount of salt and butter flavor.  No fault of the popcorn itself but rather the popcorn popper, I concluded that 2.5oz of popcorn is not nearly enough popcorn for 2 or 3 people, especially when 6 7 percnt of the kernels never pop (again blaming the machine) and I usually end up having to make two   2.5 oz servings for 3 people. Thats when the novelty of making concession style popcorn can get pricey.          With free shipping this is one of the best deals around. I would recommend it to others and suggest that they try one box and determine if the taste is satisfying to their palete, if its not for you, you can always send me the unused packs and switch to microwave popcorn at a fraction of the cost.
