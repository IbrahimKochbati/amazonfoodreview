This is a great tuna cat food. My male is so picky about his tuna. He will only eat yellow or white tuna. I am so glad the Amazon picked this cat food up to sell. If you go to Petitecuisine.com they have even more people talking about this food. Their web site allows you to order a 4 pack trial for 5.00 and it got here in no time. Amazon has a great deal on this food till Sept. 30th it is worth every penny. I will be ordering more.
