I have been a great fan of pickles (big and small) since I was a little girl. There is something about that great kosher dill flavor   they are sour, salty and savory all at once. It  ings great joy to say that Vlasic Kosher Dill Gherkin Pickles definitely are worth a bite (or two). For starters, the pickles are small enough to use them as a side accent to any sandwich (I am thinking ruben or smoked turkey) or as a nice "extra" for a vegetable platter. When refrigerated, the gherkins become crunchier and taste better. Num num num.....
