I was actually a little surprised that this was as good as it was, because I've tried some of the other lower calorie peanut butters, like Better N Butter (I think that's what it was called) and I actually spit it out because it tasted so artificial. If you go to the Bell Plantation site, the company that makes this stuff, there are lots of recipes that look appetizing. My only problem with this powdered peanut butter is that it's just not as satisfying as the real stuff because there's no (or not much) fat in it . So sometimes it's hard to only eat a little like you would with normal peanut butter. But the taste is very natural, not fake tasting in any way, and I loved it!
