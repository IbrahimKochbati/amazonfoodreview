I have an issue with dehydration, but due to some medical complications it's really difficult for me to drink a lot of any liquid.  I don't usually like the taste of plain water, and I wanted to stay away from all sugary drinks.  I went through about 10 different powdered drinks before I ran across this.  This is now basically the only thing I ever drink.  I hate the aftertaste that aspartame usually leaves, but the taste of it in this is very, very slight, nothing like drinking a Diet Coke.  It is delicious, refreshing, and it is keeping me more hydrated because I love to drink it.  If you are having a difficult time finding the perfect calorie free drink, give this a shot!
