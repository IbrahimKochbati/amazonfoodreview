I have several cats, both inside and outside varieties.  All of them love this food. In fact, my neighbor's outside cats come to my house to eat it, the little mooches.  I have one elderly cat who seemed to be on his last legs but since I started feeding him this food, he has perked right up and seems to be experiencing a second kittenhood.  My only caveat is the price but I've been able to spend less money on canned food since I started using this dry kibble. I will continue to order it regularly but I've noticed there's quite a wait to get it from Amazon.  Guess I'll just have to plan ahead.  I highly recommend this  and.
