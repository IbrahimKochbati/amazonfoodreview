Omaha Steaks' Franks are really quite delicious but I could not find out what meats are put into them so I only buy them on rare occasions.  Their web site is really geared for pure beef products with no explanations for products of multiple origins.  I know my sister has multiple GI problems but she can eat one of these every once in a while without a stomach upset.  She does complain of the salt content though.  If you don't care how these hotdogs are made then I highly recommend them for great flavor.
