We got a single pot sample of this coffee and enjoyed it very much. I get heartburn quite frequently and often feel that coffee is one of the causes, so it's nice to have this as an option. The sample was pre0ground and we usually grind to  ew, so I look forward trying a whole bean version in the future.
