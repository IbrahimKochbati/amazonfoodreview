I've used cases of these popcorn portion packs and they are great.  The best value and ease of use in one package.  I use them in my home theater and we go through quite a bit of snacks and popcorn.  We have a Great Northern popcorn machine that has also worked flawlessly and was the best price anywhere on a good machine.
