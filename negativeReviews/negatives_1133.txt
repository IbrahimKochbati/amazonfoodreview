I've suffered from recurrent bouts of acute sinusitis that have only become worse and worse over the years. Every time I get an infection, my right maxillary sinus swells up like a balloon. Sleeping at night on account of this condition is terribly difficult; I often have to resort to using Afrin to decongest my sinuses, which is effective but also very painful and not a realistic, long term solution because of rebound congestion. Now I already irrigate with a motorized system, often upwards of 8 10X daily when I'm sick, and drinking herbal tea has also become a pasttime to help cope with my sinus disease. That being said, I bought this tea out of sheer desperation. I'll try (and have tried) next to anything to give myself some relief while I wait for antibiotics to take effect. The only thing which I find works even close to as well as Afrin is to megadose on Psuedoephedrine (240 1 2 times per day), which is something that is also unsustainable. So, keep in mind that the severity of my sinus condition is drastic. What I found with this tea is that it seems to help, but I can't tell whether or not it works any better than domestic teas that tout similar claims (Yogi's Breathe Deep and Cold Buster, Celestial Sleepytime Sinus Soother, and other respiratory aiding herbal formulations). I've  ewed it double strong to try and gain the greatest effect, and again, it seems to work modestly but nothing amazing. The taste is a little bitter, but I suppose that's a fairly reasonable indicator it has beneficial compounds in it. All in all, I am likely to stick with the less exotic teas that I can buy at the grocery store. As an aside, I find Celestial's Sweet and Spicy herbal mix to have probably the best mucus thinning effect out of all the teas I've tried, though it's not at all marketed as something for this purpose. If you read everything they put in it, though, it makes sense that it would help.
