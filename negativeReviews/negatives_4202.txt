I really thought I would love this salt;  I really tried to love this salt:  I am just not a big fan of this salt.  This salt puts the Sea in Sea Salt (more so than other sea salts)  and for me that equates to a C in flavor.  I really get an 'ocean aftertaste' that I do not care for.  Perhaps this salt would go well with sea food, but since I don't eat a lot of sea food it is not for me.  Another disappointment for me is the loss of crunchiness when this salt touches anything moist;  other salts seem to be able to hold onto their crunch a little better.  I will raise this review if I find a food that em aces this salt's uniqueness to my liking.
