the ingredients are " habanero peppers,hot pepper extract,apricot nectar,mustard flour,garlic,and allspice."  I wrote a review after trying Da Bomb the first time but now that I've had it for a few days i have to revise my statement. I really like this stuff but it's intense. I started small and thought I was a hot sauce champ so I got cocky and put idk how much on a BBQ sandwich.I got dizzy and confused and was like,"uh oh" lucky my wife wasn't there to see it because she's always lecturing me about spicy food. Around 2 hours later I was pissing razors. I will continue to eat it though,as much as I can stand anyway.
