My mother and I have been trying to find Ground Celery Seed for some time now.  We have not been able to find it anywhere locally so I decided to purchase this product online.  Hesitant to purchase food items online, I placed my order.          The product arrived well packaged and undamaged.  It was sealed and fresh.  If you are looking for a healthy alternative to Celery salt, try this instead.  You do not get the salty flavor and a more robust Celery flavor.          I just wish McCormick would package this in a smaller container again.
