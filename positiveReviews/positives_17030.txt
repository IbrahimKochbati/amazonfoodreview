I got this and the "tricky treat ball" in the same order.  Both are treat dispensing toys that keep dogs occupied for longer than most other toys.  My basset hound likes both toys, but seems to really like the tug a jug.  I put his kibble in there and it keep him occupied for quite a while.  He really likes grabbing the rope, and unlike the picture the rope on mine is made of rubber instead of twine.  It will probably not last long.  Also, this toy is LOUD.  Much louder than the tricky treat ball.  But, he seems to prefer this over the ball, so it gets my recommendation.
