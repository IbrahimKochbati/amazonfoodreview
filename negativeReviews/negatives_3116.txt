Smooth rich coffee, comparable to a local favorite.  However better when I used the proportions, I prefer with my coffee maker.     Often I find, when I follow the coffee manufacturer's recommendation for coffee, I find it too strong.  This was no exception.     I prefer 5 coffee scoops (essentially 15 teaspoons) to 64 ounces of water.  The manufacturer recommended 2 teaspoons for each 6 ounces of water, which would have been about 21 22 teaspoons. Slightly different, but harsher tasting.          All in all a good cup of coffee.
