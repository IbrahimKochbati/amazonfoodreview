Many years ago I purchased Lawry's microwave pork rinds at Walmart and Publix.  And then they were gone   from both stores.  And then I got the  illiant idea to try Amazon.com!  I've actually ordered 7 cases for myself and my sons.  We're thrilled.  You'll never want any other pork rinds after you've tasted these!
