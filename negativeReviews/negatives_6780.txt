The Snack Shop could not fulfill our order and provided two phony excuses that appear in other reviews:  1) that the product could not be tracked because it was shipped via the USPS; and 2) that it was "undeliverable."  Both of these excuses are false.  The USPS has tracking services for all product shipments, including the $25 2 day shipping I paid for.  And the USPS has been delivering to our address for three years without fail.  What the Snack Shop doesn't know is that we work from home and there was never even an attempt to deliver this shipment despite their e mail stating, "the item has been shipped."  It also appears that many of these 5 5 reviews are very short, just the type that paid reviewers might file if they were paid by the number of reviews.  Thanks to Amazon's Customer Service for resolving this dispute and getting our money refunded.  They ought to bar this vendor from the Amazon Market as their phony excuses look like a pattern.
