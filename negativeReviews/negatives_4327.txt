I need a repellent to keep the ants from climbing the pole outside on my deck where my hummingbird feeder hangs full of sugar water.  I bought the HOT SHOT because it had a similar delivery system to COMBAT that I liked and previously used.  The opening on the HOT SHOT syringe is 1 4", on the COMBAT about 1 8".  The HOT SHOT syringe didn't work smoothly consequently I got big globs and blobs of gel, frequently in places I didn't want it, because the syringe kept sticking. I would  have to replace the HOT SHOT two more times to get through the summer ant problem  whereas with the COMBAT I was better able to target a specific area with a smooth delivery  without excess in unwanted places.  One purchase of the COMBAT lasted the whole summer.  The COMBAT has a tight fitting cap for the end of the syringe so there is no oozing or drying of the product.  I found the COMBAT and will continue using it.
