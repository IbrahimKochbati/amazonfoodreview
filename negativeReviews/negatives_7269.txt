Once again , clueless consumers that feed their cats nearly inedible corn, glutens, and by products, none of which are good for your animals.  Last reviewer thinks they are a good cat mom    think again.  This is one of the worst foods out there along with meow mix, science diet, friskies, most purina products.     Would you let your kids eat french fries and fritos for all their meals?  this is pretty much the same thing for your cats.     Read the labels    main ingredients should be meat, not corn, not byproducts.  Glutens are allergens and used as filler and should be avoided.  Look around, there are affordable good foods available    some warehouse clubs sell their  ands which are very good (starts with a "C").  Check pet food ratings, dot net.          Ignorance is no excuse for torturing your animals with terrible food
