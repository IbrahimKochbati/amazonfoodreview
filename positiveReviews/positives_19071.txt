I love using Carbquik. Since getting my kindle fire for christmas, I am seriously considering joining prime and using it for free shipping on my low carb products. I usually get things at netrition where they charge a flat $4.95 per order.          Well, the Carebquik is $11.99 on netrition, but $26++ here on Amazon!!  What is that about?  Much too high and very overpriced. I will continue to make comparisons between the netrition costs, and even with the $4.95 shipping I can come out ahead.          The Carbquik is wonderful, and I highly recommend it for a low carb diet.     Snorkelsandy
