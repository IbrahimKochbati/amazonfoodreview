This was a no  ainer for my family and I. We were using upwards of a small bottle a week of this Tabasco sauce. At $6 a piece it was adding up fast. This is great to use to refill the smaller bottles. I agree that a pump or some type of pouring system would be handy. Once this gallon runs out I will be quick to reorder.
