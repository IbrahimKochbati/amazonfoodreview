I sent this product to my  other in law, so I have never seen the product and know nothing about it.  All I heard from him was that he was not impressed.  Other than that, I can say that it was delivered.  I ordered two of these going to different addresses and we got immediate feedback on the first one, but until we spoke to my  other in law, we had no idea if the product had even been shipped.  Would I order again?  Probably not...          Thanks anyway,     Curt U
