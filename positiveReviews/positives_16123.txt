These chips are so addicting and so yummy.  They are crunchy and slightly salty without being overwhelming.  My two boys ages 3 and 6 love these as well.  So much better for them than daddy's potato chips.  They are a slightly less guilty treat for myself and my boys.  Another awesome thing about these is they don't contain any artificial colors, especially Red 40 and Yellow 5 which we avoid here in everything.
