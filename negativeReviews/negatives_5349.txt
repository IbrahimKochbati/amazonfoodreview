While I certainly prefer a fresh roasted whole bean coffee, burr ground, and seasoned before  ewing, I am inclined to drink a cup of coffee no matter the source or preparation.  My general preference runs to darker roasts, taken black.  I prepared the Puroast in a Technivorm Moccamaster, though I did back down to a bit less than the full three ounces against 10 cups of filtered water.          The result was disappointing.  The  ew was strong enough, and certainly presented a low acidity.  That said, the flavor is fairly flat, with almost a chemical or plastic undertone.  There is no complexity to the  ew, where even a run of the mill Folgers offers some flavor signature.          For someone who cannot tolerate the acid in a typical cup, it is coffee.  For anyone else, there are better tasting alternatives for less money.
