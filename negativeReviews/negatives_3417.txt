I ordered three different kinds of Yogi tea based on the great reviews    lemon ginger, stomach ease, and green tea super antioxident. Unfortunately, they all taste exactly the same    like licorice. If you like licorice flavor, you'll like this tea. If you're looking for something that actually tastes like lemon and ginger, look elsewhere.
