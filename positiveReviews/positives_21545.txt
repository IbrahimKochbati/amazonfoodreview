I eat a lot of oatmeal and granola and I thought this was pretty good.  You definitely can do worse and you can do better in taste and in price, which means the pricing on this is about right.  There seem to be a lot reviews on here complaining about taste, but I don't understand what the fuss is about.  Maybe they changed this flavor back again since those reviews?
