Royal Oak Peanuts are simply the best tasting premium virginia peanuts we could find. We have them on automatic delivery every 4 months. These are "bliser style" peanuts cooked in high heat causing the peanut to blister and become somewhat crunchy and firm.  The unique taste is much better than any  and in supermarkets. Be sure to check Amazon for specials. I saved 25% off of the $23.99 list price with free shipping.  ENJOY! JJJ
