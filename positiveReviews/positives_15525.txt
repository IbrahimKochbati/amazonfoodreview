i got my bonsai tree today this afternoon. it was Very well wrapped and packed. The bonsai tree looked ver live and had humid soil. It looked very healthy but it did not have 3  anches like the picture. Was it worth the money? YES it was. i loved it and it even came with instructions and fertilizer. Very satisfied with this product
