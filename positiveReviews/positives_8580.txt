What's not to like?  Delicious smokehouse almonds in the perfect size package.  I keep them in my locker at the gym for a post workout snack.  They are very smokey don't leave an open package in your car, like I did...It made my car smell like cigarettes.  However, this is unlikely to happen as it is hard to only eat part of the package as they are so good.
