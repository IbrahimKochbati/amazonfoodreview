Got this to go along with the Maxi Matic 4oz machine.  It gets the 3 stars just because of everything being pre packaged.  I didn't care for the flavor of the popcorn and found it not buttery and overly salty.  Will try to not dump all of the salt in next time.          I found a better alternative was using a product called Butter it which I purchased a gallon of through a local restaurant since it is sold by Sysco. It is a soybean oil base so it's liquid. Use 1 2 cup of oil and 1 2 heaping cup of kernals and if you want add a splash of salt and it is the best popcorn I have ever had....well, it is the same as in the pub I got the oil from, but still the best.
