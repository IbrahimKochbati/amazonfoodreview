I eat basamati  own rice quite often and found this to be relatively flavorless.     It cooked very well in my rice cooker, but did not embody that wonderful nutty aroma and flavor.  The grains are finer and have less body than what I have enjoyed in other  ands...maybe personal preference.  Would not try again.
