Two of my favorite things, extra special together. The product itself is delicious and I love this short ead combination. This was my second time to order this product so I was looking forward to receiving them. Unfortunately, I live in a very warm climate area and the packaging did not compensate for this, so the chocolate melted and much of it stuck to the short ead package. I was very disappointed about this. Other items that I have ordered that might present a similar problem have been package with cold packs and insulation at no extra charge (recently ordered Cadbury Chocolate Eclairs). I rate the product very high but feel the supplier fell short.
