My favorite coffees are the big dark roasts like French, Italian, and Full City.  This K cup dark roast has a big, bold flavor, but lacks balance.  The level of smokiness, bitterness, and acid are way too high, and the result is not enjoyable.  I liked the dark roasts. for the Keurig from Green Mt, Newman, and Donut Shop much more than this one.
