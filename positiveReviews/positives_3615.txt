I feed my two Pugs and occasional rescue Newman's Advanced Dog formula. I like this better than the regular Newman's, because it has less ingredients. I supplement with high quality can food, organic free range chicken, healthy powder and salmon oil. My boys are healthy; their coats are amazing. Highly recommend but with supplements  see above.
