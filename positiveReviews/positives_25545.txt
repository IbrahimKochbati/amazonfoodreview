Just a couple petals per cup makes a deep red  ew.  I've never used "full bodied" to describe a cup of tea before, but I think that's how I'd describe the tea that results from these hibiscus flowers.  The flavor really pops out at you and tastes almost as if it's been sweetened.  It's a very pleasant drink.  Consider the known health benefits of hibiscus tea, the fact that this is organic (which greatly improves the nutritional value), and the unbelievably low price of like $12 for a pound (a pound of this will probably last me 4 months), and you have yourself a winner.  Celestial Seasonings primarily uses hibiscus in their teas, but they charge like $3 per box of 20 tea bags, so this clearly comes out on top in my book.
