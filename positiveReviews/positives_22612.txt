Bought for a popcorn machine at work, and it's wonderful. Tastes just like movie theater popcorn   it's legit and super simple. My only complaint is that there is a small space to pour ingredients into in my popcorn machine, and having a wide packet makes it difficult to pour the ingredients into. To the makers of this product, having a perforated edge or an easy open would be perfect so we don't have to keep a pair of scissors around our storefront.
