I eat mixed nuts all the time at work. They make a healthy snack instead of the donuts, etc. that are always around. The plus side of these is that they are much lower salt than usual. The down side is that they are almost all cashews. Very few  azil nuts, pecans and it is a miracle to find a macadamia nut. The lack of variety is disappointing.
