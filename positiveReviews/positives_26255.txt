I got this in the variety pack. The entire package, which I did eat in one sitting, is 325 calories and 12 grams of fat. For me, it requires something bland to eat it with, as well. As such, I very much enjoyed the nice curry seasonings and all.          This has 3 grams per package more fat than the Red Kidney Beans Curry I also tried, but does include a  oader variety of veggies and other ingredients.
