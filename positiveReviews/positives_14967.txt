This tea and the Jasmine tea by Rishi are my go to everyday teas. This Citron Oolong flavor is not overpowering and very complex in the same time. This is the combination I would have liked to come up with and it is not a tea that will ever become boring. It belongs in my subscribed list forever (hopefully never to be discontinued, or I will have to find the ingredients and  ew it myself...).
