You can compare it to unsweetened black tea, but palpable and soothing.  It is one of nature's best blood purifiers in addition to being great for women anytime.  It's great year round and for flu season, and you can ice it too.  Sweeten it up with a bag of chamomile or red clover. Spearmint & peppermint tea compliment it well too    or add value to that flavored stuff from the supermarket w this.          You can drink this like water and I can't say enough about how good this tea is for well being, you'll probably instantly feel better.
