I spent days trying to find decent mango puree in order to make mango shakes, and since I'm a health nut, I try to control my sugar intake. Every mango puree I look at is full of sugar, and this  and is no different. 21 grams of sugar per serving, and an amazing 168 grams for the entire can. An average can of soda contains 45 grams, for comparison. I know they make unsweetened mango puree, but I can't find it.          Other than that, it's a decent enough product if you don't care about unnecessary sugar intake. Nice and creamy, good product from good fruit. Very sweet, but these manufacturers don't understand that you don't need to add so much sugar to a naturally sweet fruit! There IS a market for unsweetened fruit, guys.
