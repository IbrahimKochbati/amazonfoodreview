All the cans were dented. Every. One. It is as if a child hammered each one, some several times. Then they were shrink wrapped and put in the box. Is there any quality control here? While Amazon will pay for this 12 pound box of unusable cans to be returned and I will eventually get a refund   what a waste. Once returned there will be no ability for anyone to use this product due to the dents   Botulism anyone? Why would Amazon even bother to ship this product in this unsafe and unusable condition?T hey have paid for round trip shipping of a heavy box for no reason.
