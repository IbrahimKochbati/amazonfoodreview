Well, it doesn't get easier than this.  Put boneless pork chops in a zip lock bag, pour in contents, and shake away.  Now bake for 15 minutes.          Although the taste improves compared to simply baking the pork chops with nothing on them, the improvement isn't significant.  I'm looking for a little more flavor here, but Shake 'N Bake is a bit on the boring side.  If I had to do it over again, I'd probably add some other spices to the mix or on the chop afterwards.  I'm getting used to Thai, Indian, Mexican, etc. food so this Shake 'N Bake just isn't cutting it.  I've found very flavorful spice packets for cheaper than this, so price cannot be an good excuse.          Again, Shake 'N Bake helps improve the taste, but then again so does basic salt and pepper.  I think these packets are personally worth about 50 cents to me.
