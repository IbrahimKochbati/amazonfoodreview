I bought this to replace a large container of Schilling red pepper flakes that I bought about a long time ago. The old stuff served me well for cooking and pizza topping over the last decade. When I first tasted the new stuff I was a little disappointed that it was not as hot as the Schilling had been. It also seems to be losing its heat quickly    there's less heat there than there was when I got it a few months ago.
