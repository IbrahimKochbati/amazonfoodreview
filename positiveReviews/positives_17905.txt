Cooking pork chops is so easy when you use Shake 'N Bake. Coat the chops and pop them in the oven. Even a man can do it! Not only that but baking is healthier than frying and cooking on the grill. Also, this product doesn't contain high levels of sodium.     But wait, there' more, my pork chops were crisp on the outside and moist and tender on the inside and the seasoning made for a succulent treat!     I cooked for guests who complimented me on my culinary skills. I almost felt guilty when I neglected to tell them it was Shake 'n Bake.
