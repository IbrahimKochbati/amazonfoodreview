I love sweet potato and especially sweet potato chips. When I tried the original popchips, I was surprised by how good the taste and texture was, so I bought this in bulk, thinking it would be excellent because of the company and because I love sweet potatoes of course.     I was wrong.          For some reason, the sweet potato chip they've created tastes like cardboard despite having the same texture (cross between rice cake and chip), added with a dash of salt. That's it. I can't describe it any other way than a "bland blah taste with salt"          I wish I had gotten the parmesean garlic or the original instead.
