I grew up in Denver during the 80's but spent my summers in Michigan, where I could buy single suckers for $.10 at the corner store. I would spend most of my days eating Charms Sweet and Sour Pops, which for some reason I have never been able to find in Denver. Thank you Amazon for providing me with one of the best parts of my childhood.
