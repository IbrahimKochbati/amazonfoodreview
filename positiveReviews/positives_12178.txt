My granddaughter bought my Keurig Brewer and it came with a huge box of various coffee's. I enjoyed them all, however im not the dark coffee lover. I do not like that sour, acid taste you get from some coffee as an after taste left in your mouth. This Nantucket Blend of Green Mountain is excellent and never leaves that undesirable after taste. I do like Neuman's Extra Bold, but its not my number one choice.  With this coffee you loose none of your flavor from adding cream. I just love it and its that one little extra I do for me....hope you enjoy.
