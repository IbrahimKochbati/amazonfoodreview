These things are great   I discovered them at Whole Foods and now I can get them even cheaper here at Amazon with quick shipping to boot. These are great for traveling, hiking outdoors stuff, and to  ing to work for a snack. They don't need to be refrigerated, and they're vegan as well! They're made of wheat gluten, which is very high protein. I like the thai peanut flavor the best   I've tried BBQ and teriyaki and I don't like them as much.
