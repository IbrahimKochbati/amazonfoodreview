I have been a fan of Feridies Redskin Virginia Peanuts for many months. They are a staple in my pantry, and I have never had a single one that wasn't fresh and delicious. Until now. I was very surprised to find that the product I just received tasted stale. Upon reviewing my order, I see that I did not purchase the order direct from Feridies, but instead from an Amazon LLC. This may be the reason (older stock?). I will be certain to order only directly from the company itself from now on, as I have never been disappointed in doing so and I am drawing a conclusion. Unfortunately, this product is not eligible for return. PS: the star rating above applies to this product in general, which is superior, even if not to this particular order.
