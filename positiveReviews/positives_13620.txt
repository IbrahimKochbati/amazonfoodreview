My baby loves this flavor of Gerber juice. I dilute 4 oz of this juice with equal amounts of water and let her drink it with meals. In between, I let her have plain water. These 4 oz are equal to a serving of fruit, which I really like. It is MUCH cheaper to buy this in bulk in this size than buying the small 4 oz bottles. Would definitely recommend.
