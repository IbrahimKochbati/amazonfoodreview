I too was a little disappointed with the mix of the Donut Sampler. In my case I had 12 of the 35 were decaf.  But I guess this is what you get when you purchase a sampler pack through the Amazon warehouse deals section.  All the k cups had a best used by date of 6 2012.  I was happy about that atleast.
