This tea is great for me, as the rich flavor is so good that I do not sweeten it with anything.  I would recommend this to anyone that would like a tea that could be utilized without sweetners. I am on my 2nd batch and would not trade it for others. I believe the addition of the pomegrante flavor is the key.
