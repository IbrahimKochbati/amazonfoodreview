This toy was extremely great . . .My dog learned how to think and figure out ways to get the treats. I have 2 criticisms: 1) if your dog is a strong chewer, that rope won't last long. . . . but that's only if you leave the toy with your dog to play with; if you only use it as a way of dispensing food, then you should take it away after he has finished getting his food treats out; that should hopefully allow the toy to last longer 2) i wish the bottle itself was made of rubber instead of hard plastic. I have (soft) wood floors so i cringe every time my dog plays with it on the floors . . .it can be loud and my dog's strength when he's playing with it causes me worry that i'm going to find dents in my soft wood floors. Other than that, it's a great toy and I would recommend it.
