My Jack Russell has problems with patella luxation. I decided against surgery after researching the success rate of it and 5 years after it was diagnosed she is still OK. I keep her weight down and give her plenty of long walks to stengthen her ligaments. The vet told me she would probably have problems with arthritis so I give her one of these chicken strips daily and also give her liquid glucosamine choindroitin on a small piece of  ead. My dog loves the chicken strips, the price on Amazon is better than me buying the indivdual packs from the store and having the glucosamine in it is another way for me to administer glucosamine to her in a way that is tasty.
