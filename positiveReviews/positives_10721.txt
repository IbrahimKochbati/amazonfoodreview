My dog really enjoyed these snacks.  She has Kidney problems so I am warry of giving her any old treats.  I trust the Newman  and and have faith that they don't put fillers (such as wood chips or other low quality ingredients) into their products.  Let's face it, our dogs are part of our families and we should feed them high quality foods and snacks.  These are on the larger side   I prefer smaller treats for my dog because she is overweight.  Overall a great quality   check the ingredients listed in case your dog has any allergies.
