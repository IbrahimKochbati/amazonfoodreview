This Melitta Riviera Sunset decaf makes a better than decent cup of coffee with medium body and just a little bite. I used my my usual two heaping coffee scoops for six ounces of water in a Bialetti stovetop espresso maker.          While I was enjoying the coffee, I read the package and saw that it recommends two level teaspoons of coffee for six ounces of water. That got my curiosity up so I measured out my coffee scoop and it is one tablespoon. Since I use two heaping scoops, that's slightly more than three times as much as suggested on the package. Following the directions would probably make a watery, undrinkable  ew.          The coffee has a nice even espresso grind, perhaps a bit lighter than a French roast. I would have guessed that it was primarily arabica with some robusta but Melitta states that it is an all arabica blend from Central and South America. It is decaffeinated through the chemical free Swiss water process which is the only acceptable way to decaffeinate as far as I am concerned.          Also note the cute vintage travel poster style label and the clever name: because it's decaffeinated, it's perfect to drink while watching the sunset.
