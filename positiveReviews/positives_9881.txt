For years and years I have scoured the land in search of a pizza sauce that will quench my everlasting desire for pizza sauce and cheese in a bowl. After my ancestors spent forty years in the desert and several thousand years in other places, somebody finally decided to create Pastorelli.          Let me tell you   Pastorelli is a dream come true. Every time I mix it with cheese in a bowl and eat it, I feel like I am on top of the world. I then proceed to go into my basement and run a mile on the treadmill, which takes me approximately 9 minutes as I am rather fat.          Now let me tell you, the turd that I unleash after eating Pastorelli is not pleasent, but I think that it is worth it.
