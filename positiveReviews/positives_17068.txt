Purchased for my four year old Dobie "grandson". He's a full blown case of a four legged kid who has a terminal case of the "terrible twos".          Daughter said  it didn't take him long to figure out how to make the treats spill out. She loads it with dehydrated banana and papaya chips and it keeps him occupied for a good 45 minutes with each fill.          He's figured out the bottom comes off and tries to find ways to take the bottom off, hasn't managed to do so .....uuummm.......yet ;).          She also has five cats who are fascinated by the toy and when the Dobe let's them near it they bat it around and pounce on the rope. She's put some dry kitty food in it a couple times and the cats "team work" to get the food to spill out.     Dober baby is only allowed to us the toy on carpeted floors because he tends to swing and bang it on the floor, the cats are put in a room with tile and they shuttle it around until it is empty.          I would purchase again and expect I may have to...and soon...... if they cats decide the dog doesn't share fair.
