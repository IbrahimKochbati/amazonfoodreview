I first tried Reese's Cheesy Popcorn Seasoning when I bought it at my grocery store.  I loved the cheesy taste and bought two bottles at a time.  A couple of months ago when I needed to purchase more, I found out that the grocery store had discontinued the product.  I Googled it and found that it was available on Amazon.com.  I am so happy that I can purchase it from Amazon, as I tried other  ands of popcorn seasoning and was continually disappointed. I love this product!!
