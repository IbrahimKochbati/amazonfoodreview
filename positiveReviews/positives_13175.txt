Ordered this great tasting rice combo on Oct 23 and it was delivered on          Oct 25th.  Love Amazon's speed.  The rice combo is excellent.  Easy to cook and stands by itself on the dinner plate.  Rice is still a carbo but it taste great and has the extra minerals and vitamins already.  A nice change from white potatoes.
