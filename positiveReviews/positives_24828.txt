If you need fast food, fairly decent food, then grab these by all means! They are absolutely great in a pinch and taste even better with a dab of butter melted on top.  Kids can toss these in the microwave and have a fairly decent lunch.  They taste great, hubbies love them too, although they probably need two to fill them up, along with a sandwich, and they're a decent value.  Recommend!
