There is not much to say about this Caribou medium blend coffee.  It has an unremarkable flavor with a hint of bitterness.  A bit of cream and sugar will cover it up, but that shouldn't be necessary given the coffee choices available.          Drinkable, yes.  The coffee isn't so bad that I must throw it away.  I'll finish them off, but I won't be a repeat purchaser.
