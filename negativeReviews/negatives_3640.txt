I really like Nantucket Blend.  I drink way too much!  So I thought I would buy the 96 ct. pack.  What a mistake.  I ordered 2 weeks ago, but the product has not arrived.  I checked my Amazon account and it said the product would ship between July and August.  Three to four months for shipping?  How very ridiculous.  I must say that this is my fault.  It clearly says that in the product listing.  However, I usually get everything I order from Amazon.com within a couple or three days, so I didn't even think to look.  Buy this coffee from another vendor, please.
