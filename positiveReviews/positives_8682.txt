We are lucky to have several great coffee roasters in the Triangle area of NC: Counter Culture, Carrboro Coffee Co., Joe Van Gogh, and Larry's Beans.  Not to take anything away from the other guys, they roast some wonderful coffee too, but Larry's Beans is the master of blending beans from different regions to come up with very drinkable, delicious coffee.  Wjat sets Larry's Beans apart is that they are consistently less expensive than the other guys mentioned.  For this reason, Larry' Beans gets most of my business.
