I've bought this product many times before, but this is the first time that I found pour quality chews. This was the large dog chews, but most of the pieces were only about two to three inches long and very thin.  My large dogs practically swallowed them whole.  The benefit of teeth cleaning was nil. There was a lot of dust in the bag and I'm wondering if the bag was old.
