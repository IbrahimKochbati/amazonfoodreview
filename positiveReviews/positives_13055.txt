I love how the price on these has come down! Although this can make 8 oz. I recommend not  ewing more than 5 6 oz to preserve the quality of the flavor. This is such a convenient way to make espresso and I can easily train house guests on how to make their own coffee beverages now rather than using my complicated grinder and espresso machine. When I'm in a rush these definitely come to the rescue!
