I have been using this product for about 6 months. It is tasty enough to use as a spread on  ead or crackers. Needs to be mixed (oil separates) when opened, but afterwards keeps ok in refrigerator. Using it for the high concentration of helpful minerals etc for BPH. Prostate problems much improved, but I don't know if its the pumpkin seed butter or one of the other dozen things I am taking, or all of it together.
