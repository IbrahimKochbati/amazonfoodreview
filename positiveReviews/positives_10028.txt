I'm no coffee specialist, but I'm pretty demanding when it comes to the qualities that I like in my coffee.  Rich.  Nicely roasted and balanced.  Full flavored.  If you don't like any of those characteristics, then this review won't do much for you.  Anyway, I'm pretty tired of Starbucks.  It's overly roasted, almost to a burnt sensation, and drips a bit too much with bitterness.  I tolerate it because most of the other coffee vendors in the area sell watered down garbage.  A little while back, Melitta was offered on Vine and I figured, why not give it a try.  Boiling water, 4 minutes in a french press, and some milk and sugar, and I'm in business.  Surprisingly, it was a great cup of coffee.  Nice depth, a lovely balanced and almost creamy texture, great roast, and not exceedingly bitter or sludgy.  The real test now is for me to do a head to head against my current favorite go to: Illy.  I have a feeling that Melitta may hold up pretty well.
