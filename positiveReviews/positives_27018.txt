I'm a big fan of the Lavazza Dek decaf espresso   smooth, rich flavor that never disappoints. I can say the same for the Gran Filtro decaf. I received some as a gift and was very pleased to find that it is just as good as the Dek.          It is absolutely wonderful in a moka pot and french press. A bit lighter in taste than the Dek, but just as smooth and rich, with a hint more sweetness. Very nice aftertaste. The medium roast lets the flavor through without any harshness or burnt taste.          I also tried it as espresso and, while it was good, I prefer the Dek. The Grand Filtro was a bit flat as espresso.          Can't beat Lavazza Dek for espresso, and Gran Filtro for pretty much any other type of  ewing. Highly, highly recommend!
