These are a bit expensive but when it comes to your pet, especially one with bad  eat like mine, it's worth it. My bog is 65 pounds but I give her the petite be causes it saves money and cuts calories. I have tried everything to get her  eath smelling decent or even bearable and this is the only thing. One petite greenie once a day or once every two days keeps her  eath minty fresh. It's also grt for their teeth, she hasn't had to have her teeth cleaned at the vet once since she started eating these.
