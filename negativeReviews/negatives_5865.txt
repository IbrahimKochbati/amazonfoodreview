I LOVE chocolate and adore raspberries (Godiva Dark Chocolate Raspberry Truffles were my idea of heaven).  This coffee has been a major disappointment.  I drink a lot of flavored coffees and decided to try this one due to the rave reviews and being a combo of two of my favorite flavors.          I've gone through one box, and am either giving the second one away (if I can find someone to take it) or just pitching it.  The quality control on the flavorings is HORRIBLE.  One kcup will be actually almost pleasant (though the raspberry overtones *always* have a "tinny" aftertaste), and the next will be so strong in both scent and flavor that it is unbearable and gets dumped.          If the flavor strength of the chocolate and raspberry were consistent throughout, it would be two and a half stars.  As it stands, it's more of a waste of water and electricity.
