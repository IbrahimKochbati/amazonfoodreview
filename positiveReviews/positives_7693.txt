I love reading reviews about the smell.  Have you really though this through.  We are taking pork rind pellets, and microwaving them till they expand.  It's frankly amazing they don't smell worse.  Beyond the smell of cooking rind (which I don't mind by the way), these snacks are great.  It took us a two bags to figure out the cook time.  To little and you don't get full expansion, to much and they get hard, I mean real hard.  For us it is 1 minute 30 seconds to perfection every time.  I really like the seasoning as well.  I don't find it offensively over board or chemically.  Basically it is a simple snack.
