Of course, reviewing something for taste is about as subjective as it gets   but I can only say that this wasn't my favorite. I normally use  eadcrumbs and fry pork on the stove, but I liked giving baking a try. The flavor of the pork worked out just fine, but I wasn't crazy about the Shake 'N' Bake seasonings. I prefer my old  eadcrumbs.          You can just put the seasonings in a Ziploc bag and shake them on as suggested, or just put the seasonings into a dish and coat the pork that way. It's certainly simple enough either way, a healthier alternative to frying, and doesn't require a lot of clean up. Three people ate this and all gave sort of a mild thumbs up. I wouldn't eat it again, but I liked it enough to try the chicken flavor next.
