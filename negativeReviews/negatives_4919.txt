I love chocolate so I was excited to see the Chocolate Sampler Gift Basket by Back Mountain Baskets available in Vine to review. After reading a few other reviews on the strange packaging, I was almost afraid to open it   who knows what I would find. My daughter had a strong chocolate urge so we pulled off the wrappers.          Oh my gosh, it is hard to know what to say. What was this company thinking?          Let's start with the packaging. At first glance the basket looks simple yet classy and attractive and boasting what appears to be an assortment of delectable chocolates. That illusion is lost once you have opened the package. There are paper wrappings around boxes with the product name. But the actual boxes are for common grocery items like jello, fruit loops, flan etc. Can you imagine diving into a box of truffles that say Kenzi on the surface only to find the box below is for jello? A box of jello whose expiration was several years ago. How long does one keep old cereal boxes around, but more importantly, why would you package gift basket chocolate in old jello and cereal boxes?          One of the boxes has a computer generated label that has been cheaply made and taped to it.          So what is in the box? Well in one I pulled out a bag of peanuts that had melted and then solidified in one chunk. In another were small  own things that I believe were supposed to be truffles. There were also some wrapped cheap chocolate such as a chocolate graham cracker.          The entire basket was unappetizing and unappealing. I can't share how the chocolate tastes, because after pulling it out of jello and flan boxes and seeing the melted condition, there was no way I was eating it despite my love for chocolate.          With proper packaging and shipping, there would be a much better result but as it is now, it should not be for sale.          This is definitely not a gift basket you will want to give.
