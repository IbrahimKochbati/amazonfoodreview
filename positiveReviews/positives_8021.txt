If you are looking for a good pasta alternative this one is great! If you are looking for a Mac & Cheese replacement keep looking. We are celiacs who have caesin intollerance so our taste have changed over the years. This is a very healthy yummy alternative for those living a minimally processed lifestyle. It does not have a cheese taste. We ate it mixed with  occoli. My 2 year old and his little buddy had 5 (child sized) helpings! They have not had much grain recently and demolished everything on their plates. I added the little bit leftover to my evening salad for a different texture. Was still very tasty.
