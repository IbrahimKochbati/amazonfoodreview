I bought two bags of PopChips at Whole Foods (Original and Barbeque)and loved them.  When I went to Amazon to order lots more, I liked the idea of single serving bags rather than the larger ones, which I'd consume too quickly.  I knew I was taking a risk but when the order came, I really disliked about half of the flavors in the assortment.  In addition, only the Original and Barbeque nutritional values calculated at 2 pts; the others were all 3.  I still like PopChips but will only buy bags of the flavors I know I will enjoy eating and not have to choke down.  I recommend that you try a bag of each flavor before you spring for a volume order.
