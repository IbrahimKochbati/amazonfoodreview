I really looked forward to getting and using this tomato paste   I envisioned a paste that didn't have the usual overcooked and slightly bitter quality of canned paste, and one that had a nice concentrated quality that allowed it to be used in the same ways a cook uses regular tomato paste, but with the promised good taste of this product.  However, I was disappointed in my uses of this product, in that it was not as concentrated as I expected it to be, and therefore had to be used in larger quantities that I wanted to use.  Yes, its taste is better than a traditional canned tomato paste, but again I was finding that I had to often use more of this to get the flavor impact I wanted   and at this price, I don't think you should have to use a quarter to a third of a tube each time you put this product to use.          I'm going to next get some oil based sun dried tomatoes, and use them to create my own concentrated paste   I may also be disappointed with the result of that experiment, but something tells me it will prove to be a success.
