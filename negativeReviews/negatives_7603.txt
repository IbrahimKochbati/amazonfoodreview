I can't have caffeine, so I was anxious to try this hibiscus tea from Davidson's.  I read some of the other reviews before I made the purchase, and most of them were good, so I decided to try it.          The other reviews mentioned that this tea was tart and fruity.  I found it very tart, but not overly fruity.  Perhaps this tea has lost some of its flavor since the bag didn't seem very air tight.          Other reviews also mention a floral smell when  ewing the tea, to me it smelled a little like compost, which was slightly off putting.  The dry tea didn't have much of a smell either  it did smell barely of dried flowers.          The color is nice  a deep and clear red, and the flavor is ok  but I found the sourness is more appealing to me as an iced tea drink.          I also like to put skim milk in my tea, and I don't recommend doing that, since the acidity sourness of the tea caused it to curdle.          The printing on the bag seemed faded, and the other reviews mention difference in bags that the tea comes in.  This particular shipment was in the fold down bag, not the zip lock bag, like some of their other teas.  This makes me think that they are either gradually changing over to the new bags, and I got an old bag of tea  or they are inconsistent with rotating their product.          I look forward to trying a couple more hibiscus teas that are out there so I know more about the way that it is supposed to taste.
