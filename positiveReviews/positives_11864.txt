We have been eating this and the maple  own sugar for about 2 years now.  It has the best flavor of any reduced sugar oatmeal we have tried, except the Quaker oatmeal.  The Quaker has added chemicals and preservatives though, and we are not willing to sacrifice the ingredients.  I recommend this oatmeal!
