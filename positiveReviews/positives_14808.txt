Cracking the tin gave the first indication that this as a different Earl Grey. The tin aroma was a ' ight' citrus as opposed the the usual 'darker, earthier' citrus I have encountered with other Earl Greys. I don't know if it's a different strain of bergamot, if it's processed differently, but the nose is almost tangerine like in its  ightness.          The nose translates well to the flavor, though the bergamot difference is less obvious here.  I found the balance to be good, though I've noticed that it seems to get unusually tannic bitter with just slight oversteeping,(so watch that  ew time closely.)          I think I'm going to have to investigate more of Rishi's products.          Recommended
