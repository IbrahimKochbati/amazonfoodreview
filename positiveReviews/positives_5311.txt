The cup filter lid combination that allows for use of ones own coffee in the Kuerig  ewer is a great idea. The quality of the product is good, and the use is simple. Now if they could just get the price down! Unfortunately, we use and love 8 O'Clock bean coffee which is among the cheapest because we buy it in bulk and grind our own beans. If we could save costs by buying disposakups in quantities of 250 or so, that would be great!
