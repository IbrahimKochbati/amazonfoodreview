I have a gluten allergy and can't eat regular pasta.  After trying some pastas from my local market, I had given up on finding a tasty alternative.  This pasta is great.  You don't even taste the difference.  I make it for my friends and they don't know.          The only thing is   it get softer faster than regular pasta so you shouldn't let it sit, or you shouldn't plan on saving some to eat the next day.  It might be too soft by then.
