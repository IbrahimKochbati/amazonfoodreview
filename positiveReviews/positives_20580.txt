Once you use pure Madagascar bourbon vanilla in your baking and desserts you will never go back to a cheaper vanilla product. The flavor is incomparable.  Once you use vanilla bean paste, you will never go back to using extract.  Again, the flavor is exponentially incomparable.  This product is worth every penny. It is very concentrated allowing you to use less, however I never do because I'm a vanilla freak. When you use this product, you will first understand what vanilla tastes like. If you're of the opinion that vanilla is bland, your world is about to be rocked!
