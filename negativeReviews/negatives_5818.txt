I was surprised when I opened the box and found that some of the K Cups were not properly sealed.  Coffee was spilled all through the inside of the box and some of the K Cups were obviously unusable.  This is the first and last time I buy this  and.  Although the coffee tastes ok, paying for K Cups that go from the box to the trash can is a waste.  Very poor packaging... where's their quality control??
