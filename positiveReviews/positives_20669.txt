*****     Moroccan Mint is a premium Numi tea. This herbal tea is certified organic and is kosher. It is delicious, and my favorite mint tea.          On the box, the manufacturer says it better than I ever could: "In the Moroccan spring, the snow melts off the Atlas Mountains, watering the plains below. As the days warm, some of the most soothing, refreshing and full flavored mint flourishes in this ancient land of the Berbers. With a flavor as light and lively as a newly picked leaf, our choice organic mint will become your favorite mint teasan. An all day or after dinner delight, no wonder the Moroccans drink ten cups a day."          If you like Numi teas, get it   you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love mint teas, this is one that will not disappoint.          Highly recommended.     *****
