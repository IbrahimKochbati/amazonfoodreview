Great tasting BBQ Chips. Going to buy more.          At first, looking at the size of the bags, and just thinking about the concept of "Popped chips" I was on the fence. Glad I finally made up my mind.          My only complaint is, that these bags are so small. I want to purchase a regular size bag. Maybe a box of six or something. Because if you buy in bulk you save. Having to buy a box of 24... all that extra packaging is going to cost you.
