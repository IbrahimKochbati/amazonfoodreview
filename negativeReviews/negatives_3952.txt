I have been using the earlier versions of this product for about 15 years. It was without a doubt the best tasting cheese salsa on the market. I have tried many other  ands and they are not very impressive. When I saw Pace Salsa Con Queso back on the market I was very pleased until I tasted it. The flavor and consistency are disgusting compared to the Mexican Four Cheese and original versions. I have contacted Pace without results. I would be embarrassed as well.  I think I will take these cans and smash them against a  ick wall. This is just one more sorry replacement for a good product.
