Actually, I thought I was going to get a jar of EACH of the three mustards.  Oops!  Received package today, was confused when I opened it to find only one jar of mustard. Back to Amazon to look at product. Ahhh ... they show a shot of three mustards, but you only get one jar!! So, my fault for not reading thoroughly    but Amazon should really REALLY have an individual shot of each jar, and ditch the pic that shows three mustards. It is misleading. This jar of mustard is a "stocking stuffer" gift for my sweetie    he loves Irish whiskey and mustard, so this seems like a win win situation! $7.00 for it but that's about what I'd pay in hoity toity gourmet market in Manhattan anyway, so no big deal. It was carefully packaged and I figure boyfriend will be delighted with it.
