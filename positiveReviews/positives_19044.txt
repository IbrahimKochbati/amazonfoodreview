Four stars due to price only. Otherwise, it would have been an absolute pleasure to give it a full five stars.          I've made waffles, pancakes, and drop biscuits so far and I have to say this stuff is awesome.  The texture is a little strange at first, comes out of package lumpy when it's dry, but mixes up fine.  I also have to use MUCH more water in the recipes than is listed on the box in order to get the right consistency  maybe that is where other reviewers are having taste problems?  Pancakes waffles cooked up well, thicker than expected so make smaller drops of batter per piece and flatten with spatula as they cook if possible to ensure even heating through the middle and so as to not end up burned.          My husband and I have been on Atkins for about 6 months now.  We've splurged on IHOP pancakes a few times in the last few months, and I have to say although the texture is a little different with these, add butter and syrup (even sugar free) this stuff tastes like the real thing.  We can even eat them plain and they taste not too far from normal pancakes.  I suggest adding more water  half and half in the recipe (for pancakes we added 1 cup half and half, almost 1 cup water to get the consistency we like) because you'll find when you mix it up it's like the batter is a black hole for moisture.  My tastes haven't changed too much and I still by far prefer "real" food, but I've found this mix is a completely different ballgame when it comes to "diabetic diet" foods and there's not too big a difference.          Also, the fiber in this is AWESOME!  It will take you a few days to notice though ; )
