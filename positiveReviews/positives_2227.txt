FIRST THOUGHTS: BRINGS BACK OLD MEMORIES          When I recently tried these little wafers I recalled when I worked in an office nearly 20 years ago. Whenever the Director skipped lunch, he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 O'clock. He usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer. I came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him   I guess they really admired him. These 'Nabisco Oreo Thin Crisps, Baked Chocolate Wafer Snacks' would have served his purposes much better than the saltines, but I would rather he have more of his old favorites.          IN A NUTSHELL: NICE FOR A DIETER AT COFFEE BREAK TIME    BUT NO CREAM & SUGAR PLEASE          Basically, this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something in between meals and they don't want it to be a 600 calorie confection. That's why the biggest print on the label says, "100 calorie packs"    4.5 inches across!          WHAT'S THIS STUFF ALL ABOUT: ENRICHED FLOUR + SUGAR + "ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS" & "ARTIFICIAL COLORS" & A LITTLE CANOLA OIL          2 GRAMS OF FAT & 9 GRAMS OF SUGAR in a 23 GRAM PACKAGE   100 CALORIES          BOTTOM LINE: NO PRETENSES    SIMPLE LEAN SUGAR WAFER WITH THE USUAL ADDITIVES          As diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you. One can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. For that purpose this is a great product and I know that our Director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon. When the Director didn't find any saltines around the office he'd head straight for McDonalds and the rest was history.
