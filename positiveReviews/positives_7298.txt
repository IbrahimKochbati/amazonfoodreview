Been looking for a nice preserved Bonsai for a friend who can kill grass and this seemed like a great solution.  Shipping took a little longer than I expected, but I guess I am spoiled with Prime.  Packaging was interesting with the bowl 'cemented' into the box with spray foam.  Definitely held the piece solidly, but I almost damaged it getting it loose.  Be prepared to literally cut it out of its packaging.  A pain, but manageable.          The piece itself was fairly well done, definitely not as good as the one in the illustration, but still a nice piece.  I will probably do some light trimming to give it a little more character before presenting to my friend.  The bowl and stone are nicely matched and the tuft of moss is a nice touch.
