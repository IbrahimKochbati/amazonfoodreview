This is my fave Starbuck's coffee.  So I used a $25 gift certificate.  In these troubled times buying food instead of CD's or other crap seemed like a good adult idea. Of course I still go to the actual store to meet friends and get so buzzed on caffeine I can't concentrate.  But hey, that's the point!
