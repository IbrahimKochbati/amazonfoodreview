This is the first product I ordered from sprouthouse.  I used Kitchen crop sprouter to make sprouts.  But somehow more than 50% of seeds doesn't germinate.  Specifically I think all the alfalfa seeds are getting wasted from this mix.  Initially I thought may be I am doing some thing wrong.  But when I tried the plain alfalfa seeds which I got as sample pack with the sprouter,  they germinated fine and I got the good yield.  Later on I tried the Raddish mix from the sprout house and they seem to be doing fine. But this mix no matter what I do,  i.e., watering more number of times, keeping in dark place etc didn't help.  I guess either I got the seeds from a bad batch or they are too old stock. I tried to see weather I can contact them from my orders, but could not figure it out.  I am giving 3 stars thinking the pack I got from a bad batch. I didn't bother try to return as I used up half of the pack during this tryouts.
