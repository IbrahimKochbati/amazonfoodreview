My dog goes bonkers for these treats! They seem to be crazy delicious. Some of the pieces are so small, Lulu doesn't have to chew them; she seems to swallow them whole. I wonder how she even tastes them! But she must, because she whines and acts like a obnoxious  at every time I go near the bucket.          I like that the treats don't have any additives. They really stink, though, and the smell stays on your fingers. The smell and the price are the only downsides. Also, I wish the container said how many calories the treats have so I could compare them to other natural treats like Fruitables. The vet said Lulu is getting fat (to which I replied "Yo momma is fat!") and that we should start watching her calories.          If you're curious about the consistency of the size of the pieces, please see the photos I posted. There's some variation in size, and when I tip the bucket, I see more crumbly pieces at the bottom, but I don't foresee Lulu turning her nose up at them!
