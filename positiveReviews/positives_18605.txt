This is a great product for those who love the sweet taste and aroma of classic hazelnut in their coffee. I assumed it contained corn syrup, but it isn't among the ingredients on the label. In fact, first ingredient is "pure cane sugar." It comes in sturdy plastic bottles (I'd prefer glass).  Makes a lovely gift.
