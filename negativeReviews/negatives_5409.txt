I'm not sure most American coffee drinkers would go for this. I tried it several times at varying strengths, and even using half what I normally use, it tasted way too strong and burnt. It has very little complexity  whatever is there is drowned in the harsh burnt taste that reminds me of mud for some reason. I don't have an issue with regular coffee though I did once have trouble with acid reflux; I didn't notice much difference in acidity levels and the sheer overwhelming strength of the coffee gave me a stomachache that normal coffee doesn't.          I understand that some foreign drinkers might like this and suspect that's the market the manufacturer is going for. I gave two stars because some people might actually really like that strong taste in their coffee. I don't think it's bad coffee, just really really strong. It makes me wonder what their normal roasts and blends might taste like.
