My cat not only has a sensitive stomach, she's also a very picky eater.  What she loves one day, she'll hate the next.  At one point, I was having to feed her on a schedule of four different types of cat food.  Since discovering this product, however, I only have to feed her two  ands (this  and and Whiskas purrfectly fish variety pack).  My cat hasn't gotten bored of this product yet, and eats every last bit out of her bowl.  She seems happy with it, and best of all, it doesn't upset her stomach and make her vomit, as many products that I've tried seem to do.          Buyers be warned though   this product is somewhat overpriced from Amazon.  There are other stores online where you can get this for cheaper, and many of them offer free shipping if you don't mind buying two or more cases of 24 cans, in order to raise the order price to reach free shipping.  Check Petco, PetSupplies, PetcareRX and PetSmart as alternative places to buy from.
