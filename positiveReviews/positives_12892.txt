IF, I repeat IF you are just looking for an all fruit carbonated replacement for soda.....this would fit the bill to a "T"!          We split the can (from Vine) 4 ways , so this is a "family" review.     My boys, ages 10 16 all liked it, I myself ALWAYS cut soda fruit drinks w  a bit of water or soda water, & liked this one just fine following my usual diluting!  Many people remark regarding the calories, but they are no different from any other 100% fruit juice & better for you than soda! Yes it is a bit pricey but it seems to be about average in comparison to similar beverages sold in individual portions..............you are paying for CONVENIENCE!  IF you want to save money just but a fruit concentrate & seltzer soda water & mix up your own blend (like we do!) I did not have any on hand but a splash of fresh lemon or lime wedge would be Delish with this drink! We sampled it ice cold, don't know if that makes a difference, but if I was offered this again I would definitely grab it up! YUM
