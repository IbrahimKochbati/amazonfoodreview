My son has several allergies and finding a gluten free  ead that does not have egg, nuts, soy, or corn in it has been a challenge.  The other challenge has been finding something that actually tastes like  ead.  This product has been wonderful!!  The  ead can be made by hand or in a  eadmaker and has the recipe to use with egg replacer.  The consistancy and texture is the most " ead like" I have ever found and the taste is fabulous!!
