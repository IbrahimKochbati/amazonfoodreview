I AM NEW TO THE GLUTEN FREE COMMUNITY. I HAVE TRIED TO FIND BREAD OF ANY KIND THAT I CAN EAT. BREAD THAT IS CLOSE TO WHAT I AM USED TO. I CAME ACROSS CHEBE BREAD ON LINE AND THOUGHT HEY THIS MIGHT BE OK. I WAS WRONG VERY WRONG I'VE TRIED TO USE TWO DIFFERENT BREAD MIXES WITH ABOLUTELY NO SUCCESS. THE BREAD TASTES BAD THE TEXTURE IS AWFUL. HOPING I STILL MIGHT FIND SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY TASTES GOOD. UGH
