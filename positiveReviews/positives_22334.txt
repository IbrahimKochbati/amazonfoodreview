I recently got into spearmint tea after reading that it may help with hormonal acne (which I have yet to draw a conclusion at this point). First, pure spearmint tea is pretty hard to find, most of those sold in stores are mixed with some other flavors. Prior to using Tao of Tea, I have been drinking Alvita's spearmint tea (this is sold at most health food stores), and the flavor really tasted like mint and has a very strong (in a good way) mint aroma to it. However, I wanted to try loose teas as I read that they are usually better (for various reasons which I won't get into).          Well, let's just say that there's a world's difference between the two. Not only is this loose tea much STRONGER than Alvita's tea bags, but even the taste is different. I actually grew up eating spearmints, and my parents grow them in our backyard (I'm Asian American), so I know exactly what the actual leaves taste like. I didn't taste any of that in Alvita's (and Pukka's 3 mint tea). It took me a while to realize that spearmint tea was the same spearmint I've been eating all my life! When I tasted Tao of Tea's, I thought to myself "THERE'S that flavor I'm use to!"          So overall, as far as which one is "better" for you, I really don't know. However, I can say with certainty that this loose tea definitely tastes like actual spearmint, and not just, well...mint (like the kind you get in candies). Ironically, I actually like Alvita's taste more because it tastes like the commercialized mint we're all used to. However, without a doubt, Tao of Tea (I have not tried other loose tea  ands) is more "authentic" tasting, so I'll continue using loose teas rather than bags.          I mix this spearmint tea with loose green tea that I buy at the Asian supermarket (this mix is generally called "Moroccan Mint" apparently). Using Alvita's, all I tasted was the green tea, but using TofT's I actually taste the spearmint a lot more....          Note: this review is mostly a comparison of bagged teas vs. loose teas. I don't mean to imply that the Alvita  and itself is inferior.
