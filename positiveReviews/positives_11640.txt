I have a black and white tuxedo male that was living outside.  He had been horribly injured by racoons and possibly in a fight with another male cat.  After we took him to our vet where his extensive injuries were tended to. After he was neutered and he recovered, he had started developing what looked like dandruff on his coat.  After trying several foods, we came across this one.  I am happy to report he and his coat are doing great! He loves this food and his coat is so shiny and wonderful.  We named him Sylvester, he is just adorable.  The most cuddly thing in the world.  We are so happy to have him and so glad to have found a product like this for him.
