Thought this is Japan made and purchased at almost $25 for $2+ a pack, I had bought other  ands in local stores for a lot cheaper, this is the worst bean thread I had so far. Wish I could return it. My experience with Amazon is always satisfied except when it came to grocery products. From now on I stop buying food online.
