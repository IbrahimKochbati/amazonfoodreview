It's hard to find something you love when the Doctor tells you to do it; but Herb tea was recommended to keep my sinuses clear.  This is the tea I will drink for ANY reason.  It is just the right strength and rich with the orange flavor   not bitter like some.  And being herbal, I can drink it at night.  This is my new favorite bedtime treat!  I love my tea and I love my Keurig.
