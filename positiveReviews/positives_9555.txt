This bag is awesome. It has shaved several minutes off my morning routine. I can see all my makeup easily. Bag folds up well with magnetic closure. Travels well. Not good if you are someone with a lot of make up. I can fit several eyeshadows, mascara, blush, under eye makeup, two eyeliner pencils, several eye shadow  ushes, q tips, and a few other items.
