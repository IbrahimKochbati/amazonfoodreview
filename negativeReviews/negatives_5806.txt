I love dried peaches and normally respect the SunMaid  and. As such, I thought these were a bargain ($12 for a 6 pack). Unfortunately, they have a pungent smell that is kind of funky and turns me off. They are edible, but I think I'll give away my 4 unopened packs to the local food bank rather than eating them.
