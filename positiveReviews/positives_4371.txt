I think these are a bit boring (I like my cooked peas at least salty and preferably spice enabled) but they do undeniably taste like peas, and my toddler begs for them ("peas! peas!"). I suspect she likes the crunchiness. I bought a single package to try them out and bought the multi pack today. I think they'd probably be good in homemade trail mix, too.
