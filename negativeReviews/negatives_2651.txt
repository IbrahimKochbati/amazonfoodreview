I don't have any dietary restrictions.  I bought these because of an price reduction.  I wouldn't purchase them again.  They have very few chocolate chips.  Like you have to hunt for them in the cookie.  That isn't what chocolate chip cookies should be about.          The oatmeal version of these cookies is much better.
