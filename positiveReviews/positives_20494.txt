Interesting to read the other reviews   especially the ones that comment about the bugs.  We've been using Swheat Scoop since we adopted our cat in May of 2010 and haven't had a single problem with it.  There is only one local retailer that carries it and only in box form.  Maybe the bags can be infiltrated more easily by the bugs? Maybe it's the timing of maufacture and the environmental conditions at the factory or warehouse, and maybe its the location of the end use litterbox and environmental conditions of the space? Or any combination of aforementioned possibilities... or I'm way off. Regarless, observations noted and I will look for problems in future batches   I'll make sure to add bay leaves as noted by another reviewer.          I certainly won't plan on changing anytime soon, however, even with the chance of bugs.  This stuff is wonderful.  Grew up with cats and volunteered at a shelter. Will never buy clay again   the dust is awful and the fragrance even worse.  After several years of keeping their cat's box in a storage room, my parents found there was a layer of light, perfumy dust on EVERYTHING when they pulled the boxes and began sorting items for a rummage sale. Just think about that getting circulated around the house! They did try another natural litter after my experience with Swheat Scoop and ended up switching a short time later to this  and and are very glad they did. It only sticks to the bottom when the level starts to get low   so I add more and its fine again.  I try to scoop something every other day   may be a few days in between if life gets busy, but there is still not that much odor. It clumps nicely; however, I try to scoop when I know my cat hasn't used the box in a while just to make sure that the clumps have time to set up. Never had a problem otherwise. Flushing can sometimes be a problem if I get impatient and overload the bowl and then fail to let it soak and soften for a few minutes. But this particular toilet has issues, too.          Bottom Line: Love this stuff, so do my parents; we'd recommend to anyone.
