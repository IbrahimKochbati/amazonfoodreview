I still can't believe this isn't sold at my local supermarket. We use this oil on virtually everything! Baked chicken tenders taste like fried with a little spritz of this stuff. It gives everything we put it on a buttery taste that so isn't butter. I have bought 4 units, and can expect to purchase more for not only our own use, but for gifts to our healthy friends. Thank you, Amazon, for supporting this product!
