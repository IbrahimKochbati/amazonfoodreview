I would not recommend these to ANY dog owner.  First, they are package very poorly.  Most bones are wrapped in plastic with no air inside, these come in loose plastic and therefore lose the freshness that you expect them to have.  They don't smell like regular dog bones..they smell OLD and just gross.  I bought the knee bones as well as the regular dog bones from smokehouse.  Both were gross.  Splintered very easily and were way too  ittle for a dog to chew on. Sometimes cheap things   are really just CHEAP.
