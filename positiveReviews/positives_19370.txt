I purchased the unfortunately named "Pickle Pocket" from Petco.  My two la ador retrievers have varying levels of interest in treat dispensing toys.  I like the design of this toy as it seems to be indestructable (as much as anything can be called that when you're talking about dogs) yet easy on their teeth.  The toy is about 5 inches long and has 3 grooves that you can tuck treats into.  I put some treats deep into the grooves, and leave others closer to the top.  This keeps them engaged for up to an hour, sometimes longer.          Both dogs seem to enjoy this toy very much, so much so that I am going to buy another one so they can each have one.  I paid less than the $20.99 though and $7.99 is a rip off.  This can be purchased at Petco for around $15!
