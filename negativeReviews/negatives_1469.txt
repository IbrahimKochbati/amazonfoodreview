I know what you're probably thinking: They're vegan, they're gluten free...they're a dream come true! The taste of these bars is very banana y     but I doubt you'll be able to ignor the texture long enough to enjoy that. The texture is akin to eating a handful of dirt (I'm no dirt eating pro...but when I was trying to chew that's all I kept thinking). Please...if you're thinking about trying these...go down to your local natural foods market and pick up a box there first...while you're at it you may want to get some of your favorite soymilk...and lots of it!          PS     If you're in the market for a yummy vegan bar...try the Betty Lous  and...The strawberry is super good!
