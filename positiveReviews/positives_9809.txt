Royal Oak is the very best at this moment.  There are a dozen other  ands that I have tried and, speaking as a former Virginian, this one is at the summit.  They are so large, so crunchy, and so tasty that you will insist on EATING THEM ONE AT A TIME.  The Royal Oak container is still a 40 ounce can, which was once the industry standard.  Many competitors have slipped to 36 ounces or even 32.  Be careful when you select others.  You may not be buying the number of peanuts you expected.  Don't accept any peanuts that were canned over six months ago, as they could be stale.  I am not connected with this company in any way, other than as a customer.
