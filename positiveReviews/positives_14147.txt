Ok, let's be honest. "Dogs will be dogs" and mine love just about anything edible,  but they go absolutely bonkers for these little crisps.  I feel good about giving them these as snacks or for training, for a few reasons.          First, just like the box says they're "guilt free"; made with  own rice and beef, they're wheat & gluten free, low fat and only 12 calories per treat    so I feel good about not giving them "junk food", per se.          Second, they're light & crispy    like a puffed rice, so the pups aren't being weighed down by a heavy dog biscuit full of corn & sugar.  Lastly, the dogs REALLY like crave these, so they've been a great tool for training, when I use the crisps as a positive reinforcement for good behavior.  When I'm doing repetitive action training over & over again (like teaching my one dog how to shake), I'd rather give him 10 of these than 10 pieces of hot dog or chemical laden mushy dog snacks.  These  own rice & beef Barksters accomplish both of our needs and I'm actually rewarding him with something good for his body and his spirit.
