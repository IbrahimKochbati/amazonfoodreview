We go through a lot of tea because we use four tea bags at a time to make Chai (Betty Crocker Recipe, if you want to try it, yum!). This is the best tea I've found to use. It has a great flavor, I love that it's organic, and it's very affordable. It arrives quickly, too! I highly recommend, and will continue to order regularly.
