My 1 yr old Cocker Spaniel has been having issues with anal gland problems, so I've been trying to find a food to help solidify her #2's! She also had an allergic reaction to the last  and of food. (itcy, biting and chewing her paws and scratching) This one has done the trick! Do not have to squeeze her glands as much as usual, and the itching biting has completely stopped! SO HAPPY to have found a food that is working so well for my little pup! :)
