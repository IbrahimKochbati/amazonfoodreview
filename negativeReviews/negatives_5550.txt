This was a staple in our household in my youth.  Pork was our favorite flavor, too.  Perhaps it is my aging taste buds but I felt it lacked something.  It is still a light, mild coating mix and a fast way to prepare a main dish.  Next time I use it I may add a little more spice to the mix.  I used 2 thick pork chops for this review, and will use the thinner ones next time.  They didn't get crispy enough for my preference and took longer than recommended to reach the 160 degree temp required (per the package for done).  Also, by that time they were dry, not moist inside.          One reviewer mentioned she wished it had a resealable bag.  My Amazon Vine sample did not come with any bag, but I want to caution any user about saving any of the mix that has had raw meat immersed in it.  It is a health hazard to keep it and even the box indicates it should be thrown away.  I just shook a small portion of the mix into a shallow bowl and just used enough for the 2 chops.  That way I was able to save the unused portion for another day.
