My kids loves Chips Ahoy! and I will have them once in a while as well.  But the kids refuse to eat them from this Family Size package.  Once I tasted them, I knew why.  They have an awful medicinal taste.  Really bad.  I don't what the problem is, but if you like Chips Ahoy, you will not like these.  Go elsewhere.
