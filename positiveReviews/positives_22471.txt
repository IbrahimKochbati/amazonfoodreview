We use this popcorn in our popcorn popper (Roosevelt Popper from Discount Tommy) and it makes the best popcorn.  Everyone who comes over for movie night says it is the best popcorn they have ever had.  We tried some other kinds, but now just buy this popcorn.  It is easy to make since everything is included in one bag.  Just cut off the top and dump in.  I highly recommend this popcorn
