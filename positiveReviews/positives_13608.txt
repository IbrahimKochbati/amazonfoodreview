Finding high quality decaffeinated teas in a variety of flavors was something of a chore during my pregnancy so, naturally, I was thrilled to find this winner.          I've tried many vanilla teas, both decaffeinated and caffeinated, and it's often hard to find one with a really high quality vanilla flavor.  This tea succeeds on all counts.  The vanilla is rich and aromatic.  Immediately upon opening the tin, the superior quality of the vanilla becomes apparent in the delicious odor.  Once  ewed, this is a very rich cup that benefits from the addition of just a touch of honey or sugar to really enhance the sweetness of the vanilla.  It's delectable.  This is one tea that's worth every penny.
