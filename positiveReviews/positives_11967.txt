We have been using these dog treats for a long time.  The dogs love them a lot!  You cannot go wrong with these because they are all natural.     The only thing that I would say is a little disappointing about them is that some of the pieces are very small making them no good as treats.  You end up with liver "dust" when the larger pieces are used.  I generally take this "dust" and mix it into home made dog food for extra flavor.  Therefore, no product gets wasted.
