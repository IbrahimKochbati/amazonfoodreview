the friends who introduced me to this don't even eat gluten free but they use this as their chocolate chip cookie mix because they think this is the best chocolate chip cookie you can make!          I love this mix!!! It is also way, way better than Bob's Red Mill's gluten free chocolate chip cookie mix (which is too bad, because I really like them & most of their products)          great texture, great flavor, great density (not solid but not too airy)
