I'm not into white chocolate much  but with the sale price, I figured I'd give it a try.  This is soooo much better than I expected.  Note that it's a white chocolate covered protein bar  but the inside of the actual bar is NOT white chocolate.  It's a mild  own chocolatey coconut flavor.  I didn't expect it  but LOVE it!  If you're not into coconut, you may still want to try it.  It's not boldly strong  it has a perfect balance!  Again, exceeded my expectations!!!
