Our dog hurt her neck and had to take 3 pain pills a day, so these were a godsend!  She does think they're treats and whined for more so I had to hide them so she could rest and get her mind off of them.  These are $.26 apiece, so you can price them and buy larger quantities on here if you need them for everyday use.  I'm relieved that there is such a product that dogs like so they can take their pills and capsules.  Highly recommend these!
