Wow, I DID NOT EXPECT such a quick, shocking result from this product, but it definitely delivers!!! My  other told me about these tablets and the "flavor tripping" parties. I had never heard of them before, but decided to give it a try just because the claim sounded so wildly strange, a sort of "Ripley's Believe it or not" kind of novelty.     Anyway, the tablets WORK immediately. I just took one, had a lemon, and voila': it's SWEET! I also tried a sip of Chianti wine.. SWEET.... I poured a spoonful of white vinegar in a small glass of water... SWEET... I haven't tried beer or other things, but sooner or later I will!     The best thing I see coming out of this is that I FINALLY don't need to sweeten my tea! I'll just squeeze a lemon in and that will be that.     Hmmm... perhaps I can add lemon juice to soda water and it can turn into a new diet soft drink!! The possibilities are endless!
