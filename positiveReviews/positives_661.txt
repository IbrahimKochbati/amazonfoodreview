Having eaten (and re eaten) my way though all of the DAS caramel range, this remains my all time favorite, and the one that usually gets the most rave reviews when I share them (which isn't an easy thing to do   just try one and you'll see what I mean).  I've been a caramel fan for ages, and while Werthers Butterscotch will do in a pinch, nothing has come closer to what my mother used to make than these.  They are chewy, buttery, and the little crunches of salt are spectacular (OK my mother didn't put salt in hers, this is an improvement).
