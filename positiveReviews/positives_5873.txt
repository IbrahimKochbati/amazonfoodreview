My baby has had digestive issues from birth. At 12 months I put her on this product and immediately saw improvement.  It didn't take long for her to accept it either.  I found a recipe on the Dr. Sears website for making goats milk formula for infants and would have tried it when she was younger. TIP: This powder doesn't dissolve in water as easily as regular formula. Make a days worth of milk ahead of time and use a wire wisk to mix it.
