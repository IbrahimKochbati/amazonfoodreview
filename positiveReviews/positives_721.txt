The Rice and Lentil dinner is our son's absolute favorite. I don't know why but he gobbles this up every time. He enjoys most of the Earth's Best foods and we have only found a couple he doesn't eat (anything with too much apple) which is more a personal taste issue than the  and or particular combination. Some of the varieties tend to be too runny but this one has a great consistency right out of the jar.
