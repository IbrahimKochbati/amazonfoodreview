Ended up with a case of the Stephen's chocolate rasberry and a case of the Stephen's French Vanilla     "cocoa."  I really wanted to believe the 100% positive feedback on here, but you should never believe     what you read, right?     I guess the 1st thing I look for in a cocoa is that the liquid has some body to it. This seemed just     watery and weak....it looks like a no fat soymilk.          It kind of makes me think of baby formula...........the other reviewer who said like a hot vanilla     milkshake is close to describing it but it is not creamy enough in my opinion to qualify as such.....          I added MORE than the recommended amount for the serving size and it was still just so so.          I am just not impressed with the way the powder globbed together and     clumped and stuck to the spoon~yuk.     $5 a can for 12 serving when you can get the packets of the standard cocoa for 99 cents on sale for     the same amount of servings?     Granted, Amazon's price is better than the manufactures website since there is NO shipping through     here and shipping is at a premium through Stephen's Gourmet.     I would say unless you have tried this somehow elsewhere first, do not bother wasting your money to buy     6lbs of cocoa mix at one time. You might end up doing what I will have to do when you don't like it.     sigh     give it away~
