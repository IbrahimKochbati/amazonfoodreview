Every evening, after the dogs (we have three) have finished their dinner and taken an outside romp, they know when they come in that we'll be giving each of them one of these chews.  They come inside, make a circle around whoever is giving the chews out, and sit politely.  As each is given his chew for the night, he'll go to his chosen spot and begin chewing on the rawhide.  It's funny to watch, but we know they are each getting enzymes they need and exercise for their teeth and gums.  An excellent choice, and sold by our vet, which is the best recommendation I know.  We buy ours through Amazon because we've searched the internet time and again, and only here do we find the best price.
