My primary point with this review is to note that this packaging is less expensive than the other size offered by Folger. You get more coffee for less money.            I recently started drinking coffee again after a lapse of many years. Since I didn't know how many cups a day I would use, I wanted to avoid the fuss of a coffeemaker. I don't particularly like instant coffee. I was delighted to find these Folger's bags.            They  ew a very nice tasting cup of coffee. I'm not any kind of coffee expert, so I don't know what special terms might be used. All I know is that if I let the bag seep for a bit more than a minute, it sure tastes good. Thanks to my very much better half, I've also learned that each of these bags will produce at least two good cups of coffee.            Very convenient, very easy, very tasty. I intend to take some of these with me when I travel as an alternative to the in room coffee makers or (yeck!) vending machines.          Jerry
