I don't read every label on every drink or food I consume. I understand the switch philosophy and can appreciate the idea. I must say that if you are really health conscious and want to consume what's good for your body then you would stick with mostly filtered water and natural 100% juices that are fresh that day. With that being said I do know that everyone in my family liked the switch drink and this particular flavor (kiwi berry). I now see switch in supermarkets and have purchased a few  single cans at lunch on occasion. I don't see myself purchasing in bulk however, as they are kind of expensive.
