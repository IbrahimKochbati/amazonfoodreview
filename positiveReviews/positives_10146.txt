They kind of have an acquired consistency that you need to get used to. The texture reminds me sort of like cooked mushrooms. They have a slightly rubbery snap to them. The first time I tried them I hated them. I started the Atkins diet and now that I never eat chips or pasta I have learned to get used to them, then I started really liking them. The first time I boiled them way too long and the recipe I made with them wasn't good. Just mix in RAGU and pour cheese on top and you have guilt free spaghetti. I even took Alfredo sauce which usually has like 3 carbs per serving? mixed that in there, fast, simple, and NO CARBS it's crazy. The fact that they are so guilt free made me have an acquired taste for them. Being that they are tofu, they would totally taste amazing fried up in stir fry, the texture would work well for that most definitely. So give them a couple tries, or check out some good recipies online and take your time with them, they are worth it.
