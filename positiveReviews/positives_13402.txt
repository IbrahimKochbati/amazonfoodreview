I will continue to order Newman's Own Extra bold again and again.  It's strong yet has no bitter taste.  I've tried so many other coffee...and like many of the Coffee People blends, but this is organic along with having such a wonderful flavor. Plus.... everyone in the family kept using up the Newman's K cups and leaving all the other  ands. So I gave up on having a variety and just order the Newman's.
