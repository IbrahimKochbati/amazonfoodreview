While the fat in peanut butter is not all that bad for you, the calories can add up when trying to lose weight.  This powder was surprisingly good.  Mixed with the water on the directions, it tasted wonderful.  No added sugars, and minus the fat.  Great for smoothies, and drinks where you want that flavor without the calories.  I will be ordering again, and trying it in some recipes.  Only negative is that the 6.5 oz can is very small, and I will be buying a larger one next time.
