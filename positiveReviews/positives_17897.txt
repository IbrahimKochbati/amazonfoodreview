Shake N Bake is my son's favorite, ever since he was a toddler he has loved it. He's a senior in high school and his birthday dinner *still* must be Shake N Bake. Be it chicken or pork chops, he doesn't care, his only requirement is a coating of Shake N Bake!          Whenever we have to feed a large group at once, my favorite way to make Shake N Bake is to coat your meat of choice with whatever flavor of Shake N Bake you have handy (they work equally well with any meat). Melt a stick of butter or margarine or even pour some olive oil into the bottom of your casserole dish, and bake the meat according to package directions (turning about halfway through). Your food will come out with a crispy coating and a juicy, delicious flavor!          If you need topping for a casserole or mac n cheese, a sprinkling of Shake N Bake on top will serve in a pinch as well.
