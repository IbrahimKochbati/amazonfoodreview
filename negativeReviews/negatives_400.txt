Good texture: they are crunchy and not sharp (will not cut mouth)          Flavor: They do not taste like potato chips. If I had not just opened the bag I would suspect they were stale. But no this is how they taste. Many others have remarked about the odd flavor as well.          Healthy: good for dieting I suppose, low oil, and low salt          I will not be buying these again.
