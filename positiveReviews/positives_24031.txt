All of their chips are GREAT, but these pepper ones are my absolute favorite. (In order of preference: pepper, regular, barbecue, vinegar   haven't tried garlic.) The flavor reminds me of a baked potato, but spicy (not TOO hot). I can't get enough of them! The bonus is the low fat and calorie count, so I can munch without guilt   what a deal!
