These are the best chips I have ever tasted.  I usually don't eat chips because they're gawd awful in every way (taste, oils, artificial stuff, salt, etc.).  From Doritos to all the "healthy" chips I've tried all thru my life, nothing really caught my attention.  I usually could never finish a bag of chips.  I've been a vegetarian for 20 yrs, vegan for the last 5 and RAW Fruitarian for the last 3 months, so I had given up processed cooked foods for quite a while now (w  no regrets).  However, the other day, my mom got me to try these stating they couldn't be too unhealthy when they're chalk full of Flax, Sunflower, Sesame, Brown Rice, Quinoa & Soy!  Now, I'm a RAW Fruitarian, w  the exception of these  they're my secret sin.
