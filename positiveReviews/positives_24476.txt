A blessing!  My yorkie has many allergies, and when I saw these I was ecstatic. Not only does she now have a "chewie," she loves them!  And I don't have to worry about allergies.  I also have a Norfolk, but let it suffice to say that he eats like that snouty animal and is not so particular, so I get the sweet potato chips for him and he actually CHEWS them.  I love this product!!
