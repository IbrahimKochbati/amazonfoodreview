I didn't read the reviews thoroughly and found out too late that this product has enough sugar to give it 60 calories and 11 grams of carbohydrate in each cup. I tried one with a bit of cream and found it to be very tasty. I'll keep it around for friends and family or perhaps an occasional mini splurge. I'd like to see amazon include nutritional info in the future.
