This is a great tasting hemp protein powder.  I decided to stop using muscle milk because of the artificial sweetener and the issues surrounding absorption of whey protein.  I found that muscle milk, which tasted great, was giving me indigestion and well.......let's just say gut issues.  This Nutiva hemp shake is very smooth and has a great flavor, not chalky or gritty at all in my opinion.  I have no issues digesting the shake and I'm thrilled to be getting protein that is easily digestible.  A simple shake recipe is included on the tub which tastes great, but I've been using this powder as the base for my morning kale shake.  I find that the Nutiva really masks the grassy kale taste; My morning shake has been transformed from something I had to force down to something I look forward to and enjoy every morning!          Here is my kale protein shake recipe           1 serving of Nutiva Hemp Shake powder (3 tablespoons)     1 cup coconut water     2 3 large organic kale leaves (red kale or normal kale) torn into small pieces, I  eak off and discard the last 1" of stem     Approximately 8 spinach leaves with stems     1 whole banana, peeled     1 heaping tablespoon of peanut butter     1 piece of raw ginger, the size of 3 4 stacked quarters     1 2 apple     small handful of ice      add more coconut water or ice if it's too thick          Hint  start by blending the kale and spinach with the coconut water to create a smooth veggie consistency before adding the other ingredients
