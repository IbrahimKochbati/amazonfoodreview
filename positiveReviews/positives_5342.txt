This product works exactly as  it is advertised.  No more rinsing wire baskets.  The coffe is as good as the already filled k cups that you buy in the store.  It's nice to just throw the whole thing in the trash when done and not clog the sink.  Couldn't be happier as it gives me unlimited choices for coffee and  it saves money too!  Amazon is great!
