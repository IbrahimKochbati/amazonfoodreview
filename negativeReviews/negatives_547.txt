Honestly, I'm not sure why so many folks like this coffee in their reviews.  It's a little weak but mostly just doesn't have a rich flavor.  It is really missing something.  I drink coffee black.  Maybe it tastes better with cream and sugar?  Before buying this coffee, I had been drinking Starbuck's French Roast and Folger's Black Silk, both of which taste SO MUCH better than this coffee.
