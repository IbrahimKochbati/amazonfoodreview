I've tried a few of the different energy shots, and found that the "5 hour energy" have a flowery note (lavender?) in all of their flavours.          I can't say I like it. The _effect_ is ok, but the flavour is like bad flat orange pop, and is otherwise uninspiring. I think I'd prefer the more standard 'berry' flavour of other shots vs this one.
