I enjoyed the popcorn at our minor league ballpark so much that I was craving it even when we weren't heading to the games! Then we moved, and I admit I panicked a little bit   great addictive popcorn is 'few and far between'. I sent email to the ballpark, and the concessions manager gave me all the information about the  and of popcorn they were using. It was very exciting to find out I could order the same all n one packs from Amazon!     I have been thrilled with the 2.5 ounce size... it's the perfect size for a popcorn loving snacker. More than one snacker? Open 2 or 3 packs! Easy to make on the stovetop or microwave. I'm back to order more!!
