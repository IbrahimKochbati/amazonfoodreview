This is just like the smooth, reduced fat Skippy peanut butter you would buy in stores.          These are the "small" 16.3 ounce size, but the price is a good deal   or at least it was when I bought it.          Sure, even reduced fat peanut butter is not the healthiest thing on earth, but it's certainly healthier than some of the alternatives.
