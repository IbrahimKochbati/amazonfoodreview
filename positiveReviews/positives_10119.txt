My wife is a coffee snob ( she calls herself that too) and we have  owsed Amazon for K cups for  a couple years, We must have purchased every dark French Roast there is. All the coffee was good but just was not "it" until we ordered this coffee. Finally a coffee dark, bold enough yet smooth and not bitter. She even runs it thru the machine twice and still gets a good cup of coffee. May cost a little more than others we have purchased but well worth it. Now when re ordering I can just go to my last coffe order and re order same. Simple, quick and satisfing. Plus it has a cool picture of the Eifle Tower on the box.
