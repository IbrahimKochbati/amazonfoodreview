We usually have a case of Orville Redenbacher Microwave Popcorn in the pantry for snacks. We prefer such things as popcorn and nuts much better than candy, and I think they are much better for you. It, after all, is just corn with a few flavors and we try to keep the flavoring to a minimus. Plus, it has a lot of fiber. The popping is perfect every time. We just set our microwave on "popcorn" and it comes out just fine with no further adjustment. We bought this 40 pack box of Orville Redenbacher's Smart Pop at our local Costco warehouse store. We expect it will provide good snacks, have a good shelf life and last a long time.          I might add, our young boy (three) just loves to go over to nearby Lake Murray and feed the ducks, coots and geese. We pop up a couple bage of microwave popcorn and let him stroll around and feeding the birds. He loves it. The birds seem to enjoy it too.          Gary Peterson
