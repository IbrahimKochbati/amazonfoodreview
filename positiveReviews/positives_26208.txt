I love Valerian and I love it's earthy smell! But just because a previous reviewer hated the smell and threw a tantrum, (which is ironic because Valerian is used for its relaxing properties) doesn't mean it doesn't work! Keep that in mind when making your decision to purchase a natural product! Valerian is not like raw garlic! It's simply a very safe and effective herb which, to me, has a wonderful smell!
