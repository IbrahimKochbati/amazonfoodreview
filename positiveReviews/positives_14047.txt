This was recommended to us from a friend at weight watchers as a lower fat peanut butter alternative. It works very nicely for that: Mix with water and you've got yourself a spreadable peanut butter that's much lower in fat and pretty satisfying.  But we've also used it a couple other ways that have been fantastic.          Making chocolate covered peanut butter balls (Buckeyes): Use some of this instead of powdered sugar to increase the peanut flavor and reduce the oversweetness of some recipes.          Take a teaspoon of it and add to chocolate ice cream.  It's excellent.          This is a great product not only as a low fat peanut butter option, but also for many different desert recipes (and maybe some non desert recipes).
