My dogs had to be on food with limited ingredients for a while and this was the best of the types I tried. The dogs ate it easily (although without great gusto) and it helped us get through the medical issues that precipitated our use of it.  Vet recommended. I wouldn't use for day to day dog food, since other flavors without " limited ingredients" appeal to the dogs more.
