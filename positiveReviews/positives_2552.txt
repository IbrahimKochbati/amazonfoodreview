I see a lot of complaints about Grove Square hot chocolate. I think it tastes ok considering it's a k cup, not homemade and not gourmet. I don't have anything negative to say the company or the product, it's relatively inexpensive and the company didn't falsely advertise or make any promises about the taste.
