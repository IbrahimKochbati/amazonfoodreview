I may not do much well, but people have complemented me on my coffee for over 40 years. I like a strong, rich coffee but hate the acidy taste that some coffees have. I've been grinding fresh beans for about 25 years, instead of grinding them at the store or buying ground coffee. I think it makes the coffee taste a little fresher and with less acid.          I served the Melitta Classique Supreme Ground Coffee to guests last Sunday and everyone really liked the rich taste and I didn't have to make it stronger; I measured it properly and got a really rich coffee. It is good but... I can taste a slight hint of acidy after taste that I don't get with my Starbucks beans.          I'd say that, if you don't grind your coffee bean before  ewing each pot, then this coffee is as good or better than most ground coffees. The convenience of having it delivered and sent by Amazon are real pluses.
