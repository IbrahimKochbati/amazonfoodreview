It was always hard for me to buy this product locally   perhaps because it's so popular! I find these little chia seeds a good way to sneak in some extra nutrition and add some "fill" to my smoothies (otherwise all fruit + water or OJ). I've snuck them into other things too   oatmeal, salad, soups. If you add it to something wet, just note that the tiny seeds (think poppy seeds) will "swell" and turn a bit gummy. This isn't a big deal, but it changed the taste of my absolute favorite soup... so I don't think I'll try it in that one again (lentil). I drink my smoothies quick, so I add these as the last step, and I don't think they have much time to swell. The seeds themselves are pretty tasteless to me, just little black dots. WARNING: THEY WILL STICK IN YOUR TEETH! Seriously. These are an "at home" item only   when I can  ush my teeth or swish well after. Don't try them at work, or before a big meeting, etc. Overall, I don't think they have changed my world... but a good little supplement boost, and Amazon had them easy to get, and a great price compared to my local market. I took off a star because of the tooth concerns... but otherwise I wasn't expecting magic. They met my expectations and came fresh and well packaged.
