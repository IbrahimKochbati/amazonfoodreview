These are some of the best tasting sardines we have ever had and the size is very impressive. There are about four large taste sardines per can.  I was lucky to get these from Amazon when they had them in stock it they came quickly and the the use by date is two years away, not that they will last that long as they are so good just right out of the can that we nearly eaten up our order. The sardines are caught off of California, but processed elsewhere just in case your wondering but as another reviewer noted try finding a processor in the US is almost impossible, even here in the Monterey Bay.  In closing great sardines, but wait till Amazon has them in stock for a great price.
