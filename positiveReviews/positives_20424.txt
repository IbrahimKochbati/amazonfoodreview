This is some fabulous honey.  It absolutely delights my tastebuds.  However, it is definitely not truly "raw".  It for sure has been heated, but who knows to what temperature.  Hopefully not so high that it destroyed the beneficial enzymes.  Extremely delicious high quality honey at a great price.  If you are like me when it comes to honey, better to buy in bulk.  5 stars in my book,  )
