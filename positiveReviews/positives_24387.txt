I bought the initial treat ball at my vet's office, and after it kept my golden busy for a LONNNNNG time I knew I had to find the refills cheaper than they sell them! She LOVES them   when she sees me get it out of the package she follows me nosing my hand trying to sneak it out of my hand. She works at them for awhile, and pops them out of the treat ball, but they still keep her busy. Would be excellant for dogs in crates.     :)
