This product is not a soda but a carbonated juice. This soda has a nice taste  its not as sweet and as pure orange tasting as typical orange soda like drinks. It's not pure orange juice  but made up of a mixture of several different juices including apple, orange, grape and tangerine.  That juice blend gives it a slightly tangy taste that is actually at first slightly surprising and mostly refreshing.  The carbonation also seems lighter to me than soda but it is definitely there.          The things I like about this product are the smaller can size (8.3oz)which makes it a more appropriate serving that a regular soda.  I also like the  ight packaging and the pleasant taste.  After reading the ingredients of SWITCH carefully  I see that it is all juice just as it claims  so its probably a better choice than a regular soda.          This product has no added sugars just as advertised on the can  but buyer beware  its still kind of high in sugar because fruit juices are naturally high in sugar. As always be sure to read the label if you are concerned about sugar levels.          Overall I think this product is a good size and has a pleasant taste  especially if you are looking for something that tastes like an orange juice blend.  Traditional orange soda fans might be slightly disappointed in the taste.
