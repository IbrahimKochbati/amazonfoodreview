My dog has been eating this food for the last three years.  Every food I fed him before this caused smelly gas problems.  He almost never has gas on this food.  Also, people often comment on how good he smells.  However, when he goes to grandma's and eats junk food for a week or two he always comes home smelling like a dog.  It's totally the food.  On top of that, he loves it.  Love it!
