The only difference I can see between using this blend and using  own sugar is that you don't get the usual "sugar rush" when you eat the result.  Cookies and pies made with this Splenda blend   which does contain some sugar   taste the exactly the same as they did before.  Great stuff!  And it's gluten free too.
