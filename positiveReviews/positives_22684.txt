It's hard to order anything on the internet and be confident enough that you got a good product, let alone a great food product. Initially, I ordered this popcorn because of it's great price and relevance to what I needed, and ended up really enjoying it for the taste! The butter's consistency is hard when I received it in the mail, though it melts right up in the popper and YUM! We had great popcorn.....
