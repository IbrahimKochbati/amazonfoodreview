I bought Nutiva organic chia seeds before, two pouches 14 ounces each   $16.24 with tax, this  and in one 16 ounce pouch $14.83. The quality and the taste are the same, but the latter one is WAY much more expensive. Buy Nutiva Organic Chia seeds, not Navitas. In terms of the taste, I usually toast mine and add them everywhere   cereal, yogurt, oatmeal, etc. Tastes great and full of fiber.
