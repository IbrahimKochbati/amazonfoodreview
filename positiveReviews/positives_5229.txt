This is a nice, light, refreshing carbonated fruit juice. It's something like Orangina, but far more natural tasting    which makes sense, because unlike Orangina, it's all juice and has no added sweetener.          My only complaint is that the 8.3 ounce can is rather small; I generally prefer a larger drink. It's definitely not a bargain if you have to drink two cans at a time.
