This product is great. I have never tried any liquor filled chocolate candies chocolates but I got to say, these were a great little surprise. I am not good at describing food or candy, but these were little bottle shapped chocolates that are filled with liquid, which is nicely mixed with liquor. Some of these were stronger than others in a sense that some of them you can really feel instantly, while others you only taste chocolate.          I shared these with my friends and they seem really happy when they tried it. There are four different chocolates. I would definitely recommend this to everybody. You just have to be careful, these chocolates have liquor in them so use at caution. Great little gift...for myself :)
