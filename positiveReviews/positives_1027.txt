This was my first time ordering raw cacao powder and I was pleasantly surprised!  The item was packed and shipped professionally and I love the resealable bag.  I initially tasted the cacao by dipping my finger in the bag and I didn't taste anything.  I then placed two tablespoons in my homemade vegetable fruit juice which normally tastes like bananas...  I was pleasantly surprised because it now tasted like a bona fide chocolate shake!  This is one of the best deals you'll find (online) on certified organic raw cacao and it tastes great.  This is one of the healthiest foods in the world and I recommend this seller if you're looking to purchase it.
