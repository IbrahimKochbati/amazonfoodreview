This has been great dog food.  We have been feeding our very stomach sensitive pooch this for over a year and notice an incredible difference.  Not to be too descriptive, but the stomach gurgling and smells have totally ceased.  We are no longer kicking our pooch out of the living room because we can't  eath.          My only concern is Amazon's packing on this product which often comes  oken open and taped.  I have responded several times regarding a change being needed.  However with Amazon's customer satisfaction team they have always made the wrong righted very quickly if needed.
