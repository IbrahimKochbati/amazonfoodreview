The tea tin is guarding the aroma very well.     The taste is beautiful: the Malva flowers do soften the taste and the amount of bergamot is just right.     The first time I used too much tea and soaked it for too long (I used as reference Darjeeling FTGFOP First Flush).     Since then I save on the quantity of tea leaves and soak the tea for only two minutes.     A delight: the best Earl Grey I ever had. The price is very competitive.
