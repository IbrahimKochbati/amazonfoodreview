I saw these in our local commissary one day and decided I *had* to give them a try.  I was only looking for something that might be a better for me choice to satisfy my sweet tooth.  I had no idea how much I would like these and have to have *more*.  I got one bag of the Raspberry and one bag of the Maple and I love them both!!!  I'm thrilled to see that they are a much healthier alternative than most baked goods, especially than the ones I normally choose.  I am not someone who is health consious or tends to read labels before buying an item.  I love these twists and am looking to buy them in a larger quantity so I can enjoy them more often!  They are light and flaky and satisfying and good...a must for me!
