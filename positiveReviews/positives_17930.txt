I do love pork chops but I cook most of mine by frying or in my rice cooker. But this gives me an excuse to try something different. Now this package does not come with a bag to "shake" in, so you will need a zip lock bag. Also one word of warning! You are better off using unfrozen pork chops. Even after defrosting them there will be too much moisture in the meat and your shake & bake coating will be mushy.          The  eaded coating has a little seasoning, but not too much. Each time I used a package, there was more than enough for all the chops. It baked without burning the  eading and was easy to clean up. One of the nice things about the "shake in a bag" aspect is that you can add more seasoning if you wish. It will take a little trial and error to get it right for you, but it is always easier to add than to take back.
