I have used this  and of Parmesan exclusively now for four years, since I discovered it and I will never use any other Parmesan.  Its delightful, salty enough to replace the salt shaker.  I highly recommend using a microplane on this cheese to  ing out the flavor and to provide great food coverage in a fine thin layer.          Ecstacy on steamed  occoli, a solid partner for any pasta dish.          And bonus!!  Its Made in the USA.
