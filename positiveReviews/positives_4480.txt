To purchase this many vanilla beans for the price is great.     I've not split any of them yet, but they look nice and plump     the way a good bean should look. I have them all soaking in     a big jar of vodka to make vanilla. In six months, I should have     some pretty good quality vanilla, and will still be able to use     the vanilla beans for other things.
