This coffee is really, really delicious, quality tasting and fresh, but it does NOT wake me up.  Doesn't seem to have much caffeine.  If I drink some in the afternoon before work, I notice no difference in energy.  I just found out today that there is actually more caffeine in light roast coffee, so I'm gonna get Starbucks Breakfast Blend.
