I've been using agave for a few years now and before discovering it here on Amazon I'd generally go with what was on sale locally. I've tried several  ands and most are "good" but this Madhava Light works the best for me in things like white tea or coffee where you want just the *sweet* with as little added flavor to it as possible.          This  and also tends to be easier to find locally so I can compare prices and frequently get a really good deal from the smaller to this larger size.          Very pleased with this product and highly recommended!
