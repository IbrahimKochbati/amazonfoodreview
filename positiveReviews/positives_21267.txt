these are like catnip to my wife. if you turn your back for a minute, it'll just be her and a bunch of empty wrappers.          my best advise would be ordering them in cooler weather, but i've not ordered any in summer to verify heat damage. but mailboxes, ups fedex trucks and planes, front door step, none of these are climate controlled.          and they are melt in your mouth yummynummy chocolates.
