I am a person who has NEVER drank tea.  I've tried many different teas and have never liked any.  I also have moderate stomach issues so thought I'd try this tea.  I will admit it took me a couple cups of tea to get hooked, but once I did I found the taste wonderful and the calming effect on my stomach is a big help.  I drink one cup every night after dinner.  If I'm away from home I  ing some tea bags with me.
