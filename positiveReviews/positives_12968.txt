Switch Kiwi Berry is quite delicious, the flavor is very enjoyable.          The only complaint I would have with this product is the addition of "natural flavors" which unfortunately is a very misleading term and can be very unhealthy substances but we don't know what they might be hidden under this generic term the government allows manufacturers to use.          Still, from the ingredient list, this appears to be far healthier than almost all carbonated drinks currently being sold.
