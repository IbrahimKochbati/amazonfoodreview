The good thing about the Chipotle flavor is generally that the smoked jalapenos are a bit milder and more flavorful than regular (raw) jalapenos.  That is NOT the case with this powder.  This "Chili Chipotle Powder" is HOT HOT HOT, and seriously lacking in flavor.          The other thing is that this is an extremely fine grind, so when I sprinkle it into a sauce, enough of it enters the air and I end up inhaling it, and it feels like I'm burning my nose.  YUCK!          Stick with a plain old generic "chili powder" instead of this.
