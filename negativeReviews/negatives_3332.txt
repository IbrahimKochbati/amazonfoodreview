My 35 lb dog could not  eak these treats by chewing on them. She gave up after only a minute or so and decided to look elsewhere for a treat.          I was unable to  eak the treats in two even though they are scored across the middle.          My toy  eed dog thought it was fun to play with, but he couldn't get much headway trying to chew it either, and never ate it.          They need come out with something soft!
