We tried these and they were bland and had no redeeming qualities. We sauteed them slightly and also tried them as is shaved. The price as some have mentioned reflects what you get for truffles.  Spend your money on white truffle oil you'll be much happier, we are.  Also wait for the white truffles to come in from Italy, I would not knock JR as a company but would not recommend this offering.
