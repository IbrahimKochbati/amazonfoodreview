We have been using "original" Spike since 1989.  It's great for marinating chicken, steak and pork and as a substitute for baked potatoes and corn on the cob.  We use it on just about everything.  The product incorporates dozens of natural ingredients and altogether create great flavor that is better than Dash and other similar products.  Our guests always ask "what did you use" and have begun purchasing it for themselves.  It's not easy to find at your grocery store; sometimes placed in the international section, sometimes in the spice section.  We're very happy to have found it sold on Amazon.   "
