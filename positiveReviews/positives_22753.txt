I purchased a 6oz popcorn machine so of course I thought I 'd give this pre measured product a try. When following direct instructions off of the Great Northern product you will be left with 20 40% kernals unpopped which is VERY disappointing.          The fix for this is to only pop half of the contents (salt, oil, and kernals) one time around and then to make a 2nd batch with the remaining half. Annoying? Yes. But this will reduce your unpopped kernals from 20 40% remaining to about 5% or less.          This  and taste amazing but I will botch it a star for this small issue.
