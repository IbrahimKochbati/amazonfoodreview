Jones Gourmet products are made in USA by a family business with USDA inspected products. These tendons are just as long lasting as the bully sticks, but have NO SMELL (even the "odorless" bully sticks still stink.)     She loves these things, and they seem to be a good safe chew for her.     I can get them locally at a better price, but if I couldn't, I would     get them here.
