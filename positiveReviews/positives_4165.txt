Organic foods are probably most important the first couple of years of life. That is when so much  ain development is happening that trying to keep as much pesticides as possible away from your child's developing  ain and body is a very worthy goal.          Fortunately it is a little easier than it is for a grown up. With our more varied foods and time constraints and on the go, etc. Also no matter how worthy a goal, your child has to eat the food. This is an excellent combination of flavors that I was not always able to find at local stores. And with subscribe and save it is cheaper and delivered to my door.          The flavors are vegetable turkey which lists the ingredients as Water, organic carrots, organic apples, organic ground turkey, organic whole barley flour.          Sweet potato and chicken: Water, organic sweet potatoes, organic apricot puree, mechanically separated organic chicken, organic  own rice flour.          Summer vegetable: Water, organic corn, organic zucchini, organic green beans, organic  own rice, organic carrots, organic garbanzo beans, organic canola oil.          Rice and Lentil: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, organic  own rice, organic lentils, organic canola oil          There are other Earth Best blends where water is not the number one ingredient. Obviously that somewhat calls into the question the 'value' of this particular Earth's best item. I just found the tomato and carrot one which I have ordered but not received yet.  Also if you put in organic baby food in Amazon search there are some  ands with just food in them for example Peter Rabbit organics (have not yet tried it, but might when she is a bit older).          Overall though I do recommend this variety pack. Our daughter likes them all and she is getting organic ingredients. And for a decent price, even considering the amount of water in them. The water being first in all 4 is giving me pause as to the overall value and definitely something I will keep in mind as to trying other  ands going forward. The ingredient lists are all directly from the Earth Best's website, earthsbest.com,  as I do not have the products in front of my right now.
