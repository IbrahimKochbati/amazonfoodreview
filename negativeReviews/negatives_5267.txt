I've bought many Annie's products, including another type of mac & cheese, so I was expecting to like this item as well.  I eat whole grain pasta all the time and love it.  With this product, I think it was more the cheese sauce than the pasta that turned me off.  I found it watery and didn't think there was enough of it, although I'm not sure if having more of something I didn't really like would be an improvement.          I'll stick to other kinds of mac & cheese and skip this in the future.
