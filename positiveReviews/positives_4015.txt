Until recently I thought that coffee was coffee but apparently it's not that simple. Drinking coffee can either be an good habit for the environment or a very bad one.          The good news is, Going Green is easy! Look for the certification by environmental watch dogs like the Rainforest Alliance and keep up the demand for Arabica (uh RA bih kuh) or Rainforest Blend coffee; just ask for them at your local grocery store or favorite coffee house.          GoGreenMart&More voted Yuban as a Product of the Week because the great taste helps wake you in the morning and protects the environment as well.
