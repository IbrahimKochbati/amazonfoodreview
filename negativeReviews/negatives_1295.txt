I have never received anything like this from amazon before. The product was packed in an old used golf ball box(bizarre). The cans were all dented and old looking. The bowls were chipped up. I thought, oh well, maybe the soup will taste good. Wrong!Three different flavors but they were all awful, completely inedible. All of them were horribly fishy and metallic tasting, the worst canned soups I have ever tasted in my life. Poured them all out and donated the chipped bowls to charity. Complete waste of money.
