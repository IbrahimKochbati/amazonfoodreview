A few years ago, my wife was on a new medication that would make her sick all the time.  We were on vacation and she was in our room throwing up all day.  I walked over to the Whole Foods next door to see if I could find anything that might make her feel any better, when I stumbled upon this while just looking around the tea aisle.  I'm not really much of a natural remedies kind of guy and don't worship crystals... but this just seemed to be too much of a coincidence.  I had to try...!  I made her some back at the room and she felt much better in just a few minutes!  Over the following months, I would make her a cup whenever she was feeling badly.  It really worked!          Later, over the years, we recommended or gave this to friends and acquaintances struggling with nausea.  We gave it to one lady who was pregnant and having awful morning sickness.  It worked so well for her, she went right out and bought her own supply!          This week, my wife is sick again and we ran out. I couldn't find any locally!  I checked Amazon and found this six pack to be way cheaper then the $4.99 per box I typically would pay.  It arrived quickly and my wife is feeling much better.
