This is great popcorn!  No extras needed. Just dump it all in and let the popper do the rest. This is as good if not better than the movies!!!!! I see bad reviews for unpopped corn but I have very few with "Great Northern Popcorn" in the Stir Crazy popper! The corn pops so big that the top of the popper rises up and spills some on the counter.
