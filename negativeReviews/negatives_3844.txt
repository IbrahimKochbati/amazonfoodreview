My husband and I tried the Orange Tangerine version of Switch, and also picked up this can of Kiwi Berry.  I thought we'd like the orange better, but we both ended up loving this Kiwi Berry.          The taste is a perfect blend of tangy kiwi with smooth berry blended underneath.  This could be a heavy and sharp flavor without the sparkling water added, but together this is a very flavorful and refreshing drink.          Our only disappointment was in the small size (8.3 oz) for the price.  This is very good tasting stuff, but I don't know how often we'll pay this much for a sip of goodness.
