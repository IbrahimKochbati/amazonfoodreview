I'm about 6 months in to my transition to becomming vegan.  Every once in a while I think of something that I "miss".  All week I was craving Mac and Cheese but since I stopped eating the meat and dairy, my body has stopped knowing how to process those foods.  Soooo, I couldn't "cheat" and eat Mac and Cheese.  I was in the Gluten Free aisle at Central Market searching for pastas when I stumbled upon this.  I took it home and after about 25 minutes of my husband picking on me, I tried it out.  Ooooh Eeeeem Gheeee was it incredible!     I even stuffed some in my husband's mouth...he promptly requested more   to which I replied, Absolutely not :)     I had to come on Amazon and buy a whole set so going forward I am never without :)     Seriously, the best Mac and Cheese I've ever had!
