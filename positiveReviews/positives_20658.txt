I have been a herbal tea drinker for many years and when I try a new  and I expect to be disappointed.  Numi's Moroccan Mint Tea is fresh tasting with full bodied flavor and a clean finish.     I love that the tea bags are fully organic, not just organic tea in a synthetic bag.  What I also love is that if you are  ewing your mug of tea and the phone rings, or you are distracted by something, when you come back the taste of the tea is just as fresh and delicious.  I can't wait to  ew this for iced tea next summer!  I just had surgery and was queasy afterwards and Numi Moroccan Mint tea was the only thing that tasted good, and it also settled my stomach.  Recently, I left a box on the counter when I went on vacation and when I returned my sister, who was sitting my dog, asked, "Where can we get more Moroccan Mint tea?"  Another convert.  Whether you buy it here or in a local store, "taste the difference."  I certainly did!  I will now try some of the other Herbal Teasans.
