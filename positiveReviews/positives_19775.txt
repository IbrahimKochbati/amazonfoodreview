JR Mushrooms earned my undying devotion when they noticed I had clicked the order button twice and ordered two pounds of peppercorns.  Just as I was realizing this, they emailed to ask if I REALLY wanted two pounds.  Great Work!  The peppercorns came quickly and are fresh and fragrant  and a lifetime supply.  Since then, I ordered vanilla bean pods too.  Also, good value and quickly delivered.
