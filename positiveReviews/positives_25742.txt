Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are appropriately named, they are soft, slightly chewy, oatmeal cookies with crunchy almonds and bits of chocolate.  Each cookie comes in its own sealed packet, so they are great for lunches or a pocket snack.          I shared these cookies with three other people and they all liked them as much as I did.  While they can't compete with my mom's homemade oatmeal cookies (few cookies can) they are still very good.          The nice thing about oatmeal cookies is that oats and almonds actually have some health benefits.          Benefits of oats:             Oats contain beta glucans, a soluble fiber which has proven effective in lowering blood cholesterol.             Oats contain tocotrienols. Tocotrienols are antioxidants which inhibit cholesterol synthesis and have been found to lower blood cholesterol.             Eating oats can spread the rise in blood sugars over a longer time period.          Benefits of Almonds:             Almonds lessen after meal surges in blood sugar.             Almonds lower cholesterol.             Almonds contain magnesium.  Magnesium is a calcium channel blocker. Magnesium helps veins and arteries relax, reducing resistance and improving flow of blood, oxygen throughout the body.             Five large human epidemiological studies, have found that nut consumption is linked to a lower risk for heart disease.
