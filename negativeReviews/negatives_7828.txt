You are guaranteed to lose weight with this product as it tastes so bad, you will not want to eat more than a few tablespoons. It is salty and has a bitter taste to boot. I wanted to avoid writing a negative review but i had this a few hours back (third occasion, since I ordered 6 of these) and a few hours later, the acrid taste still remains in my mouth. Hence I decided, I have to share my experience so that others do not jump in based on most of the other good reviews. Sorry folks.
