Shucks! I've ordered the same extra virgin olive oil before, however, at the time I paid $25 for 2 LITERS, not 1.5. Next time I have to pay better attention to size & price. Not saying the oil isn't worth it, just have to shop for better prices!          I am editing my review b c I realized only after I've ordered & used the oil for the first time that I mistakenly orderd the organic kind. Again, Kirkland's extra virgin olive tastes great, but for me it doesn't have to be the organic kind to make it special. The price seems just about right if not even super for this type of quality & "organi" label.
