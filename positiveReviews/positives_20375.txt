My son has a medical condition that affects his GI tract.  He digests slowly and was fussy.  He's a year old and we mixed this cereal with his formula and it was like magic.  He's not gassy, eats his entire bottle in 5 10 minutes, has regular BMs and is much more happy.  I've never been into organic stuff before but a friend recommended this and I would never use anything else.  I really believe the probiotics have had a positive result on my son.  He really has a Happy Belly now!  We tried everything else out there and this stuff is fantastic.  It's worth the extra money!!!
