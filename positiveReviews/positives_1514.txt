This is great chilled and topped with fresh whipped cream.  It is my husband's new favorite dessert.          I don't find the texture off putting.  Of course, is isn't as crunchy as fresh fruit, but the taste is great.          If I can get my husband to eat fruit instead of ice cream it gets an A in my book!
