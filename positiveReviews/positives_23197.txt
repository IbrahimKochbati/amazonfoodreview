I have spent the last year trying to perfect my own mix of flours to gain both taste and fiber content. Many of the flours I used were difficult to find locally and some I had to grind myself.  Often the  ead was heavy tasting or donwright strange tasting, with much work and effort often just wasted.          After trying Pamela's Wheat Free Bread Mix, it was obvious I had been wasting my time.  I have tried many variations suggested on the package, made foccacia, buns, rolls and many other uses such as pizza dough and calzones.  This works perfectly in my  ead maker, (using only one knead cycle) and have also used mixing by hand.  The  ead comes out perfectly everytime, with just the right amount of consistency & rise, without gigantic air holes or packed so tightly it looks like pound cake.
