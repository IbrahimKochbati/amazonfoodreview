Having now tried several Switch drinks, I'm quite pleased with how they've chosen to enter the market with this product line. The flavors they've introduced are well thought out, generally taste good, and are really a good set of drinks I'd consider purchasing.          The downsides? It's probably not big enough. 8.3 ounces is quite small. I know it's probably more of a specialty drink, but I did feel like I still needed more after drinking the entire can. It's possible they intended that to make you purchase more.          That being said the black cherry was by far my most favorite. Again, these are great drinks. Definitely worth trying and seeing if they can become a part of your regular drink selection.
