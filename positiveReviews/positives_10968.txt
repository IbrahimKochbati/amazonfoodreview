These crackers are the closest thing to the "real thing" I could find. No they do not even hold a candle to Ritz crackers & can sometimes be  ittle (we expect that with Gluten Free foods) but they get the job done. I eat mine with peanut butter alot for a light snack. I give them 5 stars (the original), the other flavors... not soo much. One down side is that they get stale very qucikly so I keep mine in the fridge. Hope this helps!
