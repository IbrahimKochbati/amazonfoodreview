I really like lemonade, but without the sugar, and this fits the bill when I don't have fresh lemons.  For a large glass I use 4 packets, add stevia instead of sugar, plus ice and, voila, a refreshing summer drink.  It does contain soy, however, whereas the True Lime does not.  Why it needs to have soy in it is anyone's guess.  The True Lemon store sells the product cheaper than Amazon.
