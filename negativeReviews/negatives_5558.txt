If you love really strong coffee you will more than likely love this flavor.  I tried running another 8 ounces of water through the same K cup before I could drink this one.  This flavor is smooth and it is not bitter, it's just way too strong for me.  I finally added a little milk and some Hershey's chocolate syrup and it was good that way.
