I went for these, when I got a free 30 bucks to spend with a new Amazon Credit Card, and Im glad I didn't pay full price.          I was in the process of creating an authentic Bolognese Meat Sauce, and I wanted some very hearty mushrooms to add a bit of OOMPH to the sauce, which is meat and onion heavy, and I figured from the reviews that these are a meaty tasting mushroom.  I also see the price asked for these at our local Giant Eagle grocery stores, so, yeah, I did get a bargain from their rip off pricing, but, these are basically taking up freezer space.          I ordered two grades, a higher grade with bigger shroom pieces, less stems, etc, and in retrospect, should have just ordered the scraps, or even the dust, as I found the big pieces stayed a nasty tough chewy texture, even after hours of cooking, I also extracted just juice from the mushrooms, but the  oth wasn't strong enough to bother, I basically just chop these in the food processor, and add a LOT of them to get a change in flavor in recipes, the one ounce bags, don't even bother with, because it takes a lot to get some flavor from them.          In all honesty, I have not used another Poricini product, so I can't compare, but, I am disappointed with the results I got from these, it may be they do exactly what they are supposed to, for some one with a very tender palate, but, not for me, and in no case, are these ever going to be rehydrated and served on steak, they just stay too nasty of a product to serve by themselves, strictly good for grinding and using in a recipe.
