I've only used this product to make pancakes so far, but so far, so good.  Except of course for the first attempt.  When I mixed the batter according to the package directions, it appeared WAAAY too thick to possibly make pancakes.  Sooooo... I added and added and added liquid until it seemed like pancake consistency.  DO NOT DO THIS!  That first batch, although the crumbs tasted just fine, didn't hold together, couldn't be flipped without the entire thing falling apart, and frankly made a huge mess.  Entirely my fault, admittedly.  I plan to try using it for pizza dough and deep fry coating soon.
