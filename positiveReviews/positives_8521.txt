I went on a search for dairy free chocolate and found these great cookies!  We believed my  eastfed son was sensitive to milk, and having to avoid dairy when you're a chocoholic is very difficult!  These cookies helped to feed my chocolate cravings, and helped keep my sanity in those difficult first weeks with a newborn.  At first, I thought they tasted just a bit different.  They're a lot crunchier than regular chocolate chip cookies and they don't taste exactly the same.  However, after being off of dairy and munching on these cookies, I began to not notice a difference.  My picky husband also said they were good!
