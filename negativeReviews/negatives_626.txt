Wish I would have read the reviews that discuss the product's performance in hot air poppers.  The PC is very tasty and light with no residual kernel shells that get stuck in your teeth...4 stars.          Problem with using it in hot air poppers is that the kernels are too light and fly out of the machine before they pop.  Tilting the machine helps keep them inside, but it would be simpler just to find another larger kernel corn.
