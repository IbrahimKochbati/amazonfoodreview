This was pretty yummy.  I don't like pop (or soda for you Easterners) but I do occasionally crave a carbonated beverage that isn't too sugary.  This fits the bill.  It's light and refreshing.  (I know, "light and refreshing" are overused words when it comes to describing drinks, but it's true, I swear!
