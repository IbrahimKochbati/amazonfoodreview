For something that is close to 60 bucks this was very dissapointing. The basket I received looked nothing like whats in the picture. I got a small foil pack of maybe 10 crackers no chocolate candies and a small box of candies that i can get at walmart for 2 bucks. They even changed the contents of the items without notifying me. This will be a NEVER again buy.
