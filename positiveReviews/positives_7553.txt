A friend of mine has been touting the benefits of chia seeds for years, so I finally decided to give them a try.  I really like them.          I haven't tried making tapioca or pudding like some of the other reviewers have;  instead, I usually toss a tablespoon into my protein smoothies or into my granola Greek yogurt goji berry mixture.          As others have mentioned, they do swell up after they've been in liquid for awhile, but I've found that as long as I drink my smoothie within 10 minutes or so of making it, it's fine.          Since adding chia seeds, goji berries, and soy lecithin into my diet last month, I've noticed that my skin seems  ighter and smoother, and I have more energy.
