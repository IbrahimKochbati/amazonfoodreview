With Subscribe and Save, these are about the same price as they are at the local Family Dollar so I went ahead and ordered a pack of 4 for myself and friends I have over for the holidays.          These are just average. I thought there'd be more to them. Very small layer of cheese but I guess that's about how everything is nowadays. But these are just average. I won't be purchasing them again.          They aren't bad if you used them in dip.
