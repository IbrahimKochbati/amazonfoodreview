Super good cookie for  eakfast.  They surprisingly fill me up for a couple of hours (which for me is WONDERFUL).  I insist on eating as soon as I wake up in the morning, and this is a great way to get some whole grains and healthy stuff on the run.          Perishable (which makes me happy) so don't stock up unless you have room in the freezer.  I keep mine in the refrigerator and so far no problems.          My son likes them too.
