I have a 6yr old Pit.  She has been dealing with itchy allergies for the past few years, where she will bite her paws and scratch her belly until it is raw and inflamed.  The only thing that helped is the steroid shot from the vet, and also pill steroids, but we did not want to keep her on these every 3 4 months to control the out eaks.  The vet said to try switching her food, and after some research I chose this product.          At first, she loved the food, probably because it was different.  After a couple days, however, it did not settle well with her and she did have a couple accidents.  She did not seem to like the food after this, but we stuck with it and she has not had any accidents and eats it fine.  After about three weeks her paws have healed and itchies are gone.  I hate that it is so expensive, but it is cheaper than taking her to the vet every 3 4 months for medication and it is nice she is not stinky and miserable anymore.  1 bag has lasted about a month for our 80lb dog.  I would recommend trying it, but be careful about the dog getting used to it first  I probably should have mixed 1 2 new and 1 2 old and made the transition gradually.
