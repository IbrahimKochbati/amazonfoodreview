We've been using walnut oil for many years; we  ush it on toast to take the place of butter, eliminating much of the saturated fat from our diets. It's also wonderful in salads  try it tossed into greens with a few nuts and chopped stone fruit or grapes, and a fruity vinegar. This product is of excellent quality and Amazon has a great price for it.
