I truly was looking forward to using these flavored syrups for making Latte's and other coffee drinks. First of all I do not like Splenda sweetener because to me it has a lingering after taste. I had hopes that the flavored syrup would at least hide the bad taste but to me it only seems to make it worse. I will buy the Torani Flavored syrups again but only in the sugar sweetened versions.The true flavors of these Sugar Free syrups seems to be overpowered by the Slenda after taste.
