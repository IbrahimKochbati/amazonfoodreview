This is hard to find on grocery shelves.  Thank goodness McCormick is producing it now.  I look forward to using it in several recipes.          I bought it for Chocolate Chile Mole Brownies    which were received with skepticism until tasted.  Then there were rave reviews.  I've downloaded other dessert recipes using ground ancho chile pepper, but in the meantime, we've learned it really does a good job of flavoring chili without making it unbearably hot.  Good product.
