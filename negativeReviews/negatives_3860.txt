I decided to get this for my 7 yr old son to try to deter him from sugary drinks. Well this was pinkish and fizzy and looked nice, I took a sip and it kind of tasted like cough syrup lol...however HE LOVED IT. He wanted more...I did read the caloric content and ingredients and honestly it isnt any healthier than a soda! I will have to say that he did love it and I had ordered another flavor that he loved as well.
