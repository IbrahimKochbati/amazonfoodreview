I normally drink Lavazza Rossa expresso (made in a French Press), but in attempt to cut down on my caffeine intake I have weaned my self to decaf.  while other decaf coffee has given me heartburn or just tasted awful, this Lavazza hit the spot.  While it is not quite as rich as the Rossa, it is still has plenty of rich chocolatey flavor, is beautifully smooth and not at all bitter.  The only downside I have is the price tag and the need to buy it buy the can (rather than the vacuum packet).  Its a full $3 more than I pay for the same amount of Rossa.  It is by far the best decaf that I have ever drunk.
