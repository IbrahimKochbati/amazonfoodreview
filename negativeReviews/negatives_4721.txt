Ordered 2 packages of these lollipops for my son's valentines   they arrived MELTED AND MIS SHAPED.  The product description & photo showed them as all red   I got mainly pink.  Length of lollipop stems was also NOT AS DESCRIBED in description.  CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE about all matters and was told that is was just too bad because NO REFUNDS OR REPLACEMENTS would be issued on food items   EVEN THOUGH THEY SOLD ME SOMETHING OTHER THAN WHAT I PURCHASED.          FRAUDULENT COMPANY   DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!
