I've tried Wrigley's Apple Pie flavor of their Dessert Delights chewing gum.  It tastes EXACTLY like apple pie.  I can't wait to try the key lime pie flavor!  Everyone who has posted a review here on Amazon says it tastes exactly like key lime pie!  Wrigley Chewing Gum Co. appears to have hit yet another one out of the ball park!
