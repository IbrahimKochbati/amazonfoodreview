You can't fully appreciate the packaged frozen hot chocolate until you've had the REAL frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity 3 in NYC. While it doesn't come close to the homemade kind you get there, it's a GREAT alternative for when you're really craving some or you miss it or you're just far away and can't have it, etc. It's all about adding your personal touch with the ice, maybe some whipped cream and cocoa shavings like they do at the restaurant. So no, it's not the chocolate dessert to end all chocolate desserts, because that's the ORIGINAL frozne hot chocolate, but this is a delicious, inexpensive, fast, substitute and makes a fabulous gift when paired with a mug or other coffee sweet goodies. So that's the point, it's not to replace the original, it's just to satisfy some cravings, so if you've never had the original it might not be the best thing in the world to you but after you've had the original you'll find these packets will satisfy many, many cravings taht will follow! Hope that helps!    Fellow chocolate love and frozen hot chocolate expert!
