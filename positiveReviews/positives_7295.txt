I ordered two....The Monterey   Double Trunk Preserved Bonsai Tree &  The Artificial Aralia Bonsai Tree.          Both trees came packed so as to not move around in the box.     They spray foam around the base and let it cure in the box. It creates a very stable platform.     The trees are absoulutely gorgeous!!!!     They look very close to the pics they show here.     Since they are hand made, each will look slightly different, but nothing that detracts from their overall beauty.     By the way, Bonsai Boy does not manufacture these.     They are jobbed out to artisans in other parts of the country, hence the wait of at least 14 days to get your item(s.     They are truly works of art and I'd recomend these to anyone who has a love of these trees, but like me, does not have a green thumb.     The communicaton with Bonsai boy is good and they endevor to answer any question you have.     Did I mention how beautiful these are? LOL!
