What self respecting cat isn't a picky eater?  I've never met any.  My cat likes Whiskas Choice Cut foods mainly for the gravy, and sometimes for the meat.  Omar the Magnificent and Wonderful likes both  the Beef in Gravy or Tuna.  Truth be told his dry crunchie is really his go to choice, but he's that way with all prepared moist foods.  If you ask him his true five star preference is meat caught fresh in  the garden.  Let's skip the details, you don't want to know.... Let's just say that Omar (M&W) is on the job!          I personally prefer Whiskas foods in pouches because Omar is OK with allowing any remaining food to be left in pouch when stored in fridge, rather than having to transfer it from a can to a glass container.  (Come on you all have cats that expect you to do this!)  Pouches are easy to dispose of too.  Just rinse and trash.  You aren't messing with storing smelling cans and trips to the recycling center.
