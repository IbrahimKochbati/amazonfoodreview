Plain and simple, my dog loves these. She dances, spins, & squeaks whenever one is  ought out! While this makes me happy as well, it is important to say that regular feedings of 1 to 2 a week have helped avoid teeth cleanings and extractions over the years! Too bad they don't have an equivalent for humans!
