I've purchased a few of the Enjoy Life faux cookie products and although the price and quantity were hard to digest, I thought the taste was more than tolerable. I returned the faux granola because it was too hard; a bowl of pebbles, literally! But it may have been on the store shelf too long. BTW, you can't see inside the package, or any other Enjoy Life package for that matter. Then, the Perky's Rice Crunch I purchased and enjoyed for months changed, the label had the Enjoy Life logo on it  and 2 ounces less product at a higher price! Okay, the times they are a'changin' and I moved on. Last week I purchased the "Chewy on the go Bars, Sunbutter Crunch." The taste was good; what more do I deserve! However, it was a marketing triumph: four dollars and forty nine cents for 5 diminutive bars, at least compared to the packaging. The bars are about two thirds the size of the foil wrap they come in! Add in the dead space in the box and you got what used to be referred to as "a rip off." In a health food store no one can hear you scream.
