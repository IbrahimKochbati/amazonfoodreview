When I was young, nearly a half century ago, Chuckles was a very popular candy. I really enjoyed eating these jellied treats, which were dusted with granulated sugar,  as they definitely satisfied a sweet tooth. I still enjoy them on occasion, though they are not as easy to find as in the old days, having waned somewhat in popularity. My particular favorite was the cherry flavor. If they had sold an all cherry pack, I would have bought them by the ton. Luckily for me, an all cherry pack was not available.  I also enjoyed the licorice and orange flavors. Lemon and lime, however,  were the flavors that I liked least, so I would benevolently offer them to my younger sisters. I was all heart in those days.
