This is a good cup of coffee, far better than that made of the over roasted beans of Starbucks many varieties. The taste is rich and more importantly, there is no aftertaste to give your stomach grief. I recommend this product for coffee lovers who've felt that they needed to give up java for a fusty cup of tea.
