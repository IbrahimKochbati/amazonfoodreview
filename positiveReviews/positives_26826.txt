This is one of my favourite teas.  My mom had picked up some a couple summers ago so that I'd have some tea to drink while visiting her.  I've had a horrible time finding it locally.  I've been drinking Stash's black chai spice instead, which also makes a nice cuppa, but the black and green blend has a nice, gentle flavour that is just marvelous.
