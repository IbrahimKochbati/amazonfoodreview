I mean you get 2 bottles for a very affordable price!          Yes, it isn't the highest quality, but it is wonderful for the price. I add this oil to meats, lasagna's grounds etc. and it has added some great flavor. If you want more, then go for the much more expensive stuff (no guarantee it will be any better) or go for truffle pastes or other forms of truffles (which are much more pricey).          I am satisfied, though the packaging was not all that great, but my item arrived in good condition.
