I bought this as a gift for a friend who likes exotic salts, and it was a hit with him. It was well packaged with no  eakage. (Some of the reviews have mentioned that they received  oken containers.) The wooden holder is nice but not all that permanent. I would recommend this for someone who'd like to sample various kinds of salt and doesn't mind paying a high price. The reason I gave it four and not five stars was the price.
