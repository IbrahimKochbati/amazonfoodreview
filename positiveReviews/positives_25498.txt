So, my favorite sardine supplier stopped for a while and I decided to try some other  ands and configurations.  These are among the most expensive, but they were a pleasant surprise.  I understand why so many sardine eaters just get these little ones.  There was eighteen of the little fish in the can I just ate!          I suppose the best I can do to describe the taste comparison with the big ones I'm more accustomed to is that the big ones have a sort of tuna ish taste whereas these tend to taste a bit more like clams or oysters.  The smell is fishy as ever, but the taste is more mild.  Quite nice actually.
