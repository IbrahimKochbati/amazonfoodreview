Blue Diamond Almonds, Whole Natural, 1.5 Ounce Packages (Pack of 24); I buy these nuts every time Amazon has them. They are very good for you and much less expensive then the grocery store when you figure per bag price I pay $.89 here.  I have a heart condition and need all the good protein I can get. These are a good source for this. It is only natural fat and no added salt. I wish I could get them even at a bigger savings with the 15% savings by "Subscribe and Save".          My husband carries these in his pocket as a mid day snack and I have my daily dose that my MD orders. They taste very good once you get used to eating no salt or added oils.          I highly recommend. I hope this helps.
