We use to love these crackers. We use to buy them at the grocery store but found them on Amazon and it's a much better price!     Amazon was having issues with shipping and the crackers being very  oken when delivered. I thought they finally got that better with more packaging but the last box I received was sent in the original box the crackers come in and no other protective packaging. Almost all of the crackers are so  oken that it's hard to figure out what piece goes with what.     This new batch of crackers also has a very different taste. Much more salty and less sesame seed taste. When I contacted the company about the change in taste I was told: "Nothing has changed other then we added vitamin E but that shouldn't change the flavor". Well.... Something did and I let them know it's not the same and they never got back to me. I guess they don't care that their crackers have changed and customers will notice. We can hardly eat them now!   "
