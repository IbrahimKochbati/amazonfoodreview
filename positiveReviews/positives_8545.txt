My daughter tried these cookies at a celiac camp she was at and fell in love wih them.  In addition to her loving the cookies, what is great about them is their grab bag type.  Being gluten dairy perservative dye free often she feels different (and a little embarrassed) with the types of foods she eats.  This size is like having something most of her peers eat but it's healthy.  Another benefit is her non gluten sensitive  other also loves them.  That is the real test, if the gluten eating kids like it!
