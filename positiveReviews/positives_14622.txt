I have been buying this Honey for 5 years, since I first was lucky enough to find it in an Organic Grocery Store. I have tried every kind of organic raw honey  and out there, from the cheapest to the most expensive, and this is by far the best flavor and the best price. Like the other review, I also think of this more as a "cream" consistency than as a "gel", and it is just heavenly that way. It melts down easy on warm  ead or in warm tea, and it is just jam packed with all the flavor and health benefits that have been stripped from all of the runny honey that are filtered inferiors (that are clear in color because of it)that are found at big grocery store chains. If you are lucky enough to find a raw unfiltered honey at a place like that, expect to pay a small forture for it. Go to your local Organic Grocery and you will find a great selection of good honey for a good price, but be prepared, only Y.S Organic Raw Honey is the best and unfortunately it is not commonly found locally, as I have moved several times and have discovered for myself. Amazon has the best prices and the biggest jar sizes I have ever found of this amazing honey, so this is the ONLY place I buy!!! They also have a 22oz size, but sadly it comes in a plastic jar instead of glass, which is just sad since anything stored long term in plastic can "leech" chemicals from the plastic into your foods...so I only buy the largest they offer in glass (16oz). If you are debating about trying an Organic Raw honey, or switching to a new  and, LOOK NO FURTHER. This is one purchase you will NOT regret and you will be a customer for life!!!!
