Coconut is the dominate flavor and texture in these cereal bars. If you don't like coconut then avoid them. The picture also shows chocolate, which is in there for sure, but it is overpowered by the other flavors.     The bar itself isn't very appetizing looking. It looks like a wad of granola trail mix was mixed with oils or butter then squashed. This is also about what it tastes like.     The rest of the box will get eaten as soon as all other snacks have been eaten and they are the only snack left.
