I purchased pill pockets to give my dog antiseizure medicine.  The pockets are so yummy that our other dog comes by for pill time to get a bite too!     The pills are much bigger than needed to give a small pill, so we  eak them into small pieces (and it makes them last longer).  I can use 1 2 to 1 pill pocket a day so a package can last awhile.     The treats do smell, but with any dog food treat I always wash my hands after use.     If you need to give your pet medicine and they won't cooperate this is a great option!
