Although this is very expensive canned dog food we found it well worth the cost.  We own a Golden Retriever Saluki mix that is extremely particular about what she eats and she rarely accepts canned dog food. However, she loves the Weruva Bed and Breakfast. It is extremely moist and contains lots of  oth in addition to the meats and vegetables that she likes best. We normally boil chicken, rice, carrots and  oth and make her a stew that she eats with great enthusiasm.  Until I purchased this Weruva product I could find no canned dog food that came close to what we make her at home.  Weruva is almost exactly what we fix her. I have continued to use this product regularly.  It is the best canned dog food I have found.
