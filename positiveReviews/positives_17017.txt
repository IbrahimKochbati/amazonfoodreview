We have had this toy for about 3 years, one for each of our Great Dane Doberman mixes, a chocolate lab, and now one for our big terrier mix.  It is sturdy, and even to this day they are super excited when the see it getting filled.          The one thing I will say is the rope is awesome as long as it lasts, in this house that meant about 3 weeks. I don't think that is a problem with the toy  my guys have always destroyed rope toys ASAP.          We replaced the rope with a small tennis ball inside the container that just blocks the hole, but bounces around with the food still making it  challenge to get the prize. similar to    "
