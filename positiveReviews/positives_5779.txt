when i ordered these 2 bags it was only $18_ today it's $37.....so i paid $9 for a little more than 2 pounds bag with  free s h via amazon prime membership.          it had more plain m&m's than any other candy  but that could have just been my bags  you may find differently  all the bags were sealed and none of the candy was  oken or crushed  it is fresh and the expire or 'best if used' by date is JULY 2013  so long shelf life.  i also sent a couple of bags to my senior parents who love chocolate.          if you found this helpful  please click on the 'yes' box   thanx
