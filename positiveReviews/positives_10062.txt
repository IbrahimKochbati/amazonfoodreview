I'm a tea drinker now even though I used to drink lots of coffee.  Most coffee is too strong and bitter for my taste.  But I dragged out my little Mr. Coffee machine and was pleasantly surprised with the taste.  It smells nice and is ground pretty fine.  I'm incorporating it into my daily intake of caffeine now and will definitely finish the bag.
