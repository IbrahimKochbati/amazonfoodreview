Wow, this tastes great, sweet and chocolaty! Like a liquid chocolate bar.          Plus it is organic!          It does contain high glycemic cane juice, so I don't drink too much. The original and vanilla flavors are sweetened with low glycemic rice syrup. They have less sugar. All are organic.          I don't know why the ingredients here say canola oil. Neither the Good Karma website nor the label on the box has that ingredient. If I verified that this site is correct, and the Good Karma corporate website and the label on the carton are wrong, I would stop using the product. Perhaps this page has outdated ingredient information.          This is the richest most milk like rice beverage and the label on it does not mention canola oil, which contains up to 2% toxic erucic acid and is found in many rice beverages that are fed to children! Canola oil cannot be used by US FDA regulation in infant food. (One research paper found higher levels of erucic acid in red blood cells of autistic children compared to non autistic children, and there are many other well established toxic effects of erucic acid in humans and animals. Look in the medical journals.)          This product is sold in my neighborhood Ralph's (best price), VC discount, and Whole Foods in Los Angeles.          The 365  and (Whole Foods own  and) is also canola free. It is much cheaper but watery in comparison. I use it for cooking. Only plain and vanilla flavors, though.          West Soy Rice beverage is also canola free. It has a more neutral taste and less body. They have a chocolate flavor.          Many people find rice milk better tasting than other milk substitutes. I find it to be much easier to digest than soy and nut products. Soy milk, however, has much more protein. Aside from being hard to digest, I don't eat too much soy because of the anti nutritional components; so I get my protein elsewhere.
