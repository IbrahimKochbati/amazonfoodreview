This snack is wonderful and very addicting. I've just reordered the 5# bag today. It's a great snack and the fact that it's low fat is a big plus. We love the spicy flavor of the wasabi. The cost beats that of our local supermarket by about 10 to 1.     As an aside, our dog loves these too, but she's a little odd.
