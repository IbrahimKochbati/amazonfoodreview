My baby is allergic to cow's milk and the doctor said he is likely allergic to soy.  I was feeding him Gerber cereal and didn't realize it had soy content.  Luckily my son was okay...just getting really chunky from the cereal in general.  So I bought this because it is completely dairy and soy free...and since it's organic and  own rice, much healthier for him.          This stuff actually smells like rice, not processed shiny flakes.  My son also loves it.  He even makes an "mmmm" sound when I feed it to him.          I left out the last star because it's a bit expensive compared to other cereals...  But as they say, you get what you pay for.
