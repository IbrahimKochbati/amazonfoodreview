Ughh ..l I tried getting a toy for my puppy to play with to dispense treats.. it worked for a day.. my puppy was slammimg this jug around .. and the treats would dispense out .. he whipped it around he loved it ..but it cracked on the bottom and that's that.. so out of commission .. but nosey if you do not have and carpets or rugs in your home.. i have hard wood floor .. it was loud and nosey ,which was ok for a few minutes but then, i had to take it away .. good idea but my pup is 3 months old  pitbull german shepard mix.. he is active so now i ihave to shop for another treat dispenser.. i will submit a video of what i am talking about .. i just purchased another toy I will tell you how it goes .. i ordered the squirrel that dispenses treats i heard it was strirdy !!
