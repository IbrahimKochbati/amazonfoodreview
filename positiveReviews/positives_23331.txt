The White Chocolate is the most moist and best tasting flavor (in mine and my husbands opinion at least) and I will only be ordering this flavor for now on.  I have Celiac Disease and I'm a Type 1 diabetic and also a model and a Las vegas Showgirl so I have to eat healthy, stay fit and look great and these bars are the best for helping at least me, do just that.  They are Gluten free which is the best thing and absolutely balanced.  My husband who is a very picky doctor who likes these over his past favorite Zone bars.  Thank you Think products for making these bars!
