These bars were pretty good but visually speaking, very unattractive!  I was a little hesitant to bite in.  This could be because I am phobic of "healthy" foods that try to pretend to be tasty.  So many of them just aren't.  They really aren't.  This particular product was actually pretty good.  Even my husband tried one and liked it and he doesn't like coconut as much as I do.          The chocolate Chips helped I think.  But this is really a nice treat and I am happy to say a tasty one that you won't regret eating!
