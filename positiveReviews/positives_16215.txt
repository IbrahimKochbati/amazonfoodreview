Nothing negative to say about this buying experience.  My dog loves Greenies, and this was a better price than what I have seen elsewhere.  Treats like this, along with regular dental care ( ushing her teeth and getting her teeth professionally cleaned by a vet) means that my dog's  eath is nice and she is healthier.  My dog is 7kgs (around 15 lbs)and this is a perfect size for her.  The packaging keeps these treats fresh   inside the box is an airtight resealable bag.
