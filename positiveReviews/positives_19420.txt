I've ordered these potatoes again they are probably the best for an instant mashed potato. No need to add salt or butter it's already in there. It calls for 2 cups of water, that is a little thin for me, so I use just 1 1 2 to 1 3 4 cup water to make them a little more thick. If you are short on time and need mashed potatoes this is it!
