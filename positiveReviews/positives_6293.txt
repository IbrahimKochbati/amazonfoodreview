And they never vomit. They wolf them down, thought I think they are crunching. They haven't TOTALLY stopped their occasional hairball hacking, but it is rare. Perhaps they would completely solve it if I could AFFORD to give them to them all the time. Only problem with this product is $$$. I would love to buy it in a larger bag . . . if they just made one. If your cat's don't like 'em move on, but definately worth a try if you want a treat that also helps with hairballs.
