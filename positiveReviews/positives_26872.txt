I have been drinking this tea blend for over a year and never grow tired of it.  Love the blended flavor and the oil of bergamot.  Being organic and fair trade certified is also a plus. To those of you who have tasted earl grey black and green teas separately and are curious about the mix  I would say the black tea flavor predominates, but the result is an extremely satisfying tea blend.
