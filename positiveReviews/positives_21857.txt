I first tried Destiny Deep Sea Water when a friend reccomended it as a great way to increase essential mineral intake and hydration. I have been drinking Destiny for a few months now, and feel more energetic, and feel like it has enhanced my performance when I run long distances.  I definately would reccomend any athlete to try Destiny Seep Sea Water.
