Just received my order. The box was a little beaten up from outside. I was worried that some of the cookies might turn into crumbs. When I opened the box, the worry was gone. It was so nicely packed!! Each pack was wrapped with bubble sheets individually, and any space between the wrapped packages and the box were stuffed with plastic airbags. (See pictures that I uploaded) I will definitely order from them again! However I think the current order can last me for a while :)
