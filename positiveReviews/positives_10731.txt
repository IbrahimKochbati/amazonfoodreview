I love that these are made with organic ingredients and a short list at that:       "organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic apples, organic palm  oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols, a source of vitamin E), organic molasses"          I usually get my dog Milk Bones (Milk Bone Gravy Bones), which is something I can pick up at my grocery store. And I've always felt like maybe I was buying her junk. But whenk I look at the ingredients for milk bones, they're maybe not that bad.          (Ingredients for regular Milk Bones, from their web site: Ingredients: Wheat flour, beef meal and beef bone meal, milk, wheat  an, beef fat preserved with tocopherols, salt, dicalcium phosphate, wheat germ, natural flavor, calcium carbonate,  ewers dried yeast, malted barley flour, vitamins (choline chloride, dl alpha tocopheryl ecetate [vitamin e], vitamin a acetate, calcium pantothenate, riboflavin, vitamin b12 supplement, d activated animal sterol [source of vitamin d3]), sodium metabisulfite (dough conditioner), minerals (zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, ethylenediamine dihydriodide [source of iodine]).)
