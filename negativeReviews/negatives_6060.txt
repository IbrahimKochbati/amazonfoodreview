Rating 1 star due to price. Too pricey. Loved the coffee, but average price on k cups is typically 50 to 60 cents per k cup. Paying $1.18 per k cup is outrageous (I thought I was getting a 2 pack for the price, my bad). Amazon has many 2 packs of k cups for this price. Will pay closer attention on future k cup purchases. Will not purchase this product at this price again.
