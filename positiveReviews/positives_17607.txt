As I have gotten older my tolerance for acid seems to be lessening. Sometimes I just can't tolerate coffee, but I love it, and the darker the better.  I tried other  ands of low acid coffee but found them weak and tasteless.  This Puroast coffee is the best! Very smooth, with a great deep flavor.  Worked well in my Keurig also.  Absolutely no bitterness and no acidic issues. I recommend trying it if you are having issues.          I will be buying this again.
