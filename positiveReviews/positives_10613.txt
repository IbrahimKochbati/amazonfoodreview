I drink a lot of this stuff and Folgers Classic is my choice.  Have no use for all the other flavors or instant or that thick glue they sell at StarBucks.     I prefer (real coffee) and this is what I prefer.     It's the only thing I serve in my machine shop.  Nobody complains and we go thru a lot of this stuff so they must like it.
