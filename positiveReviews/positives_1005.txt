I was just messing around on amazon when I ran into this add for beer nuts, when I noticed someone had left a review it was pretty funny, being the beer lover that I am, I had to try them,  well they're here now and I cant drink beer without them, they have a story on the back about how the guy got started in the 50's, and soon his beer nuts were in bars around america!  iIcan see why, they're pretty darn good.
