My husband and I always have this at a local eatery, and WOW, it works with eggs, french fries, burgers, you name it. It's not as much Hot as it is SPICY and the balance of the garlic is a beautiful thing. It doesn't drown out the taste of your food as much as it adds to it or enhances it. It also doesn't have that obnoxious jalapeno taste that many hot sauces have. A must buy for the hot sauce or bbq sauce fan, or someone like me that just loves  eakfast.
