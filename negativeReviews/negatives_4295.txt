Tastes good, but according to most websites that I have read, avocado oil is SUPPOSED to have a HIGH smoke point...like over 500°!!! But, when you visit THIS manufacturers website, it lists their oil as having a smoke point of just 350°. I have written the manufacturer, I will post an update soon. This is puzzling to say the least.
