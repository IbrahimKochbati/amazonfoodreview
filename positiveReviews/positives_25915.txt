Bought CatSip years ago as a treat for our picky cat.  Unfortunately for us, she loves it!          This product causes no digestive issues for our cat.  The color of the milk is a definite off white   light tan, so don't be alarmed if trying it for the first time.  Although the box is small (juice box size), each one lasts us a week or so.  Refrigerate after opening (refrigeration is not required prior to opening).          It is difficult to find.  Petsmart is the only local store that sells it.  I really wish Amazon would stock this instead of the one in the purple box.  We tried the other  and once when we couldn't find CatSip    she wouldn't touch the stuff; just kept walking around, crying for the CatSip.  In a pinch, we also tried a tiny bit of real milk once but she really didn't want any part of that either.
