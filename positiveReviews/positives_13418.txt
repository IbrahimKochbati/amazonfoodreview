This is a high quality coffee particularly well suit for bold coffee drinkers.  The taste is strong and flavorful, but with no bitterness. I generally a morning coffee drinker since afternoon coffee upsets my stomach.  However, I can tolerate Newman's coffee in the afternoon, because of its well balanced favor and acidity.  Great value in the 80 K Cup package.
