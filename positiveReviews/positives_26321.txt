I received a package of chocolate which were melted and the ice packets hot. I filled out return form and within a couple of days I not only was notified through Amazon that I would be getting a full refund but I also received a personal email from the company apologizing for the situation. Maybe I will order the chocolate in winter when it's not 100 degrees in Tucson. I was so thrilled and felt like they exemplified the best customer service. I will definitely let my friends know and I will look to buy from them in the future.
