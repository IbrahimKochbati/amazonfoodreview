This tea is great.  I cook it in gallon batches and sweeten it with agave nectar and keep it in the fridge.  I guess it "worked" because my daughter was born after just 4 hours of labor and 20 minutes of pushing.  I'm still drinking it since I had just ordered another 3 pack of boxes of it the day before our baby was born.  My husband loves the tea too and he doesn't even have a uterus.
