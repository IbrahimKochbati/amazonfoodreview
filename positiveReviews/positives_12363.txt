I've been buying the Nong Shim Spicy Chicken Noodle Bowls for over a year now. They are really great when you want something warm and quick. I like that the flavor is in a packet so you can add as much or as little of it as you want. The flavor of them is also good for something that is an instant noodle. I have tried other  ands of instant noodles and they just don't have the taste that these do. Most other ones are more bland and just not very good. I will continue to buy these noodle bowls to have on occasion when I need something quick and easy.
