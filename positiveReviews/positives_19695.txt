This is the only veggie jerquee my local grocery store carries and is a good substitute for when I don't feel like ordering my favorite(stonewalls) online.     I like the flavor and the texture but I always need scissors to open the package and I hate the thought of my germy scissors touching my food.     Once you finally open it, it's hard to really get a good bite because it is very stringy and full of sauce, you usually end up with half the product in one bite just so you don't get sauce all over your hands and mouth.     I often get it stuck in my teeth too, which is annoying when I'm at work without dental floss.     I think they are redesigning the package so hopefully it will be easier to eat soon. They could work on the price too, $1.29 at the store for 2 bites is a bit ridiculous!
