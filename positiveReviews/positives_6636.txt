I am a huge fan of Jamaica Me Crazy coffee.  There was a time in my life when I was totally caffeine free and off the dark stuff, but a customer in the bank I worked at  ought in a pound of this coffee as a gift to the tellers.  Every time someone walked by my desk with a cup of this freshly made joe, the smell would really tempt me to go back to consuming coffee again.  Eventually it  oke me down, and I am back to being a full time coffee drinker, and proud of it! Imagine how happy I was to find my favorite  ew in a K cup!  The only thing better than a cup of Jamica Me Crazy is a cup sweetened with the new Almond Joy flavor International Creamer in it to highlight the sweet coconut.  Unfortunately, we only have a Keurig at our office (I'm in Real Estate now), so I have to go to work to enjoy a cup.  I'm thinking I have a  illiant boss who knows how to get people to willingly show up to work! Now if I can just figure a way to use it to temp more buyers into our office   I'd have it made ;0)
