I have been using this instant expresso coffee for about a year now.  I buy it in our local supermarket for $3.49 a 2 oz. jar.  I originally needed it for a  ownie recipe and looked here to purchase, but I saw the $9.99 price and that certainly made me take a ride to the store.  Luckily, it was on the shelf and at a very reasonable price.  Only one store in the area stocks it.          Check your local stores before you buy this online.  Chances are you will find it at a very lesser price locally.  I use it now not just in  ownies, but I add two teaspoons to a protein shake, and it makes a great coffee shake.          Thank you.
