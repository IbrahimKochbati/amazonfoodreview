The coffee pods are convenient but the quality of the coffee is not good (you will find this especially if you are used to using a grinder, fresh beans etc). I'm not sure if this is due to the pod itself or the machine in terms of temperature, pressure. I suspect the problem lies with the pod technology and the coffee within. I'm going back to a grinder, fresh beans and a traditional machine.
