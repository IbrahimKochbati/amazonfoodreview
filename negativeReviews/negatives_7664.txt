These cookies were unanimously disliked by the six people in the office with whom I shared. We all found them to be dry and tasteless with an unappetizing texture. No one even finished an entire cookie. Plus, there are only six cookies, each individually wrapped, in a box that's way too large. That really irks the tree hugger in me. Definitely a disappointment and not recommended.
