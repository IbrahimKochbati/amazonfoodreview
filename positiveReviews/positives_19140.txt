I've always been so so on coffee. I love flavored drinks and I like the IDEA of flavored coffees. But the reality never measured up to the hype for me. But this coffee is really good. It smells fantastic when it's  ewing and the taste is spot on. Obviously to  ing out the flavor you need to add sweeteners because both the main flavors in this are sweet. But whether I use cream and sugar or White Chocolate Raspberry creamer (my favorite way) it's a good cup of coffee. I have had this in the morning as well as for a dessert coffee. If you like flavored coffees that aren't either watery or overwhelmingly strong, you'll like this one.
