I agree that the price on this is a bit high, but our dog loves it and still goes crazy whenever it's meal time.  She didn't do well with many of the so called organic products because they still contain a lot of low quality grains starches.  Even better, there's less dog waste to clean up too because the product doesn't have useless fillers.
