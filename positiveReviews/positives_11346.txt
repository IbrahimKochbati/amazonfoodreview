A+ for concept, ingredients, flavor, fun, snack worthiness. C for function.          This product is a great little snack idea and is great to add fruit servings in to your kiddos day. It's a tad tart for my preference but both my 1 yr old and 4 yr old love these. They're these little plasticized foil pouches that have a sort of bottle like nipple'ish mouthpiece   but free flow   that the kids can suck the product out while squeezing the pouch flat. The mouthpiece itself is under the twist off cap and is about 1 3 of an inch diameter. They have a permanent home in my go bag as they do not require refrigeration.          BUT they do require a clean up crew until your child figures out how to use em. WARNING: DO NOT USE FOR FIRST TIME IN A CAR. They're so cute and you're thinking "oh this is a perfect car snack!" But they're not until AFTER your child learns how hard they can squeeze em. My 4 yr old was coachable and likely could have been fine unsupervized in a carseat while I drive along. But my 1 yr old? Haha, she grabbed that thing up and WOOP! Up shoots a 3 inch geyser of applesauce like product. It was super cute and definitely a home movie moment but I'm glad we usually have wipes within reach. Unless you trust your kids to eat super neatly be cautious with this product: no dressy outfits, no papers, no artwork, nothing that can't be wiped down with a moist cloth. This apple cinnamon product in particular I'm not concerned about color stains, but it is sticky and... well, it's fruit.          Once my girls got the hang of em it's been great. I even trust my 1 yr old in the car with em   but only when I'm not alone and another passenger can clean up possible 'geyser damage.'          I bought this during a special and signed up for Subscribe & Save and the price was far better than in stores (Amazon was ~61% of my stores price). I'm definitely going to keep purchasing this product and try out other pure blended fruit flavors   I'm a little wary of the 'touch of milk' products that require no refrigeration.
