While this mix is pretty pricey to end up with a small pan of  ownies, they do have a great taste!  I love that they have alternative recipes on the package.  We have egg allergies, so I use the egg free recipe.  I have to cook it for significantly longer than the recipe states, (10+ mins.), and still the  ownies are pretty gooey and don't hold together.  OK to eat at home, but not good enough to take anywhere.  Again, they taste great, especially for a chocolate and sweets deprived pregnant woman :)
