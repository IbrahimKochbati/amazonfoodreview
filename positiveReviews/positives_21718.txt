These are delicious peas. I made about 6 crock pots of pea soup before the bag was finished. I hardly had to add any spices for it to taste delicious. Just some natural sea salt and a little  ags amino acids. Plus I put in a few garlic cloves and it was so heart warming soup. Usually, with ordinary peas, you have to put bacon and other spices in to make it good. Not with these peas. They were delicious on their own. Also delivered timely. Thanks again.
