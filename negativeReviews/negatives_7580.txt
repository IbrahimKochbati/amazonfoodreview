The Pack of 3 arrived but by the look of them they don't seem to be worth the price. A bit pricey, and may as well get mixed nuts from local grocery supermarkets, I thought. Not happy.          One of the three packs came half filled, making it a pouch with less than 5 Ounce of mixed nuts, although the pouch is intact so I guess that was a faulty product. Not happy times 2.          One of the two seemingly 10 Ounce pouches has a date like print "03 26 13 GB", but I came across quite a few gone bad pistachio nuts which you can't tell until you've tasted them. Not happy times 3.          Overall, I probably won't buy this again.
