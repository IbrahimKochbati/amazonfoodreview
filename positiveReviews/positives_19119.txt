I tried all the samples in the box when I first purchased my kuerig but there was only 1 or 2 that I really took a liking to. I like flavored coffees as I'm not a coffee purist and found this one to be very good. The vanilla flavor is smoothly blended into the coffee which makes for a nice smooth coffee. This will be my standard coffee from now on.
