I purchased a box of these and 30% of them leak when I use them.  I couldn't figure out what was happening, but after examining the cups, I realized that the foil seal on top was not sealed properly and was tearing when the coffee  ewed.  There was water and coffee all over my machine and my counter.          May have been a fluke, but no other K Cup has ever leaked on me. I will never purchase these again.  Back to Jet Fuel for me!
