My dog's  eeder sent home a baggie of cheese and egg flavored Charlie Bears for my Maltese puppy.  I used them to reward him from the get go, and he will do just about anything if he knows this treat is coming.  A great training aid.  They are also small enough to give often, and are made with good ingredients.  I carry them in my pocket and my little guy keeps an eye on that pocket!
