I first bought the dolce gusto circle maker for the one cup action so I don't have to  ew a pot. I bought the American house blend and I could not get a good flavor for myself with the cream and sugar so I was kind of disappointed. I then tried the dark roast and after the third cup I had the right amount of cream and sugar and now I love it more than any coffee place. I go through a box per week which is probably not a good thing for my body but what are ya gonna do. Enjoy.
