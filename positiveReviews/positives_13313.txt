We've tried many  ands of GF  ownie mix, and this is by far the best. While many others have a powdery mouthfeel, these are rich and chewy and most of all, chocolatey! We also add finely chopped almonds to the mix and  ing them along to picnics, bake sales, etc. No one can tell that they are GF! Amazon's subscription price is good, so we'll be buying from here going forward.
