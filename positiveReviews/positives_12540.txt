My days of enjoying bold, dark coffee times have long past. Maybe it's age, or maybe it was my time in the navy when midwatch coffee was always black and bitter, and the only thing that changed when the daywatch came around was a freshening of the grounds.          This coffee is mild without being weak, and is a nice way to start the day (or finish up a meal and settle with a good book).          Good choice for your K cup pantry.
