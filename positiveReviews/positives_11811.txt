Bisto is hands down the best! My mother turned me onto it a few years back and now I wouldn't think of using a white thickener (flour, corn starch) for any meat or poultry gravy again!          What's so fantastic about Bisto Favourite is that you can make as much gravy as you want even from meats that give you hardly any drippings. Takes no time or effort at all and never ever gets lumps. You can even pour it directly into already cooking gravy. Can't do that with flour! It's foolproof. Gravy made with this always has plenty of great flavor, color and body.          I've only tried the favourite and poultry flavors but am curious about the onion one. Personally, I don't like the Bisto for poultry flavor. I use favourite for both meat and poultry gravies. It has a lovely flavor and color that really works with everything. Just cut back on salt when seasoning the meat because the Bisto will add some.          What I also love is that I can make a little 'quick' gravy for any leftover food that has no gravy by simply putting a dash of Bisto in the bottom of the plate, pour a little water over it. Place the meat potatoes whatever on the plate and microwave. When it's done the granules have melted and incorporated into the water and it is much like natural au jus. I get a nice moist leftover i o something dry and bland.          You'll never fail at gravy making with Bisto Favourite!
