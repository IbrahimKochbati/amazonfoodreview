This is roughly a two month supply of  eakfast for a single person who eats oatmeal every morning...at a pretty decent price for prepackaged cereal.  Use subscribe and save, and it's even less expensive!          We've found that this tastes better than most other flavored oatmeal out there: most are too sickeningly sweet, and have an artifical taste to them.  The Kashi  and is not too sweet, and cooks easily in the microwave.  (I tend to use a little bit less water than recommended.)  Personally I don't find any oatmeal all that filling, but my wife does.          Also, she recommends oatmeal to any nursing mother and claims that it will increase  eastmilk supply.          The green tea is a neat idea, since it's supposed to be "healthy," but we really don't notice it: we don't notice any green tea taste, nor do we notice any caffeine effect.  I'll bet it's 99% marketing anyway.  They probably wave a green tea bag over the box as it's going out the factory or something.          Hope you enjoyed my review!
