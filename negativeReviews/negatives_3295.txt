I thought this would be spicy, and coming from someone who eats spicy food all the time and fire sauce on his burritos, this is really only mild. This does not make your nose run, or make your throat burn, ears tingle, which is the funnest part of eating spicy food. Spicy food containing cayenne pepper is very healthy for you and is great for colds and sore throats. With a name like Flaming Buffalo with fire coming out of the name I had high hopes...and sadly this does not live up to the hype in the heat department. It still tastes good. The flavor lingers in your mouth making you reach for another one, after 6 8 pieces or so you get a salty taste that makes you reach for water. I give this 3 stars for taste and convenience. Just in case you don't eat it all in one sitting, the bag contains a zip lock storage to keep things sealed. It will last 3 days after opening without refrigeration.
