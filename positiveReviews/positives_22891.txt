This black tea is a morning ritual for me.  I could not find it in any of my local grocery stores so I was very pleased to find it sold in a 6 pack at such a reasonable price here on Amazon.com!  Once you try the invigorating, strong black tea with a hint of cinnamon taste, you'll instantly fall in love and want more!
