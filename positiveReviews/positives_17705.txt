I happen to be a person with acid reflux that drinks large amounts of coffee.  In fact, the coffee may be the cause of my acid reflux!  While I have not used Puroast long enough to see if it cures me, what I can say is that it TASTES GREAT!  I am going to order some more of this just for the flavor, and will see if over time my acid reflux is reduced as well.  So, if you have acid reflux, give this coffee a shot   you'll enjoy it for the taste at least!!
