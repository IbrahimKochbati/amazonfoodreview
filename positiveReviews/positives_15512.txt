The bonsai came perfectly packaged and in perfect condition; shipped from Florida all the way to Maine! The package came with a card for Lou's Bonsai Nursery with a phone number that I called where I received great information and helpful hints from Lou. I would highly recommend him to anyone looking into purchasing a bonsai tree. For anyone who is disappointed in the size of the tree, as I was at first, please note that these are baby bonsai trees. What fun would it be if you could not raise your tree and watch it grow? I think its exciting to be able to watch the tree as it becomes stronger and more beautiful. As this was my first bonsai tree, Lou was great over the phone and very helpful, he'll even refer you to places to buy supplies for your bonsai instead of heckling you to buy his products. You can tell he's very passionate about what he does. Take my word for it that you won't be let down.
