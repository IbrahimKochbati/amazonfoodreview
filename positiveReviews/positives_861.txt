I have now tried both the Ocean Fish and Tuna and the Duck and Chicken variety of this food.  My cat seems to prefer the taste of the duck and chicken a little better, but I will probably rotate them both because of the health benefits he's gotten (especially from the ocean fish and tuna) that have included a softer coat and less scratching and biting of himself and shedding.  Also, with this food, he doesn't drink much water, but still goes potty alot, so I feel good that he's getting plenty of fluids in his diet.  My only complaint with this  and, and why I only give it 4 stars, is that it has little pieces of potato? and whole peas in it, which my cat eats around and ends up being wasteful, which I don't like given the price.  Not that big of a deal, but it is a minor inconvenience that I have to clean leftover bits out after each feeding as opposed to just washing his empty bowl daily.  (In case you are wondering, it is approximately 4 to 6 whole pea 1.5 pea size potato? bits per 1 4 to 1 2 can.)
