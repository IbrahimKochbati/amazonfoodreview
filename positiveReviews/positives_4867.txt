I grew up in Southern California, so I've had my share of sweet corn cakes at local restaurants. This mix is a great way to make these at home. I prepared a package of these for a friend of mine (who lives on the east coast and had never tried a corn cake)....she's now addicted but can't find them at her local store. Thank goodness for Amazon!
