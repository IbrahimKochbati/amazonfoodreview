With all the rave reviews, coupled with the fact that these pre packs include all the right ingredients, I assumed the  result would be at least 75% authentic carnival style popcorn for my popcorn maker. After all, I have used packs like this for over 10 years (at a previous employers Ag Equipment business), of which was amazing!  This product is not. On a scale of 1 10, I'd rate it about a 2. It is edible; although extremely salty. Tastes nothing like carnival style popcorn, severely lacking in butter flavor. The only positive aspect of this product is the convenience in the pack itself. So if you're used to buying cheap jiffy pop, over the stove style popcorn, this would be better. I Would not recommend.
