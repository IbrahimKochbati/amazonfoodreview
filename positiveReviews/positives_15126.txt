My dogs are in love with Canidae Maintenance Formula for All Life Stages, and so am I.  Just look at the ingredient list and it's easy to see why.  You'll find lots of chicken, turkey, lamb, rice, and all sorts of other good stuff.  Unlike a lot of subpar dog foods, there is no corn!  Plus, my dogs love its taste, and it's a great value for the quality of this food.  I'd recommend it to any dog owner.
