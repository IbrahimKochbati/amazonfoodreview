The flavor of this coffee is good, it has a nice balance of Vanilla without being too strong.  It's not the boldest coffee, but it's a nice afternoon treat.          That being said, I have had problems with several pods.  When you hold them up to the light, you can see that there are grounds outside of the filter portion of the pod.  This causes a cup full of grounds when you  ew the coffee, and also clogs up the pin at the bottom of the pod chamber.  I'd say about 1 out of every 5 or 6 pods has this problem.
