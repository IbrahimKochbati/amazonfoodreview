Great product.  The indoor kitties love to have grass to nibble on.  This grass grows and is ready to nibbling in 10 days or less.     My How To:     Get a small, shallow plastic container with a lid.     Punch several holes in the bottom of the container with a nail.     Fill the container with organic soil, sprinkle about 1 tablespoon of seeds on top, pack the seeds into the soil by pressing them in firmly. W     ater until some of kit leaks out the holes in the bottom.     Place on a dish; put on the lid; keep out of the way for the seeds to germinate   checking to water every 3 days.     Once the grass has grown about 2 inches, remove the lid and place in the sun.     Put grass in a new heavier bowl so the cats can't pull the entire patty of grass out or walk off with the container with they nibble it.
