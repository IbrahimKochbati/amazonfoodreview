My grandkids and I love the mints in the tin and thought we would try these to cut down on packaging. They taste terrible. They have a funny after taste and really don't taste like cinnamon. We won't buy them again. We buy many Newman's Own products, but are disappointed this time. If they aren't the same mints, they should have a different name.
