These tasty little gummi candy strawberries come from Germany and are not to be confused with our inferior gummi worm type candy in the States.  Great consistency, awesome flavor, and sweet deal for this quantity.  Once your friends and family try them, you'll need 10 pounds of them to make sure you get a few.  If you haven't eaten these, you haven't lived.
