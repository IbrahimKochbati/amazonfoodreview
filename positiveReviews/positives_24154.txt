I have been on Weight Watchers for the last couple of years, and this is my morning drink of choice.  I love it because I can have my cup of chai for only one point.  Plus, I don't like to drink a lot of caffeine because it depletes my water supply for the day.  The regular chai is REALLY good also   I highly recommend this  and.
