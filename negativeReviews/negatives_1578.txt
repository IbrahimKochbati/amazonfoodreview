This carbonated product has a nice natural juice taste to it that makes you feel like you're drinking something that might be a little healthier than all the other carbonated stuff out there on the shelves but I couldn't help but notice the amount of sugar this thing has listed on the nutrition facts:          34g per 8.3 oz can of the stuff. 36g total carbs.          Like I said, it's good but don't get fooled into thinking its any healthier for you. There's no artificial stuff in here according to the can at least.
