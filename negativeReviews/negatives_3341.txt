I got this thinking that it would be a great organic treat for my Lab Rhodesdian Ridgeback mix puppy. I figured giving him a treat like this would really satisfy his chewing instinct. This treat is VERY hard. It comes in a rectangle shape that is divided in half and I tried to  eak it into two smaller treats and had a difficult time. My dog did not like the flavor either. He preferred to play with these rather than eat them. Usually he will eat a treat in about a minute but this treat stayed in his cage with him picking it up and dropping it for hours. He has very powerful jaws and he usually tears up most of his toys in a day or two, yet he did not wont to eat these very much. Whatever they put in this is not very appealing to dogs apparently.          Your dogs may like this better (hopefully). Again this is a VERY hard threat so make sure your dogs don' t mind having to gnaw at it for awhile. Also, if your dog acts like it doesn't like it then it probably never will, so give the pooch a different treat.
