I have 2 Corgis, and also foster for Corgi Rescue. So far none of the four dogs I have had since buying this toy (my 2 plus 2 rescues) have played with it for more than a few minutes. They are all otherwise high energy, playful, food driven dogs.          They LOVE Tricky Treat, Buster Cube and MolecuBall so I thought this would be a nice change. Big expensive yawn. I gave it two stars only because it appears well made. I bought it almost a year ago, and kept it around in case one of the foster Corgis might like it, but so far nothing. It is currently in the donate to the animal shelter box.
