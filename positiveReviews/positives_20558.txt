Let me start by saying I am NOT a tea drinker!  I love my hot chocolate.  However, when I have a sore throat, I tend to sip on tea (I've heard it's soothing for your throat).  My boyfriend kept giving me all these different kinds to try & I couldn't stand any of them (White Tea with Pear, Mandrian Vanilla Red, etc).  Finally I went to the fod store & saw this on the shelf.  Seeing how I am crazy for anything mint, i thought I'd give this a shot.  First cup I made was absolutely wonderful!!          This tea has a very light taste at first sip & a cool, lingering peppermint taste at the end.  It's perfect any time of year, hot or cold, alone or with dessert (even a main course!).          If you like mint, you'll love this!  Most mint tea's I've tried inthe past were disappointing, I couldn't even taste the mint & felt it was a waste of my money, & I never even finished the first cup.  This one is the best by far & will be a perm add to my pantry!
