I decided to try PB2 after hearing a couple friends talking about it.  I'm so glad I did. PB2 has a nice peanut flavor without all the fat and calories. I add it to my weight loss shakes for a little extra flavor.  It's also good stirred into muffin or pancake mixes, or sprinkled on top of greek yogurt and eaten with a apple.  I don't really reconstitute it  I just use it to get the peanut flavor without all the calories.  Great product!
