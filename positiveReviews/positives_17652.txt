I tried this in place of my morning supermarket coffee, using the exact same preparation, with a stove top percolator.  The smooth taste difference was noticiable right away.  I would even describe the taste as less acidic.  There was not even a hint of bitterness or after bite as is common with cheaper coffee blends.          The researchers deserve high marks on this one. Highly recommended.
