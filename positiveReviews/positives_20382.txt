We only fed our son rice cereal for about 2 weeks   he vastly prefers the taste of oats. This cereal mixes instantly, and combines well with other foods. The addition of DHA and probiotic supplements is an important factor in our decision to buy this product.          It was a little disconcerting to open the cannister for the first time and see that it had settled to the point that it appeared only half full. The label says this may happen...it's a shame that so much packaging is wasted, though.          Tip: We saved the scoop from his formula and use it to measure the cereal from the cannister.
