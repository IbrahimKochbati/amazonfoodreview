I tried contacting the company about never receiving the set, but they just responded "The USPS tracking says that the package was delivered."  What a help they were.  I did receive a one bottle package later in the week of Daves Special Edition Insanity Sauce, although I haven't tried it yet... I was more excited about the variety in flavor rather than the "hottest sauce ever made."
