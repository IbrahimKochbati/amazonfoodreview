Great way to give your dog a healthy dental workout every day.  Every morning our dogs are waking us up to start their day with a HEXtra Chew, they even forgo eating to have their chew first thing in the morning.  We find that their teeth and  eath are cleaner and fresher then every before and they each go to their own rug to enjoy their morning chew much like we enjoy our first cup of coffee in a favorite chair.
