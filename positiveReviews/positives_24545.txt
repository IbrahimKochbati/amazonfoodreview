My local markets weren't carrying this  and this year and I only use the Farmer's Market  and for  eads, pancakes, pies, oatmeal, smoothies, etc..  I was hesitant in ordering after reading the reviews regarding dented cans but all my cans arrived in perfect condition!  I'll be reordering from Amazon when I'm out!
