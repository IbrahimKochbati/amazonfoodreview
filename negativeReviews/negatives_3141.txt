These plastic eggs are terrible quality.  I bought them to use as centers for my classroom.  I don't expect they will last much wear and tear with students because the plastic is thin, the hinges are weak, and there are even holes in some of the eggs.  I would NOT buy this product again.  I would DEFINITELY not buy these eggs for Easter to put inside it  the eggs feel dirty and filmy and it would creep me out to put candy inside them.  There's a reason these are some of the most inexpensive  the quality is sub par and disappointing.
