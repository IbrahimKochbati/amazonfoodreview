Dogs didn't seem to like flavor as much as the liver version. Good product, can't tell if it has had any  eath freshening effect. Wish it were available in a larger can, ran out kind of fast (to be fair, I had 3 dogs, totaling 140 pounds at the time. In winter, so I was kind of desperate to entertain them)
