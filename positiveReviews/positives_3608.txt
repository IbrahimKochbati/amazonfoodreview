I've used this BBQ sauce before and it is good especially considering that is free of so many negatives (like corn syrup and for us gluten) but the price on this can't be right.  Order directly from the Daddy Sam's website to pay $5.50 19 oz bottle.  This price would HAVE to be a case price although the description says 19oz.
