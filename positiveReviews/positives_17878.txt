There is enough  eading in each pouch for about 2 lbs of pork. Simply trim your Pork Chops, get them wet and then shake a few of them at a time in a sealed bag or container. The  eading coated very well and didn't leave any non covered areas. They should only take 15 20 minutes in the 425 degree oven. The pouch says to use Â½ inch thick pieces of pork. If you follow the instructions exactly then it should only take 15 minutes. I cooked 1 inch thick pieces and it took an extra 7 minutes. It still cooked well and didn't really burn except where the  eading fell off in the pan. My Pork Chops came out juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The flavor was really good and we loved them.
