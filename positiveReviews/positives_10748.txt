Pros   I love that there is an organic option for dog treats!  I taste tested it with two doggies.  My dog who wolfs down her dry, diet food like it is steak devoured this treat and seemed to absolutely love it.  My dog who isn't very interested in food in general took the treat, then dropped it out of her mouth like it was a piece of cardboard.  After much sniffing, she did slowly nibble and finish the treat.  So, in the end she did eat it, but not with gusto.  My assessment is that this treat is not going to be a big hit with every dog.  It is quite dry and hard (and does not  eak into a smaller size very easily), so it doesn't have a greasy, meaty appeal that gets both of my dogs excited.  But the greasy treats are usually unhealthy, so I would choose this option in the future.          If you have an overweight dog I would highly recommend it, since it appears like a light and dry snack, and it isn't full of nasty fats and artificial flavors.  It's an excellent choice if health is your top concern.  I try to support organics as much as possible, so I do recommend this product with some reservations and I can see myself buying it in the future.
