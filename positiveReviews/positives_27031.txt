This is a Delicious product, and in my opinion, the best nestle coffee ever!  The price on Amazon is fantastic! The Butterfinger flavor from Nestle is manufactured to be used primarily in coin operated vending machines; however, it is also perfect for in home instant use. The directions (as taken from Nestle's Professional Vendor site) is 2 Tablespoons+2Teaspoons per 6 Ounces of Water.
