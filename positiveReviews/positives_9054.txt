A birthday gift to myself. My hubby gave me the Keurig for Christmas. And I was having a hard time storing all my flavors of the K Cups. I love this for you pull it out and there they are ....flavors and all. Good construction too. And it all fits under my cabinet with room to open and fill the reservoir.
