This was a great deal for only 8 bucks!          It was shipped way before Amazon subscribed said it would be and arrived to my son's campus on the very day the scam of a college meal plan ended.          My son isn't a big fan of Chef Boyardee ravioli but i don't care..           i told him he better pretend it's tiny empanadas with sauce and eat it or continue to starve until u get a J O B and able to buy your own food.          Personally I enjoy Chef Boyardee ravioli with cheese.
