My dog really likes this interactive food dispenser. I put her regular dog food in it, when I use it. She learned within 5 min. how to grip onto the rope and shove it in & out to get her food to come out(hers did not come with a flexible rope,her rope is a fake straight stiff rubber rope). Sometimes she gives a playful growl to it while she is trying to get the food out. This toy keeps her busy for a short period of time and if your dog gulps down food, this would definitely keep them from doing that.
