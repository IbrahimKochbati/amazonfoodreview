Dog loves these   and he's about an 85 lb chow german mix, so the large size is good for him.  I guess these are good and healthy for dogs   supposedly they are   but they're also pretty expensive.  These are also chewy   so it only takes him about 1 minute to devour   so you may want to take that into consideration if you're looking for something that will last a little longer . . .
