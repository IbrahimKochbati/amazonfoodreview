Growing up in a small town in PA, I remember going to our gas station and buying this jerkey out of the jar.  I loved the stuff.  Years ago I moved away and couldnt find it anymore.I craved this stuff so one day I looked it up on Amazon and to my suprise I found it. I quickly ordered it and patiently waited for it(so very hard).  It arrived one day early...I was like a little kid in  a candy store.  I think I ate the whole bag in less than a week..lol  Just as I remembered!!!  Thank you Amazon!!
