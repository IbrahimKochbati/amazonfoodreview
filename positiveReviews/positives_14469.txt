I started a weight loss program and began incorporating this drink.  So far so good.  I have a can of the orange flavored drink (much better thanthe other flavors in my book) with oatmeal and fruit in the morning for  eakfast, and sometimes one at lunch early afternoon.  I have been losing weight, but have changed my calorie intake, so I can't vouch for calorie burning side effect.  I do feel an energy boost after drinking a can.
