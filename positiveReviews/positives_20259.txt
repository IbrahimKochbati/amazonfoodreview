This jerky has great flavor and a perfect consistency but is quite salty. Its chew is ideal for a tender jerky, it's not overly softened by enzymes to the point of crumbling, yet still retains a bit of a chew so feels like actual jerky. All of the pieces are nicely trimmed and cut against the grain from good quality beef.          The flavor is very nice as well, there's a distinct garlic flavor and a solid spicy taste. It's definitely not extremely spicy though, if you aren't phased by Tabasco sauce then this jerky will not be very hot to you. For me, the saltiness of this jerky is considerably more intense than the spiciness. My mouth remains parched many minutes after eating this, so be prepared to drink a lot of water since it's salt content is considerably higher than the average jerky.          The saltiness didn't overwhelm too much though so I was still able to experience the really nice flavor and consistency of the meat.  A lot of jerky companies use papaya enzymes to tenderize their jerky, but it tends to make it artificially soft and crumbly, sticky even. Buffalo Bill's does not use these enzymes which I assume is why they are pretty heavy on the salt since it's such a good tenderizer. if they were able to lower the salt and retain the same constancy than this would without a doubt be 5 star perfect jerky.          This is still very good stuff though and if you are not too bothered by high salt foods and like a little spice then you should definitely give this a try.
