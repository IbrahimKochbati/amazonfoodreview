i've never written an amazon review before, but this product was so horrible i had to warn would be buyers; i can eat pretty much anything, but i had to empty out both bottles... it just tasted like colored sugar water (very thin), sickening sweet.. don't know if there was any onion flavoring.. the only reason i bought this is because i couldn't get ken's steakhouse vidalia onion dressing shipped in California.  So far, the worst product i have purchased on amazon.  Buyer beware, unless you like sugar water, then "drink up"..blech.
