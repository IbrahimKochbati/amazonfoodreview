I don't have a problem getting my 8 glasses of water each day but I sometimes like a little beverage diversity and individually packaged drink packs are a good way to add a bit of a kick to water.  Because these are individual packets, it is easy to keep a few in a gym bag, work desk or purse.  I think the flavor is pretty good with no strange aftertaste.  I purchase my Wyler's lemonade at my local grocery store for about 10 cents a packet.          Some individuals may be concerned to know that this product has aspartame and acesulfame potassium. A lot of diet beverages use these additives. Both have been linked to cancer in rats and both were deemed one of the top ten worst additives by the Center for Science in the Public Interest. So, if you are cautious about additives in your food, this product may not be for you.  A serving for this product is 1 2 of a packet and 1 2 of a packet has 5 calories and 20% of your daily vitamin C.  To make a full, sufficiently flavored 16 ounce glass, you really do need the entire packet.          If you are seeking an alternative product that does not utilize these controversial ingredients and has more vitamins, I would recommend Acai Lemonade by NOW Foods. It is somewhat pricey but can be found more economically off of Amazon. That product has 15 calories and is loaded with vitamins. It has 100% of you daily vitamin C, 25% of Vitamin A, 50% of Vitamin D, 50% of Vitamin E, 50% of Thiamin, 50% of Riboflavin, 25% of Niacin, 50% of B 6, 50% of Folate, 50% of Pantothenic Acid and 1670% of Vitamin B 12.          Wyler's Light Pink Lemonade is really flavorful, easy to pack and can be very economical.  Those who want to avoid sugar substitutes may want to use this product in moderation or steer clear.          This product is made in the United States.
