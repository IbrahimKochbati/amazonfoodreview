My puppy can't seem to get enough of it. She was on Purina puppy chow and barely ate it plus my vet told me it was not healthy for a growing small  eed puppy. I researched on line and bought this one. First of all, as soon as she hears the bistro dispensing the food she runs to the machine and devours the food. For her last meal I add warm water to as recommended on the package to release its natural smells and flavors.
