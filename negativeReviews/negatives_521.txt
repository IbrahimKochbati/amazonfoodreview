I bought this same  and from an online Indian grocery store that usually has excellent products.  I was able to turn it into cream butter, using my super blender and adding some water, but it barely had any flavor.  I usually buy the Chao Kah  and of coconut cream (which is quite tasty and flavorful) and read another review for a different product for making your own coconut cream.  My complaint is not the shreds or texture.  Mine was just virtually tasteless.
