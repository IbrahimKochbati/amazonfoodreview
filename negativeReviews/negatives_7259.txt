If the treat would stay in the toy for awhile it would be fine (which it would the first couple times I used the toy) but the toy must stretch a bit or something because now my pup can get them right out and it's gone chomp, chomp.  So after I use these up I'll probably not buy them anymore and just let him get the little treats out of the middle of his toy.
