If you love chestnuts like my family does then these are the ones for you.  The wonderful thing about this product is you can get it all year round.  We LOVE them and they make a filling healthy snack anytime, anywhere.  I highly recommend them to chestnut lovers.  No roasting or peeling, they are just the heart of the nut and ready to eat.
