Now that the Pounce Hairball Treats are discontinued, I needed to find a new way of hiding treats for my cat's twice daily medicine. I was hoping that these would be pliable enough to wrap around the very small pill. Unfortunately, they crumble whenever any pressure is applied. The cat adores them, but I have to be very careful when giving her her meds now, and make sure she eats the pill, not just the treat.          Once these are gone, I'll be looking for something else.
