I've tried numerous K Cups before, and am more of a medium roast drinker.  This coffee has been very consistent (bought it numerous times), and has a smooth flavor.  I buy other cups, but this is my "stable" blend I keep on hand at all times.  Very pleased with it, as I am with other Green Mountain blends.
