Yes, they're cookies...in England they call cookies 'biscuits'...but no matter what you call them, they're delicious! The perfect dunkable for your tea or hot chocolate on a cold winter's evening in front of the fire...or even with your coffee in the morning.  They have a nice firm texture   so they don't disintegrate when you dunk them   and a mild flavor, not too sweet. Soothing and yummy...I'm addicted!
