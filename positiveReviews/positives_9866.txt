This matcha is pretty close to capturing the flavour of mangos accurately.  Red Leaf as always has produced a quality product at a reasonable price.  In the mango matcha there is the deliciousness of juicy ripe mangos with the balance of mangos that are just about ripe.  I particularly like this matcha in my morning smoothie!
