First time I gave these to my two little dogs (Maltese and Shih Tzu), they chowed on these hard treats real nicely. The very next day, I noticed that they weren't really excited when I opened the package in front of them.          Keep in mind that these treats are really hard. I do not know about large  eeds but my smaller pups definitely had trouble nibbling them.
