My aging 9 year old Maltese has always suffered from skin problems due to varying ingredient sensitivities. I've tried so many  ands of food trying to find one that will work for her. Even low fat prescription diets from Hill's, Royal Canin contain ingredients like chicken, beef, or wheat that cause her to itch.  According to our vet, to be considered "Low fat," the formula should generally have no more than 6% fat.  Since the fat content of this product is around 8%, I mix it half and half with fresh veggies and fruits.  After a 30 day trial, her cholesterol levels are now normal.
