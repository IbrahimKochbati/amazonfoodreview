I've been a huge fan of the Senseo coffee machine ever since I experienced one in France.  Upon returning home, I found one and have never looked back.  The Paris French Vanilla is my favorite, and I often receive comments from others that it smells like pancakes after I've  ewed a cup.  Great stuff!
