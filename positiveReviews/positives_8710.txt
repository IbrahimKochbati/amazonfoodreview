I almost didn't order these because of the bad review. . .only one can was really dented, and I opened that first.  No damage at all to the contents, and the flavor wasn't salty.  The apricots are tangy, the skin is a bit leathery just like fresh apricots, and the cans are quite full, not just juice with a few fruits floating around.  I was very happy with the product and would order again.  These are delicious for a quick dessert right out of the fridge, but would make a nice cobbler, too.
