This fizzy fruity soda tastes great and has no added sugars (including all the hidden ones). Tastes great, but for those who think this is a lo cal drink, nope: 135 cal per can. Has added Vitamin C (100% RDA). Like most fruit mixes main juice is apple grape, but kiwi, acerola (a wild cherry fruit), strawberry, and raspberry are listed in the ingredients. I thought you could taste flavors beyond the apple grape combo as well.
