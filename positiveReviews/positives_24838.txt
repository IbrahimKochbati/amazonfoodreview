Just got this and here I am drinking my first cup of tea. It smells wonderfully, the taste is delicious: minty, refreshing, but at the same time very warming. I read about Echinacea and its role in supporting the immune system. I ordered this tea as a means to prevent getting sick. Here's hoping it does its job! Highly recommended.
