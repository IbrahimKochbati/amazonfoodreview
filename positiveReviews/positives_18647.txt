I ordered the ketchup on the basis of some of the other reviews that gave me the impression that it was UN sweetened, since I've always thought most U.S. ketchups (and mustard, tartar sauce, baked beans, and coleslaw, for that matter! but don't get me started...) contain way too much sweetener.  When the ketchup arrived, however, I was disappointed to taste   and find that this was, IMHO, just as sweet as any other ketchup on the market.  The key is that, NO, there is no added sugar, no corn syrup   but the product uses agave as a natural sweetener.  So I would recommend this ketchup for people who want to avoid processed sugar and chemical sweeteners   but not for those individuals like me who bemoan the tendency of American food producers to pour sugar and or corn syrup into anything they can get away with.
