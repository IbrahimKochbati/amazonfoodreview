It took a little bit of time (and a few demonstrations) for my dog to become interested, but now Weezer likes to play with this toy.  He still hasn't learned exactly how the treats are dispensed, which is nice because I don't have to constantly refill the toy.  Tug a jug does not keep Weezer occupied for long stretches of time, but it entertains him for 15 30 minutes here or there.  It has held up fairly well, with just a few scratches on the plastic sides.  I put Cheerios into the tug a jug as a treats.
