Each of these six units in this package of rendered duck fat are small, but a little goes a long way. They are convenient because one package is enough to flavor anything you want to use it for without digging repeatedly into a tub and having to measure. The fat itself is delicious. I have used to to flavor home fries, roasted vegetables,  and smeared it on homemade  ead and it is fantastic. It may seem pricey, but duck fat in general is pricey and for the packaging and doorstep delivery convenience, it is a good buy.
