I wanted to try this b c it's made with sugar (or possibly natural fruit sugars) instead of corn syrup. The result was a drink that's a little sweet for my taste but one that most people will probably like. It's 33 grams of sugar per serving; I generally find fruit juices and pop to run about 28 grams of sugar. Then again, that's corn syrup, not "sugar" per se.          The flavor reminded me a bit of raspberry ginger ale (possibly influenced by its similar color). The smell of the drink is amazing and the consensus in our little at home taste test was that it smelled better than it tasted.          I would definitely try this in a party punch or similar. As for drinking it straight, it was pretty good. I was pleasantly surprised. I would try other flavors and buy this if I saw it in the store.
