First let me say that I love Starbucks coffee.  I used to buy nothing but the French Roast but once I tried the Sumatra, I found it to be a bit smoother.  The first time that I purchased it from Amazon, it was at the $19.99 sale price and I purchased two of the 3 packs which came out to $0.56 oz. (a very good price.)  I went to reorder it today and the price is currently $26.12 3 pack which comes to $0.73 oz. a much higher price than in the stores.  I see no reason in purchasing from Amazon when I can get the same thing from Wal Mart for a much lower price.  When Amazon runs the sale again, I will stock up since I go through at least 3 4 12 oz. packs a month.
