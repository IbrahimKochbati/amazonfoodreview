I love Greek food and was excited to find this product with all the positive reviews since I don't cook a lot.  I took one reviewer's advice and bought some at Wally World at a considerable savings.          My first (and probably last) attempt was chicken  easts, chick peas and sweet onions in a slow cooker.  I poured on the seasoning as I added each layer (onions, seasoning, chick peas, seasoning, chicken, seasoning, chick peas, seasoning, chicken, seasoning) to the extent that I though surely I had overdone it.          The result was tasteless.  There was no flavor at all.  It's not that it wasn't flavorful enough, it was flavorless.          I confess that I grew up in a household where we ate "world food" all the time, we just didn't know what it was because we had no cable TV and there was no FoodTV back in the dark ages anyway.  I live in an area where authentic ethnic food is everywhere.  Maybe my taste buds are completely fried (I do like me some spicy hot anything!) but to me this has less character than a moderate sprinkling of plain old black pepper, which is no character at all.
