Unfortunately, I am in charge of ordering the k cups for my office.  All of the good stuff ran out and only Emeril's Big, Easy, Bold was left.  I realize this is a 'bold' cup of coffee, but I wanted to share some of the remarks from my co workers after while drinking this coffee:          "ugh. I feel like I am drinking pure gasoline"     "eww. this coffee tastes like death"     "big, easy, kill me."     "The only thing worse than this coffee, is no coffee"     "heyyyy, when is the next coffee order?..."          Hope this helps any future coffee ordering employees.  Avoid the death stare from your co workers and avoid Emeril.
