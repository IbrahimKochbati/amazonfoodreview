So thankful Trader Joe's is selling some of their foods online.  THANK YOU!!  This mix is quite simply *the best* grains mix I've ever eaten.  I'm vegetarian, but don't let that stop you from trying this amazing recipe.          Fix 3 4 of the package according to directions, except add some curry to the grains as they cook. After the grains are cooked, add one Granny Smith apple (chopped), 2.25 oz. pkg of slivered almonds, a handful or two of golden raisins. Mix it up and eat it warm or cold.
