Our three dogs love these and in a previous review the price is very good.  I have had a difficult time finding these large bags since our PetSmart in Atlanta stopped carrying them and the cost of a small bag is ridiculous. The added plus is that my order is on auto ship so no need to worry anymore when we are about to run out since we know an order is always on the way.  Thanks for this service Amazon!
