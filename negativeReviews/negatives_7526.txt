The price I paid ended up being 25% off what I would've spent at the grocery store on 32 oz of this  and in glass containers.          However, with the price savings out of mind, I don't like that this comes in a HDPE (#2) plastic jug, simply because it is not reusable like glass is and HDPE  eaks down easily with temperature changes over time, leaching into the product.          Since real Maple Syrup only takes a dab for tons of flavor, even our large family of 5 won't get through this in a year likely (despite our weekly pancake  eakfasts). This makes me wonder if the plastic molecules will start their leaching process and then we'll be eating plastic :   I think I'd rather get glass bottles in a smaller size   the savings isn't that great.
