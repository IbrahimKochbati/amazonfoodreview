I normally like Assam teas, but this is pretty bland    the flavor is simple & shallow.  There's no richness, earthiness or depth.  Considering that this a pound bag of the stuff, if you buy it there'll be a lot of boring tea to slog through (or throw out).          One reviewer commented about the paper package impairing retention of flavor.  FWIW, while the outer bag is paper, it's plastic coated on the inside; it may not be a hermetic seal, but it's adequate.  Based on my experience, if you're spooning single servings, you can probably expect the wire fold closure to  eak halfway through the bag, so have a clothespin around.
