I don't want to give away any secrets but I buy these treats for my 3 cats.  They are all addicted to them and ask for them after dinner.          The dog treats are the same as the cat treats but at a cheaper price.  I was worried that they would be huge or something since they are sold for dogs, but not so.          I give each cat about 6 7 treats per night.  The only ingredient is SALMON.  How much healthier can you get?!  My cats' coats are extremely soft and silky, and my vet recently commented that she thought it must be the treats!          If you are looking for a healthy option when it comes to your animals instead of the supermarket trash that has un pronounceable ingredients in it, GET THESE!
