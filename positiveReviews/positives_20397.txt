I love that HAPPYBABY has added DHA and probiotics into their cereal.  We used the cereal for my daughter and have mixed it with  east milk, water, and baby food purees.  The packaging is clean!! I had previously purchased the boxed cereal and it got everywhere!  The texture is perfect for a baby new to eating solids.  I did have to figure out the perfect consistency according to my daughter's preference!  Great product that I feel great feeding my baby!
