I tried the cherry and Strawberry Kiwi.  Both are similar in taste.  This beverage tastes okay, nothing special.  It is quite sweet and can I say ... a little salty (not sure where's that from!)  It's like mixing concentrate fruit juice with club soda or carbonated Libey's Juicy Juice?          I would occasionally buy this product (because it doesn't taste bad at all) but I'll keep my fridge filled with Crush Orange soda for now...
