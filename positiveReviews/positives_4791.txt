Now I know this formulation is not the most natural or high grade one on the market right now. Believe me, I have tried to get her interested in just about every  and with the word "natural" in the title, and she is not having it. She won't get the benefit of the food if she won't eat it. So when I noticed she was eating all of her food when I put this in front of her, I decided to stick with what is apparently working. This is still premium food, formulated for my twelve year old's needs, and she really, really likes it. 'Nuff said.
