I recently adopted a puppy from a rescue, and he was a little sickly and had been eating a big label  and puppy food at the rescue. I switched him to Blue Buffalo puppy and he perked right up. He became more regular, his coat is shiny, his  eath is better and he LOVES this food! I have had dogs before on Purina One and Nutro Max, and those foods were good. But this is better....it is more expensive but it is worth it!
