My 3 year old son was just diagnosed with allergies to wheat, egg and milk.  I was so upset when I found out but a little relieved as I started finding foods he can eat.  Yes, they are crumbly but they taste good, my kids like them and they meet his new dietary restrictions.  Since the option is not giving a 3 year old cookies I don't mind some crumbs!
