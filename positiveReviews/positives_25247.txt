This maple syrup tastes very maple y and I really love it. It's not as "thick" as some Grade B syrups out there, but the flavor is just fantastic. I find I have to use less of it on pancakes french toast because it has such a nice sweetness and flavor   this is a plus since all maple syrup is basically just sugar and using less is good for me. I prefer the Grade B because it has a deeper maple flavor than Grade A.
