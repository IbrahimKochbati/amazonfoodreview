Best coffee ever. Still haven't found anything I like better. I have never tasted coffee this strong that wasn't bitter at all. Kind of pricey when you start working out what it is costing you per pound but cheaper than buying directly from Gevalia. If this company started opening stores, Starbucks and their bitter  ews would go bye bye.
