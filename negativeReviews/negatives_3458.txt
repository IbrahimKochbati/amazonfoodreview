With a variety pack I received about 7 of these k cups. I tried the first one and it was very bitter. I let my mother in law to try it separately without knowing my feelings about it and she said to me the same think.          I tried over 50 different varieties of k cups but this one definitely take the 1st place of the worst taste and the most bitter flavor.          This is the first time I write a negative review and it is disappointing but my hope is that maybe they can do something to fix that problem with their coffee.
