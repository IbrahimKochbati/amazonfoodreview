I have tried a lot of different powders, and while I like that this one has fewer calories, the taste is just not that good. It's hard to describe   it actually is very hempy, if you are familiar with the taste. That's fine if you like it, but I didn't think it went well with chocolate. It's also very strong and sweet.          There is also very little texture added by the powder, so smoothies made with this are thinner than those made with other protein powders.
