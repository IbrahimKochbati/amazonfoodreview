This is a poor excuse for a dog toy . It lasted all of ten minutes . My puppy picked it up carried it across the room and dropped it on the floor and the screw off bottom that you load the treats in shattered and rendered it useless.     Big waste of money !!!!     Potentially a choking hazard if the puppy had chewed the  oken pieces:{     It deserves no star !
