I've always hated instant oatmeal.  I like old fashioned thick cut rolled oats or I like steel cut.  Whenever I've tried instant versions of oatmeal in the past I've found them entirely inedible. Thin. watery, and no texture or real oatmeal flavor.  Mcdougalls oatmeal cups are so close to the "real" thing there is barely any difference.  After an initial try I ordered the 6 pack of my 3 favorite flavors.  I've been really happy with my  eakfast every morning of oatmeal and tea.  My only issues are the small amount of soy used and freshness.  I'd prefer they used something else or at least be sure the soy is organic. I did find a couple of rancid cups in the batch so they need to be sure these are fresh.  Overall a great product though.
