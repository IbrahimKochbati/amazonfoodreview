my dogs are not cooperative with a tooth  ushing regiment so this for me is the next best thing to controlling tartar.     They were recommended by our Vet, the dogs like them and their teeth seem to stay cleaner longer so professional cleanings are not needed as often. they are also much cheaper from Amazon than buying them from the Vet.
