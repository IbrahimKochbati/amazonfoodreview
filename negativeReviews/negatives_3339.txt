My dogs love Newman's the Chicken and the Peanut Butter treats, but didn't care for these treats.  They are about 1.5 inch square and very difficult to  eak in two.  I felt they were too big and solid to give to the dogs.  After several attempts to entice them with the treats and no happy response, I tossed them.  I will stick to the other Newman's treats.
