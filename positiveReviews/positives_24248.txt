After getting hooked on the Chai tea sold by Tastefully Simple (which is a little pricey), I decided to look online for something more affordable but still really good.  After reading the reviews on Amazon, I ordered this vanilla chai from Big Train and absolutely love it.  It has a great flavor (not too spicy but just enough).  I highly recommend it for its flavor as well as it's price.
