This bar is from a company in the UK, which is interesting because this is pretty much how I remember all their food tasting when I last visited.  A chunky, crunchy texture with an odd amount of soft pockets as you bite through is completely ruined by the strange sweetness that arises from whichever ingredient is holding the bar together.  Too dry, too many strange textures that just seem the result of sitting on a shelf too long, probably won't please most people unless you've completely given up on fat, sweet or savory flavors in your diet.
