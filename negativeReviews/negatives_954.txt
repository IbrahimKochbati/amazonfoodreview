I'll add to the growing list of reviews here regarding the Windows 7 "USB Audio Device" error.  I figured I had a 50% chance of it working.  It didn't.  Windows 7 insists on loading a USB driver that doesn't work.  There is a review here giving details on how to possibly circumvent this loading process, however, that did not work for me.  Its easier to return this thing, than spend my whole weekend jerking around in Windows 7 hardware manager.          Blue probably has a good product here, and probably blames Windows for this issue.  However, BLUE should provide a driver that works.  Don't rely on Windows to do this.  That is corporate laziness.  Spend some resources on programming something that works for Windows 7... make it available on your support website, and make it true plug and play.  Not plug and cross fingers, then spend hours messing around in the weeds of Windows settings.          Also agree with other reviews here... in the 2 days I spent with this product... it's all plastic parts, feels cheap and fragile, and the gain button is poorly thought out.          Hey Blue... you had my business... then you lost me.  I'm moving on to something else.
