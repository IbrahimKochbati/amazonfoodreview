My father is a real fan of York Peppermint Patties, unfortunately they dont sell those at home so when I travel, I always plan ahead to purchase them. This one i bought to make a candy bouquet, not only the candy came on time and in perfect conditions, but also the price was reasonable for the quantity, I'm very happy with this seller and whenever I travel to the states again I will make sure to buy ahead the candies for my daddy
