I love this maple syrup because it has a deep, rich flavor very wholesome tasting. How can people eat the artificial maple stuff from supermarkets?  There is no comparison between 100% maple syrup and the junk sold in supermarkets full of high fructose corn syrup and artificial flavors, additives.          I have purchased it at natural food stores in the smaller 8 oz glass bottle, didn't note any difference in taste from the plastic jug   this is a terrific price since the 8 oz glass bottle sells for $9.00 which would work out to $36.00 compared to the big jug Subscribe and Save price you save a couple of dollars to purchase it in bulk.  Since 100% natural maple syrup has such a long shelf life it is a good deal.          My favorite snack is fresh cranberries, walnuts, raisins, cinnamon, clove and nutmeg and cook it with rolled oats   drizzle Coombs Family Farm maple syrup in it   yummy   especially in the winter for  eakfast.          A post was written by a person who grew up on a New England maple syrup farm and said there is no difference between organic and non organic maple syrup but I know I've seen non organic maple syrup with additives like  own sugar, artifical additives, artificial flavors.
