My 14 month daughter loves these, she's been eating them since around 10 mos old.  Because 1 3 of the bag is a full fruit AND veggie serving, I sometimes give them to her along with her main dish at lunch time.  They're also great for snack time and it's great that they are completely healthy and count towards her daily fruit & veggie servings, when fresh fruit and veggies are not readily available.
