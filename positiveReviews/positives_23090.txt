This is by far the best GF  ead mix I've tried. I have made some super tasty "from scratch" GF loaves in my Zojirushi  ead machine but none of them hold together for hearty sandwiches as well as Pamela's mix does. It is fabulous toasted or untoasted, and even works in the panini press without  eaking up and falling apart. I follow the directions on the package and it comes out perfectly every time. Lately I've been using the seed  ead recipe, although I don't care for poppy seeds so I just put in extra sunflower seeds. I always add extra sesame seeds for the top. When it has fully cooled I slice it up and freeze it so it stays fresh and ready to use for toast and sandwiches. This mix also makes surprisingly good bagels! Better than any supermarket bagel, frozen or fresh. I make this  ead so often that I have the six pack set up here on Subscribe and Save for a discounted price and free shipping. Highly recommended!
