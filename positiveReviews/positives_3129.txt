I have several of these converters in my home studio    the quality is amazing on both dynamics and condenser mics!  I had an Icicle that initially had a low hum, contacted Blue, and they said that the first 500 units produced had a low hum but that has since been fixed.  They sent me a replacement unit and it works perfectly now.  BUY THIS PRODUCT if you have the need.
