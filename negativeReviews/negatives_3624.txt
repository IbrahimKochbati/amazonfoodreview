Bought this and the regular for a friend's birthday present. Purchased the 3 pack   My friend saw a review of this on Oprah   Can't find it in stores... so I tried this   It is a bit strong   had to mix in more light mayo with it... I am waiting for my tomatoes to come in for a Tomato and Baconnaise sandwich   that will be the TRUE TEST!!     So far my review is this   Not bad  but it is strong. You may have to mix it with more mayo like I did.
