I have one of the new "VUE"  ewers from Keurig and it took a bit of time to find which VUE cups were the ones I preferred. Interestingly, the VUE cups can be different depths! I compared a light roast to an Italian roast and this French roast, and the Italian roast and French had almost 2X as much coffee. Amazing. That's something interesting about the new VUE cups in that they can be different sizes.          The Tully French roast was much nicer than the Italian roast (different  and) in that it still has that burnt, espresso like aspect but a bit of sweetness and smoothness. I made it up weaker than I usually make my coffee, taking advantage of the variable size option on the VUE. A 12oz cup, made up in a travel mug was delightful and I sipped it all the way on my commute to my office.          As to the travel mugs, if you remove (entirely) the black base, your mug may fit but not unless the entire base is off  even to the black undertray. In my case, my fave mug is so tall I had to shim the unit up just a bit and then my 20oz insulated steel mug did indeed finally fit underneath. And so, the coffee stayed nice and hot for at least a half hour.
