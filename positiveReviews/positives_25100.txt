These little bees showed up perfectly packaged two days before their arrival estimate.  They are super cute and made me extremely happy.  I was afraid they'd show up and be rock hard, inedible, and with goofy coloring that was just a little bit off.  But they are exactly as they appear in the photo   the white is where it belongs, the stripes are solid and straight, they are delicate but firm and will be the perfect addition to my little beehive cupcakes.     I fully intend on ordering more product from this seller in the future with confidence.
