My lab chewed up the rope in a couple hours. This alone is not a huge deal as the instructions with the toy say that a ball can be placed inside the container and have a similar effect as the rope. However, before I could even place a ball in it, the plastic developed a large crack from the dog just carrying his toy around the house and dropping it on our carpetted floors. He has other plasic toys that he has had for months with absolutely no signs of damage.
