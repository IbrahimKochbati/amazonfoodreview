This was my first time ordering a Japanese candy, from Kracie, to be exact. I was so excited to receive it after watching many YouTube videos about it. I must say, it was so much fun to make this! Don't worry if you don't know Japanese, as you can either watch instructional videos from YouTube or follow the pictures, as they are thourough.          All of the different ingredients smelled wonderful. The rice smelled like bubblegum. The egg and meat smelled faintly like mango. The seaweed smelled like grape. The fish eggs and soy sauce smelled a bit like mango, but more of a fruitier smell.          Now for the taste. I loved the taste of each one, as they weren't overpowering. But the textures are what really displeased me. The rice was really cool because of the feel in my hands, but in your mouth it tastes kind of stiff and grainy. I think that the worst texture was the meat and egg. They were so grainy that I could barely swallow them, and to top it off they were on top of the rice. Yuck!          The best taste and texture had to be the fish eggs. They are little gel balls, just like that product from a long time ago that Listerine made. It was  eath freshener "mints", that were in the gelled ball form, and they exploded with liquid when you bit them, making your mouth feel fresh. I actually ended up saving the fish eggs instead of putting them on the sushi because I liked eating them. Also, the soy sauce and the mixture that you put the fish eggs in tasted wonderful, with that faint fruity taste.          The product shipped the day after I order it (standard shipping), and came a week later (the first estimated delivery date). I was very happy about that, especially since it shipped from Japan.          Overall, I think if you are considering it, buy it! It is such a fun way to make candy. Just beware of the rice, meat, and egg after you make it!
