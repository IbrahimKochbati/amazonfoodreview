David Rio Flamingo Sugar Free Chai Tea Latte is so delicious and creamy, all you need to do is add water. No milk is needed! It tastes just as you imagine a creamy vanilla chai latte should... AND it has NO trans fats, and NO aspartame (it's made with splenda)! I just pray that David Rio comes out with a sugar free version of the chocolate chai...
