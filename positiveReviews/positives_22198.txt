I love nuts, but I don't eat them straight out of a jar because I would eat way too much. These bars are the perfect compromise. They're chock full of whole almonds and Brazil nuts, with lesser amounts of hazelnuts, filberts, peanuts and dried fruit. The high percentage of nuts keeps the bars from being too sweet. I bought these as a Christmas treat (they're a great alternative to fruitcake), but I liked them so much that I bought another box for after the holidays.
