This tea certainly exceeded my expectations!  While pricey, you most certainly get what you pay for.  The tea is an amazing blend of nuanced flavors.  While the Bergamot is center stage, the tea itself is first rate.  When you open the can, be prepared to meet a fully formed and highly complex Earl Grey.  If you have been drinking "retail" Earl Grey, this one will bowl you over.  Every time I enjoy a cup, I'm so happy I made this purchase.  FYI, I have found that 2 teaspoons steeped for about 3 minutes in a cup of water delivers a perfect product, flavorful, but never over powering or bitter.  If you like Earl Grey, try this product!
