These weren't awful, they just weren't good. The combination of flavors is actually nice because you can't go wrong without chocolate and coconut, but the texture just ruins it all. I do understand that often gluten free baking has its obstacles to overcome, but these bars feel like they want to be cake like but wind up powdery and almost tough at the same time. Basically, they have the sort of texture one imagines a "gluten free" product would have (although it doesn't have to be this way!) And while I love almonds, their presence only adds to the unpleasant feeling this bar has in the mouth.     Luckily, I'm not gluten free, but if I were I imagine these would be nice in a pinch though I wouldn't seek them out just to have around.
