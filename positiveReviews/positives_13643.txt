You know this stuff tastes really good... once you get it to dissolve. I suppose if you have a food processor and can powder it (as its in sugar esq crystals on arrival)   or can make a liquid variant. Took off one star for the hassle of having to modify it from its original state for use in cold drinks.          That being said, does anyone know if the heat + equal parts sugar   water   liquid sugar method will work with Erythritol? Or will the chemical process be different?
