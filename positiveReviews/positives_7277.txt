I've tried several  ands and this is true to the taste of fresh coconut water, though slightly more dilute.  The "wholesale" price here doesn't make much sense to me.  It's about $5.75 per liter in an 12 pack.  I get it for $4.99 at Publix.  The only disadvantage is that they only have maybe 4 or 5 at a time, but I'm one of few buying it and I sweep the shelves of it (LOL).       I'm 37 weeks pregnant and this helps decrease the swelling in my legs and keeps me well hydrated.  I don't experience any leg cramps like I did during my first pregnancy.  I think the potassium makes a huge difference.  And with a tendency towards gestational diabetes, the low sugar content vs. other sports drinks is a huge advantage.  They should market this directly to pregnant women with diabetes (with no renal issues).
