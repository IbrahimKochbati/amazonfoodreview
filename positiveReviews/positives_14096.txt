Good flavorful tea.  Organic and tasty.  Stands up to some milk or to drink plain.  I love loose leaf teas and this is an easy way to find a good one.  It's nice to have it come in a 1 lb bag.  The bag is a self closer zip lock one, but it doesn't really work once you open it.  I just use chip clips or put it in anoterh container.  Enjoy!
