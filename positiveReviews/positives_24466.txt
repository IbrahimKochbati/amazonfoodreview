These are great tasting meat substitutes !!     What isn't great is that a 20 ounce can costs $18.58.  A 50 ounce can costs 11.55 !!!  Something is really messed up in the comparative pricing.          Other than that, these are great.  I hate that we have to buy a 50 ounce can (which is way more than we need) in order to be financially prudent.
