We got a box of this along with our Keurig  ewer from Costco. We have three coffee drinkers in the house and all of us are fond of strong, dark roasted coffee.  This blend is underroasted and weak.  The one good point is that it isn't as sour as most cinnamon roasts are.  We ended up throwing out half the box because I couldn't get anybody to drink it.          If you're a fan of very mild medium roasts you'll probably enjoy this.  If you like coffee strong and dark with some body to it you'll hate it.
