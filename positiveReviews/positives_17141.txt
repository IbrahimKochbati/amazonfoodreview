When I was little I remember my family would make "cafe con leche"   the old style way   and I could never quite get the taste right now that I'm an adult  when trying to make it. When I first opened a can of Nescafe Cafe Con Leche it  ought back memories! It is the closest thing to "cafe con leche" that you'll get in a can   I just add a little sugar and it is absolutely delicious. Those of you who grew up drinking cafe con leche should try this :)
