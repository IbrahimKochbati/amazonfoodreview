I was on a business trip with my husband and we took our poodles along.  I needed treats for the poodles and saw these   figured I had nothing to lose.  WOW, my dogs loved them!  Usually they will hide their treat and try to steal the treat for the other dog, but with these they never left their own.  Amazing   I must buy more!
