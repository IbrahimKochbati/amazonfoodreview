My son just started the Gluten Free diet and I have tried some foods out there just seeing what he will eat. He loved it, I couldn't believe it at first but he kept eating. I'm really glad that I was able to find something that he loves to eat for  eakfast. My little girl has starring to eat it to and she says it taste good. I buy it every time I run out cause I love eating it too.
