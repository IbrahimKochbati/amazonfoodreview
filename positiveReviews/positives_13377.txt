I got this as a sample with my new Mr. Coffee keurig machine.  I usually only drink one cup here and there fairly inconsistently and I am absolutely loving how k cups work.  That being said, this k cup made the best coffee I have ever had, hands down.  It isn't bitter at all and has a nice bold flavor that sends a warmth of delight radiating out from your taste buds. It seems a bit bold for a medium roast, so keep that in mind. It does say "extra bold very intense" on the cup after all.  However, it is perfect for someone who enjoys a strong and fairly intense cup. I will continue to try other k cups but I have a feeling this will become my staple, go to  and for some time to come.  I always liked coffee but would not consider myself a "coffee lover".  Between this cup and my new machine to  ew it with, I'm definitely heading in that direction.  Try some!
