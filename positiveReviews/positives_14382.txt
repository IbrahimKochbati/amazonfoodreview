I have 2 large dogs who are getting older and a little slower now, so I got these for them.  They will do just about anything for them.  I also have a small dog who is young and she wants them, too.  I like that there is nothing harmful in them and that they are a USA product.  It is a much more healthful treat and supplement than many that are available.  I will be buying these again.
