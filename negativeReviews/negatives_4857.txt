My AKC English Bulldog has been using greenies since he was a puppy, and hasnt had any problems with it. Ive always given him the correct size greenie for his weight, and have never had to take him to the vet. (yet I never leave him unattended with his greenie) The only problem I had with this particular seller was the picture on display, and what I recieved in the mail. Please don't make the same mistake I did, there are only 17 greenies in the box, would have been better off buying them at Petsmart.
