This is the best caramel chocolate combination I have ever tasted. The caramel is liquid and complements the Ghiradelli chocolate perfectly. Do not try this  ew if you are attempting to lose weight   you will end up an addict like me.       The Ghiradelli product is far better than the Caramello Hershey product in every way. The Caramello chocolate lacks the refined taste of the Ghiradelli squares, and the Caramello caramel is harder and not as sublime in taste. Comparing the two is like comparing Warren Buffett to myself in terms of wealth. Unfortunately I am the Caramello bar in this regard.       At the very least try the Ghiradelli.
