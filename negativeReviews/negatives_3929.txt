I like the idea behind this product, but the taste was just too sweet for me, and it has a strange aftertaste. While it has no added sugar or corn syrup, there are plenty of calories (135 for an 8.3 ounce can) and carbs. Also, looking at the price, I think it is way too expensive almost a dollar a can. I would chose flavored seltzer over this any day.
