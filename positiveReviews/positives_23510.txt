My wife doesn't like these as much as another  and we ordered from Amazon previously.  She says they are firmer and "bland."  To me, they taste just fine, and an unsalted, untoasted sunflower seed is, well, expected maybe to be somewhat bland, perhaps?  A seed with a little crunch is fine by me, and we'll buy these in bulk again if the price is right since finding shelled, unsalted seeds (which is what we want) locally is impossible.
