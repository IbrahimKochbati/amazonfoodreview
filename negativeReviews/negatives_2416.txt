I was so excited to see these! And the price is good.          First, it takes a little learning to figure out how to cook these. The instructions are not much help. "Stop cooking when the bag stops expanding"....they might as well say, perform a Vulcan mind meld with the pork rinds to know when they are done. I found that the bag's expansion  or not   has little to do with whether they are done. I have a 1200 watt microwave and 1:30 was perfect. 1:00 and they were not cooked, 2:00 and I had charcoal bits.     I had to sacrifice a couple of precious bags to figure this out.          Taste and texture? Well they are infinitely better than bags of pork rinds from the store. The texture is very good. The taste? I am in no way shy of salty food, love me some salt! But these were borderline too much for me. I did sprinkle some cinnamon and Ideal on them to make them sweet and I still had a hard time eating them. My husband liked them this way though.          If they could back off the strong salty flavor, I would buy these again. As it is, I'm going to use them to make low carb nachos. I won't be reordering them though. Love the crispy texture! But can't choke down the overpowering saltiness.
