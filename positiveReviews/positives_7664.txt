I was never a big fan of pork rinds. But since I started doing Atkins, I was buying them sometimes to fill that desire for a crunchy, salty snack.  I ended up only buying the hot variety since it seemed to cover the taste of the rinds better than plain or bbq.  After reading the reviews here, decided to give these a try.          I had never had anything other than the bagged variety of pork rinds.  As others have mentioned here, these are far superior to anything you will find in a bag.  Way, way better than any bagged variety I have sampled.  Plus the make this great popping, crackling noise when you take them out for a minute or so that I greatly enjoy for some reason.          Do mind the cooking instructions.  If you overcook, they will end up tasting closer to the bagged taste you are trying to avoid.  Still better than bagged though.  I tried different times in my microwave but found it best to watch and take them out as soon as the bag stops rising.  You will sometimes have some that did not expand(you can pop these back in the microwave to try and revive them) but it is not worth burning some of them to try to ensure all have expanded.
