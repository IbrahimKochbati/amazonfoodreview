We do have a "Snack Group" at work. We used to buy everything from Pretzels to candy to bubble gum to snack on around 3 PM at work. A colleague got some caramel coated peanuts from his vacation in Williamsburg. That is where our "addiction" to peanuts began.     Since I had prime membership on Amazon, I volunteered to buy these peanuts and took them to work. They were an instant hit. The are nice big crunchy peanuts with just the right amount of salt. We love it. I was asked to put in a repeat order within a week of getting these.The goodies were delivered promptly and we rightly have a twin set ready, waiting for the last few peanuts from the previous stock.          If I were to make a suggestion, I would recommend the folks at Royal Oak to come up with different flavors, while maintaining the quality of the peanuts. I can see myself subscribing to their products (twice a month delivery), if they come up with flavored peanuts.
