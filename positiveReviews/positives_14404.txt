Only the best for our little guy!  He loves them.  I pack a few for our hikes and they seem to give our 10 year old LAB that extra boost that he needs!  I can see the difference in his energy when we run out of them so I try my best to keep them stocked.  They seem to help him!  Amazon is the best price around.  His favorite is the Peanut Butter!
