Let me say I bought this product because Amazon was offering 30% off in addition to the subscribe and save discount.  It says each count (or bottle) would be $0.05 (or 5 cents a count bottle) after subscribe and save.  Then in the product description it says contains 24 24 count cases and even says 576 counts, which one would take to mean this is 24 cases containing 24 bottles each totaling 576 bottles of water.  Well, the order comes and it is a case of 24 bottles. What? I can get a case of water with 35 bottles for less than $3 at Costco.  The water may be good but beware that their description here on quantity is WAY off before buying.
