I like most varieties of Primal Strips. They are a fantastic snack for active vegetarians (10g protein, 2g fat, 8g carbs.). The Thai Peanut variety is very tasty with a little bit of a kick. The texture is firm, which I enjoy, but it typically gets stuck between my teeth so I always need to have some dental floss handy.
