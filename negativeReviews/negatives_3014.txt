I hate chocolate. I used to have this on subscribe and save because the two pack was cheaper than buying the other flavors individually. Unfortunately, the only two pack on subscribe and save was chocolate flavor. I was able to get past the taste despite really wanting to try the other flavors, but there were a few side effects to this particular  and of hemp mix.          I would get really irritating tooth aches    in my gums or teeth    after I made a shake with this. I've narrowed it down to the inulin or the guar gum. I tried the Manitoba (vanilla) and never experienced an ache. I then tried the super berry version of Nutiva Hemp Shake and my tooth gum pain returned. Also, I would never ever recommend the super berry flavor; it tastes like flintstones children's vitamins.          Three stars go to a not so bad flavor. I think someone who actually likes chocolate will enjoy this flavor. However, some of the ingredients clearly gave me a reaction, so I couldn't give this product a full five stars. I think the inulin and guar gum are unnecessary ingredients, but I believe it's what they use to make this mix more 'mixable,' as compared to Manitoba's (which has only three ingredients total) 'sandier' texture. I don't mind the texture of Manitoba's. I don't need a smooth hemp shake, but the texture seems to really bother some other reviewers. If you prefer smoother over grittier, then try this one (but I hope you try them both to make your own comparison.)          **Update 25 10 12          I wanted to say that it would have to be the inulin. I was looking at the ingredients in a raw meal powder that I used to take and it has guar gum, and I never experienced gum or tooth pain with it.          ALSO, in regards to how horrible the super berry flavor tastes: I tried it with apple juice today and it redeemed itself. I was trying to finish off the container that I still have and normally I mix my Manitoba hemp with water or apple juice and tried it with the super berry Nutiva. It actually tastes very good with apple juice    they compliment eachother perfectly. I used soy and 7 grain milks before, so I would just recommend trying super berry with juice if you also think it tastes bad.
