For a healthy, alternative snack bar that is wheat free, gluten free and non dairy and contains a host of dull ingredients like gluten free oats and organic agave, I think Pamela's has done a superior job perfecting taste with their Whenever Bars (Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut) ... and (thankfully!) NO high fructose corn syrup to boot!          The bars certainly live up to their "moist and chewy" label description. I mean, come on, how much magic can you whip up on such a limited and boring ingredient budget?  With these limitations in mind, Pamela's has created a pretty delicious snack that may not be the most filling thing to eat, but then again, how many snack bars (healthy and of the junk food variety) really do the trick and fill you up like, let's say, a decadent hot fudge sundae!          Although the chocolate was a bit sparse, as far as the amount of coconut   think macaroons! For coconut lovers, this snack bar should be on the top of the shopping list. I would have given these  Whenever Bars a five star rating, and the only reason that I knocked off one star was that my 16 year old daughter, who was my fellow taste tester, complained about an aftertaste. At least now, I don't have to worry about MY Whenever Bars disappearing!
