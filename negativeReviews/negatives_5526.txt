Maybe I am the only one, but I give my dogs pig ears to keep them occupied for a while. It takes both of them a good 5 10 minutes to eat one. But I know they aren't the healthiest thing on the planet, so when these better than ears came out, of course I tried them. Both of my dogs love them, but they can eat one in about 30 seconds, defeating the purpose of a chew type treat. For the price, I'd rather just buy them regular dog biscuits that are eaten in the same amount of time. That being said, the Amazon price is MUCH cheaper than any in store local price I've seen. Maybe these are better for small dogs that can't devour them so quickly, but my 70 pounders eat them like they are a regular old dog biscuit.
