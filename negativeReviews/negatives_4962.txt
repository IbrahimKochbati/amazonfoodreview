I was so excited to get this toy for my 7 month old yellow lab.  When it arrived I filled it with kibble and soon discovered that this is the worst toy ever. It is loud and dangerous. The jug is a hard plastic that when swung around can easily  uise you and your dog and  eak everything in the house. In addition, because I have hard wood floors, the loud bang of the hard plastic against the floor was unbearable.  Lastly, in the two days I allowed her to play with it, the rope became frayed and I kept finding pieces of string in her mouth.  I definitely do not recommend this item.
