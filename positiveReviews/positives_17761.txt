Started buying Blue Sky organic for my husband. He wanted a soda without high fructose corn syrup in it. Tried the cola first and it took a few days to adjust to the taste but he said it was good. Then I bought the root beer and he fell in love with it. If you are older and remember the old A & W root beer joints this tastes just as good. He prefers it over the cola now. Thumbs up Hubby is happy :)
