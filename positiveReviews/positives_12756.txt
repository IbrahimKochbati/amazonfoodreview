This is by far the best coffee I've ever had. If you don't want to be addicted to a particular  and flavor, then do not try this. Otherwise, you will be hooked. I have also tried their cinnamon blend, which I did not care for as much (seemed to be too strong of a cinnamon flavor, and I love cinnamon). Check out prices at their website first though, as they may be cheaper there.
