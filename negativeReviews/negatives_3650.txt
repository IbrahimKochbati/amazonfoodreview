I've had to hunt far and wide to find the right K cups for me.  Generally, I like coffee people donut shop, and that had been my go to coffee for a while.  The dark bold coffees are way too intense for me, but the mediums are generally way too weak.  Wanting to try something new, I followed the reviews and tried this coffee thinking it would be a good strong but not too strong alternative.          It wasn't.  If I use two pods, this is a decent, but weaker, coffee for me to use in my travel cup for the ride into work.  Otherwise, it is much too weak.  I was very surprised that the first time I  ewed some and poured in half and half, the coffee turned very light  own.  It was almost white.  I will get through this package, but I will not buy again.  It's not cost effective for me to use two pods to be satisfied.  Any other suggestions?
