I love these Compleats as they have only 210 calories as compared with 300# for most of the other Compleats.  This is hot and satisfying for lunch and I can still have a 70 calorie chocolate pudding without going over 300 calories.  Very helpful to keep weight down.  These are hard to find in my local grocery stores.
