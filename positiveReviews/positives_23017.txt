Life cereal is quite tasty. Cinnamon Life is even better. It's sweet, but not so sickeningly sweet that only a child could like it. I'm an adult and I enjoy eating it regularly.          What's better than Cinnamon Life? Cinnamon Life at Amazon prices. The "regular price" for a box of this cereal at local grocery stores is in the neighborhood of $3 4. Outrageous. I commonly see supermarkets offer it for $2.00 in their weekly ads. That's more reasonable.          However, Amazon's regular price undercuts even the supermarket sale price if you choose the Subscribe and Save option. Plus, when you do Subscribe and Save you can choose your shipment rate based on your consumption rate, never have to worry about running out, and get free shipping! What's not to love?
