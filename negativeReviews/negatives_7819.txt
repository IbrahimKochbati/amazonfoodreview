This is decent tasting.  The cottage cheese leaves a lot to be desired.  It picks up the sauce color all the way through, looking grayish  own.  Rubbery texture.  No worse than other  ands in that respect.  Not really a Korma in my opinion, more like a curry.  Given what's available locally, i would not buy this again.
