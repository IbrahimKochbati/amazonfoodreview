Potatoes were good. Two 12 oz trays will be enough for 4 adults so really not worth the money honestly. $10 for two little trays is a lot even for the ease and quality. Like I said they were good and easy to prepare and thankfully only four of us for x mas dinner today or I wouldn't have had enough. 24 oz. of potatoes sounds bigger then it is lol. (not Omaha's fault)
