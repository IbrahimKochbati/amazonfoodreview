These chips are awesome. The light airy texture makes them a pleasant snack. I am dieting and thesse fit in reall nice. Gives me that salty, crunchy yummy taste that keeps my points low for the day. I love them. I have recommended them to all my diet buddies and they love them. I haven't tried all the flavors yet, only those in the variety pack but trust me I will be tracking them all down and hopefully find my favorite. That may be difficult they are all so good!!!
