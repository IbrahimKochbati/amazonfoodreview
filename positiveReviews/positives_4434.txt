I've never bought vanilla beans before, but I have seen them in the store   all dry and crusty looking.  These beans are vacuum sealed, and because of that are still moist.  They smelled great.  My whole pantry smelled wonderful after I put them in there, and they made my homemade vanilla bean ice cream the most vanilla y ice cream I've ever had.  (Even more vanilla y than Blue Bell!)  When I run out, I'll absolutely buy more of these!
