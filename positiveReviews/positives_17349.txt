This is a Japanese Green Tea, not Chinese.     That makes the difference,its steamed to get it ready for market.     If you love green tea and have the patients to check the heat of the water and the amount of time the tea is in the water, then you can have the experience of a life time.     You will not be disappointed In Rishi Sench Green. Its the best at any price , none better.
