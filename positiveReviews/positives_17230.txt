i got this on sale for a great price.  i really like this  and and company, stevita, because they grow their own stevia organically (even though it's not certified organic) in  azil, and not china!!!  (i'm afraid of even certified organic foods from china).  the only reason i give it 4 stars is because it has a bit more of an aftertaste than other  ands, but the quality of this  and is much better.
