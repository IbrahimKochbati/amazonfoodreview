I thought it was just me, but now I see that I'm not the only one who hates the new version.  The original recipe had such a delicious aroma, this one smells and tastes artificial.  I have to resort to adding my own  own sugar and maple syrup, but it's still not right.  I will be trying another  and   McCann's Maple & Brown Sugar as someone suggested.  Bad move Quaker Oats.
