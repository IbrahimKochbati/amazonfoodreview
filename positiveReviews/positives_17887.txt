I picked this up out of pure nostalgia.  Shake 'N' Bake is one of those "easy dinners" that reminds me of my childhood, with three  others and a working single mother meant that our family dinners were quick and dirty.  TV dinners with Salisbury steak.  Cardboard pizzas heated up in the oven.  And a quick round of Shake 'N' Bake.  Of these, Shake 'N' Bake was always a hit because as kids we liked shaking the bag. And then voila! Fried chicken or pork cutlet!          The nostalgia factor was fun when I made this, putting the pork in a bag and giving it some wild shakes.  The food cooked up decently, and there is nothing really wrong with Shake 'N' Bake.  Ultimately though, there is no real need for it either.  Anyone with a decent kitchen can whip together some flower,  ead crumbs, and spices for a home cooked Shake 'N' Bake anytime they want.          Shake 'N' Bake just saves you a little time, by having everything proportioned out and in a bag, ready to go.  If you are like my mother was, with three kids and a job, I can imagine being thankful for easy convenience.  But as with most things relying on the nostalgia factor, one trip down memory lane was enough for me.
