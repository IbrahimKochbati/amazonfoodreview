After a year of searching and trying new recipes this  ead mix won!  We use the egg free version, substituting applesauce mixed with egg replacer and make it in two mini loaves in order for the  ead to not fall.  Cooking time needs to be longer with the applesauce.  It also makes great rolls.  The  ead has  ead like texture and the whole family likes it.  It also holds well for about a week without freezing.
