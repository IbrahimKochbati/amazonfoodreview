I have no idea how these people sleep at night!! I pay $1.68 for these mints at Wal Mart. When I saw these on amazon, for $12 somthing I asumed this price was for a case. This seemed like a money saving deal to me even including shipping. I ordered 2 thinking it was 2 cases and the total was $32 and change. They arived a few days later and it was 2 6OZ BAGS!!!!!!!!!!!! For $32  dollars I got 12 oz of mints! How in the hell can they screw people like this and live with themselves? Who would pay over $12 for 6 oz of peppermints??? My dumb ass I guess, but it wont happen again because I won't be buying anything else, ever again from these theives. I suggest you dont either!!!!!!!!!!
