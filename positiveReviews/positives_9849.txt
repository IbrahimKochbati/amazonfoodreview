I had this in the store to  eak out of the normal coffee routine, and it was great. Unfortunately I had to buy it online, but the quality is just as good as it was in the store. If you love tea, and want to try something different, or just want to give it a try, it's worth it. The tea is unlike any other I've tried, but great for the mornings!
