I don't use sweetener, but wanted to try this coffee.  It is not sweetened, thank goodness.  I cannot taste the Vanilla or Pumpkin pie flavor, but I can smell it, and I love that.  For me this is a great cup of coffee.  Tastes just like a good cup of coffee, but has that wonderful, comforting aroma.  I will buy this again.  I would imagine that with sweetener, the other flavors would likely be there.
