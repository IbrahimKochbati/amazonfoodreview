I originally discovered this years ago on vacation in southern Maryland. Since then it's always been in our cupboard. We came home to PA that year with three cans of it and then resupplied each summer. After a couple of years it became available in our area, but in the last year or so, we haven't been able to find it anywhere. This is one seasoning I don't mind buying by the case. (and it's a great price, too!)          We put it on virtually anything   and I mean anything. Meats, poultry, seafood, salads, spaghetti, eggs, pot pie, vegetables, soups, whatever. It's especially good on any pasta dish. I even sprinkle it on a sandwich. The spice is just the right amount of heat with the touch of lemon to top it off. It sounds weird but I think I could even enjoy this on ice cream.
