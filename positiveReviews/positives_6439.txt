I personally don't like strong coffee.  If you like weaker coffee, then this blend is a great choice for you.  Other reviews on here say that its too weak, which is probably true if your used to something strong.          I also use flavored creamer to further enhance the taste. For the price, it can't hurt to give it a try.
