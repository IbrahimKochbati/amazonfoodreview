It has been said, that dogs often show signs of their owner's personality and quirks   that our bad behaviors become their own.  In fact, my dog's Vet recently told me, that if he sees an obese dog, he can just glance at the owner, and they will often share the problem.  Not only that, but I've seen photos of dogs and owners, where I swear there was a shared physical resemblance.  What do we try to do, make our dogs into a little mini me?  With this sudden jarring epiphany, I think we're in trouble here.          Although my dog is far from a 'mini me,' at 126 lbs and 30" tall, given the opportunity to select a healthy, organic snack, over an inferior product, well...let me just make this analogy.  If I'm really having a craving for a snack, and there is a bag of Cheetos in the cabinet, I'm more likely to grab them, than the 'all natural' carrot sticks and celery in the veggie drawer. Enough said, and I clearly know better.  My Shepherd doesn't. He eats a high quality food, but I have let him dictate his treats, based on his observable level of enjoyment. In essence   we DO spoil our dogs, and ourselves.          In test after test, given the opportunity to select the 'Newman's Own' treat, over my dog's favorite bargain  and   okay, Milk Bones, he would go for the MB every single time. But, toward the end of the bag of Newman's Own, I began to notice a change in enthusiasm.  Maybe eating healthy for humans and dogs, alike, is an aquired taste, or simply a change in habits.          Will I purchase Newman's Own, after this trial? Absolutely! I'm sold on the all natural ingredients, the absence of chemicals and the product analysis. The only thing I found missing from the product description is the calorie count, with recommendations for appropriate number of treats, daily, which I think is important for managing weight. Although with the few 'natural' ingredients listed (Organic Barley, Organic Lamb, Organic Carrots, Apples, Organic Palm Oil and Organic Molasses, preserved with Mixed Tocopherols   a source of Vi E) I doubt the calorie count could be that high, as these are not large treats.          These treats are hard, and dense, which gave my dog a good dental workout, even with his mouth the size of a small alligator. Of course, it was gone in just a minute (but so is everything else), but smaller dogs would likely enjoy chewing on one of these for a while.          I say, give them a try. You won't find anything healthier (per the product description), unless you decide to make your own dog biscuits, which many of my friends are now doing. But, doing so, wouldn't be more cost effective, because you would need to purchase all organic, while baking them in small batches due to preservative issues.
