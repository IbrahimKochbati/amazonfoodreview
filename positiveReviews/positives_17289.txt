It tastes like a milder version of the classic pho. The meaty smell is there for the  oth. I would strongly suggest you to add hot sauce if you enjoy spicy food. Also, bean sprouts are a must add as well. The noodles were good, however, they could have been thinner, for a more authentic experience, but I do understand that it probably makes it harder to package reheat. Anyways, overall, it is quite enjoyable after you get through the initial weird smell that comes out of the microwave, thanks to the above mentioned beef smell. I would buy this again.
