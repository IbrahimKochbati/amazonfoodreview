If you like a soft cookie this one may be for you.  The Chocolate and Almond flavor comes through in just the right amount.  Each cookie is sealed in it own pouch so when you open it up it is fresh.  They come 6 packs to the box.  If you need fiber in your diet you can get 4 g per cookie.  You also get 180 calories per cookie.  While the label on the box states that the cookies are made with Whole Grain Quaker Oats (and they are) they are also made with wheat.  If you read down the ingredients they also contain soy bean oil.  While this is not important to most people it is to any allergic or sensitive to either ingredients. These would be great to keep in the car for a quick snack or to put in a lunch box for children to take to school.
