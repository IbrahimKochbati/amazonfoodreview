The only way we could make Switch Orange Tangerine drinkable was mixing 50 50 with club soda. It was just way too sweet. It then tasted good, but Orangina and San Pelligrino both have awesome Orange flavored sodas out there with no need to mix! And surprisingly, imported San Pelligrino comes out to be cheaper because the cans are larger (11.3 oz. as opposed to 8 oz).
