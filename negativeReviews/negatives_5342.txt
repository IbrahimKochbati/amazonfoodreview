I was concerned that the beneficial features of this particular  ew were going to give it a distinctively different flavor. I was imagining something like a dark tea. This, however, was not the case. I found the flavor to be pleasant. Not as rich as the same flavor from other popular  ands, but pleasant.          If I were a more serious sufferer of acid reflux, I certainly believe that the small sacrifice in flavor would be worth it. For me, personally, I will probably stick with my regulars.
