I had ordered the the GN popcorn to go with the popcorn machine that I purchased for a Christmas gift for my husband.     The 6 oz size was perfect for a family of 4. My husband loves the convenience of the portion packs and the popcorn tastes very close to movie theatre popcorn.     It was a bit salty for my taste but my family loves salt so they loved the popcorn.     I just ordered another pack but this time the 8oz portion size for bigger gatherings.
