This is my favorite dry mix soup. I can't really find it at our groccery stores, and if i do, it's never this kind. I love the soup not to hot, not to mild. I usually add ground hamburger meat to it. Love it, so when I saw that amazon carried this I was thrilled, now I can always have it on hand! Thanks Amazon!
