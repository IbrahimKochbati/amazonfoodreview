I just cannot understand the high praise these chips have received! AGREE. I ordered the Sea Salt&Vinger packs and am very disappointed. Ver weird Vinegary awful taste. The salt and vinegar especially tasted gross! I took one bite and had to throw the bag away. Agrre. Now I'm stuck with a bunch of 23 bags of chips that I'll never eat.
