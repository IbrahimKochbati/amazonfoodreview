I love the chocolate  ownies that i've ordered from this company, but to me   the blondies seem wayyy undercooked.  I know people love  ownies moist and chewy, but to me they seem doughy and almost like raw cookie dough.          They have candies on them and caramel etc., and i feel they are a good product and company   it's just that i like my blondies cooked longer!  I am going to try to bake one in the oven, altho i know parts of it will melt.
