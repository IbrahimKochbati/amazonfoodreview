I thought these bars might be a good substitute for the Honey Nut Cherrios bar that I have for  eakfast, I was wrong.          Although they are both 40g bars the Cherrios bar is more filling.  They are about even on Calories but the Whenever Bar gets 80 of its 180 from fat, whereas the Cherrios bar gets only 35 of its 160 from fat.  The Whenever Bar has 15mg of Cholesterol, whereas the Cherrios bar has none.  The two bars are about even on Total Carbohydrates.          To me this bar does not taste like Chocolate Chips   maybe that taste is overwhelmed by the heavy Coconut flavor.  If these were called Coconut bars, with a hint of Chocolate   maybe I would give them a higher rating   but, to me, the flavors are not as the product name would lead me to believe.          I really was underwhelmed by this product, and unless you are a big Coconut fan, you probably want to buy something else.
