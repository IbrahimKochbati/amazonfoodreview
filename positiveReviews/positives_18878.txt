My dog, Lucy, suffers from a host of allergies.  Of the higher quality dog foods on the market, Ziwi Peak is the only one without carrots or barley (two foods she cannot have).  Lucy loves this food and her allergies are much better  there are no grains, fillers, colors, preservatives or vegetables (I can give her those separately from home).  Without Ziwi peak I would be making stuff at home.  This is convenient and well worth the price  I only wish I could find a local retailer so I wouldn't have to order online...
