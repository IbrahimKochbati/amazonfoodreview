I haven't had this since I was a kid and I 'm a little surprised I still like it. These days I eat mostly steel cut oats.     The texture wasn't bad for instant oatmeal and it wasn't too sweet. This won't replace my usual oatmeal but I 'll keep this on hand for when there's only time for instant. (I made it with just water and a splash of almond milk on top)
