the packs are definitely not that easy to use, big and bulky, they could have cut it down A LOT and been just fine.          the popcorn is GOOD, good quality. most of the kernels pop and are very tasty.  the oil is ok, not quite theater quality, but not bad, the salt, however, is a different story all together.  i does not taste good, NOT good at all.  if you use the whole portion it is FAR too salty, and definitely does not taste like theater popcorn, in fact the first batch i made i was so disappointed i thought i should have just kept buying microwaveable.          however I've been playing and experimenting, as i don't ant to waste a whole $25.  i definitely like using all of the kernals and oil, and about 3 4th of the salt, it seems pretty good this way.          i will buy a different  and next time, or just buy a whole box of salt directly from the theater and substitute that salt for this, however it is convenient and not too bad after you figure out the perfect recipe for you and your family.
