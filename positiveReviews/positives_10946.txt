These are great crackers, probably the closest you will find to wheat based crackers.  The crackers are really a 5, but I take one star off for shipping damage.  This is not necessarily Amazon's fault, as I doubt even if you lived down the street from the wherehouse they would arrive without damage.  My recent shippment arrived with moderate  eakage, but the shipping box was clean (no damage), though the original container showed a little damage.  I would not order anything heavy to be included in an order with these crackers.
