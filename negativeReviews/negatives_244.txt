This is not jerky, this is processed, hard like a rock, very greasy and stale smelling stripe of something that you can't  eak into anything smaller than 2 inches long and that certainly is not the size of a training treat! The dogs  who will eat anything  were not impressed, it was hard to chew, and it sounded like they were crunching rocks, where is a zero star button?
