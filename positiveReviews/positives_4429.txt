Vanilla beans have many uses: you can make vanilla sugar, creme  ulee, and many other desserts. You can also make vanilla extract. And if you buy these beans, you can do it all at a fraction of the supermarket price.          Yesterday I priced two vanilla beans in a spice bottle at the supermarket. They cost almost $6. This half pound package of beans that comes in a vacuum pack contains at least 50 beans and cost only $25. I am not quite sure what I will do with all of these, but we did make some bottles of vanilla extract for our favorite cooks for Xmas, and I have vanilla sugar in my cupboard now. The fragrance of these beans is marvelous, but I have resealed the package so the beans won't dry out. I may even put a few beans on the counter to make it smell like I have been cooking!          A recipe:          1 cheap fifth of vodka     10 12 beans, sliced the long way.          Remove a cook's share from the vodka bottle and replace with the beans. close the bottle. Let sit for at least a month in a cool dark cupboard.          Decant some of the vanilla into a smaller bottle when you need a refill. Put another sliced bean in there, and top off the large bottle with more vodka. Use the smaller bottle for your cooking. Make lots of cookies!          You can keep this up for about a year.
