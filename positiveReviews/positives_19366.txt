I received a complimentary bag of Bil Jac dog food through BzzAgent.com .  Before I could even get the food poured into my puppy's dish, she was already  pawing at the bag trying to get at the food.  She went nuts for it and immediately refused to eat her old food.  This food requires no transition time, so I immediately switched her to Bil Jac and she has had no digestive problems at all.  I have had to start measuring out her food because she'd eat way more than she needs if I let her.  She is only 4lbs at 8 months old, and the small  eed puppy food is very easy for her to chew.  This is definitely the best dog food we've tried and the one we'll stick with.
