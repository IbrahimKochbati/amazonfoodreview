The pieces of grits are much larger than average sized grits, but the flavor is better, as these are true yellow corn grits, and not bleached out hominy grits. I have since trying this  and purchased some regular sized non bleached organic yellow corn grits and like them much better. Also, this  and is quite expensive, even considering that you get the reuseable baggy, when compared to the price of the finer ground organic grits I purchased elsewhere, which only cost $1.79 lb. as opposed to the price of these grits and getting less than a pound.
