The sugar bees came exactly as described and well packaged so NONE were  oken when the arrived!  These were great for my son's 2nd birthday cake. He is crazy about Bee Movie and I couldn't  ing myself to spend a load on a bday cake from the grocery store, so I bought these to help decorate the cake. Shipping was on the early end of the estimated delivery window. Very pleased with this item and will consider purchasing a similar item for the next birthday cake!
