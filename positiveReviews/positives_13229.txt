A close friend who loves great food and seasonings introduced us to this seasoning, and we fell in love with it.  It takes fruit to a new level for your taste buds, and almost everything tastes better with the lime, chile pepper flavor.  It's not too spicy for those who are not chile heads    but gives food a 'pop' and 'zing' we like.     We had a casual evening with other friends and  ought along our personal bottle for a dish we planned to share.  They flipped over Tajine too and immediately began trying to find it in their home state, Colorado!  After hearing that they had been unsuccessful, we shipped a small case to them as a surprise gift    and it was a hit.  It keeps well in the pantry and is a delightful lift when slicing an apple for an afternoon snack.  Can you tell we like it?
