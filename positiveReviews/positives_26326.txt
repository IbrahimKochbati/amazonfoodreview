My husband always had sinus problems, but ever since he started drinking this sinus buster tea then it really helped and now he hardly has sinus problem anymore.  Highly recommended, drink it after dinner time will be the best suggestion.  Once or twice a day should be fine, put some honey and lemon to make better flavor.
