According to the research I've done and my vet's recommendation Eukanuba is the right  and for my Dachshund.  I tried Orijen for a few months when he was about 2 years old but my dog's weight skyrocketed from 16 to 22lbs.  My vet thought the Orijen was the cause and recommended I switch back to Eukanuba.  After I put him back on this Dachshund formula he dropped the weight and is back to a healthy 16 lb.  He's now 4.5 years old and doing great.          If I thought there was a better  and of food for him I would be open to trying it, but I feel good about giving him this Eukanuba Dachshund Formula.  I also can't find this locally so I am happy to buy it on amazon.
