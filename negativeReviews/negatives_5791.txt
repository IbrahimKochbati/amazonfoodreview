I've drunk a lot of coffee in the last fifty years and this is the absolute worst ever! Nothing I've had ever had comes close to how awful this stuff is. This has no taste and is very bitter, actually it does tastes worse than some mud I've eaten as a young child. What a waste of money,as I am not allowed to return the unopened bags, all three will go into the trash! When I say I'm pretty disappointed in this purchase I'm being kind.     Don't buy this or you will be 'bitterly' disappointed!
