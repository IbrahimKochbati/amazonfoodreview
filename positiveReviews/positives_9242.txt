Most, if not all coffee drinkers would agree that decaf coffee just doesn't taste as good as caffeinated. Great caffeinated beans (whatever "great" means to the drinker) are pretty easy to find. But when it comes to decaf, pickin's get VERY slim.          Kicking Horse is the best decaf for me. It's an even, very dark (consider it a french) roast and it's oily! (The whole "oily vs. not oily" is a never ending debate.) Suffice to say, I prefer dark, oily beans and it's impossible to find oily decaf from a mass production roaster.          Admittedly, I have not performed a side by side comparison with caffeinated, but straight shots are remarkable. Few people would recognize that they were drinking decaf if they were served this coffee. (espresso or press, i can't speak to the taste of this coffee after drip)          To qualify any opinion, it's important to understand the perspective of the reviewer. I don't evaluate coffee for qualities like "florals" or "dark chocolate" or "berries". I like rich espresso flavor, but without so much caffeine. So I cut my coffee with a dark decaf in order to get the richness that I want, and then smooth it with a little milk cream   no sweetener, no flavorings.          As an added bonus, I really appreciate the 15% discount for the monthly automated Amazon subscription.
