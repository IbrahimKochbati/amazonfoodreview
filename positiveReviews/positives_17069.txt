I bought this to keep my pug mix occupied while I was out of the house. It is very durable hard plastic. I put half of her daily dog food in there when I leave and it keeps her busy for a long time! I was worried she would shake it and  eak something but she doesn't shake it at all. This toy is a great idea.
