As it turns out Basil is extremely healthy and is listed on the World's Healthiest Foods list (google it)     I haven't tried this as plain pesto but I have added it to     Marinara sauce, beef and barley soup, and chicken barley soup, black bean and tempeh burrito fillings, and probably more things as I just grab stuff as I cook.          I also have the tomato paste in a tube and it is good too, so much better than those silly cans where you have to decide of you want to refrigerate the leftovers or use the whole can when the recipe only calls for 2 tbs.
