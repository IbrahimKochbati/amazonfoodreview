I love this Chai tea and it is so much less expensive than getting some at a coffee shop. Other  ands just do not have the flavor I (or my Chai Loving Daughter) care for. This has a mild mixture of all the spices normally found in chai with none overwealming the others. Mixing in milk and sugar or sweetener makes the Chai Tea Latte a warm comforting drink for morning, mid day or evening (if a bit of caffiene does not bother you)
