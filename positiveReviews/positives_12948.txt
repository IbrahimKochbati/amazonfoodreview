This switch kiwi berry tasts like the Red Bull energy drink...bit of sour and sweet but not too much sparkling gas. The overall taste is not bad (I like it), but I could not taste the kiwi or berry. If you are looking for kiwi or berry taste, you will be disappointed.          The label says no suger added, but the ingredient table shows 33g sugar? I guess the sugar all comes from the 100% juice itself. So much suger level is such a small can. That's kind of high...          Overall, I like the taste and I think it's an enjoyable drink. But I won't recommend it due to the high suger level.
