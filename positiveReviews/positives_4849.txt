Tea's are very personal and everyone has their favorites. I really enjoy this tea when relaxing, or before bed. The subtle mint flavor seems to comfort and sooth. A little sugar (I'm not a fan of honey) really makes all the flavors POP! Being a fan of this tea it was a no  ainer to order it in bulk, the price at the time was great, cheaper then the grocery store (by far). The packaging was efficient and made it really easy to store.
