I feed my dogs Sojos as part of a mixed bowl of quality kibble and quality canned food.  I recommend Sojos.          But I had a problem with the Amazon purchase.  Amazon stored the Sojos bag in the original mailing box Sojos sent them.  My order was picked from the shelf and the box containing the Sojos was placed in another box and mailed to me.  The bag of Sojos was almost one year old and there was no way Amazon kept track of that.  I got a refund from Amazon with no question and very quickly, but Amazon needs to keep control of the "use by" dates of food they offer on their site.
