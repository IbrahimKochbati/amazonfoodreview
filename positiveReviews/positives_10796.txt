Some people want to criticize organic products due to their often higher than average cost. I'm not sure I agree with that thinking. Organic ingredients ARE more expensive, and their added cost ensures that you (and your pets) are eating food that meets strict production standards.          Is it worth it? Well, consider the source of the ingredients in most pet food. I shudder to think about the junk that makes its way into "food" that you feed to your beloved animals. That's why I'm more than willing to seek out  and pay more  for quality in the form of products like Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats. What you get for your money is the peace of mind that comes from knowing that your dog will be eating human grade ingredients, including certified organic barley flour, ground chicken, carrots, apples, rolled oats, etc.          My beagle loves these treats, and I love giving her food that keeps her healthy.
