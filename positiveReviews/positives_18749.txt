Fun to make and the whole thing just tastes great!  It's probably as good if not better than a lot of the Chinese restaurants nearby.  The rice is light and provides a good base for the sauce and chicken.  The sauce is not too sweet, nor too sour and has chicken and veggies already mixed in.          The only con would be the excessive amount of packaging, but I don't know how else they could make a kit that allows for cooking two separate components.
