We have been experimenting with different  ands of K Cups since we purchased our Keurig last Christmas.  While this one was okay, it just is not as good Green Mountain's Breakfast Blend for an everyday staple.  We haven't tried Green Mountain Columbian yet as a closer comparison.  However, when we make a larger cup of coffee with this one, the  ew is noticibly weaker than with GM Breakfast Blend.          Also, please note that we LOVE Timothy's World Italian Blend!!  It is definitely amount our favorites.
