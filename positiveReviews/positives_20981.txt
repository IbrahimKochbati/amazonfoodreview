I have fund this dog food to be a extremely good bang for my buck. It packs as much if not more extra Nutrients Like salmon oil Even better yet this does not contain Corn which is common dog food filler that is not particularly healthy for dogs since I was used to paying little less then 50 cents more then a dollar a pound was kinda hard to sallow but for me have a Jack Russel terrier its not so bad its a small kibble packed with the right stuff I have not found any better bang for my buck
