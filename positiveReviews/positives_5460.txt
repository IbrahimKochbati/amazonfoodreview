Okay, I'm eating these nuts as I write this review...          And as another review noted, these are pretty addictive... However, I caution you in advance... after a few hand fulls of these, you will be running around your house trying to find something to drink to put that fire out in your mouth.  If you like some heat and are a peanut fan... you will not be disappointed.          Would write more... but... I... need... a... drink!!!  FIRE IN MY MOUTH.          HOLY HOT NUTS!!!
