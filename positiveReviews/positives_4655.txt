So let's be honest. I have severe anxiety and depression issues which has gone on my whole life. I have been prescribed dozens of different meds to help with it but nothing has. Also, I don't have insurance so I literally put out hundreds a month to try new drugs that didn't help. More importantly, the side effects were sometimes as bad or worse than my symptoms. I have also tried other natural cures that didn't help.          Several of my friends suggested I smoke hemp as a natural cure. I'm not against it but I'm not a smoker and I've had professional jobs where I could be tested, anyway. So I thought, let's check Amazon and see what natural hemp products are available.          First I tried hemp powder, which I also reviewed if you're interested, and it tasted like sand. It will take me all year to be able to finish the 3 lb bag and that's if I ever do. Then I tried this.          I'm very honest in my reviews so I wouldn't recommend this if it didn't truly help. It's not a placebo effect thing, either. I have tried too many meds for that to even be a possibility, trust me.          The one thing I can tell you for certain is within the first week it greatly and noticeably increased my energy levels. I have done more around the house in the past few months than I've done in the past few years. I have gone through 2 subscriptions of this and the energy hasn't gone away. I am a big and tall person so I take 4 in the morning and 4 at night, usually.          Anyone who has depression anxiety issues knows that sometimes you barely feel like getting out of bed most days. You get a heavy feeling like there's lead in your veins. If you've been through it then you understand what I'm talking about.          I can say with 100% honesty that it has given me way more energy and it has helped with that heavy feeling. Can I guarantee it will work? No. My aunt and mom tried a couple just one time and they didn't notice any difference. But it has sure worked for me taking it daily. What I can tell you is that you should at least try it. If it doesn't help, just don't buy it again. But it is sure worth a try because it might help you as much as it has me. I will take this supplement for the rest of my life, as far as I'm concerned. That's how much it has helped.          I hope it works for you, too.
