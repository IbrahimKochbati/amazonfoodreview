At around a buck a can, very expensive for 8.3 ounces of carbonated apple juice (with lesser amounts of grape juice, aceola whatever that is, raspberry juice, and finally actual strawberry and kiwi juice, plus some vitamin C added).          With the 100% juice banner all over that can, you might be led to believe it's 100% strawberry kiwi juice . . . it's not. Taste is not unlike a typical Strawberry soda pop, but not quite as good.  Expected sugar content (natural). 135 calories. I'm not likely to make future purchases of this one.
