I really like oatmeal but I must clarify that I like non instant oatmeal.  Compared to other instant oatmeal, Quaker Instant Oatmeal Maple Brown Sugar, tastes pretty much the same. The flavor is nice and doesn't taste artificial but the consistency of the oatmeal itself is pasty.  This is, however, what I'd expect from  instant oatmeal so it's not surprising.  If you generally like instant oatmeal, this one is just fine.          I gave this product 3 stars because it's not bad...but not great, either.
