I have been using this for literally decades, having found it first in the military commissaries I shopped in. I can't imagine making whipped cream without it. Leftover whipped cream is usable for a couple days if you put Whipit in the partially whipped cream. I have filled sponge cakes with flavored whipped cream (like a jelly roll style dessert), topped chocolate pots de creme for a party and had still attractive edible leftovers (yay!), and at the holidays I can whip all the cream for pies at once instead of again the next day for the leftover pie. NOTE: It does give the whipped cream a bit denser consistency, but I actually like that. Partially whip 1 c. heavy cream + 1 2 tsp to 1 tsp vanilla extract. When volume starts to increase, sprinkle 1 4 c. to 1 3 c. powdered sugar and a packet of Whipit over it. Continue whipping JUST until max volume. If you notice volume decreasing, stop immediately!
