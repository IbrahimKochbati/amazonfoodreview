I purchased the Branston Original Pickle for my mother as she does not eat dill pickles and being from England she remembers the great taste.  This is the first itme I have ordered Branston but will use this seller again when my mother runs low.     This Jar was well wrapped in bubble wrap before being shipped to me in a strong box that arrived without any damage.  I received my box well before the expected date.  This shipper is excellent.
