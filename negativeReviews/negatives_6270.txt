We used this cereal when my daughter was a baby 2 years ago and it was great. I ordered a case recently for my 8 month old son and it was spoiled! Amazon was great and refunded my money, but I am so disappointed with HAPPYBELLIES. There are obviously some major quality control issues that need to be addressed. I will be ordering baby cereal from a different company as I just can't  ing myself to trust HAPPYBELLIES anymore.
