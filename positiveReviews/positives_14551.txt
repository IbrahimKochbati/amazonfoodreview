If you like the flavors of a good British Tea,  this is a fairly good substitute.  The Earl Grey and Lady Grey are very good.  You have to put milk and sugar in them to make them really delicious!  I like the Irish Breakfast   very full bodied.  The English  eakfast is good but not my favorite when it comes to the Breakfast teas.  I like Republic of Tea's British Breakfast the best.  This is a great sampler package.
