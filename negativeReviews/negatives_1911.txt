This tea was not what I expected.  I love cinnamon tea and was very disappointed with this product.  The tea does not have a strong cinnamon flavor which I enjoy.  This tea has a stronger Rooibos flavor than cinnamon flavor.  Furthermore, I found that the product description does not give a full list of the tea's ingredients.          The ingredients listed on the box include:  Cinnamon, Licorice Root, Orange Peel, Indian Sarsaparilla, Chicory Root, Rooibos, Natural Flavors, Star Anise, Almond Extract and Locorice Extract
