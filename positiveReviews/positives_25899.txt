I love this peanut butter.  I am someone who has to eat peanut butter everyday.  Eating regular peanut butter in this manner will make me fatter than I want to be so this is a great substitute.  It has the taste of reese's peanut butter cups.  If you want it sweeter add a natural sugar substitute.  If you want a peanut butter drink just make it extra watery or mix it with milk.  I could live on this stuff.  I only wish it came in a better container as the bag makes it hard to not get it everywhere.  I will be dumping it into a glass jar soon as I ordered 4 bags.  It makes it easier to scoop from a hard container.  I have tried the non chocolate version of this but will only eat it when I run out of the chocolate as I have a major sweet tooth.
