The product information doesn't tell you that the tea includes processed sweetener (stevia), butterscotch flavoring, and some other processed ingredients.          This is not the original recipe for Yogi Tea, though it implies that it is. Even on the Yogi Tea website, it doesn't mention the added artificial ingredients (I know that stevia is from a plant, but it's hightly processed for use as a sweetener).          I love the old original yogi tea, but I would never buy this.
