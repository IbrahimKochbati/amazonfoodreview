Even with the chocolate chunks, these bars taste far less sweeter than most granola bars out there and I really appreciated that.          They have 110 calories each and 8 grams sugar which is less than Kudos Chocolate Chip (120 cal, 12 sugar) or a Cascadian Farms Chocolate Chip granola bar (140 cal, 10 sugar).  When I need a quick snack, I can eat one with a glass of sparkling water and I feel full until the next meal.  If I need a quick meal I eat one of these with two string cheeses, a large apple and water    I can make it until dinner.          I would recommend these to anyone looking for a tasty and quick snack.
