This is a horrible step by POP to change the formula.  They now use cheap 'maltose' (barley malt sugar   HIGH glycemic 105) in place of most of the honey, and only a miniscule amount of the herbs which were so effective in the original formula.  HUGE disappointment, and shame on POP for corporatizing and cheapening their once outstanding products.          As with the other reviewer, I once recommended this to everyone.  Now I will go out of my way to steer clear of recommending anything by Prince of Peace.  Try Source Naturals Wellness homeopathic cough formulas   they're much cleaner and work pretty well.
