I was finding that every time I got a Frappuccino from Fivebucks..err..Starbucks, I was spending about, well, five bucks.  I thought I'd give these "Caffe D'Vita" powders a try.  So far, I've only tried the Java Chip mix, and found it to be "OK".  I think that even including milk and ice, I'm still probably spending only about 75 cents a cup, so it's a great deal.          If, like me, you find the Caffe D'Vita flavors to be not quite up to snuff, you might try making your own Frappuccinos.  I found a recipe online.  The secret ingredient can be found right here on Amazon: xanthan Gum!     "
