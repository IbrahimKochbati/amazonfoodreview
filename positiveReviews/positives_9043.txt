Like a lot of people, I have very limited kitchen space, and my Keurig  ewer itself takes up an entire countertop. I was never able to fit one of the traditional revolving K cup stands in my kitchen, so I generally leave my K cup boxes on top of the refrigerator. Not very tidy and a little inconvenient, but the best I could do. I was thrilled to find this holder at the store (where it cost about $25   beware some of these Amazon seller prices!) and bought it immediately. It's perfect! It holds 36 K cups at a time, so I can stock it and put the K cups away in the closet for a few weeks until I start running low. It also complements my black and silver  ewer nicely. It's very stable and has a no slip top so you don't have to worry about your Keurig tipping over. It does add about 4 inches of height, so make sure you have enough clearance if your  ewer is under a cupboard. Highly recommended.
