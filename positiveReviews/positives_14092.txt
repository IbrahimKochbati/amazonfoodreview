I didn't exactly know what to expect when I ordered an affordable bag of bulk, whole leaf, organic tea. Each of these qualities seemed to clash with the "1 pound for 16 dollars" quality.     I'm pleasantly surprised.     Pros:     Tastes great with a lot of forgiveness in  ew time (you almost have to try to make bad batch).     Nice, resealable packaging.     Back to the flavor, it's malty with a astringency and sweet (sort of how sugar tastes, with out the sugariness) quality very reminiscent of a darjeeling.     Holds up well to milk and or honey.          Cons:     Seems a little weak, doesn't handle multiple infusions very well.          Recommendations: order away, expect a pretty solid, consistent, enjoyable tea.
