I was looking for a durable toy that would hold the interest of my 5 month old Border Aussie puppy and the Tug a Jug has been a great find. He was a little hesitant of it at first but once he figured out that the toy dispensed food, he is having a great time figuring out different ways of getting his kibble to come out. It is also a very durable toy, which is what I was looking for. He is an aggressive chewer and has chewed through a lot of his other toys   even though he has tried to chew on the jug, he has not been able to inflict any damage to it so far (we've had it for about 3 weeks now). The Tug a Jug is made of very durable plastic. The bottom opens so you can fill the jug with kibble or treats and I was happy to find that it has extra threading so it screws on very firmly and stays on even with my dogs wild play with the jug.
