My kids used to LOVE Quaker Instant Oatmeal. It was a quick way to get them a hot  eakfast on a busy morning and still get them to school on time. They started refusing to eat it, and would leave their bowls mostly full and uneaten. They said it tasted "funny". I tried a bite, and sure enough. I thought it had spoiled, so threw out the whole box, and bought a "fresh" box next time I was at the store. Nope, the flavor was terrible in the new box as well. Bad, bad move, Quaker. Go back to the old flavor formulas before you lose this line of business altogether.
