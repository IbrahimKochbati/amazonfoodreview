This popcorn actually tastes like the theater popcorn. All the kernals pop up and it makes ALOT of popcorn. You don't need to add anything extra to it after it's popped to make it flavorful because it is so good on it's own. Just be aware that the oil pack is hard. It's almost like stick butter but it quickly melts in the popper. I just mention that because at first, I thought there was something wrong with it. Makes watching movies at home very enjoyable! You can store the popcorn if you can't eat it all and it even tastes good a little stale. Very pleased with this purchase!
