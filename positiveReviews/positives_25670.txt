My wife just loves these little things as this is what she carries everywhere. A purse is perfect for tucking this dispenser away and purchasing them in quantity means you won't have to rely on a Super Market (as I do) which does not carry this product any longer. In fact, we have not been able to find this product in any stores in this area of Indiana.  My advice is this: If you like your Equal and want to be sure you have it wherever you go, then purchase this item.  You can't beat it with a stick.
