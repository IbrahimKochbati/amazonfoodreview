My dog loved these! Normally Reily, my 106 lb. male Golden Retriever, just inhales the occasional treat we give him. He's a big, tall, muscular dog who acts like his stomach is a black hole, so things are barely even chewed before they disappear down his gullet. He actually took the time to chew these and even appeared to be savoring the taste of them!          They were a nice size, not tiny but not too big to be a mouthful. The texture of the treats was nice and fresh, the ingredients so nice sounding that, heck, I'd eat them!          Reily is almost 10 now and has entered that senior mentality of laziness where unless you use the serious tone of voice when issuing commands he ignores you. Except for these biscuits! He was all too eager to please for a reward of Newman's Own! My only suggestion...make bigger bags.
