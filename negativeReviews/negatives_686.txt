Although this seems like a great product it is definitely not minced.  The cans say it is minced but it isn't, it is ground beef.  My cat ONLY likes minced.  Not chunks, not ground.  Although she will eat ground cat food sometimes, it has to be inviting and delicious, yet she just walks away from this.          I hate it when the packaging lies about the contents of a product.  The shipping was speedy and the value is great (as long as they deliver what the promise) now I am stuck with food my cat wont eat at all.
