The toy is so so. I enjoy the buster cube and atomic treat dispenser much better. The hard plastic jar against the tile floors is VERY distracting.          The tug a jug kept my dog entertained just as long as the other 2 dispensers. After a while, he just gave up and would lie down next to it.          The noise this thing made was just unbearable.
