We were a little leary when we first read the type of coffee this was but decided to try it anyway.  So glad we did!  It is wonderful anytime of day or night.  We do not like strong coffee taste or after taste and this one fits the bill for us.  Enjoy it while you can.  We have been back many times and reordered in fear we will not be able to get it again.  Thanks Amazon.
