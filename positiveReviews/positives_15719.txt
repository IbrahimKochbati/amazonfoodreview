My cat is a picky eater and I'm a picky owner in that I don't want to feed him by products, preservatives or other questionable ingredients.  When I found this cat food, he loved it and I loved the simple ingredients.  If I ate meat, I'd have a hard time telling the difference between this and actual human food if both were set before me for dining pleasures.  The food doesn't have that nasty characteristic cat food smell.  I don't know if I can attribute it to this food, but my cat's  eath doesn't stink (I've had several cats in my life, and smelly  eath was generally a constant).  My only complaint about this food is that all of my local grocers and pet stores don't stock it.  I wish it was more readily available in my town.  Also, I wish the ingredients were sourced in the good ole US of A.  Aside from these points, it's a fantastic cat food and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality food for their special buddy.
