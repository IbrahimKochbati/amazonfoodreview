I had to switch my dog's food after the price on their previous food doubled. After doing some research and talking to our vet I bought this  and. One of our dogs has wire hair, so I was suprised after awhile when I noticed his coat was getting shiney and he feels soo soft. The other dog we have is part poodle and she even softer. Which she likes because she likes to be hugged and cuddled. We have had alot of people comment on their nice soft and shiney coats.
