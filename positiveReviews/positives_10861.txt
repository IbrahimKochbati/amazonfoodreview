Let's be real. My dog is happy for any attention and will eat just about anything. The worse it smells to me, the better the dog likes it. My dog's absolute favorite treat is a horrible herring flavored dog biscuit from the specialty pet store  to me it smells like rotten fish but just opening the package will cause the dog to run into the room.          My poor pooch suffers from food allergies so I have to be careful what he eats. This dog biscuit is everything I look for: no corn, no chemicals, no mysterious "by products". To date, my dog has had no reaction to these biscuits. This is a big deal because the wrong food can give him running sores under his long coat and make him itchy and miserable. NEWMAN'S LAMB AND BARLEY biscuit has an attractive (to me) smell that is reminiscent of  molasses, which is one of the ingredients. Each biscuit has a groove down the middle making it easy to  eak, so one has a choice to feed the whole biscuit (suitable for a big dog) or only half (for a smaller dog).          The dog doesn't go wild for these things, but he does like them. Based on his body language when these are offered, they rate at least a seven. I love these things and would rate them as five stars because they are healthy and safe for my special needs pet. The four star rating comes from my dog. We agree on that much!
