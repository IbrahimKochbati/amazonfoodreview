OK truth is, I do believe these help somewhat because I will be needing to go to the bathroom more and I WILL be sweating a lot more during my work outs.  But one flaw that it looks like some disagree with me on.  The taste is bloody awful!          Let me say I am addicted to soda.... REALLY REALLY REALLY addicted to soda, so when these first came out a few years ago in cola, ginger ale and Lemon lime i was quick to give these a try... The taste gave me nightmares, yes the taste actually gave me nightmares.  So after i finished the case i bought I was thinking i'd never drink them again.  But as of last year I got really serious with  my diet and remembered that these did indeed get me to sweat alot more, so i went ahead and ordered a 24 pack of these orange flavored ones.  Personally I think if you can stomach cola then your better off buying the cola flavor.  I hate cola flavor so I think this and Green Tea peach Mango are the better ones.  They all taste awful to me and they give me a reason to keep going with my diet so i never have to consider drinking these again.          So yeah they help, but the worst tasting drink ever in my opinion.
