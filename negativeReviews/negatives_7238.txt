Nutricity is the very worst ever place to order. I ordered almond butter thinking it came in a glass bottle and when I received it it was packages in plastic. I returned them and they send me an email saying they did not receive returns. When I tried to get in touch with them with their 800 number a recording said they only handle returns via email. I will never ever order from them. I highly recommend that nobody ever orders from them. When I ordered I never read that you couldn't return an item. And then to top it off I could not talk to anyone in their company they handle all via email. VERY DISSAPOINTING! DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THEM.
