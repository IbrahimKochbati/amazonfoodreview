I think this is one of the best protein shakes on the market. All natural with 15 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber, Mix 1 is light tasting and almost 'refreshing'. Great for pre or post work outs or just inbetween meals for a protein boost. Great for vegetarians and those who are soy lacrtose intolerant. I love the vanilla one and I am a chocolate person.
