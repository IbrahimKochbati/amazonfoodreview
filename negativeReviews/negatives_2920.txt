I have bought many  ands on peanuts on Amazon. I was a tad disappointed in this  and. The Peanut Shop Of Williamsburg. The over all flavor was ok. Not a strong flavor but not weak. I found the salting to be a little on the light side. That's fine with me, I use most of my nuts in kung pow type dishes, and the lower salt is fine. The crispness was very poor for a hand cooked kettle peanut. It really should have more crunch snap.  Over all this is a step up from Planters cocktail peanuts. But you can do much better with other  ands.
