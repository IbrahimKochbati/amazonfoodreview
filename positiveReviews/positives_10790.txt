Tried these on our two Schnauzers    they were impressed!  These are rather large biscuits that are made to  eak in half which makes them a perfect size for a snack or reward.  They have a good crunch which I think is good for dental health.  Anyway, I have a box of Alpo Variety Snacks and a box of Milk Bone Flavor Snacks to which I compared ingredients.  They both have artificial color, Alpo lists animal digest, whatever that is, while Milk Bone won the contest with all of those ingredients that no one can pronounce.  I would list what makes up all three but think it would not be too interesting and you probably have at least one of the listed  ands if you give your pet treats.     What sets the Newman's Own apart is the simple list of Organic ingredients including lamb, carrots, apples, molasses, barley and tocopherols for Vitamin E.  It is made in New Zealand where they raise a lot of lamb, so this seems just the perfect place. The bottom line is our dogs think Pa and Nell Newman have a great product and would highly recommend it to their four legged friends.  Life could not be better than living with happy dogs.  So, on their input I must give this product a five star rating.
