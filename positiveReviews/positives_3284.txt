I bought this product uncertain that it would be worth the money, and quickly came to love it. I made gf Biscuits and gravy for my family and we didn't mention that it was all gluten free. Everyone loved the biscuits. They didn't fall apart at all like a lot of other  ands do. I used butter flavored shortening and I think it made the biscuits even more delicious. If you haven't tried it yet, try it now. I now buy a box a week. Amazon has a much better price than I can find in most stores in Vegas.
