This maple syrup is delicious and so flavorful    Did you know grade B maple syrup has so many vitamins and minerals you could almost not feel guilty about having french toast for  eakfast. I also try and use maple syrup where I can for sweetener instead of sugar. The company was wonderful about the shipping and the product arrived packaged well and on time! Enjoy.
