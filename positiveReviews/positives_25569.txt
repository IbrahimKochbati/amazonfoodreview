I have been drinking this tea for over a month now and I have to say this tea is terrific!  I highly recommend this tea  and to anyone who wants a great quality tea at a great price.  Also, if you want to lower your blood pressure, hibiscus tea will lower you systolic pressure by about 10 15 pts after drinking it for a month.  It's worked for me.  I hope this review helps.
