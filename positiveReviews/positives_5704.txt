"The Crunchy Popcorn Snack with Soybeans" that Grandpa Po has created makes us want to meet the ol' man and give him a pat on the back! While we are questioning the slogan on the package "Better Than Food"   there is, however, no questioning this recipe for a great tasting, healthy snack. The mix of organic popcorn and organic soybeans makes a great alternative snack food and we love the re sealable pouch. With just the right proportion of soybeans to popcorn this product comes from a company that cele ates food. Hooray!
