I got this as a gift and liked the flavor but I wasn't crazy about the texture.  I like fluffy pancakes and believe it or not, imo, Aunt Jemima's buttermilk ready mix is the best one out there and it's so easy to make.     Of course, the best tasting waffles are made by me from scratch with buttermilk and all. )     Overall, I think buying gourmet pancake mix is one of the biggest waste of money.  And it still requires you to put melted butter, milk, etc.     I am sticking with my own recipes and Aunt Jemima's if I am in a hurry.
