My son and I are on a gluten free diet so I've been experimenting with many different products, to see what we both like.  I've had to up the frequency of our subscription because everyone in our home likes these crackers!  They taste like 'normal' water crackers.  Crisp and light, they work great with cheese, tuna, or anything else you'd put on a cracker!
