My son made this.  He didn't have the patience to be precise about the water temperature and when, half an hour before it was done, it appeared not to have risen at all  I feared for the worse.  Determined to be polite, I agreed to have a sandwich using the  ead.  It was amazing.  Apparently it rises during the baking or something.          Great tangy flavor (perfect for a meat sandwich imho) and not heavy at all.  Fortunately we had lots of deli meats, since the whole loaf disappeared within the hour.          We've had all but the sourdough peasant  ead so far; I'm sure that will be delicious as well.
