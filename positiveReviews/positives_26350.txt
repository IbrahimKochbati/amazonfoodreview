My older recently adopted greyhound was diagonosed with stage 4 peridontal disease and had several teeth removed.  As part of her dental care I purchased C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews.  They help with the tarter control, she likes chewing them and her  eath smells nice. I bought the large dog size and ended up cutting them in half only because Mattie had difficulty chewing them due to lack of pre molars, (tip cut the large size in half rather than buying a smaller size, now I have 60 chews.  I had to use tin snips). The product arrived as stated and in excellent condition.  Really good price compared to stores or vet offices.  I will be buying more chews.  A happy repeat customer.
