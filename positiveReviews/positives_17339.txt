My salmon loving Persian thinks this is her second favorite so I've bought enough of this stuff to own the company! She goes made for it and always cleans the bowl whenever it is served. Great stuff, but if you're looking for a higher protein content like I'm usually doing for this little girl, then go with the Fancy Feast version of this. It's almost double the protein and if you're working on a rescue cat, then that will make all the difference in the recovery process. I've sat on the floor for many hours hand feeding wet cat food to this cat to encourage her to eat and this one, is her second favorite! But, check the price locally. I can get this down to about thirty three cents a can when it's on sale and with a coupon. Pretty high here. Highly recommend!
