This packet made 3 pots. I'm not a big coffee drinker because of the bitter after taste and it upsets my stomach terribly. I still tried this. I was surprised, it had a very mild yet strong enough flavor and while I drank it, it did not taste bitter at all & not after either. I also did NOT get an upset stomach. I only added a little splenda to it, no cream or flavors. If I were to drink more coffee it would be this one. I had my neighbors husband drink some & he drinks a pot a day. He loved it. He drinks it black & even though the coffee he usually drinks gives him heartburn he said this did not & plans on buying it.
