I just got a pack of the key lime pie gum, and it is some of the best gum I've had. It really tastes like key lime pie, almost eerily so, and is flavorful but not too strong. The idea of dessert flavored gum sounds a little like Willy Wonka, but it tastes really good, and I am looking forward to trying the other flavors.
