I am a huge fan of Pop Chips. They had them at my grocery store, but their supply was dwindling, so I was afraid they weren't planning to order more. I purchased two cases (48 individual bags) of Pop Chips. They are all excellent. Purchasing them in the Variety Pack gave me access to flavors they didn't have at the grocery store (salt and vinegar, cheddar, salt and pepper). I've enjoyed all the flavors! (Barbecue is still my favorite, though.) I also got a better deal buying them online.
