I don't know if it was the case of chips we received or what, but everyone we allowed to sample the chips (in a buffet style setting) agreed that these were slightly on the salty side.     One person jokingly stated that these would be terrific for melting ice and snow, due to the amount of salt in these.          We had ordered these with the expectations that these would be similar to the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips, but these Kettle  ands outback bbq chips are the exact opposite.          Sorry folks, we just had better expectations from these chips but they a little on the on the salty side.          We are still looking forward to Amazon finally getting the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips in stock.     These got a 2 star, because the bbq powder they had used on these were flavorful enough to be unique.
