I love this gum   it's soft, doesn't stick to my teeth, and keeps its flavor longer than any other gum I've tried. Even my teenage son who is in  aces (and isn't supposed to chew gum) can chew this gum with no issues whatsoever. Compared to other "bubble gum" flavored gum, I think this one tastes the best. Even when it eventually loses most of its flavor, it doesn't have an unpleasant taste or feel   and no aftertaste. I was happy to see it for less than $1 pack with the Subscribe & Save option. I hope they never stop making it available!
