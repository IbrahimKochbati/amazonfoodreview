I make my own  ead, we also have a weekly pizza night, and I do a lot of baking besides. I am seriously surprised at how much a difference this flour makes. Everything is just better. The flour is very fine, lite, soft, and powdery. I don't consider the cost to be too high compared to the average price I would pay for the "Gold" stuff I usually buy on sale at the grocery store. I don't see any other unbleached all purpose flour that is that much difference of a price, at least not here on Amazon. With subscribe & save, i consider thise a good deal. I just wish it were in larger bags, and came in 20lbs. I have to double my order since we go through so much in a month.
