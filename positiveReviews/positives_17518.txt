Okay. I'm a very accomplished home cook of some sophistication, but I'd never used duck fat. I wondered about the small size units, but I find that cooking for usually uses one or half of one unit, and the other half can be used plenty soon enough that it's not wasted. The taste is distinct and quite good. My first use was with some  aised pork. I had made enough for two nights, and the product arrived for the second night. I sauteed the pork and carrots in half a unit of duck fat to reheat. The rich flavor much improved a dish that is anyway always better the second night. Half a unit was plenty. The richness was a very good addition to the pork and carrots that had been  aised without wine and therefore somewhat plain. I see this as being something I keep in the pantry.
