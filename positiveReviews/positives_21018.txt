At 300 some odd calories, Gatorade's new 'Nutrition Shake' works great as a meal replacement.  It also packs a nice 20g of protein per shake, which is nice if you need an easy way to get some protein.  The vanilla flavor shake tatses quite good.  Think of it as a more palatable Slimfast.  The drink is very tasty with none of that weird protein shake aftertaste.          I think drinking these all the time could get a bit pricey, but I would definitely recommend them for people on a weight lifting workout regimen who are looking for an easy way to get some protein and as a meal replacement.
