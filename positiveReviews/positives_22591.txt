I got this to pop in my Whirly Pop stovetop popper, and it works great. This is comparable to the packages sold by the Whirly Pop manufacturer, but much less expensive. A great buy for popcorn lovers. My only complaint is that the packaging is a little awkward in that you pretty much need to cut the popcorn, salt, and oil open and pour them into the popper separately to avoid spilling them all over the place   but this style packaging seems to be very common from  and to  and.
