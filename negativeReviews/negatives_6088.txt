I bought a full array of Stubb's products on sale locally, and gave them a try?           Per instructions I  ushed on the Texas marinade 1hr before BBQing on my Weber with heavy cast iron grates (pre heated 20min at my normal Medium).          I then let my 1 1 4" New Yorks cook for my normal 4min, and turned them over.     To my surprise!      The Sear marks were Dark Black (carcinogenic!), and the meat in between was a sickly grey (NO  own whatsoever!?)          I didn't  ush on any more Stubb's, and had not used other BBQ sauce or seasoning.     I turned the heat down 2 marks, and waited 4min?      Again the Sear marks were Black (not as dark as side 1), and also sickly grey in between.          OH well, I'll give them the taste test?      I couldn't taste Any seasoning, and No flavor enhancement (as advertised).     I poured on a little Stubb's Smokey Mesquite BBQ sauce?  YUCK!          My favorite Bulls Eye Hickory Smoke BBQ Sauce (no HFCS), saved the day (cheaper at Wal Mart...)!        "
