I've been using Hodgson Mill Organic Naturally White Flour for about a year now. One of the first things I noticed after baking with this flour is that I no longer "bloated" or had intestinal distress after eating the foods made with this flour. Soooo nice! My doctor recommended this flour to me, and I'm glad I followed his recommendation. I did an experiment to make sure that it wasn't a coincidence that after eating the Hodgson Mill Organic Naturally white flour I didn't bloat, become puffy, etc. I made some cookies and muffins using the Hodgson Mill flour, and I made the same cookie and muffin recipe with typical white flour (all the rest of the (organic) ingredients were identical). I had intestinal distress, bloated, and had facial and hand puffiness after eating the desserts with the typical flour. When the bloating subsided, I waited an additional 6 8 hours, and I ate the desserts made with the Hodgson Mill flour....nothing happened   no bloating, no puffiness, and I felt great. The Hodgson Mill flour makes you feel good after eating it. I'm delighted to find a flour that doesn't have an adverse reaction on me. ALSO! The flour bakes and cooks great. The texture is wonderful   actually better than typical flour. My cookies,  eads, muffins, pie crust,  ownies, gravy, etc come out wonderful with this flour. I receive a lot of compliments on my desserts when using Hodgson Mill organic flour. Sometimes people find it hard to believe when I tell them that the flour is organic and naturally white. They can't believe the flour produces such great results.          The flour ships quickly and stores well on your pantry shelf. I keep it in the refrigerator after opening it. I like that it comes in two pound bags   very convenient for me. I definitely recommend this flour.
