I wanted to give this product a try as the liquid honey crystallized in a few weeks during the winter months. This small 8 oz. packet does clump together a lot more than other sweeteners so there is less of an advantage over using honey in a jar and spooning out the crystallized honey.          For the price I consider it a poor value. Taste is OK but nothing to rave about and not as good as with regular unprocessed honey.
