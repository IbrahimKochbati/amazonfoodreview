I was a little amazed that the product states to cook for 10 minutes. I have never known a navy bean to cook in 10 minutes.  My soup cooked for 50 minutes before the beans were done. I added some carrots, onion and ham. With a side of corn ead with honey butter, A great meal for a cold, wintery nite.
