I bought 2 cases (24 cans) of this product from Amazon.com.  Out of the 24 cans, 5 were undented, 10 were badly dented, and 9 were extremely dented with 3 of those being crushed in half.  The crushed cans were in the center of one package of 12.  Each case had 12 cans in it and was wrapped tightly in bubble wrap.  The 2 cases were inside a larger box.  There was no damage to any of the boxes.  Other reviewers of this product have talked about these cans arriving dented in similar fashion to what I experienced but I took a  chance and hoped for the success other reviewers have experienced.  Lady Luck was not on my side.  Fortunately, by googling the product's name I found Farmer's Market Organic Pumpkin at another supplier who sent me a case that only had 2 slightly dented cans and 10 perfect cans for the same price plus nominal shipping.  Amazon.com is a good company and I know they'll refund my money for the case of horribly dented cans that I returned.  However, this issue has been going on for some time as evidenced by the reviews.  Where the problem lies, I do not know but I will not buy this product again from Amazon.com until the dented can issue has been resolved.          As to the product itself, the pumpkin is delicious.  It's not solid like Libby's pumpkin, but it works well for my recipes.  It has the consistency of baby food and is slightly more yellow than Libby's pumpkin.  There is a recipe on the can for pumpkin pie using condensed sweetened milk.  I prefer Libby's recipe so instead of 14 oz. of condensed sweetened milk, I use 12 oz. of evaporated milk and 1 2 c. of sugar because we like it less sweet.  The product I can recommend and would've given it 5 stars for the pumpkin alone, but the ongoing, horribly dented can issue lost it 4 points.  The dents really are that bad and some are so badly dented that if they can be opened, they may represent a health hazard.          UPDATE:  Amazon.com is a great company.  It refunded my money for the badly dented cans.  Today, I also received my second order from another online company and while it had fewer dented cans in it, the badly severely dented cans were in the middle of the 12 pack case just like they were in the 2 cases I had ordered from Amazon.com.  The problem seems to lie with the manufacturer.  I've emailed  Farmer's Market Foods, Inc., twice but have heard nothing from the company.  I won't be buying this product again.  Over 50% of the 48 cans had bad to severe dents, of which at least 3 were crushed almost in half.  Badly dented cans may be unsafe to use (e.g., botulism, bacteria).  The tops and bottoms may seem fine (unswollen) at first, but if the seal is microscopically  eached, it may not be fine months from now.  So, when it comes to this product and the company's continued shipping of badly dented and crushed cans in the middle of the case, all I can say is:  "caveat emptor."
