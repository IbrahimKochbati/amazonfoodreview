I bought this unit because of the Kurig name thinking it would be a quality machine.I have had it  about nine months and have trouble with the pump not filling up the cup on either size.I called Kurig and they had no response other than descale it.For the price of this unit you shouldn't have to descale every week. I am very disappointed with this unit and wouldn't buy another one.I will try either a Cuisinart or Mr Coffee.Kurig lost a customer here hope others fare better than I.
