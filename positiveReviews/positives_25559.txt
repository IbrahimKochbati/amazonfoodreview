I have read that over a 6 week period that if you drink 3 to 4 cups of  ewed tea with this product, a day, it has real blood pressure lowering qualities. I am testing it out. Also, I found on line a site that recommended adding 1 4 c orange juice and it does improve the flavor (less tarty).  Good quality and value
