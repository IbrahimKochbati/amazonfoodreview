Anyone who has been on a low carb eating program for any period of time will tell you that it gets boring.  We are new to the Dixie Carb Counters line, but I was very pleasantly surprised by the excellent taste.  Some of the other low carb lines (like Atkins) have a terrible aftertaste, or require the user to have a great imagination. (Yes....this is really supposed to be a chocolate bar.)  But the Dixie Carb items are great.  Easy to make, nice portion size, great taste, and no imagination required.  It really is a muffin!  And...no sugar alcohol!  My only issue is that they are a little pricey.  Otherwise perfect!
