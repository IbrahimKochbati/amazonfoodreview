I tried Tassimo made coffee for the first time at a friends house. It just so happened to be the Kenya blend. When the coffee finished  ewing I thought there was something wrong with the machine since such a small amount was produced with foamy stuff laying on the top. My friend said that was the way it suppose to be so I added some organic cream and organic sugar and WOW!!! The best coffee I have ever tasted. I drank it up like candy. If it wasn't 10:30pm I would have had a second cup. Now I am on a mission to buy my own Tassimo just so I can  ew my own Kenya T cups....
