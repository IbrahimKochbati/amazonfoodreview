I have tried Shake N Bake for chicken but this was the first time I tried it with pork.  I normally  ead my pork chops the hard way with flour, egg, and  eadcrumbs.  Shake N Bake for pork was much easier.  Just wash your chops and stick them in the bag and shake!  I don't have to clean up flour and  eadcrumbs all over my counter anymore.  The taste of the seasoning was not over powering and it makes for an easy and fast dinner.  Obviously this is not as good as home made but if you are looking to make a quick dinner for the family this definitely works in a pinch.
