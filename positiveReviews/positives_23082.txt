My son is on a GFCF diet and most of the premade  eads he can eat are really pretty terrible. This stuff is awesome. Its moist and pleasantly dense, with a slightly sweet flavor reminiscent of potato  ead. It couldn't be easier to make, especially using a  ead machine (and I have a 10 y o cheapo machine). He has been eating this  ead over a year now, and it consistently bakes up beautifully. The 2 lb loaf this makes works out to about the same price as a 1 lb loaf of premade  ead, when bought via Subscribe and Save.          The recipe calls for eggs, which is fine for us because my son can eat them. My nephew also eats this  ead but made with Egg Replacer. It still comes out ok and he likes it, although its a little denser and flatter than when using real eggs.
