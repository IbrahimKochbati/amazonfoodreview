I was searching for an organic baby cereal to give to my 2nd daughter because I had not been happy with what I had fed my 1st.  I am not saying that Earth's Best *caused* my daughter's PN allergy, but I was very disillusioned with them, having called and asked about cross contamination and having them dismiss my concerns (now, surprise surprise, everything is labeled for cross contamination, as it should have been before!).  At any rate, my 1st had eczema and other issues, and although  east fed exclusively for 6 months (and for another 7 thereafter),did not stay on the cereal as long as she could have because of these issues.  So, when it came time to feed my 2nd, I was so happy to find HAPPYBELLIES!  I absolutely LOVE the added pre and probiotics, and think they make all of the difference in the world.  It is so nice to have this included in the cereal, without having to worry about supplementation.  Already at risk for food allergies because of her sister, I feel confident that this has helped boost her developing digestive and immune systems.  And ... so far so good ... she is allergy free! Great for mixing with HAPPYBABY fresh frozen or pouches, I cannot stop raving about this cereal (and continue do so any opportunity I get!!)
