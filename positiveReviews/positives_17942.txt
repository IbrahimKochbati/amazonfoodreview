I have tried a variety of the Shake & Bake products over the years and mostly enjoyed them. This one we used on standard pork chops, followed the directions and served for an every day family dinner. The first thing is that there was not a shaking bag included in the package   we had to use a ziploc bag instead. The seasoning went on pretty evenly with no major clumping. It baked nicely, no soggy spots on the meat, but it wasn't really a crisp crust either. The pork chops were nice and tender.          The flavor... well that left a lot to be desired. It was bland to everyone at the table. One person added salt, another added black pepper, and a third felt the need to add both. Normally if we use a marinade or commercial rub on meat, we don't add anything else to it at the table. So if you are looking for something with a bold flavor, spicey or even perky taste, this probably isn't the mix for you.
