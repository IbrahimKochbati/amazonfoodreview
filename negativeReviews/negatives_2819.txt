so i tried the garlic one and i made a mistake.... and didn't wear a gas mask when i used it ... i LOVE garlic but wow this is over powering in powder form when i first got it i opened it up to give it a smell and almost fell over it was like i got mased eyes tearing up nose burning regardless i bought it im trying it and i mix up some sausage and if you add water like it says it gets toned down so you can work with it after stuffing it and letting it sit for 24hrs for the casing to firm up i grilled them and im not impressed its not bad like someone just dumped a bunch of garlic powder in my sausage and no other spices i feel like it needs more flavor then JUST garlic powder i mean even salt and pepper would be nice
