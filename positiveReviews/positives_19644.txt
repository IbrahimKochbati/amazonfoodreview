Based on reviews online for vegan snacks, I tried this particular flavor and love them. Great snack for the road. They are mostly Wheat gluten in case you want to limit your soy intake. My friends who eat animals loved them also. I didn't mention what they were made of until they were finished eating them and asked. Nice chewy texture. These travel well. They have 10 Gms of protein in case you are asked "where do you get your protein?" I plan on trying another flvor.
