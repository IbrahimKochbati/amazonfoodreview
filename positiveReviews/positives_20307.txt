I have purchased and tried all Happy Baby products and have liked them all (or at least my children have liked them all).  I really enjoy reading peoples' product reviews to see what they think of the products that I am thinking of buying.  I have to say I was a bit concerned about the number of negative reviews that were posted on the oatmeal cereal.  I bought it many years ago for my oldest child when she was a baby and we loved it, now we are buying it for my youngest child and she too is a big fan.  All of the negative reviews that I saw were 2010 2011 (back when I wasn't buying the product).  I don't know if things were changed, but my newest addition is enjoying the oatmeal just as much...if not more than my older one did.  I am really happy with the quality, quantity for the price and healthiness of the product.  We use the cereal as just plan cereal for the little one, but also got some great recipes off of the Happy Baby website and have made some other great snacks for the older one as well. It is a definite buy again and hope that Happy Baby continues to make such great, healthy products.
