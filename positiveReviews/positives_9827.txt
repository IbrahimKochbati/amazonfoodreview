I was looking for Low Carb snacking food. I enjoy peanuts in the shell, but they are messy. These arrived and when shook made no sound. Nuts always rattle in the can.. Opened the foil sealed can and saw the largest peanuts ever. What a taste! Consistency almost of a dry roasted. Taste was fantastic. I took the can into work and those who tried these were also surprised by the crunch and the taste. I am ordering another second two cans.
