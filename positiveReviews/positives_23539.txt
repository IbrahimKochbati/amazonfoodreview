First of all: I agree with the other reviewers, way to expensive here on Amazon. You can save at least $10.00 if you pick it up a your local Sams Club, that is where I got mine. Sad to say since Amazon makes it so convenient.     With that out of the way ....Lively Colombian by Folgers should be categorized as a medium dark roast to me. Not everyone has the same taste buds but I found it to be a wee bit on the bitter side, even at the largest cup. Would I buy this again: yes! I don't mind it being a wee bit bitter but in my opinion Colombian coffee should be bold & smooth tasting not bold & bitter. I know Diedrich Colombia coffee has that bold & smooth taste I prefer; there must be something in the word "Lively" that Folgers put on this box to indicate that it may be bitter. Like I said: not everyone has the same taste buds so if you are the least bit hesitant about the word "bitter" I typed here, I would suggest you get this k cup in a variety pack first instead of buying this 80 count then regretting it later.
