Hubby and I both shared the dring and we both liked it.  I really liked the fact that there was no added sugar in this drink.  It's a nice combination of flavors.  I found it a little too carbonated but he thought it was just right.          I would buy it if it came in a larger can. Hence only 4 stars. I think this can is too small.  Too much aluminum thrown out.  I recyle everything but most people I know just toss it.  Otherwise I would buy this drink.
