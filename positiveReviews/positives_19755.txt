I actually ordered these because I wanted to try the blueberry without buying a full box of it.  I was disappointed that there were less blueberry cups, but that was my own fault because it says so in the description.  Of course, since I didn't like the blueberry, maybe it was for the better.  The other three flavors are pretty standard.  I gave it four stars because even though these aren't my favorite flavors, that's just my opinion.  Product wise, they are everything they should be.
