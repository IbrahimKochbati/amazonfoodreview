I gave this as a gift and it was a big hit.  Nothing was  oken, it was gift wrapped (paid for this), and even came with additional salt samples.  I was surprised at the amount of salt in each tube.  More than enough to get numerous meals of use out of each.  It was well recieved and I wouldn't hesitate to buy again.  I will say I think the shipping cost was a tad high, but the salt was a good deal so it evens out.
