If you like cheese seasoning on your popcorn, this product will not deliver.  It tastes like they should instead of putting anything cheese related on the label they should say, 'improved salt flavoring that will stick to popcorn more than salt'.  I would recommend anything by Kernal Season's  and... that tastes like cheese.  But if you like a salty tasting popcorn, this is the seasoning for you...
