I ordered this product because it was described as "all natural with no chemical preservatives" and the gold box price price was good.  It arrived quickly, as usual for Amazon, and it tastes good.  But, it's not "all natural with no chemical preservatives" unless you consider sodium nitrite and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil to fall under that description.  I would consider ordering it again if it weren't for the artificial ingredients.          How do they get away with suggesting that there are no artificial preservatives (sodium nitrite) in this stuff?  Sodium nitrite has been linked to migraines and colon cancer and has been used as a poison in larger quantities.
