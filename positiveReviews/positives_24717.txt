This tea was very smooth and comforting. I usually don't go for anything licorice flavored, but found that this tea is a nice combo of chai flavors with some anise undertones. I think it would be more than tolerable to someone who hates black licorice like I do! I'm not sure if it actually detoxes, but after drinking it (with food) for about 3 days I started getting rid of water weight and felt more alert without being caffenated which is definitely a plus. I had a little more energy and my mood calmed a bit. I think it needs to be consumed for a longer period of time maybe 2 weeks or more in order to really feel results, but that's the basic principle when it comes to detoxing with any tea or diet foods. I only had 3 bags of it so obviously it would have benefitted me had I a few boxes of this stuff. Good tea!
