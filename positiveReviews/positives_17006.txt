This toy is great fun, my dog enjoys playing with it.  However toys like this are typically used to slow down how fast your dog is eating.  Due to the design of this toy, your dog may get frustrated or lose intrest in eating his full meal by "playing" with the toy because they do have to work very hard to get a treat.  Or be big enough to grab the toy in their mouth and dump the food treats out.          If your looking for something to slow your dogs eating down then look at other toys like the Kong Wobbler.  Or the Steggin Egg.  You'll almost be gaurenteed your dog gets his full meal with those toys.
