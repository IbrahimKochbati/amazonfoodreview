I buy this flavor as a nice change from the plain coconut waters (also for when the plain coconut waters are too expensive  the prices seem to fluctuate a lot on amazon!) the guava is nice and fragrant.  with the guava, the texture does not go down super smooth though as you get a little bit of graininess from the guava juice in it, which makes me cough sometimes. so i do not find it as refreshing to quench thirst. but the drink is very tasty and i keep it in my subscription rotations. i also like the mango flavor and pineapple flavor offered by ONE as well.
