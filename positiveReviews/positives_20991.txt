Other rawhide chews sometimes gave our dog tummy trouble and so we have since switched to MADE IN USA products. Interesting reading: FDA pet food recall list.  Our dog loves these and they seem to digest well.  She's a big dog and will chew and eat these rawhides in a matter of 10 20 minutes, but we treat these as occasional snacks and not as a chew.  They leave no mess behind and we've never noticed any staining, but our dog doesn't eat these in a carpeted area.  She NEVER turns good buddy snacks down.
