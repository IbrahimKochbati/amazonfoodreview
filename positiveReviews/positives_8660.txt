I ordered the Merrick lamb lung treats on the advice of a dog agility friend who had great success with them.  My dog has been blowing her contacts in agility trials, and my friend suggested using these special treats ONLY when training the dog walk, A frame, table, and see saw.  After just two training sessions, my dog is once again racing to the contacts and sticking them.  My fingers are crossed that this behavior will carry over to the trials, but with the help of a clicker and these apparently very appealing treats, I'm seeing renewed confidence and enthusiasm.  They're expensive, but are a bargain compared to the wasted trial entry fees and travel costs.  I'm also going to use them as I begin very basic obedience training with our new rescue dog.
