Six bags of coffee for $32 is an incredible price!  I've had better coffee but I paid that price for one pound.  I'm now drinking this coffee every day and like it very much.  The hazelnut flavor is great and I don't have to use as much creamer for flavor.  The flavor is bold but not overly acidic.  I would definitely recommend this coffee and I will buy it again.
