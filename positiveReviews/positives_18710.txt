This is my new favorite tea.  I give it a HIGH rating.  I still prefer black tea (which this is), but I like the infused mango flavor   just the right amount   not overwhelming.  The hint of vanilla is a perfect addition; very mild.          I participated in a coffee tea exchange and selected this with a beautiful tall mug.  I enjoyed it so much that I ordered this case.  I'm giving a few boxes to friends to enjoy, taking a box to the office for my afternoon " eak" (to avoid my  eaking), and savoring the rest.          I appreciate the aroma, like a good wine; and I find that sipping it relaxes me!
