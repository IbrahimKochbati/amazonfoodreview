These vanilla beans are so fragrant that you can smell them through the unopened package!  I used them to make my own vanilla extract as Christmas gifts, and they worked great!  Don't be fooled by the product photo: they look stiff and dry in the image, but they're soft, pliable, and moist with vanilla oil.
