This is great cereal. I like the one with the raisins dates and pecans. Really delicious. I eat mine with fresh blueberries and bananas, sometimes I add raspberries, blackberries, or strawberries as well.          This price is crazy. Perhaps it is a matter of having to pay all that commision to amazon that is making it difficult to be competitive on grocery type merchandise.          They actually want me to pay 50 bucks for 7 boxes when I can often find it at 2 for 5.oo at wegmans, which would be 20 bucks for 8 boxes? ? ?          Its outragious!
