I love these because they are the best tasting protein bars I've ever had, while still having zero sugar and the same amount of protein than other bars. These taste just like a real candy bar, with none of the nasty after taste that other bars with artificial sweeteners have. I am very happy with these and always make sure I never run out. They are a life saver when something unexpected happens in the day and I can't cook something properly.
