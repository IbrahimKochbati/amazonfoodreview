Yeah, Nerds have always had a great taste, but I don't understand why the Wonka company continues to use Carmine color in their products. Carmine color, which is listed in the ingredients above, is made from the ground up bodies of the cochineal insect. So until Wonka learns that they don't need to use ground up bugs to color their candy red, I'm not buying.
