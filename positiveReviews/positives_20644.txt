We have been hooked on this chili for a few years now and it recently became unavailable at our local grocery store so we're frantically looking for another place that might have it.          We typically add a half pound of cooked hamburger and then throw it in a bowl, top it with some sour cream and cheese and use corn chips (usually Fritos) to dip in the soup   sooooo goood.
