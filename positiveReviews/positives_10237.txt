BEING A KEEN ALBEIT VERY AMATEUR KIND OF COOK I ENJOY ITALIAN FOOD AND RECIPES. I TEND TO PUT TRUFFLE OIL, TRUFFLE BUTTER OR SLIDED TRUFFLES INTO A NUMBER OF DISHES I COOK. TRIED URBANI AS AN ENDING TOUCH ON A RISOTTO AL FUNGHI AND THE EFECT WAS INCREDIBLE, WONDERFULLY AROMATIC. TRIED ON A SIMPLE SCRAMBLED EGGS AND AGAIN THE EFFECT WAS INCREDIBLE!
