I will second the notion that these are very sour.  I can't eat too many of these like I can the gummi bears.  After a few of these my mouth feels like it has tasted real grapefruit, and in fact real flavorings are part of these treats.  I'm not sure why there is sugar coating on these, though.  I don't find these too sweet at all.          The texture is on the soft side, not hard like those jumbo cherry gummis (which I didn't care for), and after trying these now for a week I must say these are quite good.
