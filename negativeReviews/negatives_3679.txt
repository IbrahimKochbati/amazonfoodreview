Ok, straight up  these things taste funky.  My first thought when I ate the first walnut was, "What am I going to do with 6 canisters of these weird things?"  My wife tried one and hated it  she refuses to eat them.  But I kept trying them and began to like them (probably because I didn't want to feel I was throwing $30 down the toilet).  I can't quite give them 4 stars, because they're not THAT great.  But I sometimes have a hard time stopping myself from eating them once I start.          It would really be cool if Emerald could duplicate the taste that Blue Diamond has accomplished for their Jalapeno Smokehouse Almonds.  Now THOSE things are awesome!  I highly recommend those, even if you're not a big fan of almonds.  I'm doubtful, however, that I'll order these walnuts again.
