Fred, our Aussie Terrier, will eat anything that's not faster than he is.  So the fact that he eats his Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats is in no way a testimonial.  All evaluation will have to be left to me.          These dog treats are 95% organic ingredients.  That carries a lot of weight with me.  I have confidence in the Newman's  ands and hope that they continue to live up to their reputation.          Fred likes the treats, but they're not his favorites.  He's young enough to deal with the hard, dry texture, but I wonder if they have as much aroma as more moist treats.  He eats them on the carpet (of course), then has to lick up the crumbs.  So we know that they're tasty enough for a greedy dog to hustle a bit.          Each treat comes as a rectangular biscuit that can be  oken into two squares.  Since the biscuits are hard and dry, even though they're scored,  eaking them would be difficult for a person with joint issues.          Four Stars.  The bottom line:  Tasty and safe, but not a favorite for dog or owner.
