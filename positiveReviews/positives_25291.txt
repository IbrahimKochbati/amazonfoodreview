I just happened upon this product as I was looking for finishing sauces and balsamic vinegars.  The four reviews were excellent, however, I have in the past purchased food products based on good reviews and have been disappointed.  I put this in my cart and tried to find additional information reviews on the Internet.  I couldn't many reviews beyond the four on Amazon.com.  I was ambivalent but decided to take a chance & purchase the 6 bottles.  This sauce has met all of my expectations and has fully met the recommendations of the four reviewers who gave it five stars.  It will be delicious on vegetables, pasta, seafood, potatoes, etc.  This is a delicious sauce and I hope that unlike Trader Joe's, Amazon never discontinues the sale of this lemon dill mustard sauce.  It is delicious and very versatile.  I highly recommend the purchase of the "Food & Wine Magazine Lemon Dill Mustard Sauce Marinade." It is incredibly delicious.
