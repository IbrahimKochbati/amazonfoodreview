My 18 year old son cannot tolerate gluten, so I have been on a quest to find a pancake biscuit mix for him that he will actually like. I tried a few others and they were horrible. I felt so bad for my son and kept looking. Thank goodness I found Bisquick. It tastes most like real pancake mix and my son really enjoys it. I have made him biscuits too and he is thrilled to eat " ead" again.  I highly recommend this mix for anyone who simply cannot eat wheat.
