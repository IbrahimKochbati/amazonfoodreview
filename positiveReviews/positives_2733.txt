A very soft, very delicious Keebler Brand Cookie that is hard to find in the supermarket and generally around $4.49 bag 'cause it's never on sale. I picked up my order of 6 bags through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon for $13.00, a good bargain considering how much they are in a grocery store @ $4.49 bag and hard to find usually in this variety! If the sale is right, I highly recommend it for you to try and buy for yourself!
