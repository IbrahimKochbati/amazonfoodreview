You should stop selling these DEFECTIVE Tully's products!          I bought 2 packages of Tully's Italian Roast K cups (48 cups) on July 20, 2011. I quickly discovered that all were defective. The airtight seal on each and every K cup was  oken and, when put into the Keurig coffeemaker, it spilled coffee grounds into both the coffee and the machine.          I contacted Tully's customer service line, explained what'd happened and they couldn't have been more rude, condescending and unhelpful. They refused to send a refund or coupon through Amazon (to eventually credit my account) unless I sent these two boxes back and they inspected them. By the time these were opened a month later, the Amazon packing was long gone and these crappy K cups were despoiling our pantry. My wife tossed them in disgust.          Our first and last purchase from Tully's. Shame on them for such lousy customer service and for failing to stand by their products!.
