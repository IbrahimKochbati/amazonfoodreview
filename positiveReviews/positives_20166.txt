I'm not a coffee connoisseur, but I like a good medium roast taste. I have a grind and  ew coffeemaker, so I buy the whole bean Copper Moon. This coffee has become a staple in our household. I keep it in supply all the time and it's the perfect blend for my husband and myself. I'm glad I discovered it online at Amazon because it keeps me from wasting money buying coffee beans at all the fancy coffee shops.
