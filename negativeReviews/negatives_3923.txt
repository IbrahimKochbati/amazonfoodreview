I was hoping for actual juice. A kiwi and strawberry combination is one of those combinations that I usually love. In fact if you combine strawberry with anything I'm usually game (steak, chocolate, banana, etc.) and this COULD be a good drink. However, it's in the fizzy drink school of beverages and as a fizzy drink, I can't stand it.          Granted, I was never too fond of the fizzy drinks in the first place. The orange drinks were always a bad second to actual orange juice. Not that I don't love pop, but I really can't get behind a bad orange juice pop.          So at first taste, this is rather sweet. But then it goes down and its too sweet. And fizzy. The fizzy and the sweet combine and you are drinking candy. Not that pop is anything but candy, but there's candy and there's candy and this is the hard candy that your grandmother gives you to suck on to shut you up for a few hours.          Not very good.
