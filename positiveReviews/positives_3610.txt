I only used one green with it's ball, etc. with the golfer on the cake.  I made one long hole with fairway, sand traps, water hazards and green.  My hubby loved it for his big 30th golf themed party.  I used the extra golf clubs, balls and pins on the decor table around the cake.  If I had a huge sheet cake to decorate I could see using the three greens but it wouldn't have fit right on one 9x13 cake.  Knowing I was buying Wilton made me confidant that I would be very satisfied and I was.  And for the price, I couldn't go wrong :)
