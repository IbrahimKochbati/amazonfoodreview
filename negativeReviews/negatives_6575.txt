This oatmeal is a good choice on very busy, cool mornings. I make it with a little less water than recommended, and it's ready in 60 seconds. The serving size is good, the oatmeal's not overly sweet, and I like the maple  own sugar flavor.          On the con side, the oat size is too small for my preferences. Some other  ands have larger pieces. I've found a few pieces of the scratchy part in my bowl, now and then. And the flavor isn't all that well distributed even after I stir well.
