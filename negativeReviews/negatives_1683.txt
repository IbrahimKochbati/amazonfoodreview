The product stinks and that's mildly stated.  The caps do not snap on easily and if you apply too much pressure the cup part caves in and you end up with ground coffee everywhere.  I threw the whole order into the trash and called it a day.  I will be using professionally produced K cups (i.e, Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks, even Folgers) from this point on.
