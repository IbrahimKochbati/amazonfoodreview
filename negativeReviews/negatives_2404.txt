I am a coffee lover of many years and as such am always interested in finding good coffees.  This was my first time to try blue mountain, and purchasing it with a gift certificate allowed me to be a bit more extravagant than I otherwise would have been.          While the coffee is good, I don't find it to be superior to other coffees I have ordered which are considerably less expensive.
