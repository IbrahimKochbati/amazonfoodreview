2.2lbs of anchovies may be over the top, but when they are as good as these, then over the top is the place to be. The difference in taste to regular anchovies & these salted one ones is like the difference of filet mignon to a fast food hamburger...unless you LIKE fast food...     It may seem expensive to buy this many, however, they last indefinitely, and one will usually take the place of a whole can of the grocery store variety.     Yum!
