I rarely do product reviews on Amazon BUT after having the 1st bag I knew I had to say something!          These chips are not for the faint. They have a wonderful kettle cooked crunch to them and the bag size is the perfect munching snack to watching a movie.  These are not only going to make a good snack for me (as I really like spicy foods) but will also make the perfect laugh when I let friends try them...          These chips have a wonderful flavor and not too much spice (if any at all) when you first chomp into a them, but wait for it, after 5 10 second the burn starts to come usually about the time you reach for your second or third and by then it is too late.          The burn lasts for a solid 10 15 minutes after eating a few handfuls and personally made me sweat a good deal as I finished off my first bag while watching a movie.          These I would easily buy again and recommend them to ANYONE who wants a good laugh at someone else's expense OR of you really like painfully spicy hot sauce. Although they were a good deal spicier than I expected. If you know Blair's they are know for the very hottest of hot sauces and NOW I think they can also  ag they have the hotest snacks!
