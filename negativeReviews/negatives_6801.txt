I had high expectations but it was extremely salty and tasted nothing like movie theater popcorn. Next time I try popping it ( I do have 23 more packs to go through) I'll try cutting back on the salt in the packet. I don't know how this popcorn got such ratings. I'll give it another shot though out of the love I have for popcorn.
