This Jam is about the best Loganberry I have found in recent years. Loganberry Jam is very hard to find in retail stores. I'm told that the berries are no longer as commercially viable as other berries..something about the berries ripening at different times.  Pioneer Valley Loganberry Jam has a fresh, tart flavor and is very true to the flavor of fresh loganberries.
