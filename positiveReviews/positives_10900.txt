These were a gift for an English bulldog, who had no problem chomping them down. (I know other reviews said some dogs found them difficult.) As with anything "Newman" you pay a little more for the  and name, so the budget conscious buyer might choose an alternative, cheaper treat. I'm not sure you need organic for your pet but perhaps it's a little healthier and certainly can't hurt. They disappeared pretty quickly, but this bulldog eats everything!
