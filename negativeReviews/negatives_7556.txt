If your dog chews these up into tiny pieces, they're probably good treats for him her.  Our Golden Retriever chews them down to two inch or larger pieces that she tries to swallow.  They get caught in her throat choking her and we have to get our fingers down her throat past the piece to pull it out, very abusive for the dog.  If we don't catch the problem when she first starts to choke, it could be fatal.          We've stopped giving her these treats.
