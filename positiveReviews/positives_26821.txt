I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING WITH TEA'S SINCE OCTOBER OF 2010 AND I'D HAVE TO GIVE THIS TEA A FIVE + STAR!!!! NOT ONLY FOR ITS TASTE BUT FOR THE PRICE AS WELL. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST TEA IVE EVER HAD. I AM SO ADDICTED TO IT NOW, THAT A BOX ONLY LASTS ME ABOUT A WEEK.     MY CO WORKER INTRODUCED ME TO STASH ABOUT 3 MONTHS AGO AND TO MY SURPRISE I'VE LOST 10LBS WITHOUT CHANGING MY DIET AT ALL. IF YOU LIKE CHAI TEA, THEN THIS IS THE TEA FOR YOU!!!!! GIVE IT A TRY, YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!
