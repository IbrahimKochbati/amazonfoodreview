My Shepherd mix ate the first one of these I gave him right away, but waited with the second. The biscuit is thick and hard, and it is scored down the middle so that owners of mid sized dogs can  eak it in half. I don't think it's going to be small enough for small dogs, and it's hard to  eak other than where it is scored. I'm sure these will get eaten, and I'm glad they are organic and have good ingredients, but they weren't especially a favorite. I would say my dog likes the Newman chicken biscuits, the heart shaped ones, better. They are thinner, and possibly easier to chew, altho he doesn't really hesitate about chewing bones. Not really sure what goes on in his mind, but maybe a hard cookie is not enticing enough for an energetic chew?
