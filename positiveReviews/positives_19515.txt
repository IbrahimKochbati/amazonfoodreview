This is the only mint  eath freshener that my nine year old daughter will eat and not only does she like them she absolutely loves them!  It's a special treat in the car and much better than an artificial chemical containing candy.  I highly recommend that people with younger kids give them a try.  These are also perfect for anyone wanting a mint that is not as strong as Altoids.
