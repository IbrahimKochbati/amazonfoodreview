My wife and I both thought this is a nice cup of coffee. The bag has a one way valve on it to keep the air out and arrived virtually flat. When  ewed in our Cuisinart drip coffee maker it has a  nice aroma. I take mine with cream and sugar, and Mrs. B. drinks hers black. We both thought it was smooth, with no bitterness. Later it made a nice after dinner coffee when we added our favorite liquor. Tho I am no coffee snob, I can tell a good cup of coffee from a bad one, and this one makes the grade.
