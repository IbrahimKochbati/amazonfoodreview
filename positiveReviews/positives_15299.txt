My family uses the refillable baskets to make coffee in our Keurig Home Brewer. I found the K cups weak and expensive and suspect most of them use dye to make the product look more like coffee.          After about a year of heavy use, my $99.00 Keurig Home Brewer died and we decided it was crap. In the week since returning to our old drip pot methods, my family has gone through almost three times the coffee we were using with the home Keurig. I also miss the flavor of the machine's coffee. It turns out that steaming pressure gets more out of the beans than traditional coffee makers.          At $10.00 a pound (we live in the Caribbean) for coffee, I reckon a new Keurig will pay for itself in TWO MONTHS.          This morning's early trip to the store because we're no longer used to buying so much coffee prompted me to do the math and decide that I'll just keep ordering these coffeemakers and hope that soon, a more reliable model comes along.
