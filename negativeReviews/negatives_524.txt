Traditional English Muffins are usually fat free or having very little fat.  This little challenger should be called something else all together.          Closer to what I would say a croissant is, having all of the buttery taste and fat to go with it.          Terrific if that's what you are looking for in an English muffin but not what I'm looking for.  I would rather save the fat for a chocolate dessert.
