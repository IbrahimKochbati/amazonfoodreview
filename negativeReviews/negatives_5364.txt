At first I thought this coffee would be strong because it's French Roast.  However, it's extremely mild.  It has a nutty aroma when the packet is first opened.  The first sip has a mild nutty flavor, which goes away with each additional sip.          I like drinking my coffee black, but can only do so with really good coffee that's not too strong.  Most coffees, I need to add non fat milk to.  So, I first tried this coffee black.  Although it's very mild, and I didn't need milk to buffer the bitterness, I found it lacking in body.  With the next cup I added hot milk and it tasted much better.  It really needed the extra omph of the milk, even though it was non fat.          I didn't notice any heartburn afterwards, which is good.  But, I wasn't excited to drink it again.
