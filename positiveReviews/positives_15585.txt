OK, so I couldn't personally taste this cat food and give you a review. But all I can say is: my two cats (14 and 15 years old) virtually inhaled it. Clawdette is the older one and she is fussy. She likes a cat food that has seafood and tomato in it. Chappie is less picky, but he can turn up his nose at some supermarket  and cat foods. So more often then not I buy the canned cat food at petshops (or on Amazon). I fed them each of the cans in the Variety Pack...and its as if the food vanished off the face of the earth within a few minutes. The bottom line: they loved it, it left their coats nice and softy and glossy, and they had lots of energy. So I (or, rather my cats) give it five stars.
