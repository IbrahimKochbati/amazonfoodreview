These cinnamon thin cookies looked appealing in the package so I bought some.  I didn't buy them because they were gluten free, I just like anything that TASTES GOOD, whether it's low fat, fattening, gluten free, low carb, etc. and they ARE really good and surprisingly satisfying for being gluten free.  Make sure that if you eat them while having coffee that you "dunk" quick (if you like to dunk your cookies).  I order 5 or 6 boxes at a time and will continue to in the future because now they are a favorite that I eat practically every day.
