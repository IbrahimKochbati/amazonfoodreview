We purchased a popcorn machine for our media room which called for the 4oz. packs of popcorn. The machine was purchased at Sam's Club where the popcorn packs were not available. Not finding this in town, we went to Amazon where we found exactly what we needed. It works perfectly in our machine. One thing to be aware of: the butter oil packet comes solid and you squeeze it into the machine. When we first opened the case we thought that the butter oil was old and had solidified. We needed to look it up on the Great American Popcorn site to assure ourselves that we did not need to send it back. It makes wonderful movie theatre style popcorn.
