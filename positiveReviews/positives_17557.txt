This coffee  ewed up beautifully in my percolator, with almost no bite no matter how strong I make it.  I prefer a very strong pot of coffee, and often this results in something that feels like it is eating my stomach lining for  eakfast.  Not so with this coffee, which left me feeling wide awake without also feeling that my intestinal tract had been invaded by a swarm of piranhas.
