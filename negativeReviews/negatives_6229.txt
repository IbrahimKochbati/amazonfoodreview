My baby has the milk protein allergy and also seems allergic to soy. I am exclusivley  eastfeding, so once I cut dairy and soy out, he was a very happy non gassy baby who slept better at night. It was time to start rice cereal...I started a little before his 6 month birthday and I found this  and because of all the reviews. I neededsomething that would not upset his tummy. We tried it for a few nights. My baby loved it...he took down every bite with a spoon. Unfortunately, though,he was up all night every night with gas. He also stopped having bowel movements for several days...before we started the cereal it was every day. I went online to ask if rice cereal could cause constipation gas and I was alarmed by all the moms who had the same experience. I was hoping the happybellies cereal would prevent this, but it didn't. I have 6 cans of it since I couldn't buy one alone, so I'm not sure what to do with them. I went straight into giving him homemade baby food and both baby and his tummy love it...we started with avocado, then banana, squash, and now sweet potatoes. I know he still needs cereal, so I'm thinking about trying the oatmeal. I was so disappointed this cereal didn't work for him.
