Very fruity, just the way a good Kalamata should be.     Sure, they are salty, they must be to preserve them.     The barchetta is way nice for salads, pizza, pasta or tapenade.          Just take a cup of olives out of the tub, rinse them under tap water     and put them in a pint jar and cover with water, place in the fridge.     In half a day, the salt will leech out into the water and the olives     will be sweet and fruity and relatively unsalty.
