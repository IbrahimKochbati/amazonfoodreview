I received Quaker Soft baked Oatmeal cookie, chocolate almond box by post. What I saw after receiving it baffled me. Even though each of the cookie has been individually wrapped, the cookies are not fresh enough when you open them. They lack the crispness. Due to this the flavor of the product is lost. I did not relish this cookie as much as I would have loved it to be.
