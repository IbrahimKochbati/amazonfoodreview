I love this sampler of Ghiradelli Chocolate Intense Dark Squares especially now that nutritionists recommend you have an oz. of dark chocolate each day that is over 70% cacoa.  Chocolate is a vegetable a friend reminded  it's a bean!          These chocolates are affordable, tasty, rich, intense, silky smooth and just the right size.  I love to serve them for after dinner.  The squares are fairly large and individually wrapped.  It's great to have different amounts of cacoa depending on guests' tastes.  Dark chocolate is an acquired taste for some.  Of course, the darker the chocolate, the healthier so you can work your way up to the 86% cacoa. Great to have on hand for the holidays.  If you are on a diet and want a low calorie chocolate healthy treat, having these individually wrapped dilutes the temptation.  I'm happy with one square most days.          These are a great non guilty pleasure that are good for your health!
