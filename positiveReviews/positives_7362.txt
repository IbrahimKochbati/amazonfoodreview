This tablets were really fun to try out. My parents, my siblings, and my friends all loved them and were so confused on how well they worked. Do not drink store bought orange juice though! It was sickly sweet because of the sugar added and the acid in it! My favorite was fresh pineapple and sucking on limes. (Limes were sweeter for me than the lemons)
