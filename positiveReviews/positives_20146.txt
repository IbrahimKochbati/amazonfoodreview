I have not had this drink in years.  The first time I had it was in Connecticut at an Au Bon Pain restaurant.  I was recently in the Virginia Highlands area in Atlanta in a very cool coffee, wine grocery store and they had it.  My daughter loved it so I began to search online for it since they don't sell it in my area.  It is so fresh and delicious.  Wish it was easier to get.  Great service with this order, however shipping amount very high.
