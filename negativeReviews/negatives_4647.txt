I thought I would go back to my grandparents heritage,all four born in Ireland, and try some Irish Tea.  I recently had a heart problem and my cardiologist recommended that I significantly decreae my caffeine intake.  I used to drink several glasses of iced tea every day. Strangely enough tea has at least as much caffeine as coffee.  Green tea is definately out as an alternative to coffee or other beverages; but black tea is fine.I picked up some store  and black tea bags (Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Chai)to make iced tea and I was quite pleased with the heartiness of the flavor.  I then researched the matter further and came accross the Taylor's Decaffeinated Irish Breakfast Tea.  I was quite disappointed with the results.  I like strong tea, and must use at least 14 tea bags to get the same results as 10 tea bags of the store  and.  As you might guess the store  and ia a lot less expensive.  I will use up the 6 boxes that conisted of my order, and then buy the store  and again.
