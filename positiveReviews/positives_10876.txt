Okay, I have to be honest here.  My Black Lab is not exactly a picky eater.  If I refer to something as a "cookie" or a "treat" and call her a "good girl" when I give it her, she is guaranteed to enjoy it.  Therefore, I can't honestly say that she "liked" Newman's Organic Lamb and Barley treats "more" than any other snacks I've given her over the years.          However, I can say that I felt better about offering them to her!  First of all, a "Nutritional Facts" comparison showed them to be superior to some of the common store  and biscuits that I've bought in the past.  Secondly, they smelled better (I'm tempted to use the word "fresher") than some of the other  ands.  And finally, she digested them well.  I don't feed her table scraps or people food aside from an occasional raw or frozen carrot, and I don't switch her regular food very often, because her system is fairly sensitive to changes in her diet.  She handled the Newman biscuits with no problems at all.          I would probably feed her these treats on a regular basis if price were no object; however, these are a premium product and are priced accordingly.  What I will do is purchase them when they are on sale, just as I do a couple of other premium  ands.  Definitely recommended!
