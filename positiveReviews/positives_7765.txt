We discovered these a few years ago and they are about the only pork rinds we consume now. Makes a great quick snack.  Only complaint would be with the heat time.  Since microwaves vary so much, it is hard to determine the exact time needed to make them nice and crispy fluffy without over or under cooking.  Flavor is always consistent ... and good.
