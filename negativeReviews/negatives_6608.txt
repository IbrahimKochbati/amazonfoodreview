...after paying the shipping the item cost over $11.00          That would be perfectly  OK if the lemon mayo gave a different little ZING! to things I would normally use mayo for.  However, tastewise I didn't care for it, but I thought..oh that's just me. Then my DH said "Ohh.h.h..h I dont even like the way it smells."     That's too bad, I love mayo and I love lemon, but this product didnt have an appeal to either of us.     Finishing with something GOOD to say..it arrived speedily and I love the label..it's an attractive label.
