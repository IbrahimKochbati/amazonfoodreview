First of all I love the flavor.  Couldn't be happier, it is as described   bold, delicious, loved it.          BUT I bought this several times and each time I had problems with my Keurig and the packaging.  The K cups would not empty, would overflow, and would make only 1 2 the amount recommended.  Keurig would say "prime" repeatedly after using these cups, and I would have to go through the extensive method of re priming my Keurig.  I bought this twice, and (yes, I'm slow), with the second batch realized the problem was the packaging of the K cups.  For whatever reason this kept happening.          Since I cannot return this item I am stuck with 30 of these that I won't use.          I also won't order anything with the blue cups again, especially not this  and.          Just to clarify   I am not a serially negative poster, and I have had my Keurig for over 6 months.  I've used multiple other  ands without a problem.          For now I'm sticking with Paul Newman's extra bold.  Great flavor and no problems with the K cups.
