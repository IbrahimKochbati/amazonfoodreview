After finding out what horrors I'd been perpetrating on my kitties with their expensive "premium" pet food, I set out to find something that wasn't full of by products and unnecessary corn ingredients. Halo Spot's Spew definitely fit that bill and their ingredients are probably the best you will find in a cat food. My cats, however, weren't as impressed as I was and turned their noses up at their new food. They did eat it, but clearly weren't enthused.     Although I like the human grade ingredients used in Halo foods, I do wish they used more meat sources. There are only a couple protein sources in the food and as a result the protein content of Spot's Stew, around 30%, is also a little lower than what I'd like.     Overall, however, this is definitely a great food to feed your pets, though if you have a cat that's a finicky eater or that needs a high protein food, Halo Spot's Stew may not be for you.
