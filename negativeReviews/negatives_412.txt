The reviews on this are so true. Great idea, but such a pain to pop the clear lid off from the side, even once I figured it out. I keep waiting for it to  eak in my hands because it does take some pressure to pop off the lid   but it feels fragile and likely to  eak with too much pressure. I would consider buying one of the new designs that seem sturdier and open from the top (not the side).
