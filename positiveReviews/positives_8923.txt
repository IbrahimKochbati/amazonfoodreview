This stuff is yummy! I was afraid to try this since I love regular butter so much. I have read about the health benefits of ghee and after ordering this, I am hooked! It's so delicious. I use it to butter my popcorn, saute veggies, on my toast, etc. The best part is that it's grass fed. It's one of the only grass fed ghees I can find. Grass fed is so much better than grain fed. I will continue to buy this...and hoping they will start selling a larger jar so I won't have to keep ordering it twice a month lol!
