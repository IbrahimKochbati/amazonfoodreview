I have a large Sprout Master. I purchased it when I first got interested in sprouting based on great feedback. But sometimes it seemed like too much. Since there are only two of us, I used the divider and sprouted two different kinds of seeds at once. Yet, it still was more than I could use in a week. Then I came across the mini sprouter! How cool is this? Each tray has a divider so if I want, I can actually sprout 6 different types of seeds at once. They stack on top of each other and take up such a small footprint on my counter. Even better, is that someone asked me to sprout some seeds for them and I was able to give them the "layer" with their seeds already sprouted and ready to finish crisping in the fridge. When they are done eating them, I will take the layer back and begin another sort of seed. The mini is the perfect size for one or two people. The larger is great for families or sharing. Quality construction, easy to clean and again, each has a divider you can use or take out when not needed. This would be a great gift with organic seeds for a newlywed couple or someone wanting to bypass the store purchased sprouts that are causing many health problems. I heard Kroger is no longer selling sprouts at all. Eat healthy and use a no fail product to sprout. This fits the ticket.
