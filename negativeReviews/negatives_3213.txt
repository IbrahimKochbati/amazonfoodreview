I ordered this product and the Urbani white Truffle oil and it arrived  oken because they shipped it in a box with nothing inside to protect it. It was just 4 glass bottles thrown into a box and shipped. Also there were no markings on the box to say it was fragile or that there was glass inside.  When I tried to go online and return it I was told the items were not returnable.  So I just bought some expensive,  oken, oil.  I will not5 buy from this again and would advise everyone else to do the same.
