We have 3 Belgian Malinois and they did amazingly well on this food. Their coats looked better on Canidae than on any other food we've had them on. It even eliminated the horrible gas that large dogs are known for! When Amazon upped the price $10 a bag we switched to Diamond Naturals, but not only did their coats begin to lose their sheen, but that awful smelling gas came back as well!! We are putting them back on Canidae. It's worth it!!
