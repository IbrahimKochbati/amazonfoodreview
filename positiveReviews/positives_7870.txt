I have been looking for a site to order Snow's Corn Chowder.  Formerly a New Englander and now living in Florida, I cannot find my favorite chowder anywhere.  My whole family loves Snow's Corn Chowder and I promise to share with them if I can order a case.  Would some one please look around and see if you can find one.  The Florida Fredericks would be most appreciative.
