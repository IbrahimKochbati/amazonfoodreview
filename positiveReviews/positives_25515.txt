I was channel surfing and purely by chance I landed on the Dr. OZ show.  As his guest tried different holistic weight loss products, I was particularly intrigued by this product.  I quickly ordered a couple of bags so I wouldn't forget to do it and I've been hooked since then.  Its great in just about anything that you would normally use sugar.  I'm an avid coffee drinker, so I particularly enjoy it's aroma and the hint of nutty flavor it adds to my sacred beverage.  Bye Bye regular sugar!
