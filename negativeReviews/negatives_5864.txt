Almost no detectable coffee flavor below the raspberry aroma. Probably would go well for those that like flavored creamers. Mostly this is warm water that smells like raspberries. Very little detectable chocolate. I bought this as an alternative for my kids. It might work for them when the hot chocolate runs out.
