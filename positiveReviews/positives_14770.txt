I found Branston pickle unappealing on it's own. Bit too tangy for my pallet, but I read it was great on Beef and cheddar cheese sandwiches and it is!          I personally think it reminds me of A1 steaksauce with a chunky kick.     I look forward to finding more obscure uses for this British delight in my american home.
