I love this  and!  The best hazelnut flavor ever! I wait for it to go on sale because it is more expensive than the other  ands.  Also, as another reviewer noted, it does say decaff on the bottom of the package! It really should state that in the product description. I've noticed the packages from Bed, Bath and Beyond did not state this but can't imagine both are available.  I'll still purchase it because the flavor is so smooth.
