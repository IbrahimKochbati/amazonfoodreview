The items are tasty, unfortunately I developed hives  and intense itching after ingestion.  Never had allergic reaction to this type of food before but there's always a first.  After initial hive  eakout I stopped eating the pastries and gave it a few days to see if it could be from other things.  The hives went away after a about five days and returned as soon as I ate the first piece after a week [they were refrigerated].
