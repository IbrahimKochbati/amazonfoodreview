This product was awesome the first couple months, I was convinced I was over any potential "defective period..." Well, after caring for it well and giving it no reason not to work, it of course stopped working for me. I now can't use it for anything serious. Anything I record that is profound or important runs the risk of cutting out half way without giving any warning leaving me with half a recording of audio and half with crickets. There must be some crappy design inside the tube that prevents establishing a solid connection, I'm just happy it's not my $100 blue microphone! Don't waste your money on the icicle, it's productive ability has an expiration.
