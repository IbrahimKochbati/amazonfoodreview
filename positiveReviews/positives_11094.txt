For years...DECADES...I've had stomach intestinal pain that many doctors have failed to diagnose for effective treatment. So I tried this and 3 times a day, I  ew 2 bags (sometimes a third bag of ginger tea) and I haven't had stomach pain in weeks! The taste isn't offensive (like the ginger...YUCK) and I find I'm benefiting from the additional liquids too.
