I receiced the order quickly of both the Hickory and the Sweet & Hot.  Have not opened the S&H yet but only the Hickory beef jerky.  The cut is very thick and meaty and not chewy at all.  I think it is too salty plus the fact that the packaging contains a large amount of crumbs (tiny bits of meats) as if they was loaded in the bag to make it one pound.  After mixing some grounded black pepper and sprinkled some sugar, the jerky tastes a lot better.
