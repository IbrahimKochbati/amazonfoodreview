Well, I discovered these little gems near the chips isle at my nearby Fresh and Easy grocery store. Somersaults. Hmmmm. Pacific Sea Salt. Crunchy nuggets baked with sunflower seeds and toasted grains. How could I resist? Into the cart it went.          These little thingies are really good! Rich sunflower seed taste and very tasty. They're about the size of a thick quarter and they chew up real easily. Delicious taste, or did I already mention that? They have a nice salty taste, but aren't particularly high in sodium. How do they do that? They're high in fiber and protein. the fat calories are high, but it's the good fat. No trans fats or cholesterol. Man, these are an excellent snack! I'm going to eat too many!          Gary Peterson
