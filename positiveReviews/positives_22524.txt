About a year ago, I purchased a 6 oz popcorn machine for my business in order to give my customers some free snacks while they are in my store.  I purchased these 6 oz popcorn packs and love them.  I do not have to worry about portions or measuring.  Everything comes in a handy serving pack with the correct mixture.  Super easy! No mess either.  I love it!  The popcorn is delicious and I have to sometimes keep myself from eating it all.
