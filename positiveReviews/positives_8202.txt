My dogs love this food & do well on it,the quality & price are decent for the Royal Canin  and. The kibble is small enough for smaller  eeds. I recommend this if you can't afford the pricier " eed specific" formulas. I hope Amazon can keep this size on hand for the price with free shipping. I will definately keep buying it!
