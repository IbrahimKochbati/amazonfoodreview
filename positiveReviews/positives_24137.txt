One of the difficult parts of dealing with Celiac disease is finding foods to safely eat while on the road.  In general salads are safe (except the croutons), but we have to watch the dressings carefully.  By  inging our own dressing my wife has found she can eat on the road and not get sick.  While the no calorie and fat free options are appealing, the Gluten Free aspect is wonderful for those who must eat Gluten Free. When you have Celiac, it's simple to tell if a food it simply labeled as Gluten Free or if it really is!  If it really is GF and also free of cross contamination, my wife doesn't get sick.  This dressing meets all her GF needs along with tasting good.          This dressing has a nice consistency, tastes good and is about the right size to put on a Subway or Wendy's salad if you prefer your own dressing.  My wife takes this in her lunches too.  If you don't need the packets, you can save some money by buying a larger bottle and filling a small Tupperware type container to take with you.  You can also modify the portion size by pouring your own.          In order of preference, our favorite Walden Farms flavors are:     Italian Salad Dressing     Ranch Salad Dressing     Chipotle Ranch Salad Dressing          As a Calorie Free, Sugar Free, Gluten Free dressing this is the best ranch dressing we have found.  It's not as thick as Hidden Valley Farms and a little less sweet.  Hidden Valley isn't an option in our home due to our need to be GF.  If you don't mind some calories, a great GF Ranch Dressing is from Kens Steak House.  My kids prefer Kens Ranch to Walden Farms Ranch but they are not worried about calories or sugar at their age yet.          It's amazing that these Walden Farms dressings can taste as good as they do with no calories, no sugar, no gluten, and even no fat!  Not all of the dressings taste great, but this flavor is really good.          4 stars as one of my wife's favorite dressings.
