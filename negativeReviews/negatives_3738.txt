I ordered this coffee under the impression that it was a medium roast,that was according to the  ief description & by zooming in the box on my laptop. On the the side of the box it stated medium. When the coffee arrived today it is not medium it is light. No medium on the box at all, just light. I am very disapointed with this purchase as I wanted at least a medium roast flavor. To be able to get a full flavor at all you will need to use a very small amount of water & make a very small cup of coffee. I'm sure I could send it back but the hassle is not worth it, but will not buy again. If you like extremely light coffee this is for you, if you like to taste your coffee this is No good. I will order bold from now on. As far as taste there is none unless you make about a 4 oz. cup even then it's not very good.     Amazon did ship very fast,I received the order sooner than expected & it was packaged very well.     Too bad the coffee was not what I ordered  expected.
