Looking forward to receiving this product and when it arrived it was covered in walnuts.  Unfortunately, tree nuts are an issue and I wish that there was information about nuts on the items listing.  I will  ing it to work for the staff to enjoy.          Addendum:  Staff loved the babka.  Picture of product now shows nuts on top, prior listing did not.  5 stars for the babka and 3 stars for the lack of ingredient list. (At least major allergens).
