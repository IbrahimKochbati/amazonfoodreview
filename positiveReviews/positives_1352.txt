This was our first time trying Popchips, but I had heard so many good things about them so I was eager to try them.  We ordered the variety pack to try a few flavors.  My kids gobbled all of them easily but their favorite was the salt and vinegar.  My favorite by far is the BBQ flavor.  We love popchips here!!!
