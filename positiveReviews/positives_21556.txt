As the title states, the main fault with this oatmeal is the artificial maple flavor. It's slight, but leaves an odd taste in my mouth. I mean, oatmeal is healthy and good in itself; why add that extra artificial sugar if it detracts from the overall taste of the food? In this case  own sugar would have been enough. Or at least use real maple syrup.          Texture and consistency is up to you, based on how much water you put in and how long you cook it. I put in different amounts of water and I thought the oatmeal tasted best with more water. My guess is that the water diluted the strong sugary taste so that it was more palatable to me. I still give this product 4 stars, because most flavored instant oatmeal have this issue of using artificial ingredients that affect the taste.          Ultimately, after trying different kinds of flavored instant oatmeal from various companies, I think I enjoy plain oatmeal with dried or fresh berries the most. Healthy and good, what more can you ask?
