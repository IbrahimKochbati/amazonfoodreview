We use Cavender's Salt Free All Purpose Greek Seasoning for almost any food   from fried green tomatoes to cantaloupe.  We no longer are able to find the salt free (blue label) in the stores   only on the internet.  The yellow labeled product in supermarkets contains salt and is far less tasty.  I usually become very thirsty when eating food containing MSG, but this product doesn't have that effect on me.
