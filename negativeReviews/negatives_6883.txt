This is a pretty good tea but pales in comparison to the vanilla Chai. Since they do not carry this at my local supermarkets I went with the high marks it got on Amazon reviews. I would much rather have purchased 120 packets of the vanilla chai.          Of the Bigalow teas I have tried I would rank them as follows:     1. Vanilla Chai     2. Cinnimon stick     3. Vanilla Caramel     4. Earl grey     5. Green Tea with lemon     6. Pumpkin spice (doesn't taste or smell anything like pumpkin pie)
