These arrived in the middle of May and they have an expiration date of the first week of July. This means I have to eat a lot of these in the next few weeks! Just beware if you're planning on stocking up for the future...the future will get here very soon with these!          It's also interesting that the box inside the Amazon box says "For internal use only". I'm not sure what that's about!
