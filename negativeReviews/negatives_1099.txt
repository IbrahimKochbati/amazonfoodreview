I had to pick up a grocery store  and after running out of our regular Innova dog food. I fed this to my 160lb dog for a week and could not believe the amount of waste this  and produced! He was going up to 10 times a day! Unbelievable! This just goes to show how much filler is in this food. Would never recommend.
