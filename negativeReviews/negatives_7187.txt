Of course it's not like Hidden Valley regular ranch but you can use it as a dip for veggies. I tried using it as a spread on a ham wrap and it was too much for one wrap. Too salty for me but then I use Mrs Dash a lot so I guess I'm kind of sensitive with salt. It's nice though that it doesn't need to be refrigerated so you can take it with you. I thought the taste was okay and the texture thin, not watery, but just thin.          Take care all
