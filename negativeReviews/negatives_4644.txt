Got what looked like a nice size bonsai and well.. If its four years old.. then its the smallest bonsai I have ever seen ..It must have only grown.. a quarter inch a year..Its like a little twig in a pot ..but suppose its ok..We will see.. Anyway got it in the mail..usps .. and its here..Its nice if you like little itty bitty plants.. but I suppose I was expecting something bigger.
