This product is very cute   I have it in the tan color and the cat graphic is nice. However, it does not cover enough square footage. The narrow end is particularly troublesome. However, it is durable   mine has lasted for two years. Yet because of the mess that inevitably winds up near the mat but not on the mat (because the mat is too small), I will be replacing this item.          Additionally, if you are neat freak, you probably won't like this item because certain de is can become tightly lodged in the prongs of this mat   you can clean it with a power hose outdoors, but that will be a pain to do every few days. Just a paper towel and or a dust pan are not sufficient to thoroughly clean this item.
