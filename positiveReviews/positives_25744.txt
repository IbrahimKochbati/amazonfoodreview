...But these are pretty good! I generally steer clear of Oatmeal and Nuts in my Cookies (Give me a good old Chocolate Chip Cookie any day!), but these have a very nice Chocolate Chip taste, the Oatmeal taste is there, but it's not overpowering, and the Almonds didn't bother me very much. My only real complaint is in the packaging: The large box only contains 6 moderately sized Cookies, which are individually wrapped. The individual wrapping is good if you want to take a Cookie or two on the road with you, but when I saw the box my first thought was "With a box that size, I'd expect more than six Cookies."
