I was initially attracted to the Rishi Tea because it is certified Organic   I choose organic whenever possible.  I am already a big fan of Earl Grey teas, and this one did not disappoint.  It is very full flavored, with a lovely note of bergamot, as one would expect from the best Earl Grey blends.  Enjoy it hot or cold, and do try it without sugar or honey first   it really doesn't need it.  I recommend this product!
