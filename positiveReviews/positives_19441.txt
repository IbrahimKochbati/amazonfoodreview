I have a friend  ought me a pack from Jordan. It is a wonderful coffee, rich taste of Arabia, with ground cardamon. you've got to try it. it is very easy to prepare, just read the instruction written on the pack. I was searching Amazon to see if they have it and I am planning to get another one in future (isA).
