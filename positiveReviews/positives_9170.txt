These are great crackers. They have a great crunch when you bite into them,and they are loaded with a wonderful toasted sesame flavor. My husband has diabetes and we went out looking for snacks for him to eat. These have no trans fat and 17 crackers is one serving.If you need to watch your intake of fat and calories for whatever reason you know how hard it is to find snacks that are satisfying and these are just great...
