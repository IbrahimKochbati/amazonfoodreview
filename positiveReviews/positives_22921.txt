Remember those spearmint green leaf candies?  That's the smell that hit me when I opened the sealed individually wrapped envelope at the Hilltop restaurant in Ephrata, PA.  I saved the envelope so I wouldn't forget to write the review.  I can still smell the spearmint the next day.  If you like mint tea, this is a good one.  Bigelow is one of my favorite teas anyway. (Bigelow, Twinings, Stash, Tsao).  I have been a big time tea drinker since I was a little one.          There is a nice hefty taste of spearmint in this tea and it is a full bodied tea  most enjoyable.          I like a variety of good quality teas and flavored teas.  I find them probably as enjoyable as many people find a special ale or a special wine.
