Our 6 month old loves this product. My only issue, is that our daughter has struggled with constipation, even with  east milk. The  own rice causes more of this issue. Our doctor recommended we use oatmeal instead, wish I would have bought the case of oatmeal instead. So if your child has these issues, I would recommend ordering the oatmeal. We have been missing a little bit of pureed prune to overcome the constipation and it works like a charm! We will now buy one can of the oatmeal to try and if she likes it, will order another case!
