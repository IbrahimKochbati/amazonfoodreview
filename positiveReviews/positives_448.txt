I've found a new taste treat. I'm not a big one for potato chips, so I am sure I've come late to discover these. I think they are really good.  The processing & ingredients list is actually pretty good no trans fats, etc. So, if you want an indulgence, these are A+ !  They are thicker & more tasty than the mass produced potato chips we've all come to know.  They are much more flavorful.  Never had a honey dijon potato chip before. Incredibly good & a flavorful combination of sweet, tangy, salty. Also not overly hot or spicy. Excellent!          If you want a snack, have something REALLY good. It's got to be worth the calories and these are!
