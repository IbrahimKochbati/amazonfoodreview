I buy these for my nine year old Chihuahua. He has bad knees, hips, and back. He also has lost the majority of his teeth due to former owners who neglected his dental health. He loves these and they seem to help him a lot. When I pull out the bag, he starts doing his tricks hoping I'll give him one just for doing them! He can eat them easily even without the majority of his teeth, although I do  eak them into smaller pieces since he is only about 5 pounds.     These treats seem to have really improved his mobility and stamina. He skips less(to get his kneecap back in place), bunny hops less(because his hips hurt him), and jumps on the bed without any help(he used to stand on the top of his pet stairs and wait for me to pick him up). He's always had tons of energy, but now his body can keep up with him better.
