Just tried these last night (Folgers K cups Lively Columbian), and they are great!  I was looking at trying something new for my Keurig, and this was well worth it   this is delicious.  I did purchase these elsewhere   I agree with other reviewers, the price is way too high. I can get these much cheaper locally.
