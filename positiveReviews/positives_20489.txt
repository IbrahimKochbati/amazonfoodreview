Unlike other versions I have tried, this is actual goji berries covered in chocolate (as opposed to goji juice or a combination of juices covered in chocolate), so they could be considered a "healthier" treat option. The sweetness of the chocolate really compliments (and somewhat overrides) the bitter sweetness of the fruit. If you've tried goji berries before and found they were too bitter for your taste, I would suggest trying them again covered in dark chocolate. Yum!
