It was neither fresh nor tasty.  Perhaps if they wrapped it in an airtight container it could change my opinion but by the time I got it it tasted as if it been lying around gathering dust.  The flavors of the tea didnt matter because they were overshadowed by the other factors. Had high hopes but had to toss it all out.
