I recently purchased a giant bag of these at Costco after they had samples out to try. I was blown away at how good they were and bought two bags. I don't live close to Costco and now wish I bought more when I was up there. You have to try these chips they are so good. They are not too salty and they are very crispy. They are a little corny as well as a little grainy and naturally slightly sweet. Very best chips I've had, great with guacamole and hummus or just plain. They are worth my 3 hour drive to Costco!!!
