I first purchased these crackers because they have no soy in them.  My daughter is allergic to soy, and soy free crackers are very hard to find.  I bought them, and to my amazement, my picky husband also loves them!  He prefers them to all other similar crackers.  I purchased a large number of boxes (which I keep hidden) as they tend to disappear rather quickly.
