After receiving this coffee I made a few cups.  It was fairly smooth, not too overpowering, and had a slight mocha aroma.  It's OK coffee.  I likely will not purchase this one again because there are so many better ones.  To gauge my review for others, my favorites are Coffee People Donut Shop, Green Mountain Dark Magic, Coffee People Organic Bold, Emeril's Big Easy Bold, and Tully's Kona Blend.
