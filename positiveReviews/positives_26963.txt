This is the best jeky I've had. It's so good that I've setup an automatic shipment every two months. I ran into this product in Barstow, CA at a T A stop. I decided to give it a try since the clerk stated that it was the best jerky she had ever tasted. She was right, it was excellent and made for a delicious snack enroute to Las Vegas. The jerky isn't hard, but not really soft either. Just a nice balance of texture. The heat comes on slow and takes a few pieces to really be felt, but the sweetness of the jerky is just right, so TASTY! Give this jerky a try, it's wonderful that these come in 1lb bags. Anything smaller and I think I would end up eating a bag a day.
