I really enjoy all the flavors of Newman's Own Mints, and I thought I would try the rolls for a change.  Yes, the rolls are less expensive, but they do not have the same consistency or mouth feel as the mints of the same flavor that are sold in tins.  Also, the mints in tins do seem to last longer, so I wonder if these rolls (though convenient) are even a better bargain.  I would not purchase these again; rather, I will spring for a few extra dollars and continue to purchase the Newman's Own Mints in tins.
