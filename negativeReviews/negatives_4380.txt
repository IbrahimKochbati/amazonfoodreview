This coffee is fair, but it seems like a waste of money and the machine.  In my opinion if you're wasting your Dolce Gusto if this is all you use it for.  I'd prefer to make a regular pot of coffee but it is easy to make.  Cost wise your looking at 50+ cents a cup not to mention the machine cost.  I won't be ordering any more, I'll stick with the Cappuccino.
