Okay, I'll admit it: I'm a coffee addict. Lately my hubby and I have been  ewing Starbucks coffee, with varying success (I'm not a big fan of Breakfast Blend), so I looked forward to trying a new and different  and.  We've now drunk our way through most of a bag of the Melitta, and I am happy to report that our impressions are highly favorable. The most important thing to know about this coffee is that it is decidedly on the mild side; although the bag specified "medium roast," it was much milder and smoother than I was used to tasting with a medium roast blend. But that's okay, as I much prefer a milder coffee to anything with bitter overtones, which I often find in other  ands of coffee labeled medium or bold.          To cap things off, the Melitta coffee is noticeably cheaper than Starbucks.  Hmmm.... I may just switch coffee loyalties.
