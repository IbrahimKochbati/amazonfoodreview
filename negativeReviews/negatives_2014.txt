I bought this coffee because several people who also liked my favorite (Jet Fuel or Emeril's Big Intense Bold) liked this one. Typically Sumatra is one of my favorite coffees as well.          I am wondering if they made a bad batch or gave it the wrong label.     It is **NOT** bold.  It is extremely mild and smoky tasting.  Not a single member of my family liked it and that's very unusual.          I'm going to contact the company to see if they'll exchange it or refund me.  It is THAT bad.
