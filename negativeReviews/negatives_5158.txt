I have a 5 month old Australian shepherd and she could not get the treats out  we couldn't either. What we finally ended up doing was boring a hole at the bottom; luckily my husband had the tools to make a smooth hole big enough for her kibbles. It now works very well as a treat dispenser, but my dog doesn't really play with it like a toy.
