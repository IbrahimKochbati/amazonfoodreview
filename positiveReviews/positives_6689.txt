Agar is basically gelatin for vegans, (or vegetarians.) Regular gelatin is usually animal based, and is made from leftover body parts of animals that would otherwise be thrown away. Sound appetizing? Agar is a cruelty free alternative, and is a great aid anytime a thickened creamy base is required, usually in baking. I use this for many cream pies as well as other desserts.
