My two boxes absolutely LOVE these freeze dried liver treats; it is one of their favorites.  Both dogs do their kidney bean dances in the kitchen when we take the lid off.  The only bad thing is the treats are small and they only recommend a few daily.  (But, I guess that's not too much of a bad thing given these are a little pricer than the average dog treat)
