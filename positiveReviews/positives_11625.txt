I am by nature frugal.. some may even say cheap. I pondered on this purchase for some time before ordering it. Although the jug seemed small when it arrived, it is full near to the rim and contains a full 32 oz of high quality, organic syrup. It's taste is excellent.. full flavored and sweet (no it isn't going to help your glycemic index.. haha.. but look at it this way.. you get more taste for less syrup so maybe you can rationalize some sugar)          My only complaint is with the jar opening.. it has a very large hole and the "snap down" cap will not prevent leakage should you upset it..  It also has a tendency to drip and to get syrup on the outside of the cap when poured. This complaint is minor.          The price is not unreasonable IMO when compared to other sources.. and with free shipping that is just one more plus...  this amount of syrup will last a very long time for me.. and it doesn't spoil :D          I don't use it for a regular item like morning pancakes, etc but instead use it as a special touch on those occasions when I think "the real thing" is needed.          I perhaps should not say so, thereby revealing myself as uncouth or a Philistine, but truthfully I enjoy plain old "Log Cabin" which does have maple syrup as a component of its flavor (#6 on the ingredients. hahah). I reserve the real thing mostly for company.
