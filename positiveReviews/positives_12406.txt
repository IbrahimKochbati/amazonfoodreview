I was in a local grocery store that has a lot of items imported from England when I saw cans of Heinz Spotted Dick Pudding. Well, I'd heard of it. Hasn't everyone? The name sounds more like a medical condition than a type of foodstuff and it must lend itself to a certain middle school level humor, not necessarily limited to those of that particular age. In any case, I had about a half can (too much) after lunch. I heated it up in the microwave and, after heating, coated it with a veneer of Devon custard. The combination was quite good. It's much too high in calories (from fats and sugars), of course, so I'll have to watch my consumption. However, it was an interesting treat and now when I hear the snickers, I'll understand a bit better.          Gary Peterson
