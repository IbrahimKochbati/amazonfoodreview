I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.          The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light  own. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea   it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!
