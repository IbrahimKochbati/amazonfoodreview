These are really tasty little snack sticks.  Really beats other  ands I have tried:  Good amount of spices, nice "snap" from the casing when you bite into one and no nasty greasy aftertaste as at least one  and I have tried has. (See my other reviews for that.)          The only reason I withheld one star is Amazon's misleading picture.  This is a *bulk pack" item meant for wholesale use.  The snack sticks come 36 (or so) to a large plastic non resealable bag, NOT individually packed as illustrated.          This was pointed out by other reviewers but Amazon has not updated the picture, so be aware you'll need some food storage bags or a nice tall jar with a tight fitting lid.  (Sticks are about 7" or so long and maybe half an inch thick.          Other than that, this is a fine snack at a much better price than you pay buying them one at a time at the "Grab n Gulp", just don't expect to hand them out for Halloween or use them as stocking stuffers (unless you *like* greasy stockings...but that's your affair.)
