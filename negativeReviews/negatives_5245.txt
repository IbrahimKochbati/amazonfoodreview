This item is listed and is identified as BLACKBERRY tea, although the image is clearly a box of BLUEBERRY tea.          When I pointed out this conflicting data, AMAZON advised that they didn't see a problem.     Now I don't know about you, but I want to KNOW if I would receive blackberry or blueberry tea.  They are not the same thing.          Sometimes Amazon's stupidity simply amazes me.
