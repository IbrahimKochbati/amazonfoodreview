***     The Switch claims to be an alternative to unhealthy sodas, and it is that  it is much healthy than most of the commercial versions out there. It does provide 100% of the day's vitamin C and does contain only fruit juice concentrates, no added sugars, no corn syrup, no preservatives, no artificial colors, and no gluten.          However...it is cloyingly sweet  a great taste of kiwi and strawberries  but way too sweet for me. The Switch also provides a huge sugar hit via the fructose in the highly concentrated juices and has 135 calories in only 8.3 fluid ounces. Of 34 grams of carbohydrates, 33 are from sugar.          I don't carbo load, so it doesn't really appeal to me at all. I'd rather eat the real fruit and get the fiber and other ingredients, or else have a less sweet drink. I tried using it as a concentrate and mixing 1 part soda to 3 parts water, which made it drinkable for me; although this worked well, I'd still probably stick with other beverages.          Recommended, only if you want to ease your way off of unhealthy sodas and like very sweet drinks.     ***
