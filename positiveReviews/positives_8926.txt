I simply love this ghee!  I feel good knowing that it is giving me nutritous vitamins and CLA while tasting great.  I use it on my pop corn, and also have just used it in other cooking.  The back label also says that it does not have casein and lactose in it, which many people have allergies to, which i try to avoid.  Thanks again, great yummy product!
