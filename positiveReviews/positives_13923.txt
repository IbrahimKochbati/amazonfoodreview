Bought this for adding flavor, substance, and protein to lunch shakes, and it works just great!  Peanut butter taste, without the fat.  It dissolves easily and is not overpowering.  I can't wait to take it backpacking for peanut butter at lunch, peanut sauce with noodles at night, etc, all in a lightweight, convenient, low fat package.
