Since we've had a keurig, we've gone through many varieties of kcup coffees including flavored and non flavored.  Every kcup seemed to be either weak, bitter, or just ordinary.  I feel like I found MY FAVORITE with this one. It's strong, flavorful, and smooth. The most popular coffee among keurig users seems to be the donut shop coffee. I tried this one and was among the few that thought it tasted bitter and burnt. I thought if so many like this and I don't, I will never find that coffee shop house blend.  I'm so glad I found "my donut shop coffee" :) Give Newmans Special Blend a chance, this will be my staple from now on. (Get it at Costco or SAMs for $33).
