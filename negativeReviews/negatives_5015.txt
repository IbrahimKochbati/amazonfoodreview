I ordered the medium, which is actually a medium large and it is too big for my Scottie.  I found after receiving this from Amazon that Petco suggests the small size for dogs the size of beagles, cockers, and shelties. I think  Scotties would fit in that category.  He doesn't show much interest in the toy even with treats in it.  I'll get the small and see if that makes a difference.
