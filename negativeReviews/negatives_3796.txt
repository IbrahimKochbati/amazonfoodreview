Of course, I like this cereal, it's like frosted cheerios with marshmallows, but I wanted to review the internet buying option. Most food products, especially candy, is a rip off from most Amazon sellers. However, the cereal is usually cheap. I think the 11.5oz was about $2.60 at Wal Mart, but I paid  only $6.86 for the 1 package of 3 boxes here on Amazon, so that is about $2.29 for each box. That was a good deal, but now the page says $15 for 3 boxes, which is $5 a box. That is a rip for the 11.5oz box; you can get a 16oz box for only about $3.00 at Wal Mart. So you have to watch the prices to see if it's cheaper or not.          I was worried about the cereal not being fresh, but it is. My Lucky Charms were the new ones with the new marshmallows in them; currently it's the different colors of shooting stars. My boxes from Amazon have the same expiration date as the Frosted Flakes I bought at Wal Mart, so that's a good thing. They taste good too (just in case there is other problems that could be wrong with them).          So overall, check the prices to see if it is worth it, the prices change both in the store and online, alot (mostly they change online, though). I bought from here like a month ago, but wouldn't buy them this second, probably would, again, in the future, though.
