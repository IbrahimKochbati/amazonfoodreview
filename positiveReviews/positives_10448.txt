My 9 month old 45 lb pit bull is an avid chewer who has and will eat just about anything he can find, including my hard wood floors.. while picking up bird food I grabbed one of these relieved that at least when he devoured it he wasn't eating chunks of plastic and hence wouldn't get mad when I had to take it away and throw it in the trash.  I came home, read a magazine, he sat quietly on the sofa beside me happily chewing and by the time I had finished my magazine he had finished his bone.  While certainly not a long lasting chew it is something I'd pick up again when I get bird food since I know he enjoys it.  I used to buy the stuffed regular bones but then I'd end up with him wanting to play fetch with the empty bone and would end up throwing it away so at least I know this isn't something that months later i'm stepping on getting out of bed.
