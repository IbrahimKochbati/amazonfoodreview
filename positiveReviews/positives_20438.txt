If a marmalade can be elegant and sophisticated then MacKay's Orange Marmalade Preserves with Champagne meets those requirements. The delicate orange peel lingers mercilessly in cane sugar, lemon juice and Champagne, living only for the moment you spread this marmalade on toast or scones.          This is a superior marmalade and well worth ordering. It may be necessary to order four at a time because this is now a  eakfast favorite and my husband keeps insisting that I share.          ~The Rebecca Review
