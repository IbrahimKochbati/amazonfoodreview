The maple and  own sugar combination seems about the right balance for the two but the amount overall covers the oat flavor.  Perhaps it is my personal preference for very little sugar but overall I was disappointed.  With many flavors of instant oats, the Quaker oats are far superior to the competition.  I am not able to detect a great difference in this flavor from many of the cheap store  and varieties I have tried.  It is acceptable for an occasional variety in  eakfast but nothing that sets it apart from others.
