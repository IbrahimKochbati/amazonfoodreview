I bought this for my daughter and she loved it. She is a huge fan of Japan and their wonderful culture. Even though she loves real sushi, she begged me to get this for her, because it's so cute and the reviews were great. This is the first of the Popin' sets I have ordered. I'm planning to try the bento one next.          It's a bit smaller than what I thought it would be, but not dissapointing at all. It's very easy and fun to make, and pretty much all of the jelly like food is grape flavor but it's not to strong and it's sweet, some is sour but not very, I hate sour stuff but I could easily eat this, so no worries. The best part I think, was making the salmon roe eggs with the water dropper. It shipped to me in about a week, getting here just one day after it said it would. If you are looking into buying this, I say you should it's a wonderful gift or activity to do with someone!  D
