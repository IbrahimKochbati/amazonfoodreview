We recently purchased the Great Northern Popcorn machines for our 3 facilities as a way to reward our employees. Now, when we periodically  ing out the popper and let the aromas from this wonderful popcorn move through our halls, the word gets out and in no time at all employees are stopping by for their bag of this wonderful popcorn. We have not received one complaint about the popcorn yet. It is fresh, seasoned just right and is a winner as an employee satisfaction booster!!
