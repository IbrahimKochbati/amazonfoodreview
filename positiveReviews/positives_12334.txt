My loveable Shiz Tzu Chanel, has always been a good eater, but she was having trouble keeping many of the BETTER (no supermarket crap) dry dog foods down. After exhaustive research and a few costly vet trips, we discovered that she is allergic to chicken....  I switched to Eukanuba lamb and rice and she did better, but still had occasional vomiting issues...  Then one day I saw an add for Blue online, and my world changed almost overnight...  She loves the taste, (including the little life source bits) her coat is shinier, and my carpets are clean and odor free for the first time in a LONG LONG time.....          Thanks Blue, we love you, so does Chanel
