I bought these last month as part of an Amazon promotion   buy 5 items get %40 percent off.  I had never heard of this product, but have a soft spot in my belly for the snacks I grew up on as a kid.  These things turned out way better than expected.  They are essentially pork rinds from your typical supermarket, but they are fresh   still crackling and popping after you open the bag.  I'm addicted to these now and have had to ratio them out so I don't eat them every night.  They're THAT good.
