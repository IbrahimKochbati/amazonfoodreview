I was researching the miracle berry protein miraculin for a research proposal, so I decided to give these tablets a try. The effect was immediate, and lasted approximately 20 min for me and my coworkers. Everyone was completely in love with the lemons, and those who normally enjoy the flavor of lime went nuts over them as well. For some the effect was actually too sweet, and they gave up after a few foods. Other foods beverages tested were blackberries and raspberries (lost their tartness), red wine vinegar (sweet on the tongue, but not so great in the throat) and Corona (loses bitterness and is sweet if you squeeze some lime into it). It certainly is not cost effective as a diet aid, but it's a great parlor trick to share when you are entertaining.
