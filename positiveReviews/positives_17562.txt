As soon as I received this product, I opened it and prepared myself for a relaxing, fine cup of coffee. I was not disappointed! I am a regular coffee drinker in spite of the occasional heartburn experienced. There were no such effects from this coffee. PLUS, I enjoyed the full flavor of the dark French Roast.          Highly recommended for those who enjoy getting their caffeine from coffee. For those who discontinued drinking coffee because of the ill effects there may be, try this and you will probably be able to once again a relaxing cup of java.
