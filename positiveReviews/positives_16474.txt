Every evening, about the same time, our two dogs know when it is time for their Greenie treat. They will both come and sit in front of us and patiently wait for us to get their treat. If we are busy and ignore them they will give a soft cry to get our attention. Each one only gets one a day, but other than walks, petting and their dinner, the Greenie is a highlight of their day.
