So if you have ever bought Bertie Bots you know you get almost nothing for the price.  But I love these flavors so much that I kept searching until I stumbled onto Weasley Wizard Beans and I was VERY happy I did.          Like the other reviewer it is quite fun to leave these out for kids and see the expression on their face when they get a gross flavor, but actually some strange ones are actually good, like grass and soap if you ask me.
