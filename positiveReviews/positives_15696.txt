We have two cats and they are picky with their "crunchy" food and seem to like most "soft" cat food. They both liked this soft food and didn't have any issues with it. Sometimes they've not liked some of the soft food and cat vomit is not fun to clean up.          The cats heard me opening up the food and would bolt into the kitchen and lick their bowls clean. That is a five claw rating.
