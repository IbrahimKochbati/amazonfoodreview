I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't tried it, but it's exactly like Movie Theatre popcorn! Delicious!  I have a 4 quart Whirley Pop stove top popper and the four ounce size size was just right.  It filled completely up and all of it popped.  And I noticed that there was very few husks.  Obviously, there's popcorn, and then there's popcorn!  Although some will probably complain because you have to cut the top off the package and squeeze to get the semi solidified coconut oil out, it was no problem for me.  And certainly worth it!
