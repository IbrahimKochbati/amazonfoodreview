I bought Stonewall Kitchen Chocolate Chip Pancake & Mix.          A person, who was visiting while moving from his residence to another, left us his Toastmaster Waffle Maker.          I bought Krusteaz pancake & waffle mix at a convenience market, But Stonewall Kitchens Chocolate Chip Pancake & Waffle Mix is much more fun to use.          Waffle production on this electronic wonder held much in store for us, as my partner and I cranked out one waffle after another.          I had the tendency to remove the waffles before they reached "waffle texture". They often were very moist. Now, I have learned to cook the waffles until they crisp on the outsides.          The chocolate chips, that are smaller then the baking variety of chocolate chips, completely melted. They do sink to the bottom of the mixture.    "
