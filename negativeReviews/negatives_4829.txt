It seems alot of items on Amazon get undeserved glowing reviews.  I tried these (original and chocolate) because of the reviews but they're nothing special. I'm sure I'll end up throwing them away when they go stale.  This has happened to me before so I wonder if Amazon pays people to write reviews?
