I found a box of this stuff at a store while on vacation. Thought that it would be interesting to try since it was powdered and didn't require any  ewing. Simply pour into a glass and add water. Could it really be that good if so simple?          A resounding YES. I was very surprised. I've been drinking green tea for awhile, so I can see where some may not like the taste at first. But as you continue it grows on you quickly. I tend to like my tea on the stronger side, so the next glass may use 2 packets instead of 1 and slightly more water. Other avid tea drinkers may consider the same.          Overall, a great product. Can't wait to try it in a milkshake. :D
