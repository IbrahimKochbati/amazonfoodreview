If you are concerned with an aluminum free product, then this is the product for you.  Too bad that baking SODA does not in any form contain aluminum.  This is, however a concern for baking POWDER which can, depending on manufacturer, contain aluminum.  Save your hard earned money and buy Bob's Red Mill regular baking soda.  Arm & Hammer is great for general cleaning purposes, but for natural beauty and health care, this  and is perfect.          Just thought you'd all like to know. I almost fell for it myself until I did a little digging around. :)          P.S  So as not to let all of amazon.com land feel I am one of those "haters who don't really know what they're talking about", I LOVE Bob's Red Mill Co. and shall continue purchasing their excellent products.
