I have made waffles with this mix twice and pancakes once.  The texture is perfect. Because they are whole wheat they are hearty but they are still fluffy.  They are slightly sweet and smell so yummy while your waiting for them to finish................  The next time I order the three pack I'm going to try one of their other products.
