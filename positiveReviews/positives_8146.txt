I remembered these honey candies from when I was a child, and ordered a box.  They were exactly like I remembered  great honey flavor and liquid center.  I shared them with friends and family, and am ordering my second box. I also like them for when I have a cold or allergies and have that throat tickle. This is the hard candy you'll find in my purse!
