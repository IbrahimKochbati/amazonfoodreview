I ordered this collection on 6 9 10 and it arrived on 6 12. Although it was was very well packaged, this did not prevent the USPS from managing to  eak one of the tubes. The seller was contacted by email and a replacement requested. As this was a birthday gift and the occasion was only a week away, I offered to pay for expedited shipping. Seller responded immediately stating that a replacement would be shipped ASAP. The replacement tube arrived three days later in good shape. My offer to pay additional shipping charges was declined. In summary, this product is excellent and the customer service absolutely first rate. I highly recommend both the product and the seller.
