I try to drink this every day due to the many benefits and antioxidents you receive from it. I've always liked this  and, and my health food store no longer carries it. Yes, it leaves a little sediment in the bottom of my cup, but I just think that I need to find a better strainer. I wish it came in a a slightly lower price.
