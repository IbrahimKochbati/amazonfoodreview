NOW has a policy to use Non GMO'd products when possible BUT they can't guarantee that this product is produced from NON GMO corn.  With their low prices and the majority of corn produced in the US is GMO'd, I have to assume it's a GMO'd product.  Isn't that just great!!!!  And, Amazon has a NO RETURN policy on food items, so I am stuck with it.
