I bought the Tug A Jug for my Yorkie and he loves to push and pull it around the room while it pops treats out. He can spend hours just playing with it. My Golden Retriever even plays with the Tug A Jug. I'd recommend this product to anyone who has a dog that needs a challenge and loves the mental stimulation that this product provides.
