I thought I new what good Maple Syrup tasted like.  I was never too impressed with the  ands we found in our local grocery stores. This is much thicker and has a stronger maple flavor.  One reviewer said it has more minerals than grade A.  That could account for the more complex flavor.  Perhaps it is because it is organic.  I am sold on this  and.  I was hesitant to buy online because of reviewers saying the caps cracked causing leaks. Since it now comes with Frustration free packaging I do not have to worry about that anymore.  I am a believer!
