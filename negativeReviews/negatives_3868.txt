This is a tasty drink with pale pink purplishcolor. With its carbonation one could call it a drink with bite. For me the taste was good but not outstanding. The aromatic bouquet of Switch is fabulous, but the actual taste, unfortunately, doesn't measure up to that mesmerizing scent.          The can's diminutive size lends itself to a quick refresher, not a slake for a heavy duty thirst. It's a good size for a pocket, lunch bag, or purse.
