Great alternative to soda and aspartame spenda sweetened drinks.  This has really helped me dramatically cut back on my diet soda intake.  This uses all natural color, flavor and sweeteners and is plenty sweet.  At 30 calories per 16 oz, it is still relatively low calorie.  I usually mix a packet with 24 oz and it is sweet enough for me.
