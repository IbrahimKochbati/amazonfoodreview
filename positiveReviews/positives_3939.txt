I am so excited about this product.  I have made Paula Dean's Apple Cake (half of the glaze), pancakes, Thanksgiving dressing, muffins and corn ead using this gf baking mix in place of the plain flour, salt and baking powder.  They were excellent.  My non gf family enjoyed them tremendously.  The finished products were not gravely or grainy. The taste was great.          If you have never tried this, test it out in the much smaller size.  It is wonderful.
