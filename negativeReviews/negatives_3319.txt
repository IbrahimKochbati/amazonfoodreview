This review is based on my impression of the Newman's dog treats, and the reaction of my two dogs. The variables:          1) I have two Lhasapoos (mixed  eed), almost 13 yrs old, with healthy teeth.     2) One is 13 lbs & one is 11 lbs, comparable in size to a large (not fat) house cat.     3) They are fed dry dog food, which is left in a feeder, so they eat whenever they like    even so, they only eat small amounts.     4) When they are given a "treat," it's not all the time, and they receive either a dog biscuit or a raw hide stick    never people food.          When I opened the bag, the Newman treats didn't smell any differently than their usual dog biscuits, and I was concerned with the large size. I noticed they had an indentation in the middle, but only a few biscuits were easy to  eak in half; most of them were just too hard to snap    and I have strong hands...I can't imagine someone with arthritis being able to  eak one of these in half. The Newman treats are a great size for a bigger  eed, like a golden retriever, for instance.          I put the Newman biscuits in the same canister that I use for other treats, even though the bag is resealable. I wasn't sure if the bag would affect my dogs' reactions to a new treat. By the way, I did read all the ingredients on the bag & it all looked healthy to me. I didn't see a reason why the dogs wouldn't like the treats.          I gave them half a piece each, after their morning potty  eak; they do not eat at night because they sleep in our bedroom with the door closed. They appeared very excited until the pieces were in their mouths, and then both dogs spit the pieces out & stared at me like I just tried to feed them dirt. I told them, "you're not getting anything else for a treat," and walked away; they reluctantly ate the pieces. Over the past week or so, I've given them a whole biscuit every other day. They always eat them, but they don't wolf them down (no pun intended, really) they way they do with their    "
