Just read the previous review which stated that Quaker was using high fructose corn syrup to sweeten the cake.  Maybe this was true at the time they wrote their review but as I have the pack in front of me, the label states "sugar" followed by "fructose" so there is no corn syrup to be found in these tasty snacks.  As someone with a sweet tooth who admittedly loves to snack, these are a godsend!  Definitely give them a try :)
