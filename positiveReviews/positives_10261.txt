I have used this a couple times when making my own baby food and I love it.  It's really easy to freeze food in.  When the baby food is frozen you just run hot water on the back and pop out the food.  It washes up nicely in the dishwasher.  I think the ammount of food that it holds is good too.  I would highly recommend this product.
