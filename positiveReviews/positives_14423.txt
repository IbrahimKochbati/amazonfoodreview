I bought these treats for my 16 year olo husky beagle mix dog. Within two weeks she showed a visible improvement in mobility and seemed to be pain free. She has pretty bad arthritis and these seem to be working very well. The only issue is they are a semi soft treat so they were all pretty  oken and in a big lump in the bag. But other than that they are a great product.
