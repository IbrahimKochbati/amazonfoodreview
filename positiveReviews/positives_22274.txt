...this is the "Finest Quality Everyday Black Tea."          I bought a box at a discount odd lot store (in the US...a box of 100 bags, by the way), because it was cheap. I simply needed some moderately good black tea for the office, and since it was Twinings I assumed it would be more than adequate. But it has been a very pleasant surprise. It is not only good tea, a great bargain for the price. It is, as it claims, of the finest quality. I can't think of a  and or variety of bagged black tea (I'm excluding specialty and flavored varieties, and loose teas) that even comes close to this for flavor. It's the best in the category.          Sadly...I haven't seen it again at that store, and this doesn't seem to be an item that's generally available in the US. For anyone willing to search, the UPC on this box is 70177 24681, and the packaging has a 2007 copyright date. The contact info on the box leads me to believe this might have been originally destined for Australia or New Zealand.
