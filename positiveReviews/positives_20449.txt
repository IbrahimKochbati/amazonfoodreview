I'm glad I bought two bags of this coffee because it turned out to be the coffee I was looking for for that first cup in the morning. It is rich, earthy, honest coffee that just tastes good! Roasting one's own coffee sounds exotic to many people, but people used to home roast their beans all the time before about the 1930s. The aroma of home roasted coffee filling the home is equal to that of a pot of fresh ground coffee  ewing for your  eakfast. I don't know why more people don't do it, and if someone wanted to try, they would love the results with this coffee, never go back to the commercially roasted and roasted variety. Blend with other varieties, and you can create your very own "house coffee". The possibilities are endless.
