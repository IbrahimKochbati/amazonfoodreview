The kiwi berry combination makes this sweet and tart at the same time, with the carbonation adding a nice bit of fizz to keep the concoction light. That being said, this was a bit too sweet for my taste   but may be fine for people looking for the 100% juice experience, or those needing a sugar fix after a workout. Personally I'd mix this with sparkling soda water for a "less is more" effect, with cost savings as an added plus.
