These chews are soo good for your dog's teeth, and most dogs will love them! My 58 lb. Blue Tick Coon Hound would eat them like candy, if we let her! But the limit is usually one per day (in this household).     I also work with a Veterinarian, and he says these are the next best thing to  ushing your dog's teeth every day. Which sounds good tto clean off their teeth.     So if you want to keep your dog's teeth clean, and don't particularly  ush them regularly (I don't and I work with a Vet), these are a great alternative!!o me! He recommends feeding your dog "dinner" or a meal, then giving your dog one of these a little bit afterwards
