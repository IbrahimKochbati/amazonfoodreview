I normally don't choose darker roasts of coffee because I don't like the acid and bitter flavor that is normally associated with them.  This coffee is quite different from a standard dark roast.  It has the smoother flavor of a lighter roast without the acid.          I prepare my coffee in a french press with water at a temperature just below boiling, around 175 degrees fahrenheit.  When I poured in the water, I could smell a sort of a burnt aroma as well as a distinctly licorice aroma.  Undaunted, I finished my preparations and added some creamer and a touch of sweetener.  Upon tasting, I detected notes of chocolate and toasted nuts with a slight licorice finish.  Very smooth.  No bitterness or acid.  The burnt aroma didn't go into the flavor.  It just tasted toasty.          It was a nice change up from my usual coffee.  I usually choose light to medium roasts.  I would like to try some of their other offerings.
