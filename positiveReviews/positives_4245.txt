I Love Basmati rice and to get the Organic is the Best.  This product is great tasting and the aroma was amazing!  The only reason that I won't purchase it again is:  the amount in the package is very little and for as much as I steam rice (for not only my kids and me but our French bulldogs) it is just Not enough for the price you have to pay.  Way too expensive.  So, I go to Vitamin Cottage and get the Ludenburg Organic Brown Basmati rice in a 2 lb bag for 4.45...great deal and great product!
