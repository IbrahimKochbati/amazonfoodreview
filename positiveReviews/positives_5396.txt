These DisposaKups work great.  I simply fill up a dozen or more with my favorite flavored coffee, and I'm good to go.  It's a great alternative to buying the expensive pre filled K cups; not only were the pre filled K cups expensive, but they don't offer my favorite coffee blends.  I was using the reusable K cup filters which are quite expensive to purchase, so I only had 2 & they leaked while  ewing & were messy to empty and wash to re use.  The DisposaKups work much better  just as well as the pre filled K cups, no leaks, no mess!  And I can re use them again if I want by throwing out the filter, rinsing, & using a fresh filter (just have to line up the holes).  Great product! I highly recommend it.  I love my coffee machine again.
