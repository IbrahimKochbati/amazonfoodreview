I am an aficionado of chili. In fact, I cannot remember any chili    canned or otherwise    that I actually despised. This particular product is at the top of my list of favorites. It is so good, I order it by the case from Amazon.com. Still, if you like your chili "hot" (I don't), then skip this one. It does have all the other flavors, however, which appeal to my taste    and to friends with whom I have shared this too guarded secret. C'mon Stagg, turn your advertising department loose! It's hard to find this product in my local markets.
