Out of the 5 flavors I tried with the Dolce Gusto machine, this one is definitely the weak link. I did not enjoy the flavor at all   it sort of tasted like stale coffee that sat out for several hours, but was still hot.          I tried playing a barista and adjusting coffee levels, but it came out bad every time. A very disappointing flavor, and one that I will not use again. Also, I've noticed that these Nescafe Dolce Gusto coffees have a pretty short shelf life, some shorter than others. So stocking up is not an option.
