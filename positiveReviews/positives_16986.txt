My 6 year old puppy LOVES this toy!  She is a crazy Sheppard mix, 60 pounds and full of energy.  I love finding toys that challenge her and keeps her busy for a while without my arm having the toss something every 30 seconds.  At first she didn't know what to think of it and got a little frustrated that she couldn't get to her treats, but after a few times with patience and encouragement from mommy, she turned to a pro!  She plays with it so much and understands to stop tipping it over when all the treats are eaten.  She got a little too good and now I have to dilute her treats with dry dog food.  Best treats for this toy: Zukes Mini Naturals Dog Treats.  Pitfall: I hate the screw on bottom; I can never seem to get it on right so I put all the treats in through the top.  No a big deal for me, but might matter to some.  Bottom line, I'm happy if there is a toy that keeps my crazy puppy entertained.
