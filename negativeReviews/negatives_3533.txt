I tried this as an alternative to Kashi's Honey Almond Flax (Chewy Granola) bars, which I love almost as much as the Roasted Almond Crunch (Crunchy Granola) bars. It's possible I'd like the Tail Mix bars when I'm in the middle of a long, strenuous hike, but it could be months before I test that hypothesis. Simply put, I don't have much of a sweet tooth, and these are overly sweet for me as a mid afternoon snack at the office.          However, after trying this and that without much satisfaction, I've found a solution that will help me get through all these bars rather than having to ship them back. I bought some Uncrystallized Candied Ginger at Trader Joe's, and the heat of the ginger  plus a few almonds  is a perfect foil. (For those of you wondering, the sweetness is from dried cranberries and raisins.)
