This has more calories than a regular coke. Even though it says 100% pure juice and no sugar syrup added, it still tastes so sweet that I couldn't even finish one can.          If this weren't so sugary tasting, I'd like it much more. Flavor wise it's not bad, though. Maybe it's only fruit sugar and supposedly fruit sugar isn't as bad for the health, but still... way too sweet for something that's supposed to be "healthy."          Maybe little kids would like it as a treat. Probably beats having candy.
