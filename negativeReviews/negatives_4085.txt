I purchase a bag of the blueberry & apple tiny fruits today excited to discover and try a new product that fits my believes (healthy, organic, no additives, working with local communities, etc). I am so glad that I tried the fruits prior to inviting my 9 month old child to eat them. The blueberries that first came into my mouth where hard as rock and did NOT dissolve. A total choking hazard.
