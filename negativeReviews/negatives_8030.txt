Please understand, that when I take the time and write a review, I am very truthful and sincere.  I am not in a contest to see how many reviews that I can     write.  However,  I am trying to help the people not to waste their money on a product.  This peppered beef jerky, is without a shadow, the nastiest jerky     that I have ever tasted.  I know about jerky.  I make jerky myself sometimes.  This jerky is like chewing on a piece of "Fat Back", you have to wipe     the grease off your chin and hands after trying to eat it. I don't believe that is 97% fat free.  You can wring the grease out of it.  These comments     that I am making are concerning the package that I received.  Other people who commented highly on this product, must have received a much different     product than I received or has never eaten any real beef jerky.          The package was made in the U.S is all the information that I can find concerning the product. Doesn't say where the beef is from or any info of this     nature.  I will not eat this beef jerky, it is sickening.  Take heed people, if you want and like jerky, DO NOT buy whatever this stuff is............
