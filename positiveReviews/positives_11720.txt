They're called "Whenever bars", but one would probably do best to reserve these for dessert. With that being said, these delicious little treats are packaged individually and are portable enough to go anywhere. And so, in that sense, they can be eaten "whenever". They are also advertised as gluten free and wheat free, as well as having 0 grams of trans fats.  But these bars are by no means going to make it into The Evolution Diet. They are by any standard artificially extreme foods. They are artificially extreme, and, at the same time, extremely delicious. Just run off the extra fat tomorrow, and you'll be all right.
