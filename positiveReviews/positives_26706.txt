I love Coleman's Mustard.  It adds a hearty kick to sauces and marinades and can double for Chinese mustard. What's not to love?  I don't put it in everything, but I do use it enough that those tiny and expensive grocery store tins aren't practical.  I was delighted to see that Amazon had larger tins.          Since it has been a while since I've purchased Coleman's in any size, I was totally unprepared for the size of these containers.  They're HUGE!  This is not a complaint, but I figure three tins will last me about ten years, and I can make table lamps out of the empties.  They're fairly well packed and all three tins seemed to be sealed, but there was a substantial amount of spicy yellow dust inside the package and one tin was dented.  Some leakage and a dent are not deal  eakers by any means.          As far as the product itself goes, if you have a taste for spicy foods, Coleman's mustard is the bomb!  It will clear your sinuses and  ing tears to your eyes.  If you mix up a quantity ahead of time, it will mellow in the fridge, but then what's the point?  I use a ramekin to make up just enough to serve with ham, corned beef or pastrami and pass it around with the appropriate warning. Love this stuff!
