The mixture of juices they use to sweeten this give it a little bit of an odd taste and makes it too sweet.  It's not a straight orange citrus flavor.  Not being an apple juice fan I wasn't fond of it.          I gave it four stars b c it is what it advertises   it's juice with sparkling water, unlike some other "healthy" sparkling beverages that are basically soda.          For sparkling juice I prefer IZZE   it's a little less sweet.
