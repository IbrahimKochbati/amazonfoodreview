I used this pouch last night. I had a package of 4 boneless pork loin slices, about 3 4 of an inch thick. It gave me a generous coat. I then baked them for 25 minutes and they came out nice and crispy. These were very moist as well. I will be using the Shake and Bake for Pork again, I love lean pork, and this ensures that it comes out perfectly done but still moist and flavorful.
