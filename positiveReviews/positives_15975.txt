I have had this on subscribe and save for about 10 months and generally like it. It is a lighter roast (northern italian) with a pretty strong acid bite. This  ews a good shot with a good machine and grinder with no problems and has a mellow rounded flavor.  I am switching over to a little darker roast right now that I tried from amazon a couple of months ago (cafe Altura Peruvian Dark Roast)but if you like a lighter roast this is a good bet.
