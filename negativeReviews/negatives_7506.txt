I just didn't like this flavor.          I have found that the coffee from Donut Shop tends to actually be quite fresh for a pre ground product.  I have no complaints there.  However, this is my first chocolate offering from Donut Shop, and it really has an unrefined, pure cocoa flavor.  That might be just the ticket for a lot of conisseurs, but I'm not much of a chocolate fan.  And to me, the pure cocoa added a really bitter bite to anotherwise smooth coffee.
