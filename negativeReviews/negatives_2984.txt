We love the Merrick lines of food to mix in with the Nature's Variety dried kibble.  Our dogs simply turn their noses up at this food and will not touch it.  They aren't normally fussy eaters.  I have one who will eat whatever you put in front of him, but not this.  We'll stick to Wing A Lings, Turducken and Smothered Comfort.
