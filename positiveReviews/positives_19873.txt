I love Mince pie made with Nonesuch  and mincemeat but it has to be the condensed kind. This year mur local stores did not carry the condensed packaged type and I do not like the jars as I find them too soupy.     I went on line and found I could purchase it that way. I ordered it, got it very quickly, and now know that if our stores do not carry it again next fall, where I can get more.
