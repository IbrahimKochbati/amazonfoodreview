I was disappointed when I received this dispenser.  It said a large dispenser.  It looks like something for a child to play with.  I bought it for my husband to put in his "man cave".  He is a huge M&M fan.  I buy him a tree ornament each year from the M&M collections.  I was hoping it had more substance to it.  I also did not realize I was unable to return this item.
