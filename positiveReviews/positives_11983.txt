My Husky has always been a little 'picky' when eating her  eakfast and evening meals.  Always needing encouragement, etc.  Well, when I found the Pro Treat Freeze Dried Beef Liver, I started putting 1 2 pieces crumbled and sprinkled over the dried food and wow, she loves it.  Never hesitates anymore about eating her meals.  Try it, they'll love it!  Sandra
