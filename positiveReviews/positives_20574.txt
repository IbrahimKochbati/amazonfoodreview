It's a wonderful product great peppermint taste and very fresh. My son was amazed when he smelled it  ewing this afternoon! "It must really be fresh because it smells a lot more 'pepperminty' than what you buy in the stores, Mom."  He's right   it does! It's also great cold as iced tea   my grandchildren love it. A friend & myself enjoy getting together for hot tea and quiet conversation   this tea is one of our favorites.     I have purchased this tea thru Amazon's "subscribe & save."  I save on the cost of the tea by purchasing it this way; t arrives right on schedule; and with the subscription option, it's delivered right to my front door. I love the convenience of being able to change the amount when I want more boxes or changing the delivery date when I'm going to be away and won't need it that month.  I highly recommend this product!
