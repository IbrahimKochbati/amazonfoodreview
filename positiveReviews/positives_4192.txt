I purchased some of this special habanero sauce this past year for my Super Bowl party. It was a hit! I thought I would try the mild since I like some zing, but didn't want to burn my mouth off. It was a great mix of some spicy zing with a sweet overtone. Went great with chips as a dip, as well as really good with as a dipping sauce with chicken wings.          I am thinking about using this as a glaze as well for an upcoming pork tenderloin. I think this sauce is a great change of pace from the person who is sick of the same tastes that you get from the same stuff in the local grocery stores. Plus it is from a small business.....win win win!          Thanks again Everidae Sauce for a great change of pace!
