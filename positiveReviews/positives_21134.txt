I find the trays are good but the smaller seeds plug up the holes and slow down drainage. This defeats the purpose so I got the hemp flax bags and start the smaller seeds in those and then after they sprout I transfer to the trays so they receive more light. They I can also drain quickly by tipping on side and holding the sprouts in. I also keep the trays in the fridge after they mature. They stack and  eathe so they are very effective. I plan on buying the larger trays as well for greater farming capacity. Also more hemp bags. I also plan on trying the nut milk bags for sprouting. My only complaint on the hemp ones is they smell a little musty, like wet rope. I am going to try a little H2O2 on them to see if that lowers the smell. To their defense, the smell rinses right off and they work like a champ! I am going to get another batch of three as well. The bags work excellent for bean sprouts all the way to maturity.     If anyone has doubts about the power of sprouts, give them a try, they are the apple of my eye!     I am now a sprout convert and a farmer in my own house.          Cheers to living foods!
