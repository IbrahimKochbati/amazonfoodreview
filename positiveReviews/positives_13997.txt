I bought this because I am on Weight Watchers and didn't want to give up PB. Only 1 WW point per Tblsp. I love the roasted, fresh taste.  There isn't anything funky tasting at all. It's just roasted peanut powder and a very small amount of salt & sugar. You just mix it with a little water.     It would be really good mixed with honey but I eat it with apple slices.
