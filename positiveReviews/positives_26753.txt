When I boughtmy Keurig there were two of these as a sample.  I really didn't think the coffee maker could do tea   after all, it is a coffee maker   so I waited a while to try it.  As a matter of fact, I offered one of the two to a co worker (thinking I wouldn't like it) and, after smelling it, I made me a cup.          I was hooked, and bought my own box after trying it.  If you like Earl Grey tea, or any hot tea, I would recomend this one.  Some people like it with a little lemon or other things added to it, but I like it "plain" as it comes out of the K cup.          I would recommend using the small or medium setting, as the large setting (to me) waters it down a little bit.  However, to each their own   give it a shot and use whatever setting works for you.
