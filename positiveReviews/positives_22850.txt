I was hesitant to order this online because when I buy in the store, sometimes the nuts are rancid....BUT, every time I have ordered from Amazon, it has been extremely fresh, in fact fresher than anything I have found in the stores.  I normally only can find when I make trips up to Canada, so it was a pleasant surprise to find this online at Amazon, and for such a reasonable price.  The toffee is buttery and very chewy.  If you have sensitive dental work I would not recommend purchasing as this will give your teeth & jaw quite a workout, but if you don't have those type of problems, this is the best toffee I have ever had.  I just wish Amazon carried the licorice flavor!
