I love this product. I do not notice any difference between this product and regular sugar. I consume a lot of sugar and am trying to cut back and I found this product on line. I ordered it and loved it! I am actually very surprised by the price of this product on Amazon.com. You can get the same 2 lbs of domino light (sugar and stevia blend) for $7.98 ea., at domino.com or C&H light.com.          I requested to receive an alert when amazon.com bought it in, and the price they are selling it at, is highway robbery as far as I am concerned.
