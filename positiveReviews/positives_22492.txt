This is now our favorite popcorn. We have long since stopped using microwave popcorn because it was either too greasy or chewy. So, we went back to popping kernels in oil on the stove until we bought a popcorn machine. Now, we gave away our other popcorn and all we use is the Great Northern Popcorn portion packs. The popcorn comes out perfect everytime with great taste. It is salted just right, very light, and not greasy. Highly recommend this product.
