My cat is a picky eater, but he got excited even before the bag was open (I guess he smelled the meat) and devours the treats. The only downside is the size. I understand this was a "strip", but I use them as regular bite size treats and therefore had to  eak them into bits by hand (took me a while). I wish Amazon sold bite size roast chicken treats by this company. I feel good about giving them to the cat, as it seems most cat treats are loaded with bad stuff.
