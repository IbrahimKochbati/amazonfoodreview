The awesome price and free shipping is what sold me.  I found this same exact pumpkin available for order from an organic grocery in NY and they wanted to charge over $30 for only 6 cans AND they only ship FedEX which is not cheap.  I couldn't believe my good luck to find the same exact item on Amazon and that I could get TWICE AS MUCH for $10 LESS with free shipping!!
