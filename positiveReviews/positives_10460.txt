I have a 9 year old lab mix, and she is over weight and simply not active.  She would  eath really heavily even when she was just laying around!  I assumed that her not being very active had to do with age, but my vet reccomeded a diet (and i agreed).  I looked around at some foods and decided to try avoderm weight control dry kibble.  My dog wouldn't eat it at first, so i tried to mix it in with a higher protein kibble (Premium Edge), but she still wouldn't eat it. I topped it with a little bit of avoderm chicken and rice canned to the mix (1 4 can to 3 cups of dry kibble), and she DEVOURED IT!  After a month of this diet, my dog lost about 3 pounds, her eyes looked  ight and she even started romping around again!  I'm SO GLAD I switched to AvoDerm foods!! And so is my Reba!
