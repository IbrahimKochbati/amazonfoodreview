The second you open the bag, you can tell these dog treats are quality. There's actually an aroma to them    not like a delicious gourmet aroma, but still, they smell like actual baked food instead of smelling like pressed carboard   sawdust, which is sorta what I think when I smell cheapo dog treats.          My small dog (Cavalier King Charles) loves these treats, but the problem is, they're almost too hard for him to eat. He has the small teeth and 'soft mouth' characteristic of his  eed and has trouble crunching these up. It's actually a good thing, because it forces him to 'savor' the treats (AKA they last longer), but it's something to consider if your dog is old missing teeth.          Other than that, these treats are great. I don't always buy Newman's Own products, but know when I do that I am purchasing quality products from an ethical company.
