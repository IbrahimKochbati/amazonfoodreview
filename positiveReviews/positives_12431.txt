Coach's Oats' patented procedures produce some very well textured oatmeal  the best I've had.          Here's my method of preparing them:     Toast ~1.5 Cups raw Coach's Oats in a dry stainless steel medium pot. Add ~3 4 tsp of Kosher Salt.     Add 3 Tbsp of Coconut Oil and or Macadamia Oil and or Butter. Stir until toasted and  own.     In a separate container, microwave 3 cups of water and 1 cup of black coffee to a boil (4 cups total).     Pour the boiling liquid over the oats in the hot cooking vessel. Instant violent boil. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes.     Remove lid and stir in cinnamon (e.g. cassia) and ~4 Tbsp Orange Blossom Honey.     Simmer uncovered for ~4 more minutes until desired texture consistency is reached. I like mine on the drier side.     Serve with a splash of cream and or berries. Or anything that will stand up to the coffee flavor. Have fun.
