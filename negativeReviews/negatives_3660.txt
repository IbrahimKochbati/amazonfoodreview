NOT what I think of as Cincinnati chili. Seasonings weren't as spicy (meaning allspice, cinnamon, etc.)as the Cincinnati chili I've had there & I didn't think the chocolate added anything. But, if I were to rate it as just chili, I'd give it 4 stars. I ended up adding chili powder, cumin & a can of chopped green chilies & it was good. I did serve it over spaghetti with raw chopped onions & shredded cheddar "Cincinnati 5 way" style.
