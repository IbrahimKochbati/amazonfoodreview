Is it a juice or is it a soda?  It's both!  Switch Kiwi Berry canned beverage has enough carbonation for it to be "soda like" but it's not overpowering.  This particular flavor is made up of a variety of fruit juices, and I really didn't taste too much kiwi or strawberry.  To me, the apple juice flavor was the dominant one.  I like fruit juices and different beverage choices, and I really like the texture of this drink.  However, it is a bit too sweet for my liking and is pretty high in calories.  If the calorie count had been lower, my rating would be higher.  Children would probably really enjoy this drink, and it's definitely a healthier option than soft drinks or other sugary options.  I'd be interested to try some of the other flavors!
