I absolutely love these peanuts.  I wrote a previous review for Williamsburg Virgina peanuts which are in the tan colored tin but I enjoy these much more. They are large and crunchy and with just the right amount of salt for me.  I'm a huge fan of peanuts and I use to buy regular peanuts at the local grocery store but I haven't done that in over a year.  I have only bought this  and since I found them. *Note, these peanuts are awesome with a nice beer like Corona or Dos Equis.
