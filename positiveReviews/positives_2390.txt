I was delighted to discover this rich tasting coffee, which has half the acid of regular  ands. I served it to a guest with an acid reflux problem and she not only enjoyed the cuppa, she reported that she felt fine afterwards. This is a great coffee to have in your pantry for finick y guests or to stock for discerning coffee drinkers who find the taste of Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts simply too harsh. Also loved the charming packaging.
