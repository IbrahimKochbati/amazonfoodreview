I first found these about two years ago at Sam's Club, and being that I had two dogs that loved pigs ears I was interested.  My elder dog (now passed away) was getting up in the years and having a hard time with the regular pig ears and had lost all interest.  I got these, and she loved them.  She had a few teeth pulled but still could tear these up.  My younger, bigger dog loves them too.          And I'll tell you this too.  My hubby forgets to close the bag properly (or simply doesn't notice, you be the judge!), and these things do stay soft for a few days (nay a week or so) even if you don't get it closed quite right.          They don't last too long in this house, but if you want a good treat for your doggies give these a go.  Good sized bag for the price.
