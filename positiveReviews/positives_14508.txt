An excellent product! ... and this particular  and seems to be better than others I have tried in the past. It has a very fresh flavor and can be used in a large variety of ways. It is pure and very tasty when used just as an oil on salads or vegetables, too. The un eakable "tin" container sits in the back corner of my cooking counter and is also used whenever I'm not sure what ingredient I should add next in a recipe preparation! Very nice and well worth the bargain price offered by Amazon and the manufacturer.
