A few times a year (Easter, Halloween, Christmas, and Valentines) Hershey's comes out with their holiday Reese's edition.  This is absolutely the best time of year   for chocolate and peanut butter lovers.  The holiday editions are not just fun shaped Reese's cups   they are the "Premium" edition of what a cup could be.  They, if I may be so bold, are the perfect combination of soft milk chocolate and creamy peanut butter   the absolute perfect ratio of yummy goodness.  The fact that Hershey's only puts these out 4 times a year is either 1)marketing genius or 2)sadistic and hurtful.  Do I recommend you buy these?  Yes   yes I do, especially if you love Reese's and want to experience that next level.  I vote that Hershey's design more of these   President's Day anyone?  Independence Day?  Groundhog Day?  Tax Day?  Okay, I'm willing to help design a shape for any day of the year if it means I get more of these delicious things.
