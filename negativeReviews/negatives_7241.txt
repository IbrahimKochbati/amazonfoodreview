Although this tea is flavorful and tastes fine, I should have read the description more carefully. I was looking for pure licorice root tea. This tea has other spices added to it and the orange peel flavor is dominant and licorice flavor is muted. I am giving it three stars because the name of the tea should include some of the other spices. Read the ingredients listed before you purchase. Here is the description, "Combined with a touch of cinnamon, orange peel and other carefully selected herbs and spices" If you like these other spices then you will be happy. Otherwise, you might opt for a pure licorice tea and the box will say, "Ingredients: Licorice Root". That was what I really wanted, although this tea tastes perfectly good.
