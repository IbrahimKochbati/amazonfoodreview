I have tried almost every flavor of Celestial's holiday teas, and all have been amazing.     This one, has a warm "cookie" flavor,  with stronger notes leading to the lemony side. I was expecting it to be more of a strong cookie spice type flavor but On first impression, It reminded me of those lolipops that have the loop instead of the straight stick. Maybe the green one...lol.          I found that this one is best if you steep it a little longer than the recommended 5 minutes. It can be a faint light taste at first, but does get that "warmer" feeling if steeped a bit longer.          Overall, it's a great flavor and tastes great with and without milk. I often force my friends to try all my new teas, and everyone seemed to enjoy this one with no complaints.          If you are looking for more of a spice warm cookie type flavor of tea, I would HIGHLY recommend Celestial's Ginger ead Spice.
