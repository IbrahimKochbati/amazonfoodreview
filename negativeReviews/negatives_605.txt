I've had quite a few sencha powders in my time.  The Stash product is one of the best priced products out there.          That said, what you get per packet is a bit on the light side for mixing with 16 oz of water.  I can barely taste the tea, and I'm pretty sensitive to tea flavors.  If you get this product, keep your mixes at 8 oz of water   otherwise, it's like you're drinking a flavorless algae.          Otherwise, it's a good product at a good price.  At proper concentrations, the flavor is good, and you can't beat the health benefits of a good sencha green tea.
