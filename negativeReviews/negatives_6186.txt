My parents are both diabetics (Type 1 and Type 2). Their blood sugar has been uncontrollable and was looking for a healthy alternative to Splenda.  Bought this last week at Whole Foods in North ook and it was on sale as well.          Love the smell, but when they put it to their coffee, their blood sugar spiked 5 times the normal range.  At one point, my mom's sugar spiked to it's highest ever at 389.  She was so scared when she saw "CHECK FOR KETONES" on the machine.  Well, let's try baking  ead and using this coconut sugar instead.  It has that same effect.  I was wondering if we could be doing something wrong.  Maybe we are using a wrong ratio to the table sugar.  My parents used the 1 to 1 ratio (e.g. 1 tsp coconut sugar   1 tsp cane sugar).          I really had high hopes with this product specially for my diabetic parents. I researched high and low here in Amazon and other diabetes blog sites. I have read nothing but excellent reviews of this product and other Organic Coconut Sugar.          Please, if we are doing something wrong, let us know.  Give us some feedback.  My parents have stopped taking this and is looking for a different alternative. I read some excellent reviews regarding a product called Xylitol.  So i might try next.
