EDIT: I had been giving my dog a half of one of these every day, and he was having digestive issues with them. I stopped giving them to him and he recovered. I will have to lower my rating on these, even though he loves the taste.          I have a havanese dog. He is very picky about treats and food. He LOVES these things. He goes crazy for them. He sometimes won't even eat his regular food (EVO Chicken small bites) because he wants one of these first. I'm not sure if they are actually helping his teeth though. His teeth are looking kind of gnarly and he is only 3. I don't mind the smell of these treats either.
