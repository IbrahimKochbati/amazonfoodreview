I like  Stephen`s  Gourmet Hot  Cocoa , White  Chocolate  Mix ,because to me  it taste like  Arabian  White  Chocolate ,the taste is  almost identical ,if it had a little  Arabian vanilla  it would  be a copy cat. This  cocoa  to me  has  alot of  class ,unlike the others this  Stephens white chocolate  mix has alot of  class .I just  have to  say  Thankyou  Stephen ,I really enjoy sipping white hot  cocoa  again.  A friend told  me how  delicious  this  cocoa  was ,I never imagined  how  delicious . I am  so  glad  I purchased  it,  THANKYOU STEPHEN , A customer  for  life !  Terry Merrill
