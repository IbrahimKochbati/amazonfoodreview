Got this for like $10 on a warehouse deal. It was a bargain! I received them in early May and the label says best before June. At a rate of one can per 2 3 days, I don't think I'll have a problem finishing them off before June. (I know, I have a sweet tooth). All 4 cans had some dents on them but the condition of the gulab jamun inside was good. They were just as described   soft cheese balls (about 20 per can) in a sugar syrup with just a hint of cardamom. Warm it up a before eating for the maximum flavor and texture.
