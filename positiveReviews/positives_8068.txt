As I am writing this review, I am sitting here, at my computer, wolfing down the food because I'm starving.          I heated product in a saucepan over high heat for 5 minutes until boiling. Base tastes like regular tomato soup. Better than Campbell's tomato soup, I would say. There are vegetables mixed in: corn, green beans, and carrots. Green beans and carrots basically turn to mush in my mouth, and I can barely taste them. Corn isn't mushy, but doesn't taste sweet. I suspect this has something to do with being canned in a tomato base. Alphabet noodles have a nice texture. Smooth, and not too mushy.          I love this soup. Very satisfying for something that is fat free. Will re purchase many times. I'm sure this would also make excellent kids' food.
