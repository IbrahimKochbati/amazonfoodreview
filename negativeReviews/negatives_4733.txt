the after taste is very distinct.  i was looking forward to the raspberry for use in yogurt and soda, but the after taste is almost overpowering. the other flavors are not too bad in coffee but still very present.  even if you mix the irish creme with  andy, you notice it.  as far as i'm concerned these bottles go into the trash.  i won't use them and i sure would not offer them to my guests.  what a waste of money.  don't buy these!  and then the plastic bottles...  you can go to the torani site itself and buy individual bottles of your favorite flavor with a shipping for as many bottles you buy of 6.95.  this sugar free stuff isn't even for the birds.
