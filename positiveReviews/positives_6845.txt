My 4 month old puppy loves these, and has even learned how to "go to bed" in order to get his paws on one! Zuke's is quite a consistent  and, and our pup loves everything we have bought by this company so far. My husband and I like knowing we're giving him a tasty treat that's also natural and is made in America. Amazon usually has these for a little bit cheaper than most of the pet stores in our area, which is also nice!
