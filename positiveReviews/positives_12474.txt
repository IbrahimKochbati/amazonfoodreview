Come on now, how much of this stuff actually DOES taste and smell good to adults.  The last time I bought it at Safeway, it tasted and smelled exactly the same  it's not Amazon's fault that grown ups would rather eat pot roast with potatoes and gravy on the side.  So, if you don't like it, fire up the blender, and whizz up your unseasoned hunk of meat (which is why it smells so intolerable to our tastes and smells,btw) into a goopy smelly jelly (very much like the jar you're commenting on here). Walk through the market trying to convince your other kids to keep their hands inside the basket everyone's riding in, you stand in line at the end of the day with your feet killing you in those do me heels guarding the gum and chocolate bars from the other day care escapees (now busily reaching OUTside the basket for the gum and chocolate), and then embarassingly survive (you hope) the wet (or otherwise and getting smelly) diaper aroma.  Now, pay more for it than at Amazon,lug it all home while balancing tons of paper towels on your head (vs. waiting for the nice looking UPS guy to set it inside the door where all you have to do is open it and put it on the shelf.)          I like shopping in the quiet of my cleaned up kitchen after everyone's gone to bed, paying less for it (with a Prime Membership), and just putting it away when it arrives two days later.  I think that's what we're supposed to be rating and commenting on.  This works for me and rates five stars.
