I usually drink decaf, for health reasons.  I found this coffee to have a robust flavor without being bitter.  I prefer my coffee to taste as close to coffee ice cream as possible; this coffee came pretty close to my ideal once I added cream and (fake) sugar.  My friend, who drinks it black, also liked it very much.  No stomach issues at all, for either of us.
