When my cat was a kitten, he ate the Purina Kitten Chow until he was full grown. At that point, I got him the blue bag of regular Purina Cat Chow, and this green bag of Indoor Formula Cat Chow, and offered him a choice. My cat is an indoor outdoor cat, but not too active with medium length hair  he looks a bit like he is part Selkirk Rex. Well, he chose this green bag formula! My cat won't eat any canned cat food or meat, but he loves this cat chow, and he also likes cheese and milk. To vary his diet, I sometimes moisten this dry food with a bit of water and add a pinch of Brewer's Yeast flakes. I also use goat cheese and goat milk for treats. (I also give him a bit of Hairball remedy now and then, sometimes he eats that, and other times I have to put it on his paw so he will lick it off. I met two other ladies while shopping who say their cats prefer this Purina Indoor Formula Cat Chow.)
