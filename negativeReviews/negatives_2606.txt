I've been drinking loose leaf tea for a while now and this has to be the worst stuff I have tried yet. I believe by "Fine Tea" they mean small particle size. My box is about the consistency of a box of dirt, instead of nice leaf parts. Following the directions did not produce a pleasant cup of tea. There is too much bitterness in this tea. I would definitely suggest checking out the Adagio teas. My Mother in Law gave me a sampler for Christmas and it had some excellent teas.
