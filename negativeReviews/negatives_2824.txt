These sardines are okay, nothing more.  Don't fall for it.  At $2.82 a tin plus shipping, the Bela Sardine from Portugal blows these out of the water.  You can purchase Belas for $2.45 a tin and maybe less if you find them sold in bulk.  What am I going to do with 11 more tins of a so so sardine.  Ugh!
