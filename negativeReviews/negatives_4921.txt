Seriously, this is the worst tasting grape juice I've ever ingested.  Tastes like it's 2 3 water and 1 3 grape juice.  Talk about a misleading label!  Says 100% juice.  I would beg to differ.  For reference, I've drank many  ands of grape juice from the obvious Welch's to any old store  and.  The kicker is on the label there's a gold medal this was awarded for superior taste.          Don't waste you money on this.  Would never buy again.
