I have found that using this product in basically everthing requirng a sweetner to be very easy to use, mixes in so easy, does not crytalize as raw honey can, and does not give me a "sugar rush" feeling. Amazon has the best price I have found and does an excellent job shipping this sweetener with out any damaged bottles. This is the only place I go to purchase this product now. The background information on this product is very interesting, look it up sometime. It is great with Newman's Organic Green Tea!!! Also, this is where I purchace that tea, from Amazon.
