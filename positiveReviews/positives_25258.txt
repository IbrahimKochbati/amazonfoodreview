Worth the price for a great tasting, sweet, and healthful food. I bought twice in Amazon and both times it shipped quick, and was packaged well, with a tight thick seal. Grade b is the thickest, darkest, and sweetest, with a earthy caramel, molasses taste to it. It is relatively high on the glycemic index, giving health enthusiasts plenty of energy before a sport. It also has plenty of iron, and I think plenty of manganese as well, and is beneficial for reproductive health at least in men. I use it every morning in my oats or 'kashi' whole wheat biscuits, mixed into cowmilk or soymilk. I recommend this product.
