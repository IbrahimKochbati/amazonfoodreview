I took a try on this one through the Vine program.  For a starting poing, I consider Pike Place Roast from Starbucks to be a four star under this system with Jamaican Blue Mountain being the epitome of five star coffee.          I tried the Classique at regular strength and thought it to be watery with a long lasting aftertaste   not a good combination.  At double strength, the taste approached a good cup of Folgers, but the aftertaste remained   slightly bitter and pervasive. I am sure there is a chemical explanation for that, but I don't have it... :)          In conclusion, not a "horrible" tasting coffee... just on the southern side of ordinary   with a cloying aftertaste that kills the deal.  Not for me, and i would not recommend.          All the best,          Jay
