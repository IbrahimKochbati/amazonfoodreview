I love coffee but don't drink it that often because my body reacts badly to the acidity. So I was really wanting this coffee to be "the one."          I invited 3 friends over to help me try it. The consensus was that Dan found it a little weak, Harry could really tell there was less acid in it and Gayle gave it 5 stars because it didn't "bowl her over" with harsh flavor.          As for me, I loved the smoothness of the  ew best of all. I did find it on the weak side after the initial velvety taste went over the tongue. The flavor was rather bland. There was no over all deep, full bodied taste, but with the beans adjusted to exclude acidity, I didn't think there would be.          I would drink it again, but probably wouldn't buy it. As the title says:  A Decent Average Coffee
