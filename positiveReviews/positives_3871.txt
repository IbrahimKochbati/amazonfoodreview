I adore using this very vanilla bean paste ESPECIALLY for my cream pies and ice cream. Why, it's like adding a "touch of heaven", but without any of the bother of scraping out vanilla bean pods. The flavor is also better to my liking too than vanilla beans. The price is WAY, way better too and it's stores fabulously on the shelf for ages!          For combined shipping, be sure to get their SWEET DOUGH FLAVORING and POWDERED VANILLA too. You'll be glad you did!          For more cooking tips & techniques... google my name SharonAnne.
