I love this Hot Cocoa.  It is the same that our local Bob Evans serves.  I used a single serve package of another  and just to see how much I should mix of the Bakers.  What I didn't expect to see was just how smooth the Bakers mix was compared to the "other  and".  And after my first cup at home, I'm hooked on Bakers Hot Cocoa. . .. and need to decide to whom do to give my "other  and" leftover packages!
