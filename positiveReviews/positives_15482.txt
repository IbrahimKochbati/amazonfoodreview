I have tried many  ands and this is the best. Pappardelle is not too sticky and not too flimsy.  Holds up nicely with a dense sauce.  You could easily pass this off as "your own homemade". When I serve it people always want to know more about the pasta. It makes a great hostess gift,(so much better than a scented candle)!
