So I have to admit that I am a cinnamon NUT.  I just plain love the spice in so many recipes I could never count. When Quaker first put this out I was a few trepidations about it.  Having loved the original flavor of Life cereal since as far back as I can remember I wasn't sure how they could add cinnamon to it and make it work   they did.  I'm one that loves to mix cereals and this one mixed with the Cinnamon Burst Cheerio's   love it so much I pretty much have this every day!     Get a box and try it!  If you enjoy cinnamon AND you enjoy original I think you'll enjoy this.  I do wish Amazon hadn't removed the 'Subscribe and Save' option   in all honesty, their full price for this is too much above what I can get it at the local discount store (I won't blame Amazon for not publishing this review!)
