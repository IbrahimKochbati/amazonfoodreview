This was the first coffee I tried on a Keurig.  At first I wasn't a fan.  Then I tweaked the cup size a bit and found a nice blend.  I personally like this on the 10oz setting.  This gives the best balance of flavor and fullness.  The key here is this is a medium roast, even though it is listed as 'bold', it is more of a medium through and through.          The flavors are good.  There is a nice tail on this one.  It is a tiny bit on what I consider to be the tart side.  Not necessarily bitter though.  However, I am the only one in my family still drinking this one.  They've all moved on to the dark roast all the time.  For me, I like slightly less strength for my first cup of the day.  Yes, I do drink 3 cups a day... So there is still plenty of time for the stronger cups later on.          Pros:     o flavor     o smooth tail     o great for 10oz or less          Cons:     o a bit on the tart side          Overall   I recommend this coffee for smaller cup sizes.
