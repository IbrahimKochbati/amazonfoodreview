I'm a chemist and tried to order the chemical (thiol) used to make most of these truffle products, to no avail. Anyone wanna split a tank car full of smelly thiol? The product is decent and I use it in anything from salads, pasta, and popcorn, yes! popcorn, though it's not supposed to hold up very well to heating (volatile). My daughter wanted to have a pig as a pet. Noone else did. I thought if I could train it to find truffles (are there any truffles in Indiana?), I might be able to justify a pig pet. We borrowed a PB 5 month old female for a weekend. She proceedeed to bite my std poodle and was very aggressive. We returned her the next day. The recepient said "she's mean isn't she." Their dogs were bitten as well. I think she was just bored. Urbani truffle (infused) oil has probably saved me hundreds if not thousands of dollars in pet vet bills and rescued me from years of trying to keep a pig amused. Thank you Urbani!     p.s. Can a pig be trained to find morels? I suck @ it. (former NY'er married to a Hoosier). Go Colts!!
