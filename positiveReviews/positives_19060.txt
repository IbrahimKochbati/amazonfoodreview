I've tried making recipes from books that use soy and almond flour, but carbquik makes biscuits that even my son says taste like good.  Nobody else ate my muffins.  The price at netrition is much lower and I bought the carbquik there,  I also bought cabalose flour but hasn't tried it yet.     It is supposed to be a near substitute for real flour.  Biscuits claim to only have 2 carbs each, so I guess one could even eat a few on the atkins diet during its induction phase.
