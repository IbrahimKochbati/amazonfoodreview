I purchased two types, the original and the salt and vinegar. The original tasted burned, they were very tan  own in color.  The vinegar were very sour.  Both cases were trashed & Amazon handled credit asap.  I have purchased these in grocery stores & airports and never had this quality problem.  These are pricey that's why I jumped at the great price Amazon offered this product.  Does Amazon got seconds?
