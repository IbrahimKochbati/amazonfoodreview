I keep buying a bag every year to see if they have changed their methods of production but as the saying goes "you get what you pay for". This used to be a great product but starting a couple years ago they stopped screening it. It is now at least a quarter woody material, 1 4 3inch pieces. This would actually be great for mulching trees and shrubs if it weren't way to expensive for that purpose. Spend the money, buy pro mix and save yourself a lot of time and problems.
