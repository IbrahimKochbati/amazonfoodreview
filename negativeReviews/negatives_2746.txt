I've recently been researching the work of Dr. Price and the X factor that high vitamin butter, combined with fermented cod liver oil, will cause teeth to re mineralize and stop tooth decay. If this is why you want to purchase this product, DO NOT. I'm sure it's fine for ghee, but when I switched from the pricey butter oil to this, I found cavities were growing. When I switched back, they stopped growing. Again, this is great for ghee, but don't use as part of preventing curing tooth decay as Dr. Price's research recommends.
