This PB is great because it is only 45 calories per 2 tablespoons and 1.5 grams of fat.  It is great tasting   of course, it does not taste like Jiff (my favorite); its taste is similar to the natural PBs on the market.  Some people like or love peanut butter.  I'm obsessed with it.  It is so bad that this is the first PB that I have purchased in awhile because as soon as I buy PB, it is gone in one day (yes, I sit down and just eat spoonful after spoonful).
