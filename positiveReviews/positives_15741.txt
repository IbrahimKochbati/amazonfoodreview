As this cat food has the somewhat comical tagline "People food for cats!," it may either at first appear charming or like a gimmick.  I think it is fair to say that it is a charming gimmick.  The foods are indeed fashioned after human food, but are more like food for baby humans than us adult humans that prefer strong seasoned flavors.  Of course, that is a good thing, as a healthy diet for a cat is quite different than for a human.  The ingredients, then, are basic, with nothing offensive like wheat gluten.          As for the taste, I agree with other reviewers that this comes down to the preference of each cat, but it has been a great hit with cats in my experience!
