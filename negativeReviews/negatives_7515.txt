This is the latest foray into the "all natural" nutritional drinks market. Despite boasting "real fruit juice" on the packaging, the flavor is simply too watered down to notice. Having drank plenty of coconut water, this drink has barely more than a hint of it. Most likely, it clashes with the taste of the guava, which is also hardly noticeable. In fact, were it not for the label on the packaging, this reviewer would not have been able to tell what the flavor was meant to be. Speaking of the which, the odd packaging is rather reminiscent of the fruit juice packs aimed at kids, sans the accompanying straw. Also, this 8.5 ounce drink will not go far to quench anyone's thirst or give any noticeable energy boost. Given the price for a pack of 12, it is not asking for much to give the consumer more juice for the buck. The nutritional content stacks up nicely to other comparable drinks, however it does have more sugar than some others currently on the market. Overall, O.N.E. has produced a product that is nothing special in the world of sports drinks. While it does offer fairly solid nutritional content, the bland taste and small size does not make this a good value.
