I bought this because it is made from real wood and from Oregon, not imported.  I like the litte size.  Very cute round and great drip edge!  The drip edge is very deep.  I don't see how I can make a mess with it.          I like this size for quick chops.  Yes, you can see some marks from the knife, but that is better than on the counter.  Easy to clean and drys up quick.          I look forward to buying other pieces.  I checked out the manufacturers website and they have a very large offering of products.  I bought a  ead knife and a larger rectangular board as well.  With the 4 3 offer, I got a left handed  ead knife for my  other in law's xmas gift!          Did I mention, it feels like you are using a work of art?  The wood is beautiful, very rich in tone and color.  The natural variation is gorgeous.
