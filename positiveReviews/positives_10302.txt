I love this product! I have several of these that I got for my daughter. She makes her own baby food for our grandchildren. But I have some as well. When the kids come to our home, we keep snacks, fruit, and dry cereal pieces in the cups for the children to enjoy.          During the summer we use this to make frozen fruit or yogurt pops. It travels well and cleans up easily. Just an excellent item that I wish had been around when I was a young mom.
