I was so excited to get these k cups and immediately filled 10, for future  ewing, with my favorite coffee.  I tried one right away...  the coffee started running down the front of my Kreuig.  I thought I had filled the cup wrong and maybe not had the lid sealed well enough.... but when the coffee was done I opened the k cup slot and found a melted wrinkled container.  I have subsequently tried more of the orrigional 10 that I filled, after carefully checking that they were properly put together, and all melted in the same way.  I have since thrown the rest away because I was tired of the mess they created!  Don't buy these... they do not stand up to hot water.
