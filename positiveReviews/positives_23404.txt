only complaint is that there isn't as strong a pumpkin flavor as I like. That being said, this coffee is excellent. The pumpkin smell is deffinitly there before and after  ewing. The bag is nice keeps the coffe fresh. The delivery was fast and the packaging fine.          I am trying to start drinking my coffee black to avoid the added sugar. This is a good coffee to do this with. The flavor without anything added is delicious.          If you like this you should try the "almond french toast" by the same company. It's amazing.
