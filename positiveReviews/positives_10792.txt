My pets came running when they heard the call of "treats!". Of course when a new treat is offered the devour it, the real test is...will they eat all the treats in the bag over the next few days or will they turn their nose up at the treat the second or third time it is given.     They LOVED the whole bag! Even the cats had to get in and get some(of course theirs had to be crumbled for them, as the biscuits are medium to big dog size)and the loved the treats too.     I did not feel guilty about giving any of the animals the treats as they are 100% organic and even better I could pronounce what every ingredient was (as well as know what it was (carrots, lamb, molasses etc)!
