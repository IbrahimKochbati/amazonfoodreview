I switched to the smaller cans because I have a Yorkie, and it took too long for her to finish the larger cans.  But to me, all Canidae products are great.  Let me tell you what happened.  Three years ago, my little dog had hot spots all over her.  She was miserable, itching, scratching, moping around.  I took her to the vet who gave me a cream which didn't help.  Then one time, I went to my groomer who told me the truth:  SHE'S ALLERGIC!  These hot spots are Alergies!!!  Huh?  Why didn't the vet tell me this?  (Was it because he was also selling the other dog food I was using?)  The groomer suggested I look for a product that had no corn.  I liked the Amazon reviews about Canidae products and tried it.  Not only did she take to the change right away, (although I gradually changed food) but her hot spots cleared up.  Needless to say, Canidae products are all I use now.  I don't care that they are a little more expensive!  They cleared up my poor dog's misery, and that's all that counts!
