We were very pleased to locate this pumpkin on Amazon.  We have a dog with a very sensitive stomach.  We have included pumpkin with her meals for years but have not been able to find pumpkin in our local grocery stores and were told that there would be no canned pumpkin until Fall 2010.  Thanks for having this available.
