Boston Tea provides some of the best tasting tea I have found.  I have several flavors on hand (Berry Medley, Strawberry Fields, etc) for the office tea drinkers.  I started out being the only one drinking it and now I have been making 3 4 12 cup pots a day.  So far the Peach Passion is the favorite and the kitchen smells of peaches when I make this one.  It is so good I'm signing up for auto delivery.          If you like peaches and tea, this is the blend for you.          As a side note I add about a 1 tablespoon of quality black tea to the 8 tablespoons of Peach Passion.  Also, I can  ew this twice and still get full flavor (24 cups total).
