IZZE is fantastic. I tried it three days ago, and haven't been anywhere without a can or bottle of it since. It could quite possibly be the world's most perfect beverage. Nothing artificial, ingredients that you can pronounce, and a taste you just cannot beat. Slightly tart and slightly sweet, this light, bubbly drink should be experienced by everyone at least once.
