I like to support companies who strive harder to help the earth.  Newman's Own Organic French Roast Coffee is fair trade organic coffee.  That means the coffee farmers are compensated fairly and the coffee is certified organic, which is better for us and the earth.          FLAVOR:     This is a dark roast coffee, but it doesn't taste overly dark.  It has no bitterness, which is great, and is fairly smooth.  It lacks the complexity in flavor that other coffees can have, but it still tastes good.  It's a nice cup of coffee, and even if you don't care for dark roast, you may find you like this one.          I drink my coffee black, and this is a great coffee to do so.  However, adding flavored creamers would also taste pretty good.  Sometimes I add ground cinnamon to the coffee grounds in the basket, so it  ews into the coffee.  That yields a nice, mild cinnamon flavor to the coffee.          AROMA:     The aroma coming from  ewing this coffee is very tantalizing.  It is warm and almost has a sweet scent to it.          PACKAGING:     The bag folds up and has a couple of arms which fold around the sides to keep it closed.  It stays pretty fresh that way.          OVERALL OPINION:     I find this to be one of my lesser favorites in the coffee world, but it is still a good one.  If you desire to work towards dark roast coffees, this would be a good one to start with.  Or, if you desire a milder dark roast, again, a good one here.
