When I 1st tried this, I really didn't like it just by itself. But then in stead of putting just all water, I put 1tsp of sugar free coffee syrup and 2tsp of water and it made it taste so much better. This stuff is wonderful to add to recipes with out adding a ton of fat. Great stuff!     An additional note: you can buy it cheaper at bellplantation.com
