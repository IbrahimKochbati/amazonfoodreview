I dislike  eakfast but it's good for my health. Oatmeal crisp is delicious, nutritious and keeps me full for at least four hours. This is good because I don't have to eat every two hours like I did in the past, with Oatmeal Crisp Cereal, Chunky Almonds, 17 Ounce Box (Pack of 6)no hunger for four hours, cool!
