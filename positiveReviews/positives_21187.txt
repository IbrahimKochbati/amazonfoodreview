The texture and taste of this chili is very much like, say, Hormel chili con carne.  Worthington has chosen not to go heavy on the heat, so I simply add some Louisiana Hot Sauce, to  ing it up to my requirements.  This is also a great chili dog topper with Loma Linda Big Franks veggie dogs.  Add some sauteed onions and peppers and you have a real treat.
