If you are looking for STRONG S V flavor these definitely aren't for you. Very mild in comparison to many others. I live in TX and I can tell you I've tried ALL S V chips I can get ahold of. The best of the best are HEB (store and) and World Market. Bob's and Zapp's Aren't bad. From a chip standpoint they have typically great kettle crunch, but if you're looking for S V flavor these have "just a touch."
