I have been buying these for years.  They are great  very filling.  The other reviewer is correct   they are on the sweet side.  I love them.  I keep one in my purse at all times.  There are more than 3 varieties made, but they are the only 3 Amazon carries.  The yogurt covered bars are even sweeter   but I love those too.
