Maybe it's because it's my first experience with Stevia... but I thought this soda tasted horrible! I had one can and can't  ing myself to drink another one. We're donating it to the food pantry, but honestly I feel bad for the people that will have to drink it. I'm normally not harsh with reviews, but I have to say this product is BAD.
