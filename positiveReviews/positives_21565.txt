YES!  Quaker went back to the old recipe!  Woohoo!  I do love this stuff.  This Maple Brown Sugar flavor is what I grew up eating.  I am unfortunately a picky eater, nothing else will do, I'm very sensitive to (and grossed out by) new flavors and textures.          A year or two ago Quaker had scrapped the old recipe and came out with a New & Improved recipe which I unwittingly tried and was repulsed, thinking I'd gotten a bad batch until I realized it had been reformulated.  The new version's hearty oats and natural flavor wasn't a hit with me.  I emailed Quaker with my complaint and they nicely sent me a $5 coupon to use on any Quaker product which I used for Life cereal.          Anyway, I guess I wasn't the only one complaining about the New & Improved recipe because now Quaker has returned to their tried 'n' true Classic Recipe.  Now I have my old Maple Brown Sugar flavor and texture back.  Sure, it's probably not as healthy for me as old fashioned homecooked oats, but I don't like old fashioned oats.   )  The flavor and texture of this instant oatmeal is comfort food to me, and since I have orthodontic  aces, it's a good food for me to eat when my teeth are aching.
