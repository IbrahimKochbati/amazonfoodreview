This product worked exactly as advertised. I filled several cups in advance with my own coffee and was able to use them in my machine just like a K Cup. Prior to purchasing, I read a review stating that the lid came off when the user was attempting to remove it from the machine. This was not the case for me. The lid was secure and it functioned just like the more expensive prefilled K Cup. I will order these DisposaKups regularly.
