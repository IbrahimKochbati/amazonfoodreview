I have purchased this item in a larger can before and it is great mango pulp for cooking, desserts, etc.          One of the six cans had a huge dent and it would have been obvious before pack was placed in shipping box.  Items were packaged very well so I don't see how this could have happened during shipping since the outside box had no signs of damage.  It is too much of a hassle to return all 6 cans because of one damaged can.  And I need one can for mango cupcakes that I'm making this weekend.  Due to anosmia, the dented can will probably be thrown away because I can't tell if it is good or bad.  I will probably not purchase this item again from Amazon and will buy locally if I can find it.
