I've been eating Nishiki (?) jasmine white rice for many years, and thought I'd try this as it is healthier. I was very pleasantly surprised   it tasted great. I was concerned it wouldn't cook properly in my programmable Zojirushi 3 cup rice cooker but it comes out great on both the regular and quick cooking settings. (I haven't tried it in my bigger neurofuzzy cooker but assume it would be as good or better). It does seem a little more sensitive to amount of water than regular white rice   adding too much makes it mushier.          I think it's the wheat and rye berries that make it delicious, so getting the  own wild rice mix at Whole Foods and mixing in some wheat and rye berries would probably be just as tasty and less expensive.
