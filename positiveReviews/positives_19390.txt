If you prefer powdered Sweet n' Low, you have no problem. Over the last year, liquid Sweet n' Low has disappeared from grocery shelves to be replaced with several other  ands. I like products I am familiar with & have long satisfying experience. When these supplies are gone, I'll have to try the replacements.
