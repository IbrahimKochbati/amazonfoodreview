I was so excited to get my whole wheat pizza dough.  After ordering it, I got it two days later!  The directions are easy to follow and the taste of the crust is phenomenal.  The toppings I added to my pizza were shrimp, chicken, cherry tomatoes, Mexican cheese blend, and turkey Canadian bacon.  The pizza turned out great! Only 8 Weight Watcher's Point Plus value per slice.  This is a better alternative to other leading pizzas.
