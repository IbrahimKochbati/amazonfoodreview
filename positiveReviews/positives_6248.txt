I was in love from the moment I opened a bag and took the first whiff.  However, it did take me a while to figure out the right  ewing method, because I found it was much easier to "scald."  Might be just me though.  First I boil the water, but whereas usually I just let it sit there for about a minute to cool, here I actually poured it into a pot and let it sit for about 2 or 3 minutes.  Then I grind the beans medium coarse (it smells heavenly) and 2 tablespoons into the french press it goes.  Pour the water in, and I let it sit for a bit longer than usual, too (still hot though).  I find that it has a very nice... sort of crunchy, hard caramelized sugar finish to it, kind of tastes like the top of a cr&egrave;me  ulee.  Delicious.  I drink it black.
