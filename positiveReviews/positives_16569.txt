Our terrier mix adores Greenies (haven't met a dog who doesn't love them, actually)... they kind of have a gummy bear quality. We give him one before we leave for work so he has a little distraction (only takes him a few minutes to finish one). These are $1.50 ea at our local pet supply store, so buying them in bulk is the way to go. We bought them from Entirely Pets and got a great deal with fast shipping.
