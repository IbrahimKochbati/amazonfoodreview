Pros: not overly sweet like some juice drinks       no caffeine       no corn sweeteners (if that matters to you)     Cons:  expensive for the size (8.3 ounces)       can't taste the orange or tangerine juices in it       lots of calories          I grew up eating oranges and tangerines off my grandparents' trees.  I was surprised that I couldn't taste those flavors in this drink, but then I looked at the ingredient list on the can and those were the juices that were used in the smallest amounts   probably to keep the cost down.          I'll stick to the Sobe low cal drinks and the 10 calorie Vitamin Water because 1   they are cheaper and  2   I'd rather save up my daily allotment of calories for something with more flavor.
