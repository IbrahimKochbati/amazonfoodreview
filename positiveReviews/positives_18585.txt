This egg protein is great!     First off, it is sweetened with Stevia, a natural herb, and not some artificial sweetener like aspartame or sucralose.     Next, it is very easy on the stomach, even whey without lactose is a lot harder on my digestion system it seems.     It tastes good, mixes well, and is a good value.     I bought all 3 flavors and found I prefer the vanilla.     Goes really well with some almond milk and blueberries.     I'm glad I've found a pure protein source that is dairy and soy free.
