This popcorn is great. It tastes like movie popcorn or better. It's tender & has lots of flavor.  One bag makes alot of popcorn so it's great for movie night with your family. I bought this popcorn for a gift for my Husband for Christmas but I ended up giving it to him early. He is a big time popcorn eater. It is his favorite snack. The store bought types just don't measure up in flavor or tenderness. I have to buy him more for Christmas so I am definitely buying this popcorn again.     Sandra L
