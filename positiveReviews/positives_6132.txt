The drink has a pleasant taste, especially when very cold.  Within 20 30 minutes I do feel more relaxed, and my mind stops racing.  I am a nurse, and sometimes after a crazy 12 hour shift, it is hard to turn my  ain off and sleep.  I keep replaying situations in my mind, and have a hard time relaxing.  This drink helps quiet my thoughts enough that I can fall asleep.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I usually have to get up in the night to use the bathroom after drinking a 12 oz drink before bed.  I do fall right back to sleep though, so I don't feel like my sleep is interrupted.  Will definitely keep this in the fridge for the end of a hectic day.  I love that it is sweetened with Splenda and not Nutrasweet.  Also, it is a nice "calorie free" alternative to wine or beer for that end of day "night cap"!
