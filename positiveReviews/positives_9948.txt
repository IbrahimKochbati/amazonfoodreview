I generally don't like any salad dressings, but this is wonderful!  My husband even uses it on veggies.  It is light and a little runny (like vinagrette).  The taste is wonderful   the sesame is not overpowering, nor is the miso.  (I love soy and sesame, but not usually the miso taste, but this dressing is perfect.)  If you are looking for something new to try, definitely give this one a chance.
