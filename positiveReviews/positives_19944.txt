Kettle Chips flavors can be hit or miss.  Some of their flavors are terrible.  But this is very simple and delicious.  Probably one of their best flavors.          Pros: Thick, crunchy potato chips with light salt that doesn't compromise on taste, eco friendly business that isn't just giving us lip service          Cons: The occasional burnt chip and the bag is a pain to open.  They have a tab that you can pull down but most of the time I end up tearing down the entire side of the bag.  Use scissors instead.
