I give this 3 stars because it wasn't unpleasant coffee.  It just didn't taste like anything.  It reminded me of hot water with those Folgers coffee bags dunked in it for a little bit.  I don't like too strong a coffee but this was way underpowered for coffee.  I enjoy the bolder coffees, too, such as Coffee People Organic Bold and Dark Magic.  I would not buy Nantucket again.
