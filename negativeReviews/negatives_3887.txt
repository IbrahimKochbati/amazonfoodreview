The kiwi berry soda drink was tasty.  I enjoyed the light fruity flavor instead of the intensity and heaviness of the popular canned cola drinks.  The effervescence was perfect....again, not so intense as the other sodas.  The cans are small(only 8.3 oz.), but adequate for a small thirst.  The idea of healthy 100% fruit juices combined with a slight carbonation is fine for children and adults alike.  Probably the only downside is the price per can compared to those very popular, but ultra sugary or fake sugar colas and other canned soft drinks....but, you getting a far better product.
