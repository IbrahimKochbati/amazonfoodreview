Green Thunder is great. Energy drinks like Red Bull or Monster really aren't the greatest in thge health department. Being an active middle school kid, I know you really need a little pick me up some days. I keep a bottle in my bookbag when I need it.          As for the taste, its not to bad. It kind of tastes like monster. Its got green apple hints and tastes a little like punch. I like it enough to drink it again. :)
