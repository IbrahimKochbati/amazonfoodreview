These are beautiful, smooth spring roll wrappers and on the package label there is a sticker on each one that reads, "New technology", so, I'm figuring by the bad reviews that this company changed the way they manufacture their spring roll wrappers and have probably upped their quality control as well. I was nervous about ordering these by the bad reviews but I'm glad I took a chance because these are a bargain compared to some of the other  ands.          Will definitely order these again!
