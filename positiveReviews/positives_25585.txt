I was concerned about purchasing this bag as opposed to the bag of cut and sifted flowers for a few dollars more, because the review on that product suggested this bag may contain stems, bulbs, and other less desirable parts.  I have found this to be untrue   the bag I received (which did have a ziploc style top) contained only pure petals.  I put mine into a metal tea holder and steeped it in hot water, and the tea came out vi ant and delicious.  I intend to make lots of this and then chill it, as I prefer it cold.  A little sugar can make this drink a little sweeter, which I find I prefer when the tea is hot.  Also... it's really pretty.  I'm excited to serve this non traditional beverage to my houseguests.  The bag is huge, too, and given that I'm usually the only one in the house that will drink it (my husband is a coffee fiend), I might freeze half of it until I need it.          I've found this bag is really simple and much preferable to more processed teas.
