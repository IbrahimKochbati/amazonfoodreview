Since a DOP product is not readily available at my local grocery stores, I got really excited when I saw the photo of this product at the Amazon website because the photo states that this product is "D.O.P. Certified."          But when I received the shipment, it was a huge disappointment.  It was a different product than what the photo promised.  (I can buy the one that was delivered to me at my local grocery stores very easily.)  Very disappointing.............
