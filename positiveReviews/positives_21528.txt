It's hard to believe that these might actually be healthy, but I love these flavored Quaker Instant Oatmeals.          And they might actually be healthy! Though sugar is the second ingredient, whole grain rolled oats is the first ingredient in every flavor of Quaker Instant Oatmeal, including this Maple Brown Sugar, which is a favorite of mine. Further, each serving (one packet) contains only four grams of sugar in the low sugar form and nine grams in the regular form, which is one to two teaspoons.          Yeah, one or two teaspoons.          I went through the rest of the ingredients on the Maple Brown Sugar flavor and on several others, and almost every other ingredient is an ingredient you'd find in a vitamin pill. The Apples & Cinnamon even has dehydrated apples (ahead of sugar, which is the third ingredient in that flavor).          I'm recovering from chemotherapy and radiation. I had a bone marrow transplant in January (2012), and my new immune system sometimes goes after my gut when we lower my immunosuppressives. Thus, eating food that is high in fiber and gentle on the stomach and intestines is important for me. It's important for you, too, because the fiber in oats is excellent for your heart.          The problem is, it's hard for me to find oatmeal edible without adding a lot more  own sugar than Quaker does! That's always been true, but it's especially true when I'm recovering from leukemia treatments. At first, there was a VERY limited set of food items I could eat without throwing up. (Sorry for being so graphic.) These flavored Quaker Instant Oatmeals let me eat gentle, heart healthy oatmeal without hating the flavor. I love almost every one. They're a go to food for me when I'm nauseous.          I know you probably aren't recovering from a blood cancer, but if you're wanting to eat oatmeal because it's healthy, this is a great way to eat it.          And for lazy people, it's a one bowl cleanup. Pour the packet in the bowl, pour boiling water over it, and wait a minute (or less if you're impatient like me). Eat it, and you have one bowl and no pots to wash (or throw in the dishwasher).
