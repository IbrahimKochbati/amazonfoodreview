My vet suggested we put our yellow lab on an all venison diet.     I tried this  and and it seemed to work and her skin issues went away.          I ordered another bag of the same product and noticed the texture of the kibble was different but didnt think much of it since the packaging was identical.          My groomer noticed that my dog is loosing her hair and asked if we changed her food.          I think the first bag was working but something must be different with this second bag.          I'm going back to using the venison formula from our local dog food store. $20 more per bag but she wasn't loosing her hair.          wish I could get a refund but the bag is half gone and wouldn't know how to return dog food.
