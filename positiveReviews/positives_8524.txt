These cookies have no milk, no egss, no nuts, no gluten and no cholesterol or trans fat, which common sense says should make them taste like cardboard, if not even worse. I don't know how they did it, but these chocolate chip cookies are delicious. They actual taste like chocolate chip cookies should taste. If you've got allergies, try these cookies. You'll love them.
