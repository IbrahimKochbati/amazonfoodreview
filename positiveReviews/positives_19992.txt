You don't need salt to hide the taste of potato chips. And these chips prove it. The taste of the potato comes through, instead of being masked. OK, so they're still a snack food, but no salt and no trans fats mean these are about the healthiest potato chips you can get. And if you're on a low salt diet (like I am), having these available means I can eat chips, and Kettle are just the best.
