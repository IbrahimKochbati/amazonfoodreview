If you are among those who really care about what you put in your body....then the Oskri Dark Chocolate Coconut Bars are 'to die for". As someone who is both dairy & gluten free, it is often challenging to find a product this delicious. As other reviewers noted, the Oskri Dark Chocolate Coconut Bar is indeed reminiscent of the Hershey's Mounds Bars. A careful review of the contents of the Hershey's Mounds Bar :NGREDIENTS: CORN SYRUP; SEMI SWEET CHOCOLATE ( CHOCOLATE; SUGAR; COCOA; MILK FAT; COCOA BUTTER; SOY LECITHIN; PGPR, EMULSIFIER) ; COCONUT; SUGAR; SALT; NATURAL & ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR; HYDROLYZED MILK PROTEIN; SODIU, M METABISULFITE, TO MAINTAIN FRESHNESS; SULFUR DIOXIDE, TO MAINTAIN FRESHNESS; CARAMEL COLOR; MILK  followed by  the contents of the Oskri Dark Chocolate Coconut Bar          Ingredients: Coconuts, Rice Syrup, Dark Chocolate (Sugar, Cocoa Butter, Chocolate, Soy Lecithin, Natural Vanilla)     clearly     exemplifies the purity & quality of the product.          Though the visual is not as attractive as the Mounds Bar, the absence of garbage ingredients makes the contents of the Oskri Dark Chocolate Coconut Bar  far more nutritious, &  its taste far superior. Any time I find myself licking the wrapper,  it's an Oskri Dark Chocolate Coconut Bar!  I seriously try to eat only one a day.  I say try!
