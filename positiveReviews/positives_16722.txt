I've had various  ands of agave nectar and this is my favorite.  I found it at Wal Mart in a smaller bottle and was elated to see it on Amazon in 46 ounces.  I went from plain sugar, to Splenda, to honey, back to sugar and finally landed at agave nectar.  It is truly wonderful and light.  Great in tea and coffee.
