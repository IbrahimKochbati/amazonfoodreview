Be very aware that the new formula ALS is not agreeing with a lot of dogs.  I have one of these dogs and no amount of transitioning improved the diarrhea, vomiting, and hot spots.  There are many, many complaints on the web by people with dogs having the same symptoms that finally stopped upon changing to another food.  Canidae made major changes to their ALS formulas and did nothing to alert the public until they had to (their web site only).  There is still nothing on the bags to make people aware of the changes except a new ingredient list.  Do your homework before buying this dog food.  Dog owners across the country have spent lots of money unnecessarily at the vets trying to find answers to their dogs medical problems only to find that it's the food they've been feeding.  Used to be an outstanding product!  Wish I could give zero stars!
