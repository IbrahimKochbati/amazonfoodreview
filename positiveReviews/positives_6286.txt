Our two Shih Tzu pups love Ziggies more than any other treat. We have given them Ziggies from the time we  ought them home four years ago and truly, nothing makes them happier than when they hear the wrappers crinkle on these treats.  We give them these special treats when we leave for work in the morning and or before we head out for a while in the evening.  Often we just split one treat in half to share between the two.  Ziggies aren't always readily available to order in the bulk cube and we've gone to great lengths to find them to keep our pups happy and in constant supply because they really  ing joy to their little faces.          You can use them to stuff into the rubber Kong things but we don't use them that way   we did when they were little but stopped bothering after a few weeks.
