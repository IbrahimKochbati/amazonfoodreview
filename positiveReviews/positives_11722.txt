These Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Whenever Bars are very good to me. They are the size of a thick medium cookie, are slightly chewy, and are very tasty despite the fact that they do not taste sweet at all.          Although coconut is lower in the ingredient list, the cookie tastes mostly like coconut and I didn't taste the chocolate at all.  However, since I like coconut very much, I enjoyed these bars.          The first three ingredients in order are gluten free oats, organic agave, and a rice blend. As for the rest of the cookie's name, chocolate chunks is the fourth ingredient and coconut is the tenth ingedient. The cookie contains eggs and almonds as well. The package claims that you get 180 mg of Omega 3 Fatty Acids and 9 grams of whole grain per bar.          Each bar is 180 calories with 80 calories from fat. Nevertheless, these are certainly a better choice than a candy bar and are gluten free. I really like the taste and chewy texture of these bars even though there was absolutely no chocolate taste to me.
