For a soft style cookie, these are a bit crumbly, or maybe they were that way being sent in the mail.  I enjoyed the taste of them.  I am used to oatmeal cookies though, my boyfriend loves them and took off with half the box.  I do feel slightly bad all the cookies are wrapped individually in a box.  Though I can recycle the box, it seems a lot of unnecessary packaging.  Overall, the cookies have a good soft yet crumble to them, they taste like oatmeal cookies with the tasty addition of chocolate chips and almonds. Both of those items tasted true for form.  Not something I would go out of my way for, but if they were on sale or someone offered me one, I wouldn't refuse it.
