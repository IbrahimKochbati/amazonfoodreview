Quaker Instant Oatmeal Maple Brown Sugar is a staple item in our household.  It allows for versatility, since you can eat it alone, as well as with nuts and or fruit mixed in.  One of my favorite things to do is to add raisins and pecans!  In addition, it is a practical item to take to work when you can't have  eakfast at home and fix it in a coffee mug in the microwave during a  eak.  I prefer to have it with milk, but it is very good when fixed with water too.  It is also a very nutritious  eakfast that may reduce cholesterol, help with digestion, and reduce the risk of heart disease   and it only has 160 calories per serving if prepared with water!  I highly recommend it!
