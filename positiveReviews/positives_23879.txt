I have tried a couple of flavors and the cheddar is by far my favorite.  The Sour Cream Onion has an off putting sweet yet salty powder.  These are a little high in sodium and they are not like regular chips, but they are a delicious chip like snack.  I recommend the individual serving packs because it is very easy to eat more than one serving of the larger bags.
