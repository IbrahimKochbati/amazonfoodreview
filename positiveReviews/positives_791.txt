I bought this product online because, although it is a Kellogg cereal, I cannot find a retail store which carries it, and incidentally I would like to know why. I called Kellogg and they could really give me no good answer, and suggested I try another product of theirs, which i found not as good as this. I appreciate that Amazon offers this, and I will continue to order it.  By the way,  it really keeps me "regular", better than any other cereal.  Try it, you'll like it.
