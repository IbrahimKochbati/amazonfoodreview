I think these are a good treat for mid size dogs. High quality, organic ingredients.          They are hard, so probably not suitable for small dogs, but they're also not very big. Our Newfoundland could eat several of these at once.          I was a little surprised that she ate them at all. She's eaten a quality grain free dog food (origen) and vegetables her entire life and usually turns her nose up anytime someone offers her a "treat". In the end though, we're both probably happier sticking to her normal food, so I won't be ordering any more of these.
