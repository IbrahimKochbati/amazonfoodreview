I've been buying this company's cookies for many years.  They are tasty and don't seem "weird" although note that they have a rice flour base, making them generally a tad crumblier and more delicate in flavor than cookies made with wheat flour.  They remind me of a light,  softer short ead type texture.  Personally I find this to be an appealing difference, adding some variety in choice (I'm not gluten intolerant but have a mild wheat allergy, so I can still eat some wheat cookies as well).  If you enjoy things like rice crackers, cream of rice, rice noodles and Asian dishes, you will probably like these and not find them strange.  In essence, I'd describe these as a lighter, more delicate version of a chocolate chip cookie.
