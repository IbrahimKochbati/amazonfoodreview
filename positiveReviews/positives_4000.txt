No more dry kibble for our felines!!!  After a few medical emergencies and educating myself WHY cats are not designed by Mother Nature to eat dry kibble (ANY  and), I changed our clan of felines to HEALTHY wet food.     Every cat with a blocked urinary tract is fine, until they start to strain to urinate and have to be rushed to the ER.     With all the issues of recalls and such concerning the pet food industry, we rotate 3 different  ands of food. Felidae is one.  It has NO grains, soy, corn, or icky fillers. Felidae is a pate loaf like consistency.     Since changing to a wet food only diet, none of our cats have been back to ER in years.  None throw up.  No runny eyes.  Coats are shiny. No matted hair.  All are at a perfect weight.  The changes are amazing.     Having 5 cats, I am VERY thankful for the 13 oz size cans of Felidae.     I had a question recently and sent Felidae an email.  They answered very promptly and were very kind.  Their customer service deserves 5 stars also.
