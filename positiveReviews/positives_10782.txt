We spoil our dog. We drive twenty miles to get special food for our Great Dane. But for doggie treats (and doggie teeth cleaners), we've been buying off the shelf  ands at the grocery store. Yeah, I was beginning to feel guilty, but our baby needs little treats when we leave the house, you know.          Now we have Newman's Own. I'm ecstatic. Yeah. About doggie tidbits.          The ingredients are organic so I can feel good about supporting the environment. The ingredients are wholesome. If I were not a vegetarian, I'd probably feel OK about eating them myself.          Oh, and as I writer, I must mention that I love the marketing. It includes a little story on the back of the package. Let's call it creative nonfiction. No, let's call it fiction. Whatever we call it, it's entertainment, and those of us who read everything, including milk cartons and cereal boxes, will find it entertaining.          As smart as my dog is, she doesn't read. But she does snarf up these little biscuits. There is one little, bitsy problem. They come in divideable biscuit shapes and are a little hard to  eak apart. So, be a sport. Don't be stingy. Forget about  eaking them in two. All the better for her teethies, my dear.          ~The reviewer is an award winning author and poet.
