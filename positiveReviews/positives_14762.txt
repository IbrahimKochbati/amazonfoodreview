Since I discovered this wonderful relish in England a few years ago I have tried to buy replacements in this country. It is served at most pubs in the UK as part of a Ploughman's Lunch along with various cheeses and other goodies. It has a wonderful taste and texture, unlike anything in this country. I recommend every one buy some. I've found it only on Amazon.
