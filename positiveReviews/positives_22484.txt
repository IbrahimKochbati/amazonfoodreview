For mother's day, I surprised my wife with a Great Northern Popcorn Machine and a case of the Great Northern Popcorn Tri Pack.  The machine works flawlessly and the popcorn was absolutely delicious.  At about $1 per popping, the results couldn't be better or most cost effective.  The machine was easy to assemble, and adding the pre packaged and pre measured popcorn ingredients was a snap.  Delicious homemade popcorn in our theater room is a huge hit with the family and friends.  I highly recommend Great Northern Popcorn products.  A reputable company that stands behind its products, and delivers.
