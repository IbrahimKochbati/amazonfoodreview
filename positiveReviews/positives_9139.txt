The three ounce  eakfast cookies are a small meal in a cookie and the individually wrapped cookies are easy to keep in a desk drawer, or to carry in a back pack or  iefcase.  They are good for people on the go, and have reasonably balanced nutrition (6 grams of protein, 6 grams of fiber, 8 grams of fat).  They are listed as having 300 calories.  They have an expiration date noted on the wrapper.  I have tried many different flavors over many years, and have never found a flavor I did not like.  The listing of ingredients is in white lettering on an orange background on the wrapper,and is almost impossible to read, but the ingredients can be obtained from the Web page.  The Morning Glory cookies have a good combination.  It is worth sampling the different cookie flavors, and you will undoubtedly have favorites.
