I bought this bonsai as a gift. It came within a week, and was well packaged. I'm posting this review on the second day, so I'm waiting to see how it survives. It came in a rectangular pot instead of a circle like the one in the picture. That I don't mind. It was also very healthy. Wish it had a drainage tray.          I see people saying that theirs is nothing like the picture.  I guess the style of tree will vary depending on who you buy it from, since there are different buying choices. I got mine from Sheryl Shop.          Update     Check your bonsai for spider mites. Mine got infected before I knew what they were, and died within a year and a half after buying. Was still a nice tree though.
