I thought that the white pepercorn was such a deal. The only place in town that carried white peppercorn is Whole Food with costs 6.99 for 1.7 oz. For the price of 8.99 plus 3.99 postage you get 16 oz. It came to the house in about 3 days and works great in my peppermill. If you you a lot of white peppercorn or mix with black peppercorn it's a great deal!     Pam
