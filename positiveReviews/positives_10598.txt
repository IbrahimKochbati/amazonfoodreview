Seriously, this is one of the best bar gadgets one could ever find! It just arrived today and I've already put it to the test. It's so easy to use and makes stuffing blue cheese olives quick and easy! It's also extremely well made with a great design. Only thing that could make it better would be a button feature that dispersed pre made belvedere martinis :D Definitely no complaints.
