I do get bouts with reflux, and try to cut back on things like coffee, chocolate, mint, and other things that they say accentuates it, but this coffee doesn't taste very good. Kind of metallic.          We made it with filtered water in the same coffee maker we use for our regular  ands, and it was just ewwww. Sorry to the folks who make this but it just wasn't there for me.          I like New Orleans coffee because when they add chicory, you get robust flavor with less caffeine and acid because you don't need as much to be satisfied. You can also buy chicory and add it to standard coffee. My favorite of the standard  ands is still Folgers.          Mrs. Olson was right. Mountain grown is the richest coffee.
