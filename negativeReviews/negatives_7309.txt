I found it to be watery. At least, more so than other canned pumpkin. It's likely less watery than fresh pumpkin puree, but definitely more watery than Libby's or the generic  and at my grocery store.          The texture upon opening this organic one was smooth while the other was irregular. It made my pies taste a bit bland as well, but I also made a mistake with the crust (too much water) so that had a hand in my pie disappearing in two days rather than one.          I really liked the art, though. The label. It's nice.          Basically, it won't make a fantastic pie, but it'll do. Especially if you would like organic. I suggest straining through coffee filters (placed over a mesh colander) overnight or longer.
