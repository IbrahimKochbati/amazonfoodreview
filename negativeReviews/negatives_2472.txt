This was my second purchase of this product. The first purchase was great, but this 2nd must have been a defective batch. Most packs did not cook correctly because they were not sealed tight and opened during cooking. That caused them to burn or not cook completely. I did not send them back because I kept thinking, maybe the next one will be better, but I was wrong. There are a few packs left, but I'm hesitant about microwaving them. I will probably purchase some again, but it will not be anytime soon.
