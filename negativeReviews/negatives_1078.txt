Come on Amazon, give me a  eak.  Powdered tofu?  Get in some real food and I'll buy more from you. I went looking for table sugar. You've got 100 weird kinds of sugar (that you expect me to buy in bulk!) but NO just plain sugar. I'm not eatin' any more of this rice and tofu  ead either.          Sorry I just had to rant.
