I am on a diet, but there are there are times when I like having a small snack.  A pack of Melba Toast doesn't cut it   just five small, dry crackers for around 100 calories.  The jerky is very tasty, not too chewy, not too sweet, and just the right amount of food.  It takes a lot longer to eat a packet of this jerky than a pack of Melba Toast, too.  So, I highly recommend this jerky for people who want something that is low fat to nibble on.  The beauty of this is that you can also buy in bulk.  I don't think you save any real money doing this, as opposed to getting it retail, but it is very convenient to always have it on hand or just a "click" away!
