My son was recently diagnosed as having food sensitivities to wheat and especially to milk cheese.  Not having mac and cheese (his favorite food) was especially hard.  We tried some other products, but the general consensus was they tasted like cardboard.  When we tried this the whole family loved it.  It doesn't really taste like Mac and cheese, but tastes great non the less.
