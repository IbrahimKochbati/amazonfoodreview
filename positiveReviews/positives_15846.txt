I originally gave this item one star because the box was busted open and I only received about half of the box worth of product. I tried the return link but it indicated that the product was non returnable and that I should use the "help" link instead. I went to the help section and reported that the shipment was damaged and in my opinion should be replaced. After I submitted that, I received confirmation that the message was sent and that I would receive a reply within 12 hours. A couple of hours later I went to check on the shipment status of another item and noticed that a replacement box of cat litter was being shipped. I checked the invoice for it and it showed a total cost of $0. Once again, Amazon made things right.
