My two boys LOVE the semi moist Pet Greens treats. Admittedly, Biscuit is not overly choosey, but Chicken has turned up his nose at the other treats I've tried. Now, if I say "treat" or even reach toward where I keep them, Chicken comes running. They DO smell weird    kind of like not so freshly mowed grass, but the odor quickly dissipates and the kitties love 'em. So far we've tried the chicken (ironically enough) and the salmon and both have been equally well received.
