Gluten free and sugar free white chocolate bars with 20g of protein... doesn't get any better than this.  These are my favorite out of all the flavors of Think Thin bars.  I'm on Subscribe and Save and get 2 boxes per month.          Buying from Amazon is the cheapest way to get these bars.  I save about $5.00 per box as compared to buying them at the store.          I have to admit the first bar I had tasted slightly chemically... I think it must be the vitamin B I'm tasting??  But now they are absolutely delicious and I crave these bars!!
