I was quit suprised how big this tug a war toy was when I opened it.  My two pit bulls love it.  Unfortunetly, I read the precautions that stated not good if dogs shake and throw it around, after already purchasing it.  That's what one of my dog loves to do...so I try to give it to her while in her dog crate.
