This is excellent for a baby's first taste. The pouch size is perfect and it actually lasted me two days, as my baby is still just learning to eat solids, therefore didn't have it all. The top makes it easy to refasten, so it doesn't go to waste and can be used again. I love the pouch, it's easy to get all the product out wihtout making a mess.
