I rescued a 3 year old Doberman Lily a few months ago who was not in the best of health, and after getting a checkup at the Vet, I found out that she has heartworms.  After all the shots she just received, she had to go through a lengthy treatment with more medications than I would ever want to give my dog, but I had no choice.  I was determined to get her healthy again, and knew that good nutrition would be especially important during this time of illness and treatment.  Lily received Olewo Carrots and Red Beets with her daily meals, and while the carrots improved her digestive health, I feel it was the Olewo Red Beets which played an important role in her recovery.  The red beets are a great natural detoxifier and helped get rid of the toxins in her system from all the medications. It also helped strengthen her immune system.  At the very beginning of her treatment she was sleeping most of the time, but after adding the red beets to her diet, she had more energy and was more active.  Lily is doing well now and will continue to receive Olewo to make sure she remains in good health.
