There are some types I really like  especially Southern Sweet Tea (which is actually a lot less sweet than Southerners really make it).  The raspberry and peach are also good, and not overly sweet.  Urologist has banned artificial sweeteners from me as they do kidney damage.          I did not care for the herbals, and thought there was a bit too much green tea in the assortment  but I found friends who like those flavors.          It was to taste test, and it was fine for that.  I don't think I will buy assortments again, as I have found what I really like.
