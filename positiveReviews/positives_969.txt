We found this on our recent trip to England and had to find it as soon as we got home.     It's a standard for the Brits, and for us now too.  It's been around FOREVER.     You can use it in so many ways; pies, trifle, donuts,     cakes, by itself with fresh fruit and whipped cream, or even on french toast!
