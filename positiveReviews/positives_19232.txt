   class "tiny"  Length:: 0:34 Mins              My dog can get bored easily and when he's bored he's destructive and annoying.  So I try to find anything I can to keep his mind busy and hopefully wear him out.  He figured this toy out fast and gets his food in about 2 minutes, but he does really love it and he often settles down after playing with it.  My other dog (the chi x you see in the picture) has absolutely no interest in working for his food. So I guess it's not for all dogs, but if your dog is busy, this is a good way to occupy him for awhile.
