We use these crackers on a limited basis; they are great for packing in a picnic lunch when others will be having sandwiches, and they add crunch to split pea soup.  They are really great, however, in meat loaf if you can't have gluten  or  yeast, or in meatballs, or any other recipe that calls for crushed crackers.
