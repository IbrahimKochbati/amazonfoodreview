I have used this product for several years. I am diabetic and needed the additional immune system boost especially in the Winter time. Nobody wants cold or flu and I found that if I used this if I even thought I was getting sick it almost stopped it in it's tracks.  Sometimes I got a little achy from a cold but the cold did not last as long  nor was it as severe as it was without the tea.  My BF uses it now too, he has had the same experience with using it when you have just a beginning of a cold or flu...this stuff either knocks it out or at least deminishes it.  I thought the flavor was very good, almost sweet. It smells wonderful too :) I am not a sweetener user but this was good drinking hot or iced regardless if you sweeten.
