I use this product as a base for my own chile.  I follow their receipt but:  Brown about 1.5 Lbs of ground beef with 2 medium chopped onions and 2 or 3 cloves of fresh garlic (or more to taste) in the bottom of the chile pot. Instead of adding water, use Beef Stock.  Add 2 cans of drained different color kidney beans (like Red & Black).  Add 1 large can of diced tomatoes (including juices).  Add 1 extra small can of tomato paste.  Add Chile Powder to taste (I like mine spicy so I add 5 or 6 Tbs).  Let it simmer until it thickens (could be several hours) and enjoy!!!!
