Ive tried the Black Cherry version of this drink, and I prefer that to this. Both are light and refreshing and WAY better than fruit flavored waters. YUK! You can tell by the taste these are definitely fruit juices but without the sticky, thick, sweetness of a non carbonated drink. This orange tangerine flavor though   there's this weird taste to it one that hits you immediately. Not quite bitter, not quite metallic, but definitely not yummy   unless you like bitter fruit   not sour   bitter. Maybe it's too much carbonation for my taste. If you've tried the other flavors and are looking to try something new   think twice about this one. It is tingly and refreshing, but I won't order it again.
