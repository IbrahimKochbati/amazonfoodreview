Delighted with my first ever Irish Oats Steel Cut.  As a Diabetic this should help me with my blood sugar    natural carb with a slow release!          Cook up a batch in the slow cooker and use left overs (microwave) for a couple of days.  Great . . . will be purchasing more.          Thanks McCann's and Amazon.
