I was exhausted, hot, and dehydrated when I spotted this in a concourse store at JFK airport.  I was about to get on a 6 hour flight and water sounded too unsatisfying   but juice sounded too heavy.     I'd heard the rumblings about coconut water so I looked to see if I liked any of the flavor options   I can't stand mango and just about everyone adds it. I was relieved to see the O.N.E. coconut water with a "splash of pineapple" so I figured I'd give it a go.     The woman at the counter said "are you sure you want that? It's $4." Steep! But it's an airport, what can you do? By that point I was so wanting to try it I said sure.  After all, it would've been $3 for a sticky sweet soda.     I was so happy with it that I kept the empty tetra pack with me the whole time I traveled so I would know which one it was.  It doesn't taste heavy (in case the pina colada reference made it sound that way) but the pineapple takes the edge off the green coconut water.  It's amazing.     I was happy to find it on Amazon   as I'm definitely hooked.     Since I have Prime shipping, it gets to me in 2 days (if I order it right, that is!) which saves me a trip to various local stores trying to see who still has it in stock.     I'm totally thrilled with this stuff.
