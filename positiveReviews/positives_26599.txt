Brewed coffee is almost non existent where I am from, and we in our family would almost always buy instant coffee. Brewed coffee never tasted quite right or coffee like to me before. But one day my  other  ought home some free samples of this. Then I understood why people loves  ewed coffee. The flavor and taste simply blew me away.
