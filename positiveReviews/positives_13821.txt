85% less fat   a bit too good to be true? Couldn't find this on the shelves in Canada.  Been searching for it since first showcased on the Dr.Oz show.  I bought about 10 jars intending to give it to family and friends (especially those who are mindful of their caloric and nutritional intake) as part of their Christmas gifts and am RELIEVED to find it tastes good!  It will be well received by my family and friends.  I have only tried it as a spread and look forward to using it in smoothies.
