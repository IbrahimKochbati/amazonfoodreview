I could tell as the pot of coffee  ewed that this was not going to be my type of coffee.  The smell was not that of a good strong smelling, fair trade bean that I am use to.  It is hard to describe but the smell was slightly better than my tennis shoe.  Despite the smell, I still gave it a fair chance.  As I sipped on the first cup, I kept saying to myself, "this will get better."  I thought I just needed to get use to it.  While I was able to finish two cups, I cannot say that I enjoyed them.  I cannot describe the taste other than to say that it was an original coffee taste.  It's something I have never tasted before in a coffee.  And the aftertaste was super long lasting.  In fact I  ushed my teeth twice and was still tasting the coffee an hour later.  As far as being easy on my stomach, it was no different than other coffee.  I still had to use the toilet after I finished my second cup.  I would not pay money for this product.
