We switched to Canidae ALS after the tainted food scare.  We were very happy with our choice and I recommended this food to many people.  Then they changed the formula.  They made this major change without so much as a sticker slapped on the bag notifying their customers.  The change sent my dog into a tail spin.  Severe vomiting, diarrhea, hot spots and itching were the main symptoms.  And since she had always done so well in Canidae, I never dreamed it was the food.  After weeks of worry and meds and messes to clean plus prednisone for the scary hot spot (my vet shrieked when she saw it!) I started researching and a food change was the only thing that stopped the problems.  She lost 5 lbs. in a very short amount of time.  Canidae's customer service rep. blamed me for not transitioning properly!  Talk about adding insult to injury!  Not a good food for us and not a good company to deal with.  Wish I could give ZERO stars.
