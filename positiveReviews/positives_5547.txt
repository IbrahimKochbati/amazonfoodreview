I got these because I'm on a low carb, high fat diet and was wanting something high fiber that also packed a bunch of omega 3s. These fit the bill pretty perfectly! The flavors aren't all winners, but they're all really strongly flavored which is fantastic for a crispy snack. I like the flavors of these more than I like the flavors of potato chips, honestly.          They don't strike me as slimy when you chew them, but your mileage may vary   I mean, yeah, the texture is a bit odd (imagine chewing a bunch of sesame seeds, similar kind of texture) and they do get stuck in your teeth, but hey   that's flax seeds for you. If you don't like (or tolerate) the texture of flaxseeds, there's nothing these crackers can really do for you.          The flavors: My favorite is the Mexican flavor, hands down. A close second is the hemp (rosemary! nom nom!) and the cinnamon maple (higher carb, but only barely. Really cinnamony). I'm not really a fan of the onion garlic and italian... I love garlic, but it's just too much. The original flavor is icky, it just tastes like soy sauce and flax. Meh. I like soy sauce, but it's not really an ideal flavor for crackers! If you like Japanese rice crackers you might like that flavor.          I think the cinnamon maple would probably be a fantastic flavor to spread nut butters on (chocolate almond butter, almond butter, peanut butter, whatever).
