When i received my fly trap all of the traps were closed so i called the "help line" and asked the guy if that was normal. the man on the other line spoke such poor english i could hardly understand him, i had to get him to repeat everything he said. he told me that the heads closed were ok that they would open in a few weeks i was like well ok, so about a week passes and the traps still are closed and they begin to get black spots on them so i call the help line again and he says oh thats normal  it should go away in about a week . so time goes on and still the traps remain closed and the black has completely covered two of them. so i read online that if they get black spots on them to immediately pop the head off and a new one should grow back, so i did but the rest of the leaf just got really black and began to limp over.  ive had my fly trap for about 3 and a half weeks now  and they still haven't lost the black on them, one of the heads have opened but it is dead. i did EXACTLY what the instructions said to do but still no luck. dont be fooled by the photo on this item it is NOT ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THE SIZE IN THE PHOTO. it is maybe a third of the size in the photo. very disappointed!
