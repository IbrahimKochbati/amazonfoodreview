I found Dogswell products 7 years ago when my vet recommended the Glucosa Chondro chicken strips to help my dog who had just had patella luxation surgery on both his knees. The vet said the supplements would help my little one avoid arthritis in his later years. I'd say so! He's pushing 8.5 yo and doesn't show any signs of slowing down even though he has pins in both knees. He jumps high, runs like a maniac and is spry as a pup. Between this and various other dogswell treats that care for his eyes, hair, coat,  eath, teeth, etc, he's going strong which makes momma very happy. All in all, I love these products and recommend them to all my friends who have dogs.
