The bag was smaller than I expected, but that's probably just me being bad at estimating things.  The salt seems good, however, I was a little disappointed that the photo showed the salt to be much more vi antly colored than they actually are.  I mean, they are pink, just not so  ight pink as it shows.  The salt has a good flavor though.  I'd say it was worth the price.
