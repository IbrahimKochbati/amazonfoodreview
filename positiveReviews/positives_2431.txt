Though this coffee was expensive compared to regular store bought, I am a huge fan. Coffee usually tears up my stomach so I've been a tea drinker for years, but this coffee has a low acidic level so I can handle it. The aroma is enticing and the bag lasted a long time. I am a fan of beans versus grounds so that was another plus. It was prompt and the packaging ensured my coffee stayed fresh and intact.
