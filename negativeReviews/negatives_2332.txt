I and a friend tried these tablets before sampling various kinds of foods we'd seen suggested online, but noticed no effects whatever. We used them as suggested, then even tried multiple tablets at once. Maybe I got a bad batch or maybe we have unusual taste buds, but in any case it was very disappointing. Makes me think I should have tried the berries themselves instead.
