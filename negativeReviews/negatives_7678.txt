These cookies are OK.  They are individually wrapped in sealed pouches so I expected them to be moist like many of the competitive products.  I found them a little dry but still soft.          The flavor was fine.  They weren't too sweet which is kinda what you get with oatmeal cookies.  I thought the chocolate and almonds would make them sweeter but they were not.  You can taste the oatmeal which is nice as some other oatmeal cookies you can only taste the added ingredients.          Overall, a milder cookie that was a little dry, but not too dry, still soft, good oatmeal flavor, sweet but not too sweet.          If that is what you are craving then give these a try.
