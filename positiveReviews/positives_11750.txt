I received these on a very hot day 97 degrees. They felt very squishy so I let them sit a day before trying.     Oh my goodness, they are so moist and just the right mix of coconut and chocolate, almonds. The bar is big enough to be a good small meal if you eat 6 meals a day 3 snack size and 3 small regular. They are soft and a bit chewy.          I know I can trust Pamela's products to be gluten free and of the highest quality. I highly recommend these, they taste like a home made cookie that Grandma made. Super yummy.
