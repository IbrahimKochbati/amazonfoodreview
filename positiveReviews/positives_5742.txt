The written description of this tea was good enough to get me to put it on my wish list this xmas. My wife prefers the sweeter fruitier teas, such as Republic of Tea's Kiwi Pear, and I generally go for traditional blacks, Prince of Wales, Oolongs, etc. But this tea is perfect for both of us! I always liked good vanilla teas, and some coconut teas always blew me away as well. Our pals at Steep Tea still make some of the best teas in around, so we were pretty game to try this Lana's tea   it always feels good to try out teas by the 'small guys'.          Anyway, there was this unbelievably great aroma to this tea that we couldn't pin down until one of our pals pointed out "This smells like Bailey's!" Bingo. Need I go on?
