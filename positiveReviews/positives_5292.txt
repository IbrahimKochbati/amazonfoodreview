The Switch in Orange Tangerine has perfect serving size to keep the sugar in take at its minimum and naturally. The carbonated sensation adding extra awakening sparks to the taste buds!          That was my wife's first impression.          I like the "fruit soda" idea.  It maybe a better alternative soda if it is indeed made of natural orange, but it taste likes other carbonated orange flavored soda on the market.  The only benefit you are getting and not from the regular soda is it contains daily recommended 100% vitamin C. If the price is right, doesn't hurt to try.
