I like peanut butter and the crunchy is the best style that I have found. (My wife likes the creamy version) you can't ask for anything better for a quick meal than peanut butter and crackers or a PBJ sandwich.          What I like about peanut butter is that you get 7 grams of protein and 2 grams of fiber but only 3 grams of sugar.  Easy and fast to get a snack and tastes great!  Jiff if a great choice!
