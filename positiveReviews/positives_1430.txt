We love Popchips, but they're hard to find at our local grocery stores. I was very excited to find this variety pack, which has 6 flavors (some of which we'd never tried before) in single serve packages right around 100 calories a piece. Our favorites were the original, sea salt & vinegar, and sour cream & onion... but all of the flavors were good. These were perfect for snacks, but they also made for easy lunches. We'll definitely order again!
