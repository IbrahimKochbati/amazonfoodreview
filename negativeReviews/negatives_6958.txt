This was one of the first  ead mixes I tried after learning I couldn't tolerate gluten.  Fresh out of the oven it is amazing to eat with just some butter jam on it.  It even smelled like real  ead when baking and was just incredibly yummy freshly baked.  I could have eaten the entire life, haha!  But I found the next day it was not as good, even with retoasting it in the oven.  It was very heavy and dense and had a strange bitter taste to it.  Because of the dense texture though I think this would work really well for sweet  eads.  I tried using it as a pizza crust and it was just way too heavy and overpowering of more delicate flavors like cheese and mushrooms.  The flours used in this were a little hard on my tummy too.  Overall it is okay, but I am not amazed.  I would probably skip this unless I plan to use the whole loaf fresh from baking or just for sweet  eads.
