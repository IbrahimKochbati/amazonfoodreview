Both my boys have autism and are on strict GFCF diets.  The foods by ENER G are very good.  These cookies, although rather crumbly, are delicious!          My youngest son calls them 'white cookies'.  I am a VERY picky eater   but do enjoy eating a white cookie with him!  You should try them with some chocolate melted on them...oooh divine :)
