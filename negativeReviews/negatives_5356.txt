If you are expecting the x bold, smokey, gourmet flavor of a Starbucks or Seattle's Best, you may be reaching for a miracle that isn't there. I grew up in the 60s with a younger  other who needed to use sacchrine on everything because of his diabetes. Sacchrine is absolutely no sugar substitute. Anyone who has used it knows.          The Puroast Low Acid is really not a bad alternative if you need a low acid blend because of acid reflux, sensitive stomachs, etc. Was it weaker than what we're used to? Certainly. Is it bolder than, say, Folgers medium roast. I would say that it is. Though milder than most bold roasts (that's a dead giveaway in opening the pouch. But that is probably because of its finer grind than even the mild and medium roasts with a coarser mill. The finer the grind, the lower the aroma retention. Yet, because it is a finer grind, the taste is much bolder than the smell would give away.          This is also a smoother tasting French roast than I was expecting (possibly because of its fine grind), but it was a very pleasant taste.          The cost and the flavor may be inconsequential to those who do really need a low acid coffee. For that reason, it was hard for me to rate using the star system because I am a coffee lover without a low acid need. Perhaps someone with a low acid need finds that this coffee is superb and would otherwise give it four or five stars.  If you are a regular coffee drinker, any flavor that isn't cultivated in what you are used to will make others, especially weaker blends seem more inferior than they probably are in reality. When I was in Asia, there were times when I would go weeks without a cup of coffee, and after that, the mildest of blends tasted oh so good to me.          Although I was unable to try it in an espresso machine, the finer grind lends itself to espresso; and that may be something you might want to try with this blend to kick the flavor up another bold notch or two.          Another possible idea is to use this blend in a French Press (yes, although I know the finer grind isn't typically conducive to the Press; perhaps a filter may be used).          If you suffer from acid reflux, sensitive stomach, etc., this may be very worth the try for you.          If you don't need the low acid beverage, stick with your standard  ands.
