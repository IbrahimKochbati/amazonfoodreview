I received my order in April 2010 and was disappointed to see that the expiration date on all three packages of coffee is June 2010.  The same bags of Starbucks at the grocery are usually almost a year out for the expiration date.  I won't be buying coffee online again.  Otherwise, the service and shipping were just fine.  I'm almost always happy with my purchases from Amazon   this is a rare exception.
