The chips are delicious!! I absolutely love them. They are very addicting. Excellent for people with gluten wheat allergies. The only thing was that during the shipping process the chips became  oken and crumbled, not as bad as I thought after reading other reviews but still quite a few crumbs in the bottom of the bags. I would order again.
