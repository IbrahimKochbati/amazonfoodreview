These pretzels have a nice crunch and a lot of nutritional value, but their flavor is very bland.  Bland with a hint of cinnamon.  I wish I'd tried a single bag before buying an entire 12 bag box, but they're not available in stores (at least where I live) and the reviews seemed fairly positive.  On the  ight side, they do leave you feeling comfortably full for minimal calories.  A recommended diet food for those who have the fortitude to place higher priority on protein dense snacking rather than flavor.
