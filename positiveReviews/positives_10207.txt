My dog used to work the pills out of cheese, peanut butter, meat cubes,  occoli (yess, she loves this stuff), and anything else I thought of to hide the darn things in. Then I tried these. She loves them. She practically swallows them without chewing, so no time to find the hidden pill. She likes both the chicken and the beef flavors equally.     Thanks Pill Pockets for making administering the daily pills to my geriatric Cushings dog so easy!
