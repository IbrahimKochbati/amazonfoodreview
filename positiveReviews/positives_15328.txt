First, I found this product for about $80 90 through dealnews.com (I think I bought it at newegg.com) and I've seen it for similar prices when on sale and even less than what I purchased it for at the time.  I love this unit.  It is soooo much better than coffee maker coffee and very easy and fool proof.  It is expensive to buy k cups, but cheaper than buying coffee at DD or somewhere else (saves on time too).  Plus I am going to try to get the reusable k cups to make it cheaper and more friendly to the environment.  I do like how you can select either a small or large cup with this unit and I like how the water tank is dishwasher safe.  I wouldn't get anything smaller than this unit because you will be filling up the water tank constantly even with a single user household like mine.  I would say I get about 4 5 cups from this unit until having to refill.
