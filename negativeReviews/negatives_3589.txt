This is expensive for a 50 lb bag.  I looked around for a long time, found that it was the most economical at cos*co, one of the membership stores.  It isn't available at the regular warehouses, but at 'cos*co business' store.  You don't need to have a business membership card to go there.  Price   $ 14.21 for a 25 lb bag, I live in Phoenix, AZ and there is one such store near I 17 and Indian School road.     J
