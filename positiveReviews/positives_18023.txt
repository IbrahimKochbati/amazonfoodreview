I have to proclaim how impressed I am with the service. First, the shipment arrived in 2 days which is much faster then the last time I ordered a wheatgrass kit which was from another company that took 2 weeks to arrive. The package was organized perfectly and the instructions were clear with there business card attached to it. Also they included a hand written note thanking me for my business and insisting me to call if i had anyway questions about the growing process. I did follow up with questions and they were very polite and helpful. It is a fantastic service and I think anybody who is looking to order a wheatgrass should consider purchasing this particular wheatgrass kit from rejuvenate forever. It is all organic by the way.
