These are delicious! A very thin wafer roll with a melt in your mouth chocolate coffee filling. What's not to love about it!!     The only reason I don't give it 5 stars it's not because of the wafer itself but because of the condition it arrived, most of them were  oken and even melted, I'm sure they were exposed to a very warm environment.     Still yummy dough!!!!
