I discovered these wonderful tomatoes and yes, they are worth paying for. Unfortunately in my area they are approaching 6 bucks a can and never go on sale. Walmart has them for about 4 dollars a can, but I prefer not to be tied down to that store. The local "Italian mart" advertised san marzano tomatoes, 4 cans for 5 dollars  too good to  be true? yes, in fact , these are very ordinary tomatoes. I am on the hunt for these wonderful tomatoes at a good price.They turn an ordinary recipe into a gourmet experience.
