This hot sauce is thicker than most hot sauces. It is not particularly or overly hot, like a Ghost Pepper sauce, or some sauces that are made from the habenero; nor is its secondary flavor vinegar, like Tobasco. This is a particularly well balanced sauce. This is the wife's favorite sauce, and she rarely likes hot stuff. Too bad it's so expensive.
