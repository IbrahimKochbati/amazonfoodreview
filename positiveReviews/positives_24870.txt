My 3 year old Akita is very picky when it comes to food, and usually refuses most of the standard dog treats. This is the only thing he visibly appreciates; BTW, when offered Chicken Happy Hips of the same  and he's not as interested.          The only downside is the price; don't ever buy it in retail stores   they charge 2 3 times more than online retailers. Even then it's rather expensive.          Hope this helps.
