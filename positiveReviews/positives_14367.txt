I really like these Zukes (made in the USA) treats.  I  eak off small pieces for my 8 lb and 9 lb dogs.  They like the peanut butter flavor.  However, I never give them more than a whole one in a given day because of the glucosamine and condroiten.  (I believe an excess of these ingredients is not beneficial but in limited dose may be helpful.)
