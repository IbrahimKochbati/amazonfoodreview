   class "tiny"  Length:: 1:39 Mins              What I loved most about these dog treats:     1. No greasy residue on my hands     2. No fowl smell     3. They are organic     4. My dog loved them     5. My cat even loved them          6. One last thought...they are very hard treats. When you own a Beagle, keeping their attention is a chore. I can hold these treats in my hand and only expose one corner of the treat for my dog to crunch. This keeps her attention longer in situations like a nail trim or Vet exam.          ****** (6 stars!)
