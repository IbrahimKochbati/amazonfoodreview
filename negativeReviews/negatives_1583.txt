Sometimes if too many flavors are mixed together, the result tastes like none of them.  This doesn't taste like orange or tangerine.  It tastes, to me at least, very sweet and sort of orangy but not tart at all, and I like my citrus type sodas to be tart and sort of sour.          Still, great for those who are trying to get away from the high fructose corn syrup diet.
