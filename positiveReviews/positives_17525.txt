I am fat, but I'm currently trying to change that. Not being a body builder I wondered if this product was for me, and I was very happy with the results. I keep these with me on days that I can't prepare a meal or when I am tired of my diet food and want something that has a little more hearty flavor. Caveat is: just like turkey jerky, if you didn't know you were eating ostrich you might think that it tastes a bit different. Keep in mind that ostrich tastes more like chicken than beef.          The Good:     Compact (will fit in cargo pocket)     Tasty     Fairly low salt     Semi Moist (good or bad depending on your taste)     80 calories     Great for diets          The Bad:     Hard to open sometimes     A bit large to fit in pocket (won't fit in standard pants pocket)     Co workers think you are weird to eat Ostrich     A little expensive          So, with all that said, I keep a box of these in my cupboard at all times just in case I need a snack and I don't want to go off diet. Buy a box and see what you think.
