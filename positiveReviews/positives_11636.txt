I switched to this cat food from Purina One mature formulation. Chicken is the first ingredient! Many other cat foods have rice or chicken by products as the first ingredient. This food is specially formulated for the older, indoor cat. The other good thing about this food is that it is low in protein (27%), which is important for older cats because of decreased renal function; Purina One mature formualtion has too much protein (37%). My cat really likes the taste and he had no problem switching to this food from Purina One. This is a high quality cat food and although it is a bit more expensive than other  ands, my cat is well worth it!!
