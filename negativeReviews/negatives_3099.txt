Background:  I am a big fan of Trader Joe's coffee.  We have a Bunn Coffee Maker with the slow sprayhead and a Capresso Burr Grinder.  So, I guess you could say that my husband and I really like our coffee.  I usually use a combo of The Joe's coffee at TJ's and the decaf Columbian.  I do make it strong  I just realized how strong when I googled it a moment ago.          This Coffee:  I used 1 Tbsp per 5 7 oz. cup.  I couldn't find the directions on the package as some people did  it must have been in small print.  It was like mud.  Way too strong.  Even so, I didn't like the flavor of the coffee.  It reminded me a lot of store bought Maxwell House or Diner coffee.  It had a bit of a burnt aftertaste to it for me.          So, for me, I'm going to stick with Trader Joe's coffee.
