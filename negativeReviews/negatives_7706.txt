I ordered this solely on the reviews but found this very muddy and bitter. I do, however, question the freshness of the cups. Both boxes cups were "puffed up" They looked like they were about to explode?? Have never seen that before. I like Coffee People's Doughnut Shop, if that gives you an idea of my taste.
