Any whole grains that are cracked open can go rancid easily, as they contain higher fat content than their processed versions.  That's why it is recommened you store whole grain flour in a freezer, only up to several months.  I don't know if it is the manufacturer or Amazon who did not warehouse these cans properly, but they are BAD!  I usually read many reviews before I make purchase decisions, but as I did not have any problem with one can of this multigrain before, I did not bother to check this time.          Well, after a week of consuming this, my baby got sick.  As we were expermenting with variety of solid food, we weren't sure what was giving him diarrhea.  We removed almost everything from his diet over the course of that week, until we were left with this cereal and his formula.  Only then, it dawned on me that it could be this cereal, again, with which he didn't have any problem before.  As I read some reviews only at that point, some parents had pointed out these were rancid, and I could confirm my can smelled bad as well.          Too bad Amazon would not accept returns on these products.  The trouble we went through warrants more than a refund   my baby developed a severe diaper rash due to constant bowl movement, and we ended up seeing a pediatrian to get a prescription for his open blistered bottom.  This was his first diaper rash ever, and no diaper rash cream would help as he was going too frequently.  I feel terrible for not checking when I first opened this box.  Please learn from my mistake and DON'T BUY THIS!
