I have a huge, overweight cat that I adopted from the pound.  He doesn't eat that much, but he doesn't move much either, which I think causes his weight problem. He normally eats an expensive dry cat food recommended by his vet. When I chose Petite Cuisine, I was a little concerned that it would add to his weight problem, but it seems the opposite has happened.  Within a week, he seemed  to have more energy and has been up playing and chasing invisible mice around the house.  We've never seen him move this much in the two years that we've had him.  I don't know if his diet was missing something that this cat food contains, or if it's just coincidence.  I haven't weighed him, but he seems a little lighter, and he sure acts like he feels better.  We're feeding him half a can a day in addition to his dry cat food.          The only downside to the fish flavors is that I notice that the smell hangs in the house, even if I scrub up everything after he eats.
