My dogs LOVE duck treats and have been getting the chicken happy hips for years so I though I'd give the duck a try.  Bad idea.  The treat was too tough and stringy for my small female Westie to pull apart and she ended up choking and vomiting.  I order by subscription and had to make cuts in the strips with a poultry shear to use up the 6 bags.  I too hate the fact that these are made in China, but my little guys need extra condroitin and glucosamine so I'm back to the chicken formula.
