Came quickly.          I used it for the first time in baking and it has a nice sweet flavor.  Good value especially with the free shipping.  This is the first time I've used agave so can't compare it with other  ands.  I can say it was sweeter than sugar and I'll be cutting down the amount I use in recipes.  I am experimenting with cooking with sugar alternatives and I liked how this one tasted.
