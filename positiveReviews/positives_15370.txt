This is a very good tea  it tastes somewhat like an infusion of green tea with a peppermint leaves. It comes from Chile and it reminds me of Yerba Mate. It is natural and has many health benefits  mostly detoxifying the system. All the women in my family drink it and they swear it keeps their system in tip top shape and bc of that, their skin is supple and beautiful. Some of them are between 55 72 and their complexions are flawless. I developed some age spots on my face and have started drinking it on a daily basis.     The package contains 12 boxes. It was wrapped well and it arrived on time. The price is extremely reasonable for this product. Thanks!
