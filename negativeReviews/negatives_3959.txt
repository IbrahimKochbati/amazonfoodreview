Weird black stuff inside the ravioli.          Otherwise, really tasty. My favorite, but the black stuff freaked me out. Not sure if it was bugs or what. I started slicing the raviolis open. I found a lot of them have black stuff.          I did an internet search to see if there was maybe an explanation. I found none. The ingredients are plain. I must have gotten contaminated cans or something.          Unbelievable how people think that reporting bugs in the food, or some kind of decontamination, isn't helpful. Some people are really lame. Well, enjoy eating your bugs, idiots.
