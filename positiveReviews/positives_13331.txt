I picked up a box of The Gluten Free Pantry's Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix at my local grocery store. As a newly diagnosed Celiac sufferer, I was feeling depressed and starving! This has to be the best  ownie I have ever tasted. I did add pecans to it. It is so good with gluten free moose tracks ice cream on top!!! My husband says these are better than regular  ownies. When I discovered I could order bulk on Amazon, I was estatic. If you have Celiac or if you just want a great  ownie you should try these.
