I too purchased this product thinking it might not be a flavored product, and before it arrived I looked it up to see that there was some rumor as to a coconut flavor.          So, lets get this out of the way. *********Do Not Purchase this is you do not like flavored coffee. It is flavored.          The first thing you notice is a deep coconut aroma, almost akin to Hazelnut in its presentation. The initial mouthfeel is good, a light roast but a snappiness to the roast which settles in nicely with the flavor, which     has a definite dark chocolate taste without the bitterness.          The finish is semisweet chocolate, Jamaican coffee and faint toasted coconut.          Bottom Line: if you like flavored coffee with coconut hazelnut cocoa profiles, you will like this coffee.
