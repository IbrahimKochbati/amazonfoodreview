We had the same issue with this product. Half the flat was improperly sealed, and resulted in an expired food issue.  But you can spot the unsafe jars because they have dried up & turned solid, resulting in a different sound when shaken.  Also, when opened, these "bad" jars are mounded up in the middle and have a rotten smell.  It may be that the product was frozen in shipping, and the expansion caused the seal to  eak.  I have requested a refund from Amazon.          Our baby did love this meal though   it was like Thanksgiving dinner.  The ones that were still edible were delicious, and are one of his favorite foods.
