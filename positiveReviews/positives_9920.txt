A few years ago I was on vacation in CA and saw these in Trader Joes.  I wanted to  ing a treat back for our dog, whose name just happens to be Buddy; when I saw these I knew I had to get a box.  Buddy absolutely flipped out over these molasses bisquits, which are shaped like little ginger ead people.  Now, all I have to do is ask him if he wants a Buddy bisquit and he runs to the laundry room where his treats are kept in a plastic tub.  He's getting a 6 pack of these for Christmas this year!!  After doing a lot of research I found this web site has the best price!!
