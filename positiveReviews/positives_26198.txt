I drank this tea after my first trimester of pregnancy for its numerous health benefits.  It is pure red raspberry leaves and great organic package.  They are  not individually packaged, they come in a foil lined paper lije package and there are no strings or tags, just steep add agave or honey to sweeten...it is a little bitter but not bad and drink!
