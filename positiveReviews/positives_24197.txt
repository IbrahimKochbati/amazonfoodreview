Had the pleasure of trying this while visiting my parents back east. It is really really good! Not too salty and just plain tasty!! I was bummed to realize I couldn't purchase it around Seattle so I had to order some! Once you try this I know you will be hooked and at 35 calories a cup, it's a pretty safe addiction : ) Enjoy!!
