I recently switched to this dog food from Nature's Variety Prairie.          So far I am very pleased with the dog food.  When switching, I was looking for a certain range of protein and fat and Merrick Whole Earth met the requirements I was looking for (a protein reading of 27%, a fat level of 14%) and chicken meal and turkey meal is the main source of animal protein.  The dog food was also "highly recommended" by an independent dog food advisor site that I use.          My dogs really (really) like this food and they eat as soon as I put it down (even their morning meal which is dry food only), so the taste of this food must really be to their liking.  Despite the fact my dogs are rescues (and who knows what they were eating when they were wildly roaming the streets), they are picky and with the Nature's Variety, half the time they never ate their  eakfast.  Also, I have large dogs but for some reason they like the small dry kibble and this is kibble is on the smaller side.          I have also noticed a positive change in their stool.  It is a little firmer and a bit smaller, meaning they are absorbing more and eliminating less.          I actually really liked Nature's Variety while they were eating it but so far I think the switch was a very good one.          ****PRICE INCREASE UPDATE: I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWER THAT THE PRICE INCREASE EFFECTIVE IN THE PAST WEEK IS AN ISSUE AS THE PRICE FOR THIS FOOD HAS ESSENTIALLY DOUBLED.  I MAY BE WRONG BUT THIS APPEARS MORE OF AN AMAZON INCREASE AS MY BACKUP FOR BUYING THIS DOG FOOD IS PETCO AND THE 8 POUND BAG IS CURRENTLY SELLING FOR $10.42, ABOVE BIT ABOVE THE AMAZON PRICE INCREASE BUT WELL BELOW THE CURRENT $16 FOR AN 8 POUND BAG.  SINCE I LIKE THE FOOD (AND MY DOGS LIKE IT) I CAN JUST BUY IT THERE.
