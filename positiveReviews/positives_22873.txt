I was very glad to finally find a way to recieve my favorite tea.  I am unable to purchase Cinnamon Stick Tea in the Nashville and surrounding areas...and drank it on a daily basis when we lived in Texas. So when I searched and found you had it, I was thrilled.  The price is very fair.  I bought 6 boxes and the price total for each box and shipping were close to the grocery price I had been paying.  Another, YEAH!!  I will order again and again.  It took less than 48 hours to arrive once my order had been placed.  This was way above your 5 star rating!!!
