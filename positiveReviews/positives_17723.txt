One thing great about America is a lot of choices. One thing bad about America is a lot of choices.  How many different kinds of coffee do we need?  Now I have to make another decision when really I just want to enjoy a nice cup of coffee in the morning; should it be decaf or regular,  ewed or instant?  Some of these choices are easy, for example, instant is never a substitute for  ewed coffee, Starbucks is better than the vending machine at work...These choices I can make in a second.  Now I need to decide about the acid in my coffee!          I first discovered that coffee had a fairly high acid content  when I inadvertently drank a really old cup of coffee at a gas station.  I think I also discovered acid indigestion!  I also realize that many people have an acid intolerance from a medical standpoint, therefore low acid coffee is a good idea.  Is it good coffee?  This package was a French Dark Roast which I felt was extremely flavorful, in fact after the first few cups I was actually making the coffee somewhat weaker to suit my taste. In no way did the low acid impact a full bodied flavor.          I recommend the coffee regarding flavor, however I suggest reviewing the coffee on Puroaast's website to discover the real ingredients and acid percentages.  The package seem to give no details except for the statement "Now you can drink coffee again".
