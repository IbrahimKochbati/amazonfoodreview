It's a small drink at just 8.3 ounces but that's probably the size drink we should all be consuming so I wont ding it on that point. It's made with good ingredients and as it says `No Sugar Added' but don't let that fool you into thinking it's low in sugar having 34 grams. A Coke contains 45g of sugar but it's almost 50% larger so even without adding sugar this is a drink that's fully loaded. In defense of The Switch at least the sugar is natural with no high fructose corn syrup. Obviously it has no caffeine which I have some issues with so that's a plus over soda although at 36g of carbs it seems a bit high and 140 calories is nothing to sneeze at.          So it can't be considered a health drink since you can get lower sugar, carbs and calories from a similar size glass of Tropicana orange juice. So how is the taste? My wife described it as tasting like soap. I wouldn't go that far but I will say the despite its good ingredients it actually tasted artificial to me. I wasn't a big fan and personally I'm going to stick with water and orange juice.... and beer.
