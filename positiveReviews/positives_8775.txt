This cereal is so tasty   it seems like you are eating one of those not good for you sugary cereals that kids love. They are very similar to Cinnamon Toast Crunch. They do have a slight "healthy" taste, but it's hardly noticable. Even the kid's will enjoy this cereal which has an amazing amount of fiber in it   especially to taste so good (not like sticks)! I used to eat raisin  an b c it had 7g of fiber and still tasted okay. Now I eat this, which has 9g of fiber and tastes awesome!     I highly recommend it. Oh, and the squares are small, about 1 2 the size of CTCrunch, so it's the perfect size for toddlers to pick up and eat. They'll think they are eating candy, but you'll know it's good for them ;)
