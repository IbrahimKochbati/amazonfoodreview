My dog has allergies.The vet tried all kinds of medicine,steroid shots and special shampoos.Finally she put him on a prescription diet.He went from a little dog who loved mealtime to a dog who had to be coaxed to eat.Mealtime became a chore for us both.So I did a little research and discovered the Natural Balance line of dog foods.From the moment I opened that first bag everything changed.My little dog was enjoying his food once again.He loved the food from the very first bite.I also got him the canned food.This dog food is all I will ever feed my dogs.Great quality for the price.I highly recommend it.
