Our son loved this.  Great to take with us when we are going out as compared to big bulky and heavy bottles (ie Earths Best baby food)  The only issue we had was that my wife, for some reason, could never open the top.  She would always screw it up somehow.  Easy fix however, just have daddy open it.  Also wish it was re sealable, but our son ate all of the Gobbe Gobble 95% of the time so wasn't an issue.  Overall, very pleased and wish we had tried these out earlier.
