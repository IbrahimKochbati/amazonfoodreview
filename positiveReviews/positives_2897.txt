Patak's sauces have many uses but I always make a basic chicken curry.  A friend from India taught this recipe to me, and now I always have a jar or two on hand.  If you want you can get one of the Indian pickles relishes as a garnish.  This is easy but is a bit time consuming with all the dicing and sauteing.  Typically the recipe as written takes an hour or so from start to finish, and serves 3 4 adults.  I always make at least a double batch; it's just as easy and that way I have leftovers to freeze and everyone can have plenty to eat.  You can use any rice, but basmati is so fragrant that it is what I prefer.  Some Indian groceries have frozen Naan you can heat in the oven for an even more satisfying dinner.          Ingredients:     1 1 ½ lbs chicken  east cut into 1 2" cubes     1 cup nonfat plain yogurt     Salt     3 tbs Patak's curry paste, flavor heat depending on your taste          1 (generous) tsp cumin seed     1 (generous) tsp mustard seed     1 small onion diced     3 cloves garlic diced     2 medium potatoes, diced same size as chicken cubes     2 3 carrots, diced same size as chicken cubes     1 14 oz can diced tomatoes with juice     ½ cup frozen peas     2 3 tbsp cooking oil     Salt to taste          1.

Stir constantly or else it will burn.     5. Add carrots and potatoes.  Saute until potatoes are just about ready to eat.  You have to stir very frequently or they will stick burn.  I do not let anything caramelize.     6. Add chicken yogurt mixture.  Saute a few minutes until chicken is about half cooked through.  Lower heat to low.     7. Add tomatoes and let simmer until the juices cook down a bit, and chicken is cooked through.     8. Add peas for color.  Add salt to taste.     9. Serve over freshly cooked basmati rice.  Remember to soak the basmati rice prior to cooking or it will be hard.
