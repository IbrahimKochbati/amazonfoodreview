The listing of this item is a bit unclear. It is a six pack, which means it comes as six boxes, each with 8 packages of cereal for a total of 48 packages.          The cereal is of fine quality. When my wife tasted a sample, she immediately said "I could eat this every day." Which is why I bought it. As for myself, I think it's a bit bland, but I have a sweet tooth.
