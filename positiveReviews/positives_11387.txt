We tried this rice and liked it a lot, but didn't realize how good it really is until it was gone and we cooked a batch of organic basmati rice from the food coop. The Rice Select rice has wonderful taste and firm texture. The local rice that we cooked tonight was mushy and tasted terrible. I tried a bite and didn't eat any more. I've been spoiled and will have to be sure to always order in time so we never run out again.
