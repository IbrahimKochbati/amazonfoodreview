I am a coffee lover. It is one of the few pleasures of my life so I was excited to review this product.  Once received I opened it up and gave a good sniff.  I know to some that may sound stupid, but I love to open coffee and have the aroma surround me, this coffee did not do that as much as others that I have used.  I had to really give a good sniff to smell the aroma, but it smelled pretty good once I got my nose in there.          I set out to  ew myself a pot.  I followed the directions and enlisted my husband to have a cup with me.  Now usually I do not drink decaffeinated, so I was just a little concerned. Decaf to me can taste very flat. But I waited and a nice smell filled the air.  Finally our coffee was ready and we both sat down to taste this product. My husband smiled. He loves any coffee that has Arabica beans. He looked at me and said, "ummm this is really good."  My turn.  I sniffed some more, I'm a real sniffer before anything goes into my body.  It still smelled pretty good so now for the taste test.          Okay, it was definitely different than the Dunkin  Donuts coffee that I'm use to and love. However,it had a smooth flavor, but  a little richer than I like and I didn't seem to notice that it was decaf, that was a good thing.  It was flavorful and made a pretty good cup of coffee.  Hubby liked it a lot. So I would have to say it was a winner, a good rich coffee flavor and a good price.
