My boyfriend and I received the Keurig Elite  ewer as a Christmas gift after lusting after the  ewers all of my friends and family owned.  We have been using a trusty Cuisinart 10 cup drip  ewer for a couple of years now, and while it has served us well, it was a challenge to get a consistent cup of coffee.  Somehow we always ended up on either the too strong or two weak side of the line, despite our best efforts to be consistent.          I should mention that we are students living on a very strict budget and we knew that the Keurig would end up being a little bit more costly than our Cuisinart.  But we really liked the idea of  ewing coffee a cup at a time and cutting down on waste.  Thankfully, my generous sister surprised us with one for Christmas and it has really turned out to be a perfect gift!          WARNING!          I feel it is important to mention that we almost sent this back.  Considering how I've been singing its praises, I'm sure this is surprising, but there is something that ALL new Keurig owners should be made aware of.  The first maybe six or so cups aren't going to taste quite right.  Apparently this is a common problem.  There is a sort of plastic y taste going on, even with coffees that don't normally have that fake finish.  It's the newness of the  ewer.  Run five cups of straight water through it and then one cup of white vinegar to get rid of this problem.  I can't imagine how many people must have received one of these and then written it off immediately because of this issue.  It's a quick fix and a one time deal, so be aware of that ahead of time.          Now... as I was saying:          The Keurig Elite is the entry level of the full size  ewers (Keurig also makes a Mini, but we have friends who have had problems with that model).  It has a great water carafe that only needs to be refilled once every six cups (convenient!).  There is no digital display unlike some of the higher end models, but we don't find that a problem.  For those wanting to set up  ew times in advance, though, that might be a make or  eak feature.  We manage just fine without it in our household.  It has the two cup sizes and, although they are only two ounces apart in size, the difference between the two can be quite dramatic.  I like a milder cup of coffee while my boyfriend prefers something stronger so I  ew on the larger size while he picks the more potent smaller for his cup.          When we turn the power on in the morning it takes about 3 minutes for the  ewer to heat up and then it really truly does  ew the cup in less than a minute.  SO convenient when you want to make a quick cup on your way out the door!  No muss, no fuss.          We tried out several pods from the 12 k cup sample pack the  ewer came with (another bonus!) and since then we've also tried out a few of Keurig's other offerings.  It's really hit and miss in terms of what you'll like and what will be positively NOT your cup of coffee.  Here are some of the blends we have tried and enjoyed:             "
