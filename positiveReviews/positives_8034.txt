Modeled after York Peppermint Patties, these mints are a perfect match of chocolate and sweet.  The honey filling is a bit thinner and sweeter than most mints this style, but you can tell all the ingredients are natural.  The thin layer of gooey honey complements the unsweetened chocolate beautifully.  I highly recommend this tasty treat!
