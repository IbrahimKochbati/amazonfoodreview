First off, it was disgustingly difficult to tear the jerky with my teeth, unlike the other flavor, sweet and hot.          Then after LITERALLY 1 after week there was fuzzies on the jerky. You buy a 1 lb. bag so it lasts, right? I didn't realize what it was so I ate a little bit anyways. Then another week goes by   I'm talking about with the bag sealed completely up   and there is a crap ton of white and green mold all over the jerky.          They had it on sale because it expired 10 years ago.          OH AND YOU CAN'T GET A REFUND :P
