Choo Choo R Snacks Chiptole Habanero Country Cut Beef Jerky is by far the best store bought beef jerky I've tasted!  I love thick cut beef jerky   and the spicier, the better!  They score a AAA+++ from me.          USPS really messed up on my shipment of this item, but Choo Choo sent me extra, as an apology for a slow delivery   something they really did not need to do.  Choo Choo is tops in my book!  From a disabled Vietnam Vet, a big THANK YOU!!          Alan Hoffman     Wyoming
