I have a small  eed service dog and his raw food diet can be a challenge when we travel. I bought this food based on the fact that it's the closest ingredient wise to what I'd feed him at home. He loves this food and literally spins in circles when he hears me open the container I store it in, something he has NOT done for other foods in the past.          My issue with this food is that when I received the bag I noticed through the window on the back of the package that the lower third of the bag seemed to be mostly crumbs; in transferring the upper portion of the bag to a smaller storage container I found that most of the bottom of the bag was almost "dust". The "dust" makes my dog cough even if he eats slowly; adding a little water to his bowl has helped with this issue.          Edited to add: I've added a photo so you can see what winds up in the bowl.          Since this was my first bag of ZiwiPeak I'm not sure if this is normal for the  and   at this cost though I feel it shouldn't be. It could be that the product had settled and the heavy weight of the upper product caused the lower portion to settle and  eak, or maybe this bag just had a really rough time in shipping. Either way, this product makes traveling so much easier and my pup just loves having it at home as a treat so I've ordered a second bag today and will see if the crumb issue repeats itself or not.          UPDATE 01 16 12: The second bag (Lamb) was received in perfect condition this time.          Would purchase again and recommend.
