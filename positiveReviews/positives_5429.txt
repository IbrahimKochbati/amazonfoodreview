We have a Michigan based coffee cafe (now renamed "Biggby's") that stomps Starbucks. (Biggby's was originally named "Beaners," a name that encountered resistance as the franchise spread.) Their     dark roasts are to die for     none of the K cups come close (except possibly for G.M. Espresso). So this build it yourself K cup is a near perfect solution. The downside is that the  ewing takes much longer and there is a bit of splatter. Also the caps are a bit difficult to snap down. Recommended.
