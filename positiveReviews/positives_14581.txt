This stroganoff doesn't have a robust flavor, but with a little help (spices, cheese, etc.) it can help make for a good meal.  I haven't made it with a meat base, which would probably help the flavor,  but I added cauliflower, okra, kale, Parmesan and Cajun spices and it turned out pretty darn good. Some other creations have turned out decent as well ( but a few others not so much!).
