My one year old cat ate a few of these and seemed lethargic.  Two weeks later I gave him a large helping of these     and I thought he was going to die.  He laid around and would not eat or move for two days.  I will not feed him these     again.  Same thing happened to my parent's cat after eating the salmon variety.
