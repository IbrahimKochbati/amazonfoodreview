I have been giving my dog these treats for years, thinking I was giving her something healthy.  I took her to my vet because she has been having bladder issues.  That's when the vet told me not to give them to her because they were made in China.  She said dogs have been getting sick from eating jerky treats made in China.  I can't believe I have been poisoning my poor little dog!  I will never buy another food product from CHINA!
