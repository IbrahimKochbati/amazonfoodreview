Love this water.  Feels silky smooth and clean when you drink it.  Really love the bottles.  Nice and sturdy.  No squishy plastic.  And since I had hard time buying and carrying from the grocery store, love the automatic delivery to my back door!  A little more money than store  ands, but well worth it.
