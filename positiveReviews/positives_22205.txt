I had used Chebe Bread mix in its original form. That was quite a while ago, and for some reason I'd gotten away from using it until recently. Chebe  ead has come a long way! I ordered a case of the All purpose and used it to make a nice gluten free pie crust for my Thanksgiving Pumpkin Pie, and also then used it to make stuffing. And then MORE to make dinner rolls...all came out very well. I am very pleased. If you go to the Chebe website you can find many more recipes which is nice because for each recipe it tells you which versions of Chebe Bread Mix can be used for which recipes (and now there are 5 or more varieties of this Mix). I am planning on trying out the Sticky rolls and a pizza crust with this Mix so I will see how that goes. The mix, is very fine and fly away....so you want to take it easy when opening it and pouring into the bowl or you will have a fine dusting of powder around the area you are mixing it in. I have really been pretty pleased with the items I have made from the Chebe All Purpose Mix.
