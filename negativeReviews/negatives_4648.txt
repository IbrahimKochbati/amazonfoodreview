This tea is definitely worth trying as you may find that it's your favorite.  I've tried Irish Breakfast from most online Tea Shops to try to find one that is superior.          Taylor's has some fine teas, but I didn't find this variety superior enough to keep buying it.  I do buy their Yorkshire Gold, which is much stronger and great for when I need that.  I found that I enjoy Trader Joe's Irish Breakfast Tea just as much or more than this  and at around half the price or a little less.
