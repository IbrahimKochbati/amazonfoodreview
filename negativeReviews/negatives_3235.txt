This bone is nothing more than a very expensive dog biscuit. My dog consumed the entire thing in less than 20 minutes. He really enjoyed it, but there is no way I'm going to buy another one. There are a lot of  more durable bones that cost the same or less than this one. I do not recommend it at all.          My dog loves Nybone products. All the other ones seem to last a long time. I guess this "Edible" line is just made for eating and not chewing. In my opinion, the price is way too high for what you get. I highly recommend other Nybone products, but steer clear of this one.
