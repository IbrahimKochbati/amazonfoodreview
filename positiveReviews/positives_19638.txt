i have eaten these chips for years. they are no longer available where i live so i have had to start getting them online. they are usually good. this particular batch wasnt the best i've had. the chips seem too thick and somewhat stale. so its too bad when you get a bad batch and you bought a box of 12. oh well. hopefully my next batch will be better.     however they were shipped immediately and arrived over a week before i was expecting them so that was great.
