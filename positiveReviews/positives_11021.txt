My dogs love these chews. I have 5 dogs   all various sizes and temperments. I have found they are similar to Greenies but much less expensive. In addition you can often find coupons and sales on these. It is so good for their teeth to let them chew, and even my Yorkie at 11 years old has wonderful teeth because I have been giving her things to chew on since she was a puppy. As always, I do not let my dogs chew on any  and of treats without supervision.
