My husband thought this was alright, but I just couldn't get myself to drink more than a few sips. Let me also add that I am not a soda drinker so this may be a great alternative for someone who is(hence the two stars), but this is an opinion from a non soda drinker.     I had a hard time tasting anything close to Kiwi or berry. It was more cherry or ?? to me. I would've liked a little more fizz to it, I consider it just lightly carbonated. Also, I cannot imagine consuming 33grams of sugar in just over 8oz, it tasted WAY to sweet for me.     It kind of bothers me to see 'natural flavors' listed in the ingredients too...like what type of 'natural flavors'??? I would've hoped all the mixed fruit juices would've been enough...
