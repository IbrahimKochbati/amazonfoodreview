While I don't normally go for dark roasted coffees, the Puroast Low Acid French Roast coffee was astonishingly appealing. The lack of bitterness and bite actually enhanced the rich nutty flavor. I sampled this product both with cream and without cream and found both methods quite enjoyable. I generally get a stomach cramp within a few moments of drinking coffee, but it was conspicuously absent when drinking this  and. I can only conclude that the low acid is the reason for the change. Additionally the low acid nature of the beverage made it more smooth on the palate.          The price of the coffee may deter many coffee drinkers, but for those with a sensitivity to acid and a refined taste for quality coffee the price is worth the added benefits. In comparison, Starbucks French Roast is offered in a 36 ounce package of ground coffee for slightly more than Puroast is offering their 40 ounce package of whole beans.          Keep in mind that Puroast also offers a variety of other flavors including half caff and decaf flavors. Additionally Puroast offers a membership program that reduces the price when the consumer agrees to have the product placed on a regular shipping schedule. When drinking coffee is a regular part of your life, auto shipments seem like a good idea and low acid even more so.
