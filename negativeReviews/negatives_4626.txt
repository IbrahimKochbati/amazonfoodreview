I bought this for my girlfriend. I have one and she loves to make fun of me for it, so I thought I would get her one.  I ordered this from a different seller than I bought mine from, and though the tree is nice, it isn't as artfully "crafted" as mine was.  It was just looked like a small bush in a pot, unlike the one in the picture. I got mine from  tabletop bonsai and it closely resembled the picture.
