These kernels are fresh and H U G E!! We had a problem with the order being mis routed by the carrier (not the fault of Gerbs) and Gerbs jumped in to not only correct it but to offer a tidy discount on my next order for my troubles.  These kernels are really nice oven roasted.  We love them and have found our preferred kernels!
