My twin girls love this! I wanted to give them fish but wasn't ready to prepare it myself. These are perfect! I've tried Sprout pouch meals and didn't really like them, so I was a bit wary of these. But these pouches are easier to empty, and the texture is great for 10 month olds. My girls eat it right up.
