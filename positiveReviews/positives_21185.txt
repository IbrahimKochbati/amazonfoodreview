This chili is very good, my family loves it. This chili is mildly seasoned, not too spicy. You can also use it as a starter and add a can of your favorite chili beans and if you want it not as thick add a small can of tomato sauce. It will go farther with less expense. Tastes great and makes an easy meal. Goes great with corn ead too.
