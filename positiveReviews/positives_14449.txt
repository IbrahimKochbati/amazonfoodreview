Wow! Wow! What a great product. I am 70 and have been slow cooking steel cut oatmeal for over 50 years. Now, that my 96 year old Mom is living with me and I am her caretaker, I have been looking for some nutritious short cuts and decided to give this a try. I was dubious because even some of my favorite  ands like Trader Joe's Instant Oatmeal were dismal. This is the real McCoy. We both like chewy, filling hot cereal without a lot of sweet taste and this is simply delicious. One cup provides two servings   one for each of us. How thrifty is that! I still slow cook a quart of oatmeal 2x a month but am going to Subscribe & Save on this one regularly.
