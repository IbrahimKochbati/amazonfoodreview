I love these crackers but not the price change.          At $29.00 for 12 boxes; ~$2.42 a box if you sign up for "Subscribe and Save" I was ecstatic. I most definitely signed up for "Subscribe and Save" delivery.          Not yet 2 months later I learn the identical item now cost $55.00 for 12 boxes.          Bait and switch?          I think these crackers taste better than their clone parent the Triscuit. 12 boxes is just right for a two month period  I keep a couple boxes at work. Use them for  inging nibblies to gatherings and more importantly as a stable of my diet because I choose not to eat  ead and I love food items with ingredient lists like this: Whole Wheat, Expeller Pressed Oleic Safflower Oil, Sea Salt, Natural Tocopherols Added to Preserve Freshness.          As a big city dweller who uses public trans (I don't own a car)I rely on Amazon for certain essential groceries. I pick them up at the UPS store on my walk home from the train stop. It's one of the main reasons I'm a "Prime" member.          I'll need to cancel my "Subscribe and Save" for this item. I like to think Amazon wasn't going to send the next delivery without notifying me of the new price.          I can get Triscuits anywhere for ~$4.50 a box, sometimes less. The Back To Nature cracker is now $4.59 a box.          It's likely the pricing situation is out of their hands but I'm so disappointed!          Looks like I'll be checking out the cracker selection at CostCo.
