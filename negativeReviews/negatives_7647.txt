i wanted to like these cookies, i really did... however, i have to let you folks know that while they come out of the package as fresh, they were a bit mealy and dry...          did that deter me from eating them? of course not, they're cookies!          but honestly, this is not a product i would avidly seek out at the grocery... there needs to be a bit more moisture and texture in the product          and you definitely don't want to eat these without having a nice big glass of cold milk on hand...
