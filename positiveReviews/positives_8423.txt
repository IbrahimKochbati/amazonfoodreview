I was first reading reviews @ the Starbucks website for this coffee, and it had great reviews, so I though I might give it a try. I went to downtown and bought a bag of whole bean Caffe Verona and boy I am glad I made that decision.          Out of the bag, the rich dark  own colors and the aroma punished me of the years I lived without this. A blend of 80% Yukon Blend, an array of Latin American and Indonesian coffees; and, 20% Italian Roast   a blend of Latin American coffees.          In the cup the flavor was weak, bold as it smelled it did not seem to have the same score in taste. Light bodyweight with a woody feel to it. The light acidity is topped off with a fruity overtone and bittersweetness.          Let me be as bold as to recommend Peet's Arabian Mocha Java. If you are looking for a Multiblend similar to this, Peet's fixes whatever lacked in Starbuck's Verona. This Mocha Java is balanced, nutty and smooth. It has excellent acidity, with a slight bite.          If you want a closer mix to this than I would mix the Arabian Mocha Java with Sumatra and you will be very satisfied with its resemblance.          There are many coffee drinkers who hate Starbucks because of their corporate culture and popularity. I just like to try anything which looks interesting to me and this caffe Verona is one of the better speciality blends Starbucks has offered.          I almost forgot to mention, whole beans always rule . Even if you ground your beans at your nearest cafe or supermarket, the moment the ground coffee comes in contact with the air, the aroma starts to leak. Grind your beans moments before you put it to use, you will see notice the change in taste and aroma when you are drinking it.
