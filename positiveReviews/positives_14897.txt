This morning as part of our ongoing Dolce Gusto tests, I had a Caffe Lungo.  Very good, has a strong flavor and was even good after it got cold (which, sadly, tends to happen to my coffee a lot of time).  I will continue buying this flavor.  I also like this because it is just the coffee   no superfluous milk capsules to lay around and take up space.  This is definitely a repeat flavor for me.  Reminds me of the Nespresso "Livanto" flavor which used to be my favorite.
