What a lovely tea this is! The rose petals are abundant in the mix, and when you  ew a pot of tea and then raise the cup to your lips, the full, sweet scent of roses greets you! This tea is perfectly blended and balanced! Its color is coppery golden, very warm and luscious. I just want to drink it every day, for relaxation and sheer enjoyment!
