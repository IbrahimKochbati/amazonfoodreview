With all natural ingredients and mostly real fruit juice, I'm not expecting this drink to taste like soda, punch, or anything like that, but I when I tasted it, I felt myself wanting more. I could really taste the orange flavor coming though, but they somehow missed me on the tangerine side. Tangerines are very sweet, so I was expecting that to be the predominant flavor, but instead what I tasted was mostly orange, which left a somewhat sour bitter aftertaste in my mouth. This drink wasn't bad, but given a choice, I'd rather drink orange juice or tangerine juice with seltzer. I don't see how this drink improves beyond that. Switch's other available flavors tasted much better, so in some ways this was a disappointment.
