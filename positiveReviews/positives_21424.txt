This is a purely smooth and silky soup, not a bean or veggie chunk to be found. I loved the consistency actually; it was like a light cream rather than a starchy thick soup. But, I can never leave well enough alone. I saut&eacute;ed three sweet carrots in 1 teaspoon of oil, then added the soup to heat, and served it up with some chopped avocado. The combination was delightful.          The soup on its own had a wonderful taste and just the right amount of flavor in terms of heat (not too much!), spices, and salt. Nothing was over the top, and it all melded rather nicely. There was just one note that kept tasting "off" to me. It was mostly in the aftertaste, so it didn't deter me from devouring the bowl. Nonetheless, it left me curious, so I checked the ingredients and finally spotted the culprit ... cilantro paste. Yes, I am one of those cilantro supertasters who generally dislike it. Cilantro fans will find this soup spot on, but luckily, the cilantro is far enough down the ingredient list that even most "cilantro tastes like soap" people (such as me) will enjoy it.          I will purchase this soup again either for a quick lunch, or as a recipe starter ... it has great potential! Plus, I love that it is both dairy free and soy free.
