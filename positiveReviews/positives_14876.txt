Added 2 hours later: I am buzzing! There's caffein in that tea!          ADDED 102308: Just made a big pitcher of iced tea (it's 83Â°F here in Moss Beach! That's HOT, for us) with this tea. The aroma is unbelievable... flowery, spicy... and the flavor is quite good... Earl Grey with a kick. YUM.          OK. The smell and taste of this is Earl Grey tea... what do you expect? The selling point is the organic, fair trade aspect. Also, the elimination of the middle man, but I'd have to review the books before I'd believe that. I am fortunate enough to be in a situation where I can afford to support these important principles. If you are too, then buy this instead of non organic, non fair trade.     Hmm, after previewing I tried to change my star rating to 5... I mean, it's the principle of the thing... but I was not able to.
