This gravy is great!  1 4 cup has only 50 calories and 6 grams of carbs, which has helped my husband loose over 20 pounds.  How?  Well the low carbs helped, but the main feature that makes low cal low carbs part of the formula work, is the great taste.  This gravy has got a peppery tang that makes it just right for spicing up eggs or chicken or anything else you might through a white pepper gravy over.          And I don't know if you have tried other packaged sauces, but I have, and generally they aren't very good even when freshly made.  Worse, these sauces tend to get 'strange' in the fridge overnight.  (Oddly watery, or jell like... yuck)  This S&M Gravy mix doesn't do that, which means that it's good for several meals.          Highly recommended for the gravy challenged.
