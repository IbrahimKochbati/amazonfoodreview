This sugar is simply wonderful! Wonderful for you and tastes wonderful! I use it in my coffee and I bake with it. Everything I've baked so far turned out pretty delicious. I love this new alternative from cane sugar. The texture and the taste are different, dryer, more subtle sweetness, hints of caramel. I am very pleased!
