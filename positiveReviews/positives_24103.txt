My family needs gluten free products for some very serious health problems. Many products that I try to bake with just don't taste good. Cravings place TASTES sooo good that my boys have no idea that I am using "healthy" ingredients when serving baked goods or pancakes and waffles. Thank you so much for such an EASY and delicious product. Our family times at the  eakfast table actually happen more often now because they all know they will enjoy the food and the company. I can cook more often because it is easy and fun for me. We are all happy and healthier.
