Refreshing orange juice drink with a good kick to it. If you drink this first thing in the morning with  eakfast, it's sure to be a real eye opener! It's a "juice" drink, not soda pop. But it is carbonated, so it has the same bubbly, zesty fizz. The tangerine taste is better than Switch's black cherry. I would definitely buy a whole case of this orange flavor. Highly recommended!!
