I am fairly new to tofu but have already gone through 3 cases of this lovely tofu since the beginning of the year.     It's really great. Very mild flavour that is easily masked by what ever you cook it with.          I make an awesome instant chocolate pudding with this stuff, a box of silken tofu, some dark cocoa powder, stevia and then a bit of milk to loosen it up. Whiz in a blender or food processor and it makes a super creamy, dreamy delight that I don't feel guilty about eating and leaves me more satisfied than your standard pudding. Chill it and it becomes a realllllllllllllly thick, luscious mousse. (making myself hungry)          Anyhoo, I love that it's a shelf stable product that I can have on hand for impromptu meals.          Sometimes I make burgers by mixing it with smoked paprika, garlic, onion, nutritional yeast, oatmeal, masa flour, bit of nice oil until a thick consistency and fry up and they're just fantastic.          I think this is one of those foods that's so versatile and easy to play with and gives you a nice bit of protein to your diet.
