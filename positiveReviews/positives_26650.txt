Our dogs(Akitas) love this food. Even our boy, who has tract issues with digestion this works really well for him. I think sometimes he gets sick of maybe eating the same food, he'll skip meals every now and then but when mixed with rice he gobbles it up! We will dry another flavor soon. It's great for the price.
