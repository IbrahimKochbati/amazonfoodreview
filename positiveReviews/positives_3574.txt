I highly recommend these very tasty Kavli Thin Crisp eads. I wanted something different than just white  ead for sandwiches. I hate whole wheat. I love rye. I saw these, noticed the ingredients couldn't get much simpler and gave them a try. Topped with cheese, or a sandwich spread or whatever you'd like they're very tasty. I feel as full after 2 or 3 of these, topped of course, as I did with just white  ead. They're nice and thin so it isn't like biting into anything hard   just a nice crunch. The flavor isn't strong at all   it is very mild and nothing like a rye  ead you might have purchased in the past. Then I noticed that they are only 20 calories per slice. What's not to love? They taste good, they're whole grain, they're super low in calories, it's no crunchier than a potato chip, and I feel satisfied while chewing and after eating them. Oh   and they keep forever in the cupboard. I definitely will be buying these for a long time. :)
