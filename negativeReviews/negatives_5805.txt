There is something wrong with these peaches.  We have purchased Sun Maid dried peaches from grocery stores and Walmart in the past, and they were wonderful.  These are absolutely FOUL tasting.  I also notice that Dried Peaches are no longer shown as one of Sun Maid's products on the Sun Maid web site.  We also no longer find them in our local grocery stores.  Note that Amazon DOES NOT ACCEPT RETURNS on food products, so I highly recommend against buying these.
