I guess you do really get what you pay for!     It's expensive but top quality. There is a huge difference between this and any other dog food. It is real meat, not the garbage meat and garbage meat by products you get in most dog food that have to be processed for days on end to make them safe.     This stuff is the real deal and my dog LOVES it.
