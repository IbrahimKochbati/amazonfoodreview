What can you say about this product. It is canned ravioli and it is not bad for a quick meal. You can't expect a true italian raviolo from a chef boyardee can so for what it is it's fine. I keep it at work and eat it for lunch once or twice a week.     The price on Amazon is very good. I can get it at the grocery store for a dollar a can when it's on sale or 1.39 when not. This was $12 and change for 12 cans delivered to my door in 2 days with Prime. I will order this product again.     As far as the reviews saying they recieved dented cans. I didnt recieve any dented cans but that's not to say others haven't. (on a side note, my 7 year old niece loves this stuff)
