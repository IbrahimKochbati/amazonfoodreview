I first encountered this product at COSTCO.  When they discontinued it I decided to find another source.  I have diverticulosis and the doctor says I should avoid popcorn completely.  This is a wonderful substitute.  I also am diabetic and the product has no sugar and not too much carbohydrate either.  I thought 12 bags would last about 6 months.  I didn't count on my wife and son acquiring a taste for it as well.  Twelve bags is only about a three month supply.  While other flavors are available, I think the cheddar cheese flavor best approximates the flavor of buttered popcorn. I can now watch a movie and enjoy the old custom of munching on "popcorn".  (The product is also available in much smaller bags and 60 bags at once.  That is convenient for packing in lunches, but you pay more per ounce.)
