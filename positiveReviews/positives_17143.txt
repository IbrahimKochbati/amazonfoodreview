High sodium content notwithstanding, Campbell's Cream of Chicken soup remains my perennial favorite when it comes to canned soup. On its own or in certain dishes, it delivers reliable comfort in every mouthful. I love its creamy texture and full taste (thank you, high sodium!). My pantry is always stocked with this soup. Being able to purchase this in a family size at a great price on Amazon is an added bonus.
