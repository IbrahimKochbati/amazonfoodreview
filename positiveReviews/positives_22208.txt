I not only have non celiac gluten intolerance, but anaphylaxis to corn, so I use this mix primarily for tortillas.  I figured out that Chebe had changed it's formula when trying to make them one day.  I followed the package directions as usual, & got a gooey, sticky mess that would not roll out into tortillas.  Then next time I made tortillas I used 2 TBLS water (1 2 the amount called for), 2 TBLS olive oil & 1 egg & omitted the cheese.  This mixture seems a little dry, but once kneaded it works perfectly!  As one reviewer said, Chebe is changing back to the original formula & if it were unchanged, I would have given the mix 5 stars.  My 6 year old is also gluten intolerant & allergic to corn & he loves these topped with cheese to make cheese crisps.  Fry the dough & you have a great base for Navajo tacos or tostados!
