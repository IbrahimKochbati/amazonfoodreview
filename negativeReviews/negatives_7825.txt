Simply terrible in all aspects.  Far too salty.  Mushy overly soft texture.  Unattractive  own throughout, lacking any fresh vegetable color.  Smell is unappetizing and taste is far worse.  We've visited seemingly every Indian eatery in NYC from Curry Hill to Zagat top rated to rat infested taxi stands and pushcarts in the street.  Kitchens of India Navratan Korma wins the prize for being tossed in the trash in record time.  What we were reminded of is if you want edible prepared Indian food, purchase frozen entrees...NOT unrefrigerated pouches.  The most redeeming quality is nobody has yet to go to the hospital with an illness as a result of this product (but it has only been an hour so that could be coming).  Spoke too soon  my stomach is starting to hurt.  You've been warned.
