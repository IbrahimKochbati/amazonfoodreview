I bought this mix for my daughter's boyfriend, she made it for him and he loved it.  It smelled so good when it was baking that we had to try some ourselves.  The texture is a bit different than regular  ead but it tasted great.  Her boyfriend was happy to be able to eat  ead that does not taste like cardboard.
