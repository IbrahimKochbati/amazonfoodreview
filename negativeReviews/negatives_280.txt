These are actually pretty good little potato puffs, and best of all   no CHEESE!  (unless you like that sort of thing, which we don't so it's nice to actually find a potato side dish with no cheese in it).          Anyways    these are surprisingly good and they toast up nicely in the oven in like 10 minutes.  worth it for $10.
