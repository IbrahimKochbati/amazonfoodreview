I was sent the incorrect product and have never received EMERGEN C. It is considered a food and nonreturnable.      I did take a packet of Emergen  C Multi Vitamin and had the unpleasant and immediate symptoms of a headache and a racing heart. Since digging deeper into the ingredients I have decided to switch to a much "healthier" alternative called ULTIMA replenisher with NO ARTIFICIAL COLORS, FLAVORS OR SWEETENERS.
