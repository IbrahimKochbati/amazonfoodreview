Although I think it's good that they came out with low acid coffee for some people that have issues with too much acid in their diet, I really didn't care for this particular coffee.  I drink my coffee black and I'm used to tasting the pure flavor of coffee and I felt that this coffee had a strong burned flavor. Not my cup of tea, or should I say coffee.
