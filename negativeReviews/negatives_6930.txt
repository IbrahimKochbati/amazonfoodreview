I purchased a case of this  ead mix because my daughter has celiac and I find it so hard to find products at a reasonable price. I have made 3 out of the 6 packages and only 1 turned out.  There is no date on the yeast packet so on the last one I finally decided to use my own yeast and that did rise properly.  My packs are dated May 22, 2010 but like I said the yeast has no date on it like other products I have bought.  My bar code is 93709 30060.  So needless to say when I thought I was saving money it actually cost me just the same price as when I show at the store.  I will continue to look for products on the website.  Thank you for letting me vent a bit.
