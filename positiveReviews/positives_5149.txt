There is gum acacia in the list of ingredients.  Not sure if it adds anything to the flavor.  The orange and tangerine flavors do come through the fixx.  It seems to be a bit sweeter than orange juice.  Have achieved more satisfying and natural tasting fizzy juice drink by adding sparkling water to OJ.
