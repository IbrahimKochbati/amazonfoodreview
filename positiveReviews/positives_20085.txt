When it has came down Starbuck Via Ready Brew, I honestly found it to be one of the worst tasting instant coffee  ands that are definitely out there. I tried it out in a taste test just recently, and I was definitely appauled. But with Taster's Choice instant, I definitely knew it was one of the best. But when I found out they had on the go packs, I was even more impressed. Taster's Choice on the go packs are easy to drink, and taste just like you're tasting a freshly made cup of coffee each and every time. I loved the taste, because it was delightful, and carries more at a very inexpensive price. Overall, I really suggest you buy Taster's Choice on the go packs. They not only are worth the money, but the taste is definitely the strongest with each and every cup. Bottoms' Up!          Price: B+          Convience: B+          Taste: A           Overall: B+
