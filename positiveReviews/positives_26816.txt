I love this coffee and since i can't drink caffeine this is one coffee that is out of this world, wonderful full flavor. But the prices have gotten way out of hand. this is the draw back. so now i find myself trying other coffees from around the world, but to date, none have matched the flavor of illy Caffe Decaffeinated.
