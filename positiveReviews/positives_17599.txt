Purost low acid coffee will surely be of importance to those that love their coffee,     but NEED to reduce their acid in take, this product contains less then 1 2 the usual amount.          But since I don't get heartburn, or have acid reflux or stomach irritation problems,     I thought I'd sample this coffee on it's merits of good taste.          Puroast has a good strong French Roast flavor.     But I found the coffee to lack smoothness, and to contain an unplesant bitterness.          My opinion comes from comparing the taste of this coffee to the one I drink every day.     That perhaps is unfair because we all generally prefer what we get used to.     But I defiantly find Folgers coffee more to my liking.          HOWEVER: if the day ever came that I needed to have less acid or give up coffee,     The first thing I would do is switch to Puroast for my health.
