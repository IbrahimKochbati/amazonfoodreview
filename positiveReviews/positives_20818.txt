I get my favorite Earl Grey (Supreme) from Harney and I saw this tea while perusing their website. I bought a tin of sachets simply out of curiosity and it was a fantastic decision. The tea itself smells like Thin Mints   sooo yummy!   but the taste is mild and refreshing. It's like a peppermint tea but with much more depth than regular herbal teas. It's great for after dinner, but I've also been drinking it in the morning (instead of my usual Earl Grey   hell must have frozen over) because it's been so cold and dreary and this tea is a perfect fit. I love it and will definitely be buying more!
