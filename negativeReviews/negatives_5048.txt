I bought the Tug Jug for my dog because she was jealous of the cat's Slim Kitty food dispenser and she likes to play with rope toys.  I guess jealousy and rope are not enough motivation for her to play with it.  They need to be very food motivated because it is very challenging to get the treats out, and unfortunately she isn't a big eater.  It is a very sturdy and well made toy, and it is not as easy for them to get the food out as the other treat dispensing toys that roll around.  She only shows interest in it if I play with it with her.  I could see how it would be a great toy for the very food motivated dog who has a lot of dexterity.  Also a funny side note, the package came to me opened by the post office already because apparently on x ray in looks like something dangerous.  Someone thought that a person would buy a molotov cocktail on Amazon, I guess.
