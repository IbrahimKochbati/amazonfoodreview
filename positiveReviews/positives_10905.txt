These "certified organic" (by Oregon Tilth) baked dog treats are made as a pair of attached treats, 1" x 1.25", separated by a " eak" line along the longer dimension.  I put " eak" in quotes because, these treats are quite hard & do not always  eak right on the line.  The ingredients list is "Organic Barley, Organic Lamb, Organic Carrots, Organic Apples, Organic Palm Oil (Preserved with Mixed Tocopherols, a Source of Vitamin E), Organic Molasses".  The "Guaranteed Analysis" is Crude Protein:  9.0% min, Crude Fat:  4.0% min, Crude Fiber:  4.0% max, Moisture:  11% max".  FYI, despite being "certified organic", there is a "Not Intended for Human Consumption" disclaimer under the ingredients list.  Hence, I can personally testify to their delectability (or lack thereof)...  ;o)          However, my "test panel" certainly can   if they could talk, that is.  Testing these treats were our four rescued shelter dogs:  Jolene, a female Pit Bull & Boxer mix, Niki, a female Boxer mix, Cosmo, a male Boxer mix, & Mollie, a female Black Lab Mix.  In the interest of full disclosure, the first three dogs listed are all eager & voracious eaters   rarely, if ever, do they turn up their noses at a treat.  Mollie, on the other hand, is far pickier, being a tentative eater.          Once placed in a "sit", all four test subjects eagerly anticipated their treat.  For the test, I gave each of them a single 1" x 1.25" treat, having  oken them apart in another room.  I gave each subject a treat, one at a time.  Jolene, Niki & Cosmo took their treat without hesitation (Cosmo rudely almost taking half of my fingers with his), while Mollie had to give it a short "sniff" (as is her custom) prior to gingerly taking it from my hand.  However, once in their possession, all four dogs eagerly devoured their treat, crunching it up in short order, Mollie included.  None of the them had any trouble crunching into the treats, from Jolene who is only 40 pounds, to Cosmo who is 55 pounds.  Once finished, they all looked back up with hopeful anticipation in case I had another one to offer them.          So, based on these tests, I'd say these treats were a resounding success.  If I had to take anything away from their score, it would be to dock them Â½ star because they are so hard to  eak apart.  Of course, if you have relatively big dogs, you could always just give them two attached treats at a time & forego this issue altogether.  Therefore, I still awarded them 5 stars...
