I got these for the "health" benefits of fresh  eath, plaque and overall quality of stuff. I like to treat my kids now and again and they love them so much they have even taken to identifying these treats as "greenies"! Yes I know it is typically the tone but they even get excited if you say the word green now, its crazy. So I'd say, get these for your kids they will love them so much you'll have a hard time denying them at least one a day. I know I do.
