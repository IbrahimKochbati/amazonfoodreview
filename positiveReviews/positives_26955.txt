This is real beef jerky that tastes like meat, has good texture and is fun to snack on. I order several packages to come monthly on a subscription basis as my kids and I love this healthy snack.  You know the stuff they sell at 7 11 they claim is beef jerky?  Well, this is how this one is different:          1. The meat has great texture.  It is chewy, not  ittle. You tear bites off with your teeth.     2. The quality of the meat itself is quite good. Not too many fatty pieces   it tastes like beef, not chemicals.     3. Unless you order teriyaki, the jerky is not sweet. Original flavor is just a tad spicy, but tolerable for kids. It's what we always get.     4. It does not have an infinite shelf life.  I found it go bad within a month or two. Bad for nuclear winter. Great for a healthy snack.  : )          I love the little packages inside the big one. The jerky stays fresh longer.          Enjoy!
