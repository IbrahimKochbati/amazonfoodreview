I order Folger's Black Silk coffee for our office.  The staff here like a bold coffee without the bite of some of the "coffee shop" coffees.  Black Silk gives them what they want while still being mindful of cost.  I priced out coffees by the ounce and found that this coffee is a great value when I buy it by the 6 pack    even compared to the larger sized canisters that we were buying in the supermarket.  All in all, a good coffee at a great price.  No one can complain about that!
