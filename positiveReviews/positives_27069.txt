We've been giving our baby different varieties of these melts since he was around 8 months old.  He absolutely loves every single flavor and would eat the whole bag if I let him.  I use them mainly for snacks on the go and the resealable bag makes it easy to toss in our diaper bag.  I usually buy a lot of my baby items from Amazon but I actually get these from the grocery store because they are much cheaper than here.
