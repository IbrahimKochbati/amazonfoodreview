Bought these at Whole Foods to try....and the flavor is well balanced and you get a nice suttle banana flavor.  Am a vegan and chef so I struggle to fine well balanced bars....but this one delivers.  I'll be ordering from Amazon because of their great prices.  Not sure about the other flavors so will try and report back.  I don't believe you'll be disappointed with this bar...with realistic expecations of what vegan bars can deliver on.
