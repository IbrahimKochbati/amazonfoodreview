I purchased two bags of this dogfood, after one week of feeding the newman  and, my dog started vomiting after eating, she had gas all the time and lied around whimpering due to stomach ache, after having her checked for a stomach disorder, I took her off the newman dogfood and the symptoms disappeared.     I have sent three emails to newman dogfood website, no replies or acknowledgement, phone number not available, the dogfood is expensive and THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NON EXISTENT.
