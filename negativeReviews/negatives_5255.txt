I'm no "pho" expert, but I've eaten a lot (I really mean a lot) of Vietnamese, Japanese, and Chinese noodles in my lifetime.  And I wasn't really expecting authentic Vietnamese Pho noodles with this item, but it wasn't even remotely close to resembling that or any other Asian noodles.  I guess it's a matter of individual taste and preference with these things.  It didn't taste bad, but it didn't taste good either.  Not a lot of flavor, and what little flavor it did have I wouldn't describe as Vietnamese (or even Asian for that matter).          I've also read a few reviews describing the portions as big, but it definitely was not.  Nissin's Cup Noodles taste better, are more filling, and a whole lot cheaper (but probably more unhealthy too).
