We all love it. I have a "Man Cave" in my basement with a popcorn machine. All my friends and family love the popcorn I pop. I now use nothing but Great Northern. I also have a small machine in the main area of our house and use nothing but Great Northern in it as well. Great taste, very tasteful seasonings, includes the seasonings and oil. We love it!
