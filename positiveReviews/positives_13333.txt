Gluten Free Pantry  ownies are the richest and most chocolaty.  I used to use Pamela's, which are good also, but the GF Pantry are irresistible.  Only my son has celiac sprue, but the rest of us love his  ownies so much, we eat them over "regular"  ownies, even though these are more expensive.  He has to hide them or they are gone in a flash!
