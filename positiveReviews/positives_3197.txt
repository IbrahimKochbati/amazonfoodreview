After searching many local stores to find this product I ordered it via Amazon.  I took the advice of other reviewers & ordered the 3 pack.  I've only made pancakes w  it, but they are delicious.  Some complain that they are bland.  I always add a little something to flavor my pancakes.  A few drops of vanilla & a sprinkle of cinnamon had these pancakes tasting wonderful!  My 2 yr old loved them.  I highly recommend you try the GF Bisquick.
