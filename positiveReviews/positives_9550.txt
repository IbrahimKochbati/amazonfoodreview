I used to drink regular chocolate milk after working out to help with recovery, and then I was introduced to Core Power! While I like all of their flavors, Vanilla is my typical go to. It's so smooth and I never have to worry about a chalky, nasty taste because it's actually made from milk (not powder and water). I'm a big fan of the natural ingredients and can't imagine using anything else to get a great balance of carbs and protein. You can't go wrong with any of Core Power's drinks!
