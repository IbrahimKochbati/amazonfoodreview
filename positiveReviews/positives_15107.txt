This food is great. My German Shepherd does well on only 2 cups a day of the all stages formula.          I've had a hard time finding it in my area as this is a smaller town. I am excited to see it available here but no where can I find out how much it costs to ship a 40lb bag?          Amazon doesn't seem to have a "contact us" option either, so until I can find out how much they charge for a 40 pound bag I'll just have to do without.          If anyone can tell me what the shipping was on their bag I'd love to know.          Thanks,          Birdy...
