I was impressed with the service (price) and speed of delivery   but disappointed when half of the cans in the case arrived severely dented. I didn't bother with asking for replacement   we had an immediate use for the product (made lots of pumpkin pie), so this is a word of caution to other buyers. We will do this again   but next time, we will not be so forgiving.
