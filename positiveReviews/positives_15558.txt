I've used this item for stunning drink presentations but have routinely been entertaining "self" at home.  The syrup's amazing and the flower is edible.  The flower stuns everyone at first but when they taste, they thoroughly enjoy.  I have purchased this a number of times.  Amazon use to carry the larger, 11 oz. jar but I did not see it on this last purchase.  This product's become a staple in my house. I also use the syrup to mix with other items (fruit dips, desserts, ice cream, etc.)
