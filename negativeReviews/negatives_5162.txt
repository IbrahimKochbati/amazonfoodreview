This toy lasted about ten minutes.  First one i purchased had a rope tug, which my pup quickly chewed through, rendering the toy useless.  I bought another one after i saw that they had changed the rope portion to a rubberized "rope" and it seemed like a better solution.  Wrong! The rubber rope took my dog (who is not much of a chewer) about two minutes to completely chew into small pieces, again leaving her with nothing but a purple plastic jug.  Product is a great idea if they can figure out what will work better as the "tug" mechanism, but as is (both versions) are just poorly made and a waste of $$$$.
