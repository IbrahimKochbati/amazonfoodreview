Perhaps my expectations were too high. When I see the name "Wolfgang Puck", I expect to be impressed. This (to my taste) is very average tasting coffee. To be fair, it is billed as a medium roast, and that's what it is. However, it's just too bland for my taste.          If you want decaf with more character, try Green Mountain Coffee's Dark Magic Decaf    "
