My dogs love these bones.  I bought all sizes.  My jack russel loves the big ones and the small ones.  My 60 pound mutt loves the big ones. They are great.  They are able to digest them and able to enjoy the bones.  I bought so many of them.  Petsmart for some reason discontinued them I was so upset.  I was so happy to see them on Amazon for a great price. I highly recommend them.
