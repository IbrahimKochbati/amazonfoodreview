I just ordered my second batch of these apple chips and they are worth every penny!  We absolutely love them and we eat them up in a hurry.  They don't last long in the house.  The package size is a little bigger than I prefer so this time we ordered the smaller sized bags.  We take them to school, to the gym, out on trips, they go everywhere!  It's a quick healthy snack and the price is just right, the price is even better if you sign up for subscribe and save!  I also enjoy having a package on my doorstep which reminds me I didn't have to go to the grocery store and it's fun to have tasty treats inside the package!  Enjoy!
