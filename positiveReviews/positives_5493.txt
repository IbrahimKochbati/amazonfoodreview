The grapefruit and blackberry flavors are the current favorite at my house on Tuesday nights when we try to always have a rotisserie chicken and homemade gravy while watching TV.          Once you taste the subtle fruit flavors mingling perfectly in a not overly carbonated sparkling water, you may want to order this by the case.          There are no artificial flavorings or colorings, not to mention extra sugar. The only sweetener is grape juice and apple juice concentrate. Lemon juice and fruit concentrates mingle with the sparkling water to create a delicate, smooth, slightly tingly and delicious drink.          Perfect for drinking with dinner or taking along on a picnic.          ~The Rebecca Review
