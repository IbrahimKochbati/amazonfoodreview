This is by far the best decaf I've ever tried. You can't  ew it on the large cup setting. You have to  ew it on the 8 oz setting, don't try to stretch it to the 10 oz or it will be too weak. However, when  ewed at 8 oz. this is smooth, tasty and tastes like coffee. Not bitter and you can't tell it's a decaf.
