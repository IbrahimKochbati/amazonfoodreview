Ordered Galil Roasted Chestnuts after watching a Dr Oz show.  We expected that the word roasted was referring to something similar to dry roasted.  Instead we found that they are a wet soft mushy nut.  Horrible tasting. We couldn't eat even one complete nut much less 24 pouches. Strongly would recommend that all future buyers beware of trying something in quantity that you have not tried before.
