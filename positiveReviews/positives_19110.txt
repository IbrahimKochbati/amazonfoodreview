I happen to love flavored coffee, and am always looking for a new one.  I found this  and a few months ago, and have been trying the different flavors.....they are all good!  This one is my favorite though.....it is the perfect blend of Raspberry and chocolate.  I  ought it to a meeting, and we spent more time oohing and aahing about the coffee than getting our work done!  It is also a great dessert coffee!
