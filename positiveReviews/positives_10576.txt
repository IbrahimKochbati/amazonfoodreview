Like many others, had trouble with the rinds puffing up.  Inital try had many unpuffed  pieces, and the pieces that puffed, had rock hard ends.  Microwaves pretty much work by heating the water in your food, so if the amount of humidity in your pork rinds is too low, they won't heat up enough to puff.  I took about 1 4th of a paper towel, wet it and lightly squeezed out the excess so it was not dripping wet, then put it in the bag with the pork pellets overnight.  The next day, the paper towel was dry, so I guess that the rinds absorbed the extra moisture.  When I tried to cook them again, they puffed up much much better and in less time.  There were only two or three unpuffed pieces, and one or two rock hard ends.  I also got good results by soaking them in water right before microwaving, but the papertowel method is easier with less mess.  Just be carefull that you don't make the inside of the bag too humid then you may have to worry about spoilage.
