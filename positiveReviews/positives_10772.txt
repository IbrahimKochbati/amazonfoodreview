These dog treats were an instant hit, and unlike most, weren't simply swallowed whole and followed by a happy grin waiting instantly for more.  My "big girl" actually laid down to eat her half of the treat, making sure she got every crumb before attempting to wheedle the other half.  The pickier smaller dog also liked hers, and the list of ingredients is sure to please a picky mom too  it didn't have a long list of unpronounceables and less than appetizing ingredients! (organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic apples, organic palm oil (preserved with mixed tocophenals, a source of vitamin E,) organic molasses.)          These are BIG biscuits, but they are scored to easily  eak them in half to double the fun of treating your pet to a healthy and apparently tasty treat. The package is resealable, which is nice if you try to dole out treats and keep your four legged buddy's waistline in line.          These definitely got my dogs woof of approval, and were liked as well as homemade "cookies" without all the work.  I really like the heartier size too, as these cookies are substantial enough to encourage chewing by the greediest of dogs.  I like that I can  eak them in half for my smaller dog, as well as to stretch out the fun with the "big girl" of the two.  While neither of my dogs are "picky" eaters, they really seemed to enjoy these cookies more than most, and we've tried a LOT of kinds, including making our own.
