This was the 2nd time that I ordered the Smokehouse USA Chicken Stix. The 1st order had USA printed right on the bag, this one had a USA sticker over the China sticker.  In addition, the product looked entirely different. Obviously I am concerned. I pay more to ensure I am not feeding my "fur kids" products from China. If it happens again, I'll stop ordering all Smokehouse products on line.
