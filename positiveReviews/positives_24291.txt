This is crack chai! Every time I go to a coffee spot, I hope they serve this. However, there is caffeine and it's mostly sugar. Understanding that, this is wonderful! Best taste. It's just the right amount of sweet for me without being overdone. I love how much money I've been saving making these in my own reusable to go cups and can't wait to try out some recipes to vary it up a bit!
