Great product that  ews a great cup of coffee fast and removable water resevoir is the way to go no more messy water refills with a pitcher or coffee pot.  Looks great with any kitchen decor and saves you money, with so many flavors now available in K cups you cannot go wrong.  Only downfall is that the pump is louder than I would have liked but for the savings over store bought coffee or wasting half a pot in a conventional  ewer I can live with it.
