There is nothing, no product anywhere, that compares to Cope's Corn.  It was always served in our home on holidays, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter.  We loved it.  Corn pudding is one thing.  Dried corn pudding is something completely different and quite wonderful.  I cannot find this anywhere in the grocery stores now.  I thought that maybe it just wasn't being produced anymore...then I looked on line.  WOW  so happy.  I will (WILL) be serving this on Thanksgiving this year, 2011.  Can't wait!
