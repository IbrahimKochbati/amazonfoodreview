Once you try these, you will not go back to conventional anchovies. If you never liked anchovies, it is probably because you never had the good stuff. If you worry about the large size of the can, don't. Stored in a glass container under salt in the refrigerator, these anchovies keep forever (not that they need to, you'll start using them more and more). Put one or two in beef stews, on lamb roasts, etc. It adds a depth of flavor, nothing fishy at all.          However, shipping charges on this are ridiculous. I ordered once online. Realizing I would need more, I searched for an Italian deli that carried them. It took a while, but I now have a source for fantastic other Italian products that are difficult to get anywhere else.
