I love these chips!  They're all natural, gluten free, and relatively low in fat and calories (130 calories and 5 grams of fat per 1 ounce serving).  I've tried the white cheddar, butter and sea salt flavors.  All three are good but the white cheddar is definitely my favorite.  The flavor is similar to Pirates Booty but the texture is more like a thick chip.  It has a very satisfying crunch.          These sell for $3.99 per bag at my local grocery store which makes the Amazon pricing a great deal.
