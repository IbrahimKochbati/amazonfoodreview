I tried these on the recommendation of our veterinarian for my 2 little dogs' bad  eath. I didn't think they would like them, since the treat is hard & they favor soft treats. But both dogs love them! Within 2 days, their  eath was improving. Now, they get their once a day treat to keep their  eath smelling fresh.
