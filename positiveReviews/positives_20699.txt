Every time I've introduced this rice to people they've been amazed that this is  own rice. It's delicious and always used in my home instead of white rice. I prepare it in my rice cooker on the white rice setting as it says on the bag. I add a touch more water than asked to make it a softer texture that I prefer.     The rice comes out lighter in color than other  own rice that I've used. At times, I add a little unsalted butter mixed with chopped green onion to dress it up. Never gone back to white rice.     I find this rice at my local Asian market.     Bottom line is it's a little pricey but soooo worth it!
