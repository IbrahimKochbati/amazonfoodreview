I did not like the taste or texture of Wild Ride Original but decided to give the company one more chance as this flavor was on sale.  While the flavor is better, unfortunately the meat is of such poor quality that it's difficult to recommend.  I uploaded three images as examples of what you will find in a typical bag.  You'll see that about 10 15% of the pieces are marbled in a high amount of fat which is odd because meat was originally smoked not only to add flavor but to get rid of fat so it would last longer.  I'm not sure what's happening here.  Some pieces have hardened grease settling on them, most likely due to the meat being smoked on something similar to a conveyor belt as opposed to hanging in a smoker.  Finally, the pieces that don't have any apparent fat or grease may still contain gristle as another reviewer mentioned.  It's not horrible, but it is of low quality to match its low price.  I wouldn't recommend it to any serious jerky lovers but you can check the at the top of the page and decide for yourself.
