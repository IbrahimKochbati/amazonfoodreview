My days on the university campus are long  they start with office hours at about 7:30 until 10, and then classes until 2 or 3:15.  Office hours later until about five.  I usually carry my own lunch to eat in the office or on the run.  No quiet  eaks for me, I usually have students in the office.  When my blood sugar starts dropping, I don't have much time to wait, so a little bar like this serves really well to give me a little boost.  I prefer not to have chips or cookies or crackers, as I need to watch both sugar intake and salt intake.  I'm not gluten intolerant. That said, I enjoy these little bars by Pamela's Products.  It truly is good for "Whenever."  This particular flavor is soft and very much like a soft baked oatmeal cookie with chocolate chips and coconut in it  but without the gluten!  The flavor is natural, not very fake berry flavored or peanut butter covering up the flavor of soy protein flavored.  It's probably five or six bites for me, and a couple crumbs will fall off as I nosh, but that's okay for me, now that I know.  A bit high in calories (180), but the number of carbs is low (23, before fiber content figures in), so it's a pretty safe treat when you have blood sugar considerations.  It's a darned tasty treat.  I will look for them at my grocer's in the near future, as the long school year gets underway.  Thanks, Pamela!
