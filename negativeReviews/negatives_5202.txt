I like some of the Snickers Marathon bar flavors, but not this one.  It doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't come close to tasting like the dark chocolate its name denotes.  Mostly this just tastes sweet.          For many people, this might be a healthy snack substitution.  Each bar has only 150 calories yet has 11 grams of protein and 22 grams of carbs (9 grams of sugar).  It's also fortified with many vitamins (100% USRDA of many of them), but I take a multivitamin daily already so this doesn't mean much to me.  My main complaint about the nutritional profile of this bar is that it just has too much fiber for such a small amount of food.  If you're someone who doesn't eat fresh fruits and vegetables and prefers refined foods (white flour, white rice, white  ead, etc) rather than whole grain foods, then the fiber in this bar would do you good.  For me, however, the 7 grams of fiber per bar (28% of the USRDA) causes me intestinal discomfort as it adds to an already high daily consumption of fiber from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.  I assume that some of the fiber in this bar comes from its principal ingredient (soy), but I also see that chicory fiber is listed as an ingredient and chicory root has a high concentration of fiber.  If I were to reformulate this product, I'd remove the chicory fiber and do something to attempt to give it a bit more authentic of a chocolate flavor.
