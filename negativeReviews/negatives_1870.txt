I thought I'd be writing a review raving about this product.  Sadly, I'm not.     I would never use it for home use.  It tasted "muddy" and bitter. I followed the directions. I even made sure the water was hot but not boiling. I'd probably take it backbacking, but that's it. It's worth a try if you haven't tasted it yet. Read some of the other neutral reviews.  It might help with expectations.
