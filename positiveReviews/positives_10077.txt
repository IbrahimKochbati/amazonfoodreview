I have been eating this cereal for years. It initially had oat  an as well as the current corn, wheat and rice. I never eat "sweet" cerals but this is good with just a very very slight hint of sweetness. Eat it right away and it is very crisp and crunchy or let it stay in the milk a bit and it gets more like oatmeal. Great stuff. Wish I could find it in the grocery but this is another case where Amazon comes through. $9.99 a box...you gotta be kidding!No cereal is worth that much but don't despair because other sellers have it for normal reasonable prices.
