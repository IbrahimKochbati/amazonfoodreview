At first I thought I had wasted my money. I hated this coffee. It is very bitter. Then I had a great idea...use it for iced coffee.  I  ew it for a medium cup. Fill a tall glass with ice. Fill glass 1 3 full with milk. Add your favorite creamer. Add coffee and stir. So if you hate this coffee hot, try it cold.
