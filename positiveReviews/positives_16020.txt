I purchased this Hot Sauce while on a trip to South Dakota.     Since finishing it I have not been able to find it in any store on the East Coat.     I was so excited to find this listed on Amazon.          I like HOT things. Although I won't do Ghost Chili Hot.     I really enjoy it because it is hot enough for me but not too much.     It has great taste as well. Not too vinegary as some other hot sauces are.          For the size of the bottle, this is a pretty decent price too.     Was received in a timely manner too.     Will be re purchasing when this bottle runs out.
