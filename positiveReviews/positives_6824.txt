My dog loves the how these treats smell and taste   they are special treats for her. They're healthy, mildly chewy, low calorie treats so it's perfect. They are a good compliment to her regular chicken jerky treats (from Canyon Creek Ranch.)     I usually divide each into 2 or 4 pieces while training.
