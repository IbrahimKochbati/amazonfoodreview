This is a wonderful deep flavored classic Assam tea, and certified organic, as well. The flavor is malty and rich, with no bitterness or off flavors. Stands up well to milk and a bit of sugar but would also be excellent without them, say, as an iced tea in summer. I am a simple tea drinker, not a gourmet expert. I simply like this tea a lot and will purchase it again.
