My dog absolutely loved Greenies. He would come downstairs every morning and sit in front of the pantry until someone gave him his Greenies. He also learned to do all sort of cute tricks. We taught him these tricks with Greenies as his incentive. These treats were healthy for him, never made him sick, and made his  eath smell good. I would only give him one Greenies a day and to spread that one Greenie out over the entire day, I would take pliers and cut it into 6 8 little pieces. Seemed like my dog would feel more fulfilled to have little pieces throughout the day versus one whole Greenie once a day. Once I discovered Greenies, I cut all the other treats out and really only have him the Greenies. The 27oz. tub was in my opinion a really good value for the money so I would always buy that size. I highly recommend this product for all dogs.
