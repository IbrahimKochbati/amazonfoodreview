I loved the fact that there was really nothing in these treats that I couldnt eat.  I want to keep chemicals and bad things away from my dogs.  However, I did not try one to tell you what they taste like!  I also like that they come in large sizes with a  eak in the middle so that they can accomodate both large and small dogs.  That being said, however, my dogs had a little trouble with them.  They are square and thick.  I have toy dogs (Papillons) and they found them a little difficult to eat.  It was hard to tell if it was the size and shape or the taste that bothered them.  They did eat them, but they did not devour them.  All in all, it appears to be a great product though.
