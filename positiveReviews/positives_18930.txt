My dog loves these treats, but I can't think of any treats my dog doesn't love.  The treats are hard but only takes my 70 pound lab a few seconds to eat.  Based on the other reviews, I will look into this treat containing product from China.  If it does have any product from China I will never buy from this  and again.
