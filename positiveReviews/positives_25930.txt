What a great name for a snack. My kids (5 and 7) love these. I find them pretty tasty too.          These are bascially cheese puffs although softer and "smoother" than your standard mass market puff (like cheetos).          These are a regular in our snack cabinet (the other being pirates cannon balls :  )
