I don't want to comment on how this protein shake affected my body.  I will only say that I worked out like usual and drank this powder mixed with milk and neither gained nor lost weight.  I like that there was no funny aftertaste (unlike some protein powders containing artificial sweeteners).          I am giving this product three stars because I like that it is of organic and fair trade origin.          I would have rated it higher, but I find that if I mix this with milk, the resulting shake feels gritty and has a weird and almost unpalatable taste.  If you mix too much powder with not enough milk the shake needs to be consumed quickly!  If not, you will have a jello like substance that is best eaten with a spoon or mixed with more milk.          The two containers I received were probably not well mixed.  I found that as I got closer to finishing the product the shakes I was making started to taste sweeter, so I wonder if the sugar was just not evenly distributed.  Given that this product is a powder, I don't think settling during shipment was a problem.          At this point, I will probably not order this product again simply because I find it too hard to drink given the flavor and texture.
