I honestly cannot say that I saw any difference whatsoever in this variety compared to Friskies regular sliced beef version.  Actually, my cat preferred the regular Friskies over this one.  He's not really all that jazzed over these Fancy Feast varieties anyway, so if you're going to buy this one or the chicken, save your money and buy the regular Friskies versions.  They seem to taste better to the cat and it saves you money.  I've never had a cat that ever got too thrilled over this variety over the years so I guess I'll get the special ones instead.
