I have never taken the time to write a review before, but in this case others need to be warned off. I expected to get a product similar to what I have seen in the stores, but this obviously is a replica. The sliders on the bottom of the tray that are supposed to keep the tray straight when you slide it in and out  oke off before I even got it out of the package. It is not something you can fix unless you have a solder gun. Even then, it is very "sticky" pulling the tray out because there are no rollers. It is metal on metal, which does not work well without some sort of lu ication. I love Amazon, but this product is inferior at best.
