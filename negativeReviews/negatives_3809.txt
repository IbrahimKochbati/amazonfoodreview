I decided to try the Switch Kiwi Berry drink because I'm trying to find tasty alternatives to regular cola and I don't like most artificially sweetened drinks. Switch did a great job with the kiwi and strawberry flavor of this beverage, but I can't shake the feeling that it's a drink that is pretending to be healthy even when it's not.          The Switch can states this drink is made with 100% Juice, all natural, with no sugar added and no corn syrup. That must make it healthy, right? Wrong. This tiny 8.3 ounce can packs 135 calories and 33 grams of sugar! How is that possible? Switch uses fruit "juice concentrate" which is just a nice way of saying they process fruit into a sugar syrup and remove almost everything that makes juice healthy in the process. Juice concentrate is barely any better than corn syrup.          At the end of the day, this is a very tasty drink, but don't buy it if you're looking for a healthy beverage.
