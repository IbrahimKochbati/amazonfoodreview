This makes frying chicken easy.  I've used this product for over 20 years but it's not always available locally.  I was glad to find it on Amazon.  It is also good for making ranch fries.  Just dip the potato wedges in water and coat with this and fry.  Perfect every time.  So is the chicken I make with it.
