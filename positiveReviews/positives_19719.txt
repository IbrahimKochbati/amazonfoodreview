I just wanted to say that I picked up my first single serving of Primal Spirit Texas BBQ Meatless Vegan Jerky today at my local Home Economist while searching for Gluten Free products (I'm new at this so its an adventure everytime I go into the store!).          Now, I am going to say that I am 100% Carnivore!! And I am a absoulte jerky fanatic as I've had it made out of Beef, Deer, Rabbit, Fish, Bison, Buffalo, and even Turkey Jerky!          But I can honestly say, this was fantastic! It had a nice stringy texture, like actual meat. Was flavored nicely, a little mosit, and it left me wanting more!          I'm glad I bought only one as I think I could have eaten several :)          Also, love the fact its only 81 Calories, with 1g of Fat but still has 10g's of Protein!!
