I have been giving the Stewart's Pro Treat Freeze Dried Beef Liver to my maltipoo named Elvis Lee for many years now along with his daily meals.  It is all PURE Freeze Dried Beef Liver which provides him with protein since he is a very active boy who likes to go for long walks and play ball!  Elvis Lee is very particular about what he likes and this Freeze Dried Liver is on his list of FAVORITES!!
