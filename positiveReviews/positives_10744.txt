When this arrived, I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the bag.  I was expecting a little sample bag but received a full 10 oz sized bag.  Looking at the purchase price on Amazon, I think this is very fairly priced.  At $23.60 for a 6 pack, that is just a little under $4 for each bag which is very competitive with other dog treats   many of which have lower quality ingredients.          Speaking of ingredients.....Lamb?  Barley?  Organic.  Okay, I'll admit it   I just had to try one myself.  They're hard so I had to soak it a little but they are actually quite good.          My dog is a 45lb mutt who will eat anything, so it doesn't surprise me that he took one with alacrity and I didn't see it again.  I also keep chickens and it occurs to me that for a little protein boost, this would be a fun way to treat them too.  I'd have to soak them for awhile but I think they will also be getting a treat.          The only thing I would like to see added is another version of this treat that includes glucosamine.  My dog has severe hip dysplasia and we supplement him with glucosamine twice a day.  He doesn't love the pills and administering them is not a fun job, but because we can tell a different when he's on them, we persevere.  However a treat like this that he wolfs down, that includes the glucosamine?  Now THAT I would be willing to pay good money for.  And as common as this disorder is, there would be a huge market for a product like that.
