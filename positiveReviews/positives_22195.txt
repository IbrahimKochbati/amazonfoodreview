This is a very good bar. There are lots of nuts and different kinds of fruit, but there is a bit too much sweetener (honey, etc). Good for  eakfast, or half of one as a snack to get me through to lunch dinner.          Great price! Cheaper than Kind bars, although not as many different kinds available.
