The basic problem with this product is that unless you load a VERY small amount of coffee in the filter, the filter clogs.  This causes the coffee ground and hot water to back up through the hole in the top and cause a mess.  My son and I spent a few hours experimenting with different ways to prevent this but we have admitted defeat.  I suspected the filter but I used filters which work perfectly fine in my EZ Cup still result in a mess on my kitchen counter. Even worse, coffee grounds in my coffee!  However, if you like your coffee very weak, this will work well for you.  I hope they can fix the design issues.  Until then, I will stick with my EZ Cup.
