From the way my two dogs inhaled these Newman's Own Organics Lam and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog treats, I would say that they are a hit with my canines.          They were crunchy enough that the dogs at least had to chew them instead of swallowing them whole.  The smell wasn't bad like most dog treats and while my husky didn't stop to smell the roses, or rather, the treats, my chow mix did.  A couple of sniffs and then the treat disappeared.          If I could change anything with the treats, I would love for them to come in a single bite instead of two biscuits together.  The treats were hard and not that easy to  eak.  I think they would have lasted longer had them come in a single 'square' instead of a two part rectangle.          I would buy these for my dogs again!          Natalie S. for Amazon Vine
