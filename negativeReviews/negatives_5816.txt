"Van Houtte Cr&egrave;me Brul&eacute;e Coffee" is OK once in awhile, but I wouldn't buy it on a regular basis. 3 stars.          "Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Coffee" is a notch above this one.          But I recommend "Van Houtte Cafe, Costa Rica Tarrazu (Light Roast) Coffee", it's not flavored, but it's my favorite right now.
