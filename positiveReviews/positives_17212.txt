I was introduced to this sauce by a coworker from Guatemala. I love all kinds of hot sauces, but this one is truly unique as it has a nice level of spice to it, has a good burn in the mouth, but does not carry the burn to your stomach. It, somehow, really enhances food flavor without taking over the natural flavor. You gotta try this stuff!!
