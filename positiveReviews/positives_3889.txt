This soup is good. I really love this  and of soups..my favorite being the Chicken and Dumplings. Healthy Choice isn't always the best  and when it comes to frozen meals but for some reason they really knocked it out of the park with their soups. I love them, they taste homemade and amazingly better than Campbell's or Progresso. I recommend this, the Chicken and Dumplings, the Split Pea and Ham...in fact, every variety I've tried has been delicious. You can't really go wrong with this.
