The one BIG problem being that they don't always send you the right product and when that happens there is no way to return it for the right product. I ordered 2 lbs of the honey and received  own sugar instead. When I tried to return it for the right product (the honey) I got absolutely NO RESPONSE. None. I sent countless emails, but nothing. It is a great product with a great taste, but the company is a little dodgy, so be careful.
