The Presidor Allegro Crispy Cookies with Hazelnut Filling are a tasty, crunchy treat with kind of a dry center.  When I see filling, I think of creamy filling, but this was more of a dried Hazelnut paste.  The cookies have a good flavor and there are two rows of them in a nice box.  The box is presentable enough for the cookies to be a little gift for someone.  I enjoyed them hence the 4 stars, but I don't really crave them as a cookie favorite or 5 stars.  At the right price, I would buy them again.
