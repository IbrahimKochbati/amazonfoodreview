This soda is all natural unlike many others that have artificial flavoring and sweeteners.  That, in itself, makes it ok in my book. The key takeaways from tasting this is that 1. It actually taste like a soda pop and not just juice with carbonation in it.  2. It's as sweet as artificial sodas without the artificial sweeteners. Since it's all natural I guess that's alright.  3. The Kiwi can be a bit overpowering.  So only get this if you really like Kiwis.
