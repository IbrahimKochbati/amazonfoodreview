I really like this Namaste Foods "Say Cheez" gluten free, vegan macaroni and cheese style dinner. It's not Kraft Mac & Cheese but I like it a lot better than Kraft! It's zesty and peppery and it does taste like cheese.          I thought that the 3 tablespoons of oil they say to mix the "cheez" sauce with was excessive.  I used one teaspoon of oil and 1 2 cup of the cooking water I reserved from the pasta and let it simmer while stirring for a few minutes to thicken.  Then I added the pasta and green beans that I cooked with the pasta.  It was really tasty!  The macaroni, which was a nice texture and cooked up beautifully, has ridges to hold the sauce.  Do not over cook the pasta though, it needs maybe 8 1 2 or 9 minutes.          It's just way too expensive.  I really think Namaste Foods could make money and still price this much better to be affordable for the average person.  No need to price gouge people who have food sensitivities and parents who have children with Celiac Disease.  I know this type of product costs more to produce because of the need for a dedicated facility and the special ingredients but your prices are ridiculous.          Most families are on a strict budget especially in these days of poor economy and job losses.  Even on Subscribe & Save this product was almost $4 a bag!  Come on Namaste Foods.  You don't understand the meaning of "Namaste" if you charge such exorbitant prices.
