Great little toy for you an your pup to play with together. You'll be surprised how easily they get the hang of it, no matter how clueless they are at first! We play "treat wheel" about once a week so she doesn't get it too fast. We get down on the floor next to her and praise her as she plays with it. She really enjoys playing with it, and will try and get the food from it, even if she has a bowl of the same food right next to her!
