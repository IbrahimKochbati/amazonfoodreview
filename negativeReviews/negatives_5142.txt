My dogs are not rough at all, one is 4 years old and still has toys from when she was a puppy.  Within one week, she  oke the cap into 3 pieces anf got all the kibble, Superglued it back together which lasted another week.          I would not purchase again.  I went for the hard plastic Kong that dispense hard kibble.  They have barely scratched it although they can get the food out more quickly.  I throw larger treats in to slow dispensing action.
