The first 10 ingredients list:  #4 pork by products, #6 chicken by products, #8 gelatin by product, #9 wheat flour, #10 wheat gluten. A lot of cats are allergic to grains and by products aren't as healthy as actual meat. There are many grain free  ands out there that cost about the same with NO by products like Royal Canin, Science Diet or Purina. Look into Merrick, Wellness Solistic, Blue Buffalo, EVO, Innova, Chicken Soup for the Cat lovers Soul or Weruva just to name a few. Get your cat started out right.     I have a bengal who had terrible runny poo for the first 4 months I had her, even with adding Fortiflora to Royal Canin. I started doing research on what could be causing it and on almost every site I visited, they warned against grains and by products. I've since switched to grain free by produt free food and it's made a great improvement on her stools. Cats need healthy food and Royal Canin is equal to McDonalds.
