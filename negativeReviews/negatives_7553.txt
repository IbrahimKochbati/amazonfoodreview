My dog loves these treats and begs for them.  The only problem is the irregular thickness of these treats.  Some are 3 times as thick as others.  When my dog eats the thick ones, she ultimately throws them up.  I continue to buy them because she loves them, but I hate throwing out the thick ones as expensive as these are per treat.  I wish they had better quality control.
