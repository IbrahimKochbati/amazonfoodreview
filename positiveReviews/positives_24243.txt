So it's Chai.  If you don't know Chai is a spiced tea.  In this case the overtone is vanilla.  It's got a little of everything you might get in pumpkin pie spice.  It's very tasty.  I use two scoops in a twice as large glass and I make it just with hot water.  You don't need to add milk.  Many of the local coffee bars actually use this  and.  You could of course make this whole thing yourself but this is a GREAT alternative. And of course Amazon is a great place to get it.  I actually love that they kind of remind me every couple of months to get more because I usually need it.
