Still debating whether Dream Fields Pasta is better than Al Dente Carba Nada Egg Fettuccine, 10 Ounce Bags (Pack of 6). I have tried their different kinds and I find them to be an acceptable option and to me much better than regular pasta. I am happy that another low carb pasta is available for purchase for it is to my advantage to eat the low carb pasta. The last time I had regular pasta was a long time ago. Between the two pastas mentioned above I no longer feel I am missing much. 4 Stars!
