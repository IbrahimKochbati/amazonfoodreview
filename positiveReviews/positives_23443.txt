I have been using King Aarthur All Purpose, Whole Wheat, White Whole Wheat as well as Bread Flours for several years ever since I discovered KA in a supermarket. Believe me it is well worth the extra pennies for a bag of these flours. I have used these flours mainly for  ead (I could live on  ead even though they say that man does not live by  ead alone) as well as for cakes and cookies.  If you haven't tried KA I strongly advise you to start baking with it ASAP. I do not work for KA nor am I part of the company  just one of their loyal consumers.
