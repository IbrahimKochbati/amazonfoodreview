I was extremely impressed with the single serve Pecan Pies. I expected a middle of the road product, thought I'd give them a try.       The ratio of filling to crust thickness is perfect. Pie has a rich home baked flavor, and the size is wonderful. 2 Ounces is large enough to enjoy without ruining diet. It's satisfying without being overly sweet.       I will be ordering more next month to give one to each guest to take home after Thanksgiving Dinner.
