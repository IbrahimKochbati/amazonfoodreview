Xylitol is an all natural alternative to chemical sugar free sweeteners. I love to use it when baking. Xylitol tends to be less bitter than stevia (another natural sugar substitute). This is great for any one watching their sugar intake. Many body builders use this as a natural alternative to chemical sweeteners like sucralose when trying to cut calories. Another plus, Xylitol is good for you teeth! I use it to make homemade tooth paste and mouthwash that really works. The only downside is that Xylitol can be pricey. Average cost is $7 per pound. I have only tried the Now  and, but I have also heard good things about Ideal  and Xylitol, which also offers a " own sugar" version. Oh yes, and please do read labels. Toxic to animals! And, causes laxative type effects if over consumed.
