As a relative of a child with severe food allergies, i have always struggled with what to serve when the child comes to visit.  Until i heard of (then tasted) these gems! Not only are they super safe for children (or anyone) with food allergies, they are delicious.  I find myself purchasing some just when i get a cookie craving.  they are hands down the best line of cookies I have ever had....Great flavor (you would NEVER know that these were produced with safe products rather than traditional cookie ingredients).  I think one of the hardest thing for parents and relatives and friends of people with allergies is finding GOOD, tasty foods...especially sweets.  If you have a loved one with a food allergy, i think you should stock these in your pantry (but beware, you will find yourself craving them as well!!!)
