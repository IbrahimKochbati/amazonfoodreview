I used to buy these candies when I was young, I was like 8. I remember this ice cream man would come around by my house, and I would buy a whoooole bunch to last me forever!! LOL But finally i found them for cheap on AMAZON and had to buy them! Finally I received my box of Sour Power Strawberry Belts and now I'm sharing them with my 4 year old son. :)          5 STARS FOR THIS CANDY!!!!!!!!!!!  ]
