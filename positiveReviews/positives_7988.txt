I love a great gyros platter, but there aren't many Greek restaurants pizzarias where I live.  So I was excited to see this offered here!  The meat was still frozen when it arrived, and the styrofoam lined shipping box can be reused, ice packs and all.  I bought it pre sliced, and the slices separate easily from each other in the box so you can keep it frozen and just use a little at a time.  My only complaint is that I like thicker slices; but in terms of flavor, well, I challenge you to make it at home yourself and have it taste this good.  I have a feeling I will keep a box of this on hand from now on.  One note:  the box does not contain heating instructions.  I tried it in the  oiler and over  owned it.  I wish I had read the instructions here before that first attempt!
