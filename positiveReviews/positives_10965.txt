I have been looking for a cracker that kind of passes off as a saltine cracker. My Mom's recipes require saltine crackers and so having celiac disease I have gone without! Now I can enjoy some of the recipes that I have grown up with. They also are good for snacking crackers. I thought they tasted like a cross between saltines and ritz. My husband went with a kinda grahm crackery taste. They are the first gluten free cracker I have found that are not so crispy they crack in pieces!!
