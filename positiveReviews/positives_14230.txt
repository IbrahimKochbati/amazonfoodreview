I must have caught these Nestle Assorted Miniatures at just the right time.  The price was just over $13 bucks, which   for 4 big bags   was a great value.  The Crunch bars got picked out first but the others were appreciated later.  The product arrived quickly and fresh, and at a better price than my local Kroger and WalMart.  Would not hesitate to buy them again, even if the price was a bit higher.  Convenience and a great value!
