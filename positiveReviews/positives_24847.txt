i had a terrible cold and a patient of mine had given me a yogi tea for colds     took me days before i tried it and when i did i absolutely loved it! so i went on their website and found a whole array of teas they offer. i didn't have an idea where to find it first so i checked out whole foods just because i know that the tea is organic and we all know that whole foods only sells organic stuff. i bought a box of triple echinacea for more than $4! i didn't care at that time for the price but as i googled this tea i found out great websites where i could order this from and lo and behold i just subscribed to amazon's auto delivery. although now i only drink this particular one twice a day     one in the morning and one before i go to bed     not only it supports my immune system but it also warms my tummy in the morning! i highly recommend this tea to anyone who is a tea drinker and even for those who have not tried it...it has a wonderful aroma and its very soothing to the throat as well...
