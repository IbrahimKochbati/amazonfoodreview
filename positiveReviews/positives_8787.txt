Far and away the best cereal I've ever had! My husband and I literally go through at least a box a week. We have started ordering by the case because it's hard to find in our area.          Yes, it's sweet, but I'm a dyed in the wool Frosted Flakes fan, so it wasn't too sweet for me. If you look at many 'healthy' cereals, they have sugar too   a cup of FOCD is only 40 calories more than Special K Red Berries (my old 'healthy' cereal.).          I think the taste is rather like Golden Grahams   not a lot of cinnamon that I could detect to make it taste like Cinnamon Toast Crunch (a healthy substitute would be the new Total Cinnamon Crunch).          5 stars!
