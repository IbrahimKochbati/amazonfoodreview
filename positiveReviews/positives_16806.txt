This oil has a very strong garlic flavor, which is hard to find.  There are bits of garlic in the bottom to keep the infusion going on the shelf, but the pour spout fails to filter them out.  So if you're pouring directly into your dish, you may find some garlic "paper" or the woody bits of the skin atop your food.  Keep an eye out for that but, otherwise, good stuff.
