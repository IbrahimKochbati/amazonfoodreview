When I first got my dog I started her out with Innova. She liked it at first and then would not eat it unless it was mixed with wet food. I then changed her to Taste of the Wild, which (pun intended) she was wild about. She loved  eakfast and dinner now. However, after one bag I took her off TotW because the company that makes it has had recalls with other dog food  ands they make. Though TotW was never on the recall list I loved my dog too much to risk it. I didn't have a lot of dog food options for my area and I was not about to buy her dog food from Wal Mart. All of which contain the ingredient animal digest which I am keeping her from. A friend suggested Earthborn, which is what she feeds her dog, and was also sold in my area. And just as much as she loved TotW she loved Earthborn (probably more). She was soon an Oliver Twist and was asking for more. This food makes me happy with the good ingredients that are used and her coat shows it. I love this product and so does my dog.
