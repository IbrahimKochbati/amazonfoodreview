I got a box of these yesterday, and at first I thought they were actually spoiled.  After I re read the reviews, I realized that they are just that bad.  I usually try to throw in a positive, but I just cannot think of one.  If they tasted good and the carbs were not nearly as high (24g per bar) I would be happy to pay the money, but for how bad they taste and how they really aren't very low carb diet friendly, 1 star.  Really, though, I wish they would have stated the carb count on the ad.
