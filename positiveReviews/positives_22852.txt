This is old fashion English caramel.  Caramel  gets hard when cold.  Just a fact with ANY caramel,     especially ones that use REAL butter and cream.  It says "TOFFEE",  but in USA it's caramel.     Those who have said......"oh it's hard, can't bite it"........ three little words........     SIT ON IT!     I put  one piece in a zip lock bag...... and put it in my chair before I sit down.     Just forget about it!  When you wonder "what is that under  there"     you'll find the caramel is starting to soften.........this may  take  awhile, depending     on your body temp.  :  ) .....Just unwrap ........ and give a tug on a corner n'  s  t  r  e  c  h !     The Brazil nuts are high quality,  LOTS of nuts  and  full  of  flavor.     SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF TIME WORK ........ BUT IF YOU LOVE SOFT CREAMY CARAMEL...........IT'S WORTH IT!     And the tray has many uses......wrap each piece  in cute cello bags (Dollar Tree)... there you have a gift!     Don't be fooled by the ridiculously low price..........WALKER'S IS A HIGHLY REGARDED BRAND IN ENGLAND SCOTLAND IRELAND,     FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS!  (may I have some right now?)
