I was recently introduced to Genmai cha by a friend who's husband works for a company that does business with Japan.  I was at once intrigued and desirous to purchase more of the same.  However, I am still unable to find a similar tea with the same delicate taste.  Unfortunately, Yamamotoyama Genmai Cha is just adequate.  I am still on my quest to find that same delicate flavor I found in those tea bags my friend gave me.  Wish me luck in my search!
