My 3 yr old 75lb boxer is a heavy chewer and has a really long attention   to toys that give him a challenge. So at first this seemed like a promising toy.  It lasted maybe one week before my boxer figured out that picking it up in his mouth then dropping, no slamming, it on my hardwood floor gets pieces of food out. The end cap, which screws on and is plastic, never stood a chance. it  oke off and I was able to screw it on once more before bits of plastic shards were on my floor and victory was his.          It now sadly sits in the dogs toy box he doesnt like it anymore now that it doesnt dispense treats. lol. I wish I could get my money back or get a new plastic screw cap for it.
