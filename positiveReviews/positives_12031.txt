These treats are similar to the PureBites, however, since I have small dogs (Peke mix), I generally don't give them these snacks because they are more suited for medium and large dogs (or small dogs with large mouths). Smaller dogs have a hard time biting down on them and there is the possibility of choking because the pieces are too large and dense for their small mouths, so I have to  eak them up into smaller pieces before I give them to my doggies. The PureBites, on the other hand, are flatter and easier for them to chew. The snacks appear to made in the same way, so if I had larger dogs, I would give them either this snack or the PureBites.
