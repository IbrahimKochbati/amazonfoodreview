I found these snacks on a jetblue flight and since then they have been my primary snacking chip. They are have pretty much healthy snacks for you because their is nothing bad in them. It is quite amazing and they are even gluten free for people that need good snacks like that.          The most important part is they are delicious. I can't quite describe them, but they beat anything else out there. They also solved my old Doritos problem where the chips would slice the roof of my mouth......
