I was looking for a ketchup that had very low sugar content and thought a little spice would be an added bonus. So this product fit the bill perfectly. I agree with the very accurate description of the ketchup by the previous reviewer. Just that little bit of kick and the thicker texture make it amazingly versatile. I don't eat much beef, but I have tried it on a burger and it was great. But my absolute favorite use is on fish  particularly the meatier types of fish, like tuna, that can get a bit dry if grilled.It has also replaced barbecue sauce for me on pork chops. I love this stuff. What a find!
