I just opened my first bag of Azar Chef Express Pecan Halves. These are, without a doubt, the best nuts I've ever eaten. They're super sweet, super crisp, super fresh and super flavorful. I kept checking the label to make sure these roasted (more like toasted) nuts didn't have any undesirable seasonings, but they don't even have any salt! These are nothing like other nuts I've ordered online. It's pretty unbelievable how freshly picked they taste.
