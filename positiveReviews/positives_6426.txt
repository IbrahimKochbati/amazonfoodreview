I caught this as a "Warehouse" deal. $18.09 for 48 K cups. This was my first experience with any Wolfgang Puck coffee.     The Rodeo Drive Blend is good, average coffee. Nothing exceptional. I prefer a little stronger, bolder coffee, but at this price, it works for me. There's other  ands that I like a little better, but with K cups, cost per unit is always something I have to factor in...     I'd buy it again @ $0.38 cup, but I probably wouldn't @ full price. If you keep your eyes peeled, you can always find a good deal... just have to be patient and stock up when the deals arise.
