This dog food is the only thing that helped our dog with his dry skin.     We tried topical creams, antihistamines, etc.  With this dog food, he stopped itching and we dont have to apply any creams, give medicine or apply liquid omega oils on his food.  Will never change up from this  and.  Absolutely love it...so does our dog.
