Okay, I admit it, I'm a red licorice junkie. But I don't care for Red Vines or Twizzlers; they just don't have the "tooth" I desire in a good whip. These spirals are very tasty (almost too good) and they offer a good, long chew. The one drawback is that they tend to be very oily thus the reason for my 3 star rating. Still the berry flavor is spot on. Just what I love about strawberry licorice. Warning: Having a 5 pound bag of licorice in the house will weaken even the mightiest willpower. You've had your caution.
