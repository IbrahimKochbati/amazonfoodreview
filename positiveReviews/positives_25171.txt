I used it in an Organic Lemon, "Cleanse" diet mixture. ( See my Organic Lemion review ) Great tasting, and grade B " Organic" has more vitamins & minerls than grd A, acording to the book. ( I assume they get filtered or processed out ) I will be getting more from them for the next round in 6 mo.     My son wants me to get it soon, as he likes it better on Pan Cakes, waffels, and his cerial, than the stuff at the BOX stores.
