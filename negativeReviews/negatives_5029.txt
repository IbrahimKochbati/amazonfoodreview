its a free for all in my house when i fill up the busy buddy    and both the dogs and the cat get involved (the cat loves dog kibble lol) i do have to use the largest kibble i can find to make it more difficult.  However, the dogs have discovered that they can pick it up and swing it around like a mace... which gives them a weapon against my furniture, tv etc     so i had to put it way   is its way to dangerous...  i bought the busy buddy tumbler instead   which is a great alternative.
