After reading some of the frothing reviews criticizing Mrs. Mays for manufacturing their product in China    which doesn't in any way address the quality of the product itself    I tried to confirm this for myself. The website and packaging say nothing about this, so I wrote them an email asking where their product is manufactured. Here is the response in full:                                                                                Thank you for your purchase and inquiry.
