Although this is marketed as a coconut product, it really isn't. People seem to be having success baking with this. Now, coconut flour is delicious and tastes great in many substitute recipes, but does not have the same consistency or taste as wheat flour. When I saw all these success stories I grew suspicious.          I looked up the ingredients for this and the first one is white rice flour. Coconut flour is the fourth ingredient (after potato starch!). Each serving packs a walloping 46g of carbs.          If you are not necessarily gluten intolerant but just living a low carb lifestyle (Primal, Paleo, Atkins, Ketogenic, etc.), you'll want to avoid this.
