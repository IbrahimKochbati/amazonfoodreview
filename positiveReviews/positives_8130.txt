My 12 year old loves to make a cup of this before school every morning. The cocoa tastes wonderful and  ews up nice. We add a splash of milk to cool it off and it's so good. I don't taste anything artificial, in fact the quality is great. We will  ing this camping for the younger kids. With the powders we always had clumps, this  ews a great cup every time and tastes like the expensive coffee shop stuff!
