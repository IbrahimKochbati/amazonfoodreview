Truffle oil  makes a wonderful addition to most chef's repertoire. It allows you to infuse the aroma and part of the taste of the truffle. I purchased a finger sprayer and use it to allow the oil to create a mist over simple dishes like ravioli butter capers procusitto and parmesan.          Most cooks are unaware that the product (infused olive oil) even exists. Used in the fashion above it can be misted in many recipes to add an exquisite taste at a reasonable price. Truffles can cost up to $400 lb making it an ingredient unavailable (unless purchased on line)and un affordable.          I am sure that I will return to buy more once my current supply exhasts.
