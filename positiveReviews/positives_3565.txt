THANKS TO AMAZON FOR CARRYING THIS WONDERFUL PRODUCT . MY LOCAL GROCERY STORE NO LONGER CARRIES THIS PRODUCT AND GENERALLY PROMOTES THIER PRIVATE LABEL HOUSE BRANDS .     FOR THOSE FOLKS WHOM ENJOY FETTUCCINE ALFREDO , THIS PRODUCT CANT BE BEAT .     IT IS FAST AND VERY EASY TO PREPARE AND A EXCELLENT ITALIAN PASTA DINNER CAN BE READY IN 30 MINUTES OR LESS .     FOR ME , I DO ADD SOME EXTRA PARM CHEESE TO THE MIX , YET , THAT IS PERSONAL PREFERENCE .     WE REALLY ENJOY TOSSING IN SOME BONELESS AND SKINLESS CHICKEN , GRILLED , TO ADD TO THE SAUCE AND CREATE OUR OWN....CHICKEN ALFREDO .     THANKS AGAIN TO AMAZON AND TO MC CORMICKS FOR MAKING THIS PRODUCT AVAILALBE .          CHUCK RUNZO , PITTSBURGH , PA .
