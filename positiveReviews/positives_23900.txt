Popchips are no ordinary chips. What's in them is as good as what's not in them.     No preservatives. No artificial flavors. No saturated fat. No gluten ingredients.     Popchips are thicker than ordinary chips. They're crunchy ,zesty, tasty, and not overly salty. I like that there's no greasy residue on my hands after eating some.          The chips are uniform in size, strong enough to dip, and small enough to make double dipping unnecessary.     After sampling these for the first time, I'm looking forward to enjoying these great tasting and satisfying chips again.
