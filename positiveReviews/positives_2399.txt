I love fresh  ead and Hodgson  and is awesome. i usually just use the dough cycle on my  ead machine and then form the dough in buns and stickss so i can easily take them on to go. even if the  and is not organic all the ingredients are natural and processed without chemicals. but most of all they taste great. all it requires is some water and shortening(butter, or oil). i have even been able to use applesauce instead of oil but it didnt get as rich taste. I have ordered all varieties they had on amazon, whole wheat honey is specially tasty. no more supermarket  ead!
