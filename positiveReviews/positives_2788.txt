I remember really loving to eat dried mangos when I was younger so I decided to give this  and a try. These weren't bad per se but they were a little too sweet for my taste. I guess it's a good thing though since you don't want to eat a lot of them because the calories will build up unless you control your portions. I'll eat one and it'd satisfy my sweet tooth for hours before I want to eat another one. Therefore, I guess it's a good thing that it's a little too sweet but still... I would have liked less sugar.
