This is strong coffee like the Italian espresso. A teaspoon in a cup is sufficient. Take care you don't boil the water, otherwise it will loses its flavor. The water should be between warm and hot. I use it black with a small lump of  own sugar. A real amateur will tell you that the use of any sugar is sacrilege. But what can I do? The flesh is weak.
