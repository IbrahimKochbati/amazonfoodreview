First off, I received a bag of this coffee via the Vine Program to review at no cost.  Secondly, I am more of a bold, "slap me in the face" French Roast coffee drinker (or StarBucks Gold Coast), so I had my reservations about this decaf.          And ... Well, for me, this coffee had a somewhat stale aroma upon opening the package, an OK flavor once  ewed (sort of a nutty strange flavor at first), and once consumed, left an after taste in my mouth.          It is definitely a different roast than I am used to, but it is "decent" for a pre ground Melita decaf.  More of a medium roast as opposed to being a dark bold roast in my opinion.  Overall ... not too bad.          I give this coffee a so so recommendation.
