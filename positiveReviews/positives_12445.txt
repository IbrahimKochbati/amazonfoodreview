I have been eating coach's Oats for about 3 years now, about 7    4.5lb bags a year. So much so I am starting to neigh and whinny. I have not last much weight but my blood work does look better, cholesterol is better and BP is down. It tastes great and have not grown tired of the taste. Easy to fix (2min40sec in the office microwave done perfect). Life is good.
