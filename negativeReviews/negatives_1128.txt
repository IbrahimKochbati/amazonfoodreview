I thought this would be the perfect candybar, I love hazel nuts, I love caramel, and I love chocolate.  But there is something about the chocolate filling that I don't like.       they claim a whole hazel nut in each piece, but it's probably only half.  It's an OK candy, but I will never ever buy it again. I'll stick to Snickers with almonds!
