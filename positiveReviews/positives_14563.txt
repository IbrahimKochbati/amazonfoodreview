This variety pack is great. It comes with my favorite flavor, Earl Grey tea. Amazing aroma it has and with a Stroopwafel nothing can be better in the morning. The other flavors are nice too. Lady Grey for instance has a mild citrus flavor.          Buying in bulk from Amazon saves money too. So if you're into Twinings or tea for that matter, this is a great deal.
