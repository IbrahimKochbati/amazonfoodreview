My cookie research associate (my 13 year old daughter) and myself were both of the opinion that these cookies were not so great    dry, crumbly, yet with jagged bits of almond and shrapnel like chocolate bits. Yeesh. I was expecting something like an "Archway" cookie from the mid 70s    soft cookies you'd put in a lunchbox. I'm unclear what the story is with these cookies, but they're just not very good. Far from what we expected. Not worth buying.
