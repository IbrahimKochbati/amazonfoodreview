I'm a little biased in my review, but I firmly believe that Mt. Kofinas extra virgin olive oil is the best olive oil you can buy. It has the best blend of flavor and low acidity that I've tastes anywhere. I've tastes olive oils that say they have .1 acidity levels, but then they don't taste like anything at all. I've also tastes olive oils that claim all sorts of awards that have made me have a coughing fit from their pepperiness. Here's what I think: it's all about the flavor, and Mt. Kofinas simply tastes the best. Also, since it's sources from one area, I'm not worried about any other oils being in my delicious extra virgin olive oil.          If you want to taste some truly delicious olive oil that doesn't cost a lot, try Mt. Kofinas olive oil.
