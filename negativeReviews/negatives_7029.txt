I used to get these a few years back, and they were amazing. Now I've bought them a few times and they taste different, like they're now skimping on something. They taste really... dry, kinda plain. I have a feeling this recipe change had something to do with the fact that the flavor blasted ones are now available in the huge boxes. I'm sure they're wanting to save money on some ingredients when they're selling in bulk. Will not be buying again.
