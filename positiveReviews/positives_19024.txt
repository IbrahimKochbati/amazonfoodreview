We buy these regularly.  These do not splinter and they do keep the dogs chewing for quite awhile.  We have one little guy who likes to chew a lot.  We keep a couple of these laying around and he is perfectly content to chew on these (new or old) instead of chewing on inappropriate things.  Love them!
