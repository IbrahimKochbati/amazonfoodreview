I opened the carton and the plant looked like someone put it in a shoe box and shook it all up.  I didn't think it would live.     It did recover however and a heat generating pad was included so I give it 4 5 stars.  knocked one for loose packing.     I would buy from this company again in hopes they get better at packing.
