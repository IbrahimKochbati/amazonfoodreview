I originally bought these grape laces two years ago for my cousin who tasted them once and fell in love.  I was never able to find them locally and after much searching, I discovered them on Amazon.  I should have known!  That's where I start looking for everything else.  Anyway, these are delicious, reasonable in price, and they make my cousin very happy.  I would recommend them to anyone who loves licorice, in any flavor.
