I use this cutting board everyday for about two months and I really like it.  Firstly, the size and thickness is perfect, not too big or too small (I cook for 2 people).  A deep edge is very useful, no juice mess on the table and easy to grab.  Secondly, the color is nice warm  own and I like its mild wood smell :)  Thirdly, it's easy to clean and seems to last for a long time(although you can see some knife's marks on the board).
