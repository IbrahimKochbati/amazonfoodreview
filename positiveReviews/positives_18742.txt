I admit it's been years since I've had chicken cooked with Shake 'n Bake. I remember my mom using it back when you'd put it in a little plastic bag and shake it. So when I saw this I just had to try it. When my wife saw what we got in the mail(12 pouches 2.05 oz) she laughed, I didn't even know they still made this, she said. Well, we had it for dinner the next night. Easy to use and it creates a delicious coating on the chicken. Moist, tasty, it was just right! Highly recommended. I'd get it again.
