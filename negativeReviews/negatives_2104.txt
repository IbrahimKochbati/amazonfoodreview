Before I ordered this coffee, I read reviews both here at Amazon and on other sites.  I used reviewers comments to base my decision to purchase it.  I am a lover of Starbucks Espresso Decaf coffee.  I have my own Breville espresso machine at home.  I have been using Starbucks for years.  My Lavazzo coffee arrived and I was eager to give it a try.  I opened the tin to find  own coffee   while I already knew I would be disappointed because I already know I prefer Black coffee beans to  own. While it pulled a decent looking cup, I put it to my mouth only to find it did not match my tastebuds. One sip was all it took for me to hand it off to my husband.  So. My verdict here is, if you are like me and enjoy only black bean coffee DO NOT buy this product.  If you prefer  own bean coffee, give it a go.
