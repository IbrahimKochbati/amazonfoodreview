I can't sleep past 6 AM anymore because of this food.  One of my cats sits on my face, attempting to suffocate me into consciousness (cats aren't very good at biology..), while the other kneads every bare spot of flesh he can find with his claws of "love" until I get up.  If I stop in the bathroom between stumbling out of bed and into the kitchen, I'm treated to a rousing refrain of "MROW MROW SCRATCH YOWL" outside of the door  and that's if they don't follow me into the bathroom and circle around my legs like they're caught in my gravitational pull, all the while insisting can opening is a far better use of my thumbs than anything else.          The only cons, really.  And they're cute cons, so I let it slide.          Suffice it to say, my cats love this stuff.  They eat it, rocket around the house for 45 minutes like they've just done some meth (oh, the power of organic ingredients!), then collapse in the sunspot on my vacated bed and sleep until I get home from work.          Cat win?  I think so.
