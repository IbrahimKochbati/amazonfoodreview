I absolutely love these crackers. The taste is just right. Just enough sea salt, just enough olive oil, just crisp enough, just the right texture. Easily my favorite flavored cracker at this point in time.          So why not a 5?          Well, writegirl is correct in her review below. I have yet to get a box that was not at least 50%  oken. For my purposes, this is not a huge problem as I never use them to dip or for hors d'oeuvres. I tend to eat them plain as snacks. But if you intend to use them to entertain, or need them intact to hold a topping, then you may have a problem.
