The toy seems pretty durable which is a big winner for me because usually the toys that I buy for my dogs don't last quite long.  The toy itself has a tennis ball inside which I really like you don't have to buy two separate toys. I also love the fact that it has a ball inside and they can try to entertain themselves. So awesome.
