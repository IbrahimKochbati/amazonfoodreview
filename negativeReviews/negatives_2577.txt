I just bought a 35 oz box of this at Sam's Club yesterday for $7.87.  AND the reason I looked it up on the internet today is because it is NOT GOOD.  I checked and the expiration date on the box says best if used by Feb 16, 2011.  I bought it Jan 20, 2011.  WTH  The raisins in it are so hard they could  eak your teeth.  The flavor is unimpressive.  The packaging was so hard to open I had to get scissors and then use a zip lock bag because my attempts at opening it, no matter how carefully I tried, caused me to rip the bag.  I doubt I will need to worry about keeping it fresh as I'll probably not eat it again AND I don't think it's very fresh to begin with. YEEEUUUKKKKK  and what's with this price?  Is it a joke?
