This drink is ok. A little pricier with several more calories and carbs than I would like, but it is a good alternative to soda. I am glad there's no artificial sweetener in it. It's sweet enough without it. I like the Crayons drinks better, but cannot find them anymore. I also like the flavor of the R.W. Knudsen Spritzers a little more.
