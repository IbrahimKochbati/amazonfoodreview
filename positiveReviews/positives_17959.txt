Want an easy dinner fast?  Than this is what you need!  I bought a pack of pork chops, threw them one at a time into a ziplock bag with the mix and in 5 minutes had 6 chops ready to bake.  This package does say it will make 6 pork chops, and it did, but the last one was pretty skimpy in coating and I had been very careful to not overdo the other 5.  I would suggest that it does 5 or use 2 packets to do more.  The flavor was light, but good.  If you want a lot of flavoring you might consider using 2 packets, also.
