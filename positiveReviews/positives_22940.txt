I can only find this cereal (w  almonds) at our local ACME grocery store, but it is more expensive.  So purchasing from Amazon.com was a no  ainer.  The expiration date is far enough along that my husband finishes the cereal beforehand.  He loves the crispiness of the cereal; so, as long as he wants Oatmeal Crisp w  almonds I'll keep purchasing from Amazon.com.
