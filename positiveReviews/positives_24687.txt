I actually got this for my cat! And she loved it!!! For a week.... ha          Well I was amazed that she was interested in it at all but now I've got a whole lot of pumpkin on my hands.          It looks, smells, tastes like the real deal and I'm excited to learn how to make pumpkin pies ;)          I would definitely order again (only I already have 11.5 cans ;)
