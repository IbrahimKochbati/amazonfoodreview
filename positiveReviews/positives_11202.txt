I have been grinding my own coffee and putting it into a DIY k cup. I tried several of the "bold" pre packaged k cups (I use these when I am in a hurry.) None of them matched up to my own grind until I ran across these. Emeril's Big Easy Bold is the first I have found that make me want to  ew them instead of my own grind. Excellent!
