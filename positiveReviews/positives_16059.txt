These crackers were called for in a recipe for a no bake cake so I ordered them on Amazon.  Some of the reviews stated that the crackers arrived  oken, which would not have mattered for my purposes.  However, they all arrived intact.  No shipping issues whatsoever.  I did not use all the crackers in the cake and am enjoying them as a cracker!  Very good!!  Cake was fabulous.
