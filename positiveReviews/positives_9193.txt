My daughter and I ordered these "noodles" from Amazon when we were on a diet.  I am diabetic, so they were doubly useful for me.  I read the reviews and found that the advice to rinse throughly and season heavily is the best way to prepare them.. I bought the angel hair and the rice.  We did not care for the rice.  I prepared the angel hair by cooking it dry in a pan with chopped onions..cook it for a good while.  I then added spaghetti sauce and cooked chicken and simmered it for some more time.  It was not like a meal at an Italian restaurant; but when you consider the caloeies and carbs being saved, it was quite palatable.  The only thing I really missed was the buttered garlic  ead!  We gritted our teeth and ate another serving of the angel hair.          Another plus; the website for the noodles has a lot of info and good advice.
