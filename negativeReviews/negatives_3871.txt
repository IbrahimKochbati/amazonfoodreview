The ingredients on this item show several natural fruit juices, but the first one on the list is apple, followed by grape.  Kiwi & Berry juices are further down the list.  I know this is actually fairly common in beverages that have multiple tastes...apple and grape become the "base" and other juices are added in moderation to create a convincing flavor in which the taste of the apple and or grape fades to the background.          Not so in this case of the Kiwi Berry Switch.  It tasted, to me, like apple juice with sparkling water added.  This in not a BAD thing...I kind of like that taste (having spent many years in Germany, the "Apfelschorle" (sparkling apple juice) is a commonly served drink which I always enjoyed.  HOWEVER, I was expecting something that tasted like Kiwi Berry...and in this I was disappointed.          It's nice that SWITCH makes these sodes without any corn syrup or other additives...just juice and carbonated water.  They're still high in calories and sugar content though...so it's not exactly a health drink.  And I wouldn't say it's worth paying more than I would for another "regular" soda.          It's a refreshing drink, but I can only give it the most lukewarm recommendation because it doesn't taste like what the can promises, and offers only modest "health" reasons, none of which really justify a higher price.
