And that's not a detraction!  I love lemon grass tea!  I love this soup!  Going to double my order on the next one I make, this one is so good.  It's the only one I've ever found that I made a second when I finished the first.  I'm thinking stirfry some chicken  east, add a handful of slivered veggies, and make this one a real meal!
