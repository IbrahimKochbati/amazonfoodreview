Since discovering Yogi Teas a few years ago, I have enjoyed the rich aroma and tastes of their varied flavors as well as the fact that they are de caf. I love Peach Tea in general and this is definitely my favorite peach flavor out of all the other herbal tea companies. The Yogi Vanilla Almond is also in my basket of tea to drink everyday.
