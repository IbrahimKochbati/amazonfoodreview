I purchased this coffee because my subscription Hawaiian Peaberry coffee was wiped out due to unusual weather and insects in Hawaii.  While these peaberry beans are smaller than the Kona, they have a much more full bodied taste.  There were "hints" of cocoa bean and something else I couldn't put my finger on.  It's also about $50 less that what I pay for the Kona coffee!  Gotta love it!
