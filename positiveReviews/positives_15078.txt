i love this stuff. all you do is cook it up like the directions say then add what you want (i love sliced kielbasa)and dinner is ready. i don't have the patience for cooking and i'm not very good at it but my family likes this dish.  it has a little heat but my 3 year old eats and likes it. i cook up 2 boxes for my family of 6.
