My dog loves this toy. I have a 60lb Shepard mix and she will spend hours with this thing. She is the type of dog to scarf down her food in a second flat if it's in a bowl, so I give her  eakfast and dinner in this thing and it can take upwards of 2 hours for her to get it all out. I notice that she doesn't act as hungry or bored during the rest of the day which is great! I also have a kong toy that I would fill with treats but that was way too easy for her. The bottle is made out of hard plastic and so far she has hardly made a dent in it. Beyond a collar and leash this is by far one of the best investments I have ever made for my pup. I would recommend this for my friends!          Emily
