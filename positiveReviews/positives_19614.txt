After moving from the bay area to Louisiana, we found we couldn't find salami here. Well, not real salami anyway. That processed flavor added pre sliced stuff that taste horrible, is even hard to find. We ordered this since we couldn't find a way to order what we usually got back in California, on line. While not quite the same flavor as we were accustomed to, it is still really good salami. It has a bit of a nutty flavor unlike our old usual salami. The pepper in it isn't as uniformly distributed in some of the chubs, some bites will have a stronger pepper flavor than others, but not too strong to make them any less delicious. Unfortunately, the cooling packs that were in the box  oke and water logged everything in it. This seems to make the casing with the mold on it hard to remove  I would suggest overnight shipping if you plan on ordering, to avoid this. Five pounds of salami came to 15 little 7 and a half inch chubs, with a refrigerator life of about 2 to 3 months. This is a bit much for two people to eat; unless you eat salami like my wife and I do. This amount would be perfect for a party of 8 to 12 people if that is what you are looking for. Just make sure to slice them thin. If you are one of those unfortunate people who have never had a chub of salami, only the pre sliced packaged stuff, you really should try this. It's like the difference between good cheese and processed cheese food. While both serve a purpose, only one is edible by itself. Add a bit of provolone and a club cracker and this salami is heaven in every bite!!
