I had received this as a gift and had never heard of this  and before, but my friends have always had excellent taste, so we gave it a try.  We made most of the batch for a family  eakfast on Father's Day.  Everyone raved how good the pancakes were!, where did we get the mix?, what's the name of it?, and so on.  The blueberries in the mix are small blueberries, but they really had a lot of flavor  they weren't little tiny blue flecks like in some mixes.  The flavor was fantastic all around, and everyone really enjoyed them!  I will definitely be getting everyone a few of these for Christmas!
