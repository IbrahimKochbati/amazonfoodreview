Mama Grain and Amaranth Ratatouille from Happy Baby have been long time favorites since my son was about 10 months old. Even now he is a toddler, he still eats Mama Grain on occasion   it's good to take with us if we're eating out and he's being picky about what's available. It's thick and filling enough to supplement his meal. It has a sweetness from the bananas, obviously, but the black beans and the quinoa grain also help making it more lasting. So full of goodness! I agree the taste seems a little weird at first to us adults, but I actually like that's a different flavor   help to keep his taste buds open to different tastes, hopefully...
