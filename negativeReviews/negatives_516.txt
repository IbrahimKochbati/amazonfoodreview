If your child is truly lactose intolerant, this product is great.  If fussiness gas is an issue, then consider staying with Similac Advance or another formula that is made primarily with **milk**.  This product did seem to create less fussiness in our baby, but honestly I think the Dr Brown bottles made a bigger impact.  Make your own trade off between fussiness vs. nutrition, just be aware of which formulas are made with corn sweeteners and which are truly milk based.          It's misleading for the company to label the product as "milk based" when it has minor ingredients "derived from" milk.  Read the list of ingredients (below).  I found the ingredients on the parent company's website (Abbott Nutrition).  Don't try to find the ingredients list on the Simlac website    it's not there (perhaps for good reason).
