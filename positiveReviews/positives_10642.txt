Flamin' Buffalo Chick + A1 are my all time favorites. The meat is tender, and the taste (based on the ones I've bought) are extreme with flavor. The only problem with jerky is the salt, and these have a ton of it. I wouldn't consume more then one bag a day, but it's your choice and body. I'll definitely be buying more in the future though, because these are delicious.
