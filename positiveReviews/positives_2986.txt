After reading that corn (and of course pop corn) was heavily sprayed with pesticides and agriculture uses lots of chemicals in the soil to grow it, I decided enough was enough. It was time to spend a little more and get organic. Supplier shipped quickly. Eden Foods puts out a great product. (Edenfoods.com). Certified organic and pops up nicely. I use a  own lunch bag (top folded down) with 2 TB of corn and 45 sec. in the microwave. (Your microwave time may vary). Voila! perfection. Add some splenda cinnamon cocoa powder mixture and yum yum. (mixture sticks really well if you spray popcorn with a little cooking spray) Only 80 calories for 2 TB! No worries!
