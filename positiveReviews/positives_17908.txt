We have used this several different times now and really enjoyed it.  We use the original flavor for our daughter, and then the spicy for us.          Here are a few tips that we think work well:     1. Cut the pork into small pieces, 1 inch square for example.  They cook faster and more evenly.     2. It seems that using a bag and shaking wastes a lot of the crumbs.  Instead, put a little bit of water in one bowl, pour some shake n bake in a second bowl and leave the package open and accessible.  Then dip the pork pieces in the water, let them drip, then roll them around in the seasoning.  If you need more, pour more in.  Seems to work well.          Yum!
