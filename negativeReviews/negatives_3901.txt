The Switch is apparently supposed to be a substitute for soda, with fizz but without corn syrup or added sugar, just juice.  However, the product, billed as "Kiwi Berry", has 135 calories in 8 ounces  more than one would get in soda  and is in fact mostly highly caloric apple and grape juice, for the sweetness, with kiwi and berries later in the ingredient list.  Yes, it is tasty, but a more healthy alternative would be club soda (or water, if you can do without the carbonation) with some juice added.
