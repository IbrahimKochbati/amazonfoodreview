if the house catches fire, I will grab my husband, amnimals and senseo.  I love the french vanilla coffee pods.  I use one pod and select the 2 cup option as I dont like strong coffee.  You will instantly fall in love with the foam that is on top of the coffee.  Use fat free  carb free vanilla creamer and you have a mighty tasty cup of coffee!!!!
