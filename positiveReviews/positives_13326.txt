This  ownie mix makes fabulous, moist and fudgy  ownies.  I use canola oil instead of butter with excellent results.  They tend to dry out quickly once you cut them up, so freeze whatever you don't use after cutting and it will remain moist and chewy.  This beats any gluten free recipe I could make on my own.
