I have a Waring WPM35 which is a 10 cup popper. I use these Great Northern 8 oz. portion packs. I also use the 2 oz. popcorn bags which have a 5" in diameter opening size and they are just right to stuff your hand easily into them to get that last kernel.  This product is easy because everything you need is in one pack, easily opened and dumped into the kettle.  Tastes like movie theater popcorn too.  I'll give it a 5.
