I have never tried turkish delight before. Like others, I was curious about it after seeing The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe.     I really do love it. The rose flavor is an exotic flavor and takes some getting use to. After the intial thought of "I'm eating a rose flavored bath bead" it was really good. It is a little more goey than I would like it to be. I'm anxious to try the lemon flavor. Also, there is A LOT of powder sugar covering them. I had to put the cubes on a paper plate and then dust them off a bit. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try it. I would also recommend you only buy one box at a time. I thought they were smaller boxes my mistake. I think any adult who has a sweet tooth would like this tasty little treat.
