I tend to eat lunch at my desk a lot and got a few of these as something better than tuna on cracker.  Overall, the rice dishes take a bit of getting used to in prep... once you learn the exact time for your microwave, the rice cooks well and is fluffy and the sauce is quite flavorful.          Overall, I haven't found anything at super low fat low cal that tastes better... so I keep these (and other flavors) at my desk all the time now.
