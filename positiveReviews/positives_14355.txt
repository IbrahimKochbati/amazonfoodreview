I have an eldery dog with hip and joint problems. We have been using Zuke's for a little more than a month and have seen and amazing improvements in her. She loves the way the treats taste and goes crazy at the sight of the bag. She can now navigate stairs, is more interested in play and she even runs on daily walks all because of Zuke's!
