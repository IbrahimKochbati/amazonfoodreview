I recently found out that I am allergic to wheat and milk.  As you can imagine, this severely limits my snacking options.  My local grocery was clearancing all of their organic section, so I tried these.  They are SO GOOD!  I love salted & plain rice cakes (did before my diet change too) & these add an extra punch of flavor and crunch!  Yum!
