The crisp texture of these PopChips is very appealing.  The chips also stayed whole in the bag, which is a big plus.  They  have a nice sweet potato flavor, with a light hint of salt.  Best of all, no greasy fingers!  I like that they are a healthy alternative to other chips or crackers.  The information on the bag well represents the taste of the chips.  I think that children would like these and they would certainly be a healthy alternative to other chips.  They are also gluten free...which seems to be a growing trend in foods today.  Overall, I would definitively buy these chips again and look forward to trying other flavors of Popchips.
