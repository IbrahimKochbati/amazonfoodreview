I germinate 2, not 3 tablespoons of  occoli seeds in one container (undivided). I allow the roots to extend into the drainage hole. I can easily hydrate the roots by spraying water across them, whenever I happen to be in the kitchen.          Once the sprouts have matured and greened, I find the following helpful: Two to three times a day, flip the container over, and immerse the greens in a container of water to vigorously shake the seed caps loose. The roots will help keep the sprouts anchored in the box. I don't find the few seed caps that remain a problem   I simply eat them along with the greens.
