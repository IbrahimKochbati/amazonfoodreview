Wild Ride Beef Jerkey is incredibly tender and flavorful.  Most jerky products I've tried in the past are like flavored shoe leather   WFBJ is definitely heads and shoulders above all the others.  There's actually some substance to it   and the fact that it's low fat with NO preservatives is a big selling point for me!  If you like spicey   try the Black Pepper one
