I purchased a bag of the blueberry & apple tiny fruits excited to try something different for my 9 month old child. Seeing that the product said that it was for ages 6 months, I thought it would be o.k. since my child is well passed that age, eats finger foods and is crawling. Unfortunately, the blueberries do not easily dissolve in the mouth. This product is a choking hazard. The company's mission is good. Hopefully they will be able to fix this issue.
