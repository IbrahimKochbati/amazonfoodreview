Peanut butter was one of the things I reluctantly gave up while I lost weight. Through diet and lots of exercise, I lost 50 pounds, and have kept it off for several years now. I thought I'd never have peanut butter again   until I saw this in the organic aisle of the grocery store. Well hello, peanut butter, welcome back! :) I love this stuff. It's like whipped peanut butter. I mix 2 tablespoons with 3 4 tablespoons of water, as I like it thick.          Try this for  eakfast:          In a blender:     8 ounces of milk (I use 60 calorie original flavor almond milk)     1 serving size of powdered chocolate flavored carnation instant  eakfast     1 tablespoon powdered PB2 right out of the jar            mix until smooth. OMG, it's like drinking a liquid Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.          I can have peanut butter again and still fit into my skinny jeans! :)          (PS: the amazon price has GOT to be wrong. I only paid $4.99 for a 6.5 oz jar at the grocery store the other day. Check your local grocery stores, or better yet, the Bell Plantation website where you can buy it cheaper in bulk!)
