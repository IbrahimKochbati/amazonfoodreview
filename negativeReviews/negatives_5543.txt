I have never tried any of the Shake N Bake products before.  I was mainly attracted to it because most  eadings made from scratch require egg or milk and some sort of crumb, and I don't always have those ingredients on hand.  The Shake N Bake for pork only requires a bit of water to dampen the chops and the contents of the pouch    couldn't be easier.          I used some very inexpensive "special purchase" chops; they were thin but huge, not the conventional center or loin cuts, and one of them was more than enough for dinner.          I was only making three big chops, so instead of putting the mix in a zip bag, I just poured some of the mix on a plate and dipped the chops in.  Very easy.  There was plenty of mix left, so it was a very economical meal.          As for the flavor, well, it was okay, not bad but not great.  We specifically tasted paprika and onion powder.  I would prefer flavors that blend a bit better.          The cheap chops came out very juicy and tender with the Shake N Bake.          The covering was also a bit unexpected.  It is very fine and a bit grainy, not a  ead crumb texture.          We microwaved the leftovers the next day, and I would not recommend doing that because they got soggy.  The chops probably should have been warmed up in a toaster oven or maybe a skillet on low heat.
