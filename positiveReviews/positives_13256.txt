Vanilla caramel flavored Coffee mate makes for an excellent milk or cream substitute for people who want a cup of coffee, cocoa or even tea when they don't have access to a refrigerator to keep milk or cream on hand. Coffee mate therefore comes in very handy in many workplaces, naturally, but it adds so much extra flavor to your beverage that you just might wind up using this instead of milk or cream even if you do have access to a refrigerator with milk or cream in it!          Coffee mate is easy enough to use  just add three or four teaspoons full of it into your cup of coffee, tea or whatever beverage you want to sweeten with this wonderful vanilla caramel taste.          I would use vanilla caramel Coffee mate by the expiration date on the bottom of the plastic container; and the container gives you simple instructions for turning this powdery substance into liquid just in case you want to do that.          The nutrition label claims it contains no trans fats but I notice that it contains partially hydrogenated oils. This may indicate that the trans fats in Coffee mate are present but very negligible.          Have further questions? Just give them a call or surf on over to their website.
