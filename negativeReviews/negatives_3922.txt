Switch Kiwi Berry is a soda made from carbonated water and juice concentrates of Apple, Grape, Kiwi, Acerola, Raspberry, Strawberry and mysterious "natural flavors". At 135 calories per can, it's slightly higher in carbs than an average soda.          I gave it two stars because although it is refreshingly free of high fructose corn syrup, it claims to be "all natural"    not sure what's natural about juice concentrate. And, like regular soda, it is chock full of "empty" carbs    like eating raw sugar. I get the feeling from the packaging we're supposed to think it's a healthier alternative, and this seems disengenious at best.          It tastes OK, but really isn't anything special; it doesn't taste like kiwi fruit and only vaguely of strawberries.
