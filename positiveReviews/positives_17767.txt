This is great granola! I had looked at it on Amazon previously, and was unsure of the ingredients based on their description. I found it at Whole Foods, bought a package and loved it. It is very basic granola, done well. The ingredients (reading from a package in hand) are: Certified Gluten Free Oats, Wildflower Honey and Canola Oil    no fruits or nuts at all. I am ordering more. (Incidentally Udi's Gluten Free Vanilla Granola is really good too.)
