The crackers are very good and we were delighted to find them.  My dismay is not with the crackers but with the packaging.  I order multiple boxes from Amazon every few weeks.  When I open them a good half or more are cracker crumbs, no longer crackers.  That makes for a pretty expensive cracker.  When the company is smart enough to come up with a good gluten free cracker then surely they can devise a way of packaging it so it arrives in one piece. i know they are fragile but that is not a good excuse.  Please give this your attention.  Alice & Ben McCarley
