The product itself is very good and I will rebuy.  However, unknown to me at the time is a problem with using this in a Keurig.  If you don't run a cup of plain water through the Keurig after every hot chocolate usage, you will clog up the spout needle and the machine stops working.  If you do that consistently, you should have no problem.  I had to troubleshout this with the Keurig people over the phone.          Ellie
