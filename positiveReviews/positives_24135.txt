I saw these in the supermarket at the checkout line and picked up the clusters. I figured they would taste bland and not be satisfying for the chocolate craving. While there aren't many in the package, I think five or six clusters, they are tasty and definitely fix your urge for something sweet.          I love the clusters and the peanut butter bar. The regular chocolate bar is tasty but I prefer it mixed with caramel or peanut butter. They are between 110 120 calories which is a great little snack, equivalent to some of the other snack bars like Special K.          The bars are heavenly crisps (think nutty bar but thinner). So they are wafers with chocolate or peanut butter between each layer.          I love this variety back and thought it was a good value. I paid $1.25 for the clusters at the grocery store so under a dollar a snack works for me.          Highly suggest to those watching their calories but unable to kick their sweet tooth. Quick shipping too.
