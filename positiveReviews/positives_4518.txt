Harney & Sons' Dragon Pearl Jasmine tea is one of the cleanest and most delicate of commercially available teas I've encountered.          My first experience with it was at the Williamsburg Lodge, in Virginia, where it was served over the 3 days of an annual convention I attend there.  While a shame to have to sip it standing up or moving between speaker sessions, I had a remarkable sense of being elevated above the rush around me.  The bouquet is evocative and tended to linger in the air yet was in no way overpowering... more like a stroll through a jasmine studded garden.  Upon tasting, the first impression seems to register near the tip of the tongue, as if sweet, and as the flavor develops in the mouth there is a recognition that it is, in fact, tea but without insistent tannic or other strong overtones.  A fine impression remains when the cup is set down and the intake of  eath recharges the sensation.          There is no settling of heavy flavors   a cup is as fine and pleasurable from first sip to last.  I also have found that this tea maintains its character despite the array of waters I have used to make it.  Some  ews become distinctly unpleasant when the leaves are introduced to certain mineral rich well water or treated city water.  The best experience no doubt is when using filtered water, but it is not requisite to enjoying Jasmine Pearl.          As a wake me up tea on a work morning, I would likely choose a more robust leaf.  However, for a proper moment of relaxation   or an attempt to induce one in the midst of chaos!   I hope to never run out of this tea.
