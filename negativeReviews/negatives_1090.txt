I've been searching for a no corn natural dog food to keep skin rashes away...tried Halo which was great but so expensive.  This is a little more affordable and the ingredient list looks very similar to Halo, but....oh boy.  I'm just glad it's warm enough to have the windows open!  My dog loves the taste and the quality seems great, so we'll try 2 more days to see if things settle down.
