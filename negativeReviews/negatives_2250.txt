I really like to mix things up with k cups and rarely buy 50 ct boxes of a single flavor.  Exception to the rule would be for dark, bold coffees such as French roasts, which I really enjoy.  So when Wolfgang Puck's French roast turned up on Amazon's deal of the week, even though I have never tried before, now I have 48 units.          It's fairly non descript for a French roast.  Decent aroma, but taste is muted compared to, for example, a Diedrich French roast.  I don't hate or even dislike it, it's 'okay', and for the price I paid, is acceptable without complaint.  It may make an acceptable guest coffee for those wanting something a little bolder without being over the top rich.          I'd call it mildly bold, average, and I won't be going out of my way to keep it on hand.
