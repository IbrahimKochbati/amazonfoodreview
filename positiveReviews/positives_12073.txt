I have a Lhasa Apso. She goes through bully sticks in a day at $3 5 a pop. I'm a senior on a fixed budget, and all of it can't be going to dog chews. I've tried pretty much everything. Having a small dog limits many options because her mouth just can't fit arund some products. This product is great. Because it is round and  aided, large chunks don't  eak off, eliminating concerns about rawhide chews. She is able to both chew it and carry it around easily. And one of these lasts at least a month. I had been buying a similar product in my local Petco, but it cost $3 more. I am totally happy with this product and would highly recommend it for smaller  eeds.
