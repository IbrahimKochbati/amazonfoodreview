I love this stuff.  I have one of those small individual serving blenders and I love to make Vanilla Chai freezes.  I use ice and skim milk and this powder.  This  and is great, and you definitely get the most for your money.  I used to get Vanilla Chai freezes at Borders for like 3 4 dollars, Starbucks makes frozen Chai's for just under 5.  I've also tried Tastefully Simple Chai, but it was really really expensive.  It's nice to be able to make it at home whenever I want (which is basically every day!) and it's more cost effective.
