I was looking forward to this order from Amazon. I've been on a calorie restricted diet for months and it's the taste of grains ( ead, chips, crackers)that I miss the most. I find these Thin Crisp eads from Kavli to be the perfect solution. They are ultra thin. I mean they are thinner than you might think possible.          As soon as I saw the first one I was amazed it made it through the shipping process in one piece. So far I have not come across a single  oken cracker. My next thought was...."well, as soon as I bite into it, the thing's going to explode into a thousand tiny shards. I was amazed when it held together and showed only a perfect half moon hole where my teeth had been. These crackers really hold together nicely.          The flavor is very plain. There is no seasoning, and very little salt. they taste like the grains they are made from. I have ordered a case of the "Garlic" flavor and look forward to trying them. I eat these with a generous spoonful of very low calorie pepper and eggplant spread that makes for a very low calorie snack. I highly recommend these.
