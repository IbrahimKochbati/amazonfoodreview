My daughter (9 months) absolutely loves these "snackin' fruit rings."  And I feel much better feeding these to her because they are Earth's Best.  I much prefer this to the other  ands puffs.  They do not melt like the other ones, but my daughter is fine with them.  She gets a big smile on her face when she sees me take them out and is trying to open the container to get them.  A great snack, and a great distraction in a restaurant.  I just wish I could buy them in a smaller bulk amount.
