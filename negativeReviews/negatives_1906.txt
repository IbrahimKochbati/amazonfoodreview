I tried this pricey dog food for my Australian shepherd on the advice of a friend who has a  small dog does that does very well on one of their foods geared for toy dogs.  First of all, making a decision on what food to buy is confusing.  They have many  eed specific foods and to look at all the bags is exhausting.  With the help of a sales clerk I picked the Medium Breed adult. My dog, at first did like the food very much but I felt he was overwhelmed by the amount of food I had to feed to maintain his caloric need and gradually he lost interest in eating it.  The ingredients list was pretty standard but did have nice levels of antioxidants and omega oils.  Certainly this was not worth the price tag.
