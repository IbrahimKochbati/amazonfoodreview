This is the best tea I've ever had, and I have basically given up coffee in favor of it.  I usually buy several boxes at a time and one box seems to last a few months (drinking a few posts per day).  One of these tea bags  ews an entire 32oz tea pot with great flavor.  If you love black tea you should give this a try    it's smooth and flavorful. Shipping is a little slow, but definitely worth the wait.
