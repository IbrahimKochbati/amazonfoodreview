These dried mangoes taste similar to other dried mango products.  In some bags though, you may get an odd piece that is hard and dry    but tasty nevertheless.          My only problem with this product is that in each bag, some of the pieces are really tiny.  This can be annoying if I am snacking right out of the bag.
