Tea should be stored in an airtight container. This paper bag is just folded at the top w o any seal. Tea was tasteless. I should have returned it but I was too lazy to do so. I am sure Amazon would have taken it back and would have paid for shipping. I like Amazon but not all the products are excellent.
