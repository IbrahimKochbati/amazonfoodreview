I've purchased this item twice.  The first delivery was excellent in all respects.  The sun dried tomatoes looked and smelled great, and they tasted even better   I ate many of them straight from the bag.  Unfortunately I re ordered and the second shipment was awful.  The tomatoes were over dried, dark  own in color, and smelled burned.  Worst of all they tasted horrible in everything I've tried to use them in so far.  Honestly I think I'll probably throw away the rest before I have to throw away any more dinners prepared with these.  A huge disappointment after my initial impression, and due to the cost of a 5 lb. bag.
