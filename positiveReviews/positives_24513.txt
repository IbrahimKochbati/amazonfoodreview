I took a gamble ordering since I knew other people were receiving them badly dented.  Luckily mine came without a single dent.  They were packaged in a tight fitting box inside a bigger box with some of those air packets.  With the 50% off sale and subscribe and save discount, they were under a buck each and are delicious in pumpkin  ead :)
