These are for people that cannot tolerate sugar. They are not low cal, just slightly lower cal. The regular Coffee Rio Original Coffee Caramels made with sugar average 15 calories per piece or 60 calories per 17.3 grams, which is 4 pieces. The sugar free version averages 12.5 calories per piece or 50 calories per 16.5 grams, which about 4 pieces. Thatt's 20% fewer calories per piece.          They are slightly softer as the regular Rios and much less sweet and much less flavorful. In terms of flovaor, there is no comparison    the regular are rich; the sugarfree are bland, emphasis on the "bla". Eating these is a big sacrifice for 20% fewer calories. If you want to reduce caloric intake, the if you can work up the discipline to skip one piece for every 4 you eat, you total enjoyment might be much greater with the 20% fewer calories.          They are made with real coffee and milk and Splenda sweetener, and other things.          If you have partial fillings or crowns or  aces, etc. you will want to avoid chewing these even though the are sotftler than the sugared version.
