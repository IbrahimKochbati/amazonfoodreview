There is a reason The Today Show voted this coffee the best organic blend in America. It really is the best. I buy a lot of coffee and have tried all the mainstream  ands, like Peets and Trader Joe's varieties. This is easily the best I've had. Consistent, never bitter, and it's Fair Trade Organic too. The Organic French Roast is also great!
