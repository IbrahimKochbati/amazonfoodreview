I love this tea. You cannot always find it at the grocery around here, so I was very excited to find it on amazon. It is cheaper to buy it on here to boot! The taste is smooth and mild, and great with cream if you like your tea that way. If you are looking for a new favorite, this is it. Has a little caffeine but I am sensitive to caffeine and this tea does not bother me one cup at a time.
