This is a wonderful, delicate, yet so tasty green tea. The Pomegranate gives it a special, almost zesty, taste. I ordered a box of it for my Keurig machine, and went through the 1st box at record speed. Since then, I order two boxes at a time, Since it's a green (herbal) tea, you can enjoy it any time of day or as a tisane in the evening.  I think you'll like it as much as I do.
