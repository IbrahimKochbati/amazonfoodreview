This product is a real bargain, considering the fact that dogs love liver. I've used this as an addition to another dog treat product I use for my dog. My dog goes nuts when he knows that he's about to be rewarded with     Pro Treat Beef Liver treats. The instructions advise to give 2 3 pieces per day when using. At this rate, the container will last you a good while. The product itself is very fresh and the pieces are all of various sizes and thickness. Average size of treat is small rectangular pieces of different thickness. They're easy to  eak into smaller pieces if necessary. My Springer Spaniel pup is 5 months old and he just loves these. I tried this product on my girlfriend's 10 yr old teacup Poodle, who is pretty slow at this point in her life. She absolutely came to life and jumped all over the place for a taste of one of these treats. Buy it....your dog will love it!
