When my much older children were little, Gerber sold a sweet potato juice they loved! Go Vitamin A! Gerber has changed their offerings many times over the years giving this particular item ingredient and name changes. My daughter adjusts to the changes, but will prefer this juice over all others. And now when her friends come over, they leave telling their parents, "I love carrot juice!" Unfortunately fewer and fewer stores are caring the item as the Gerber line continues to change and update . I was so glad to find it still available on Amazon. Try it. I think you will be surprised and your own child's response.
