This product is delicious.  I will say this upfront   Thou semi messy (why not place the peanut butter in the center??? Instead on the back?)  The taste is great.  So great that I started to eat them all day    not good as it ruins the enjoyment!!!          These are actually so good I had to stop eating them!!! (I guess I over did it!!!)          Value:  Excellent snack for everyone (all my friends love them)   family.          Shipping:  Fast (as always with Amazon Prime membership   2 days)          Packaging:  6 Boxes Total   each contains 6 individually wrapped granola "thins"  (1 3 of granola bar but flat with peanut butter on one side [seriously).          Also do not ruin the granola as I did by eating every day!!! Also I notice to avoid mess just open with scissors!!! (pealing makes a mess!!!)          [...]  Exclusively
