I got this for my 100lb laberdoodle I want to keep her healthy so I get her real stuff to enjoy. I like the fact that the bones are not bleached like most dog treats. People buying treats for their dogs need to remember they are carnivores they need the protean and calcium that the marrow gives them. Not to mention they love bones, give them a choice between a bleached fake bone and a real bone see which one THEY chose.
