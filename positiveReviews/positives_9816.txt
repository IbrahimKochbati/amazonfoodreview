I love them. I have eaten all styles and preperation of peanuts. These are unique in that their texture is crisp and crunchy. The quality is first rate. Fresh, clean taste. I even love the salt free because the taste is so pure, you don't miss the salt!!     These are my new standard. I just hope Amazon doesn't stop distributing them!!!
