The bumblebees arrived on time, very carefully packaged, with none  oken.  They are larger than I expected, and very, very cute.  I cannot attest to how they taste, but I bought them to decorate a cake, and they are small enough so that their flavor won't affect the overall taste.  I'm guessing they taste like hard sugar :)
