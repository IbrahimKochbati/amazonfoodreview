Made  ead in both oven and  ead machine.  The oven method seems to produce an 'exploded' top, which I assume is from the yeast rising too quickly?  Either way the  ead turns out moist and stays fairly well in the fridge.  I always toast the  ead on a dark setting which produces a light tan, probably due to the moisture in the loaf.  Every GF  ead I have tried has always seem to be much better tasting toasted and I think that is the rule if the GF world?          I also use this for pie crust (you do not use the yeast).  The pie crust has 3 variants:          1) Standard   2 sticks of butter     2) Flakier   1 stick of butter and 8 OZ of shortening     3) Non Dairy   1 stick of margarine and 8 OZ of shortening          I've tried both the standard and flakier versions and both turned out well.  Never had a complaint about my pies (yet!).  You may want to warm up the bottom crust first or it may be a little raw, but I have also had that happen on regular pie crusts.          If you do try the pie crust   make sure you put the mixture in the fridge for a bit to ensure it is cold, otherwise it may be too sticky.  I roll it between 2 sheets of wax paper that has a quick spray of PAM applied.  Makes the transfer to the pie plate a snap!
