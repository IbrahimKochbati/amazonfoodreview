When our third child, and first son was born, we sent our oldest to school (Kindergarten) with these for her friends to cele ate. It really made her feel important at school, and helped her cele ate the birth of our little boy. She loved doing it, and her friends enjoyed them too. BTW  teachers, we did clear it with the teachers at school first, so no hate mail please!
