I'll be honest, when I'm eating GF crackers I really want them to taste like a saltine ritz or something that doesn't feel like you are eating a mouth full of hay. (Not that I don't like multi grain stuff, I do.) I want the cracker to hold up to cheese or whatever I put on it AND not to  eak apart everywhere. This cracker has all of that   dry cracker taste, works as a carrier for other food items and doesn't  eak. That puts them a 5 in my book.          What I would rate a "three" is how many you get in a box. It's just not much at all. The crackers come in two 2 serving packs, which if you are like most people that's really two 1 serving packs. Like most GF things these aren't cost effective, but if you are buying them on Amazon they are a lot cheaper than the $5 a box that most stores carry at them at.          Overall, love 'em.
