Ok, so I have ordered the 1 oz and 1 2 oz bags and absolutely love them!! They definitely have a cheesy flavor and are delicious. I decided to order the 4 oz bags because it is more oz for your money. They aren't good at all! They have NO cheese flavor at all. I am very disappointed with this! I have contacted the company to see what they say about it and will update my review once I get a response. Don't buy the 4 oz. bags!!!     Update**I contacted the company and they did send me a  and new box. It was much better! Apparently the 1st box I got was old!
