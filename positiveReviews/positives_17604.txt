Using a coffee scoop to measure, one 3 oz. packet  ewed an 8 cup pot of coffee.  One thing I noticed immediately, while measuring, was the lack of strong aroma. (You know, that lovely smell that wafts up from good strong coffee.)          I stuck my nose into the packet, and over the pot when it finished  ewing, and still, not much aroma. Same thing in the cup I poured. (Taken with one sugar, a little half and half.)          So I was pleasantly surprised that my first cup had a nice, rich flavor. It was very smooth, with no bitterness. But...there was an unusual sort of "aftertaste", that I really couldn't identify.  So I waited about fifteen minutes, and fixed my second cup. The rich taste had faded some by this time, but that aftertaste was still there.          I think if this coffee is  ewed and consumed quickly, the taste is rich enough to be satisfying, and the aftertaste may not be something everyone notices.  However, the quick fade of flavor, and the lack of aroma equals four stars.
