i first bought these treats at my local shelter to try with my 2 dogs.  i barely made it in the door before they were jumping up on the bag i had them in.  they absolutely loved these treats and look forward to them after our morning walk.  they each get 1 and race to their respective hiding places to eat.  once they're done, they usually come looking for more but i try to limit 1 treat per dog per walk or else they'd both gain a lot of weight!  i'd highly recommend these treats to fellow dog owners and i'm sure you'll have a similar reaction from your dogs as well.
