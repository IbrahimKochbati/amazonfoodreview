First off I'm very happy that my Keurig Coffeemaker sits nicely atop this storage drawer without having to take up any extra counter space. But on the other hand it's difficult to reach the last K cup in the very back of the drawer. I can live with it but they should have designed it so the drawer extended out a bit more for easy access.
