After my doctors told me that I needed to supplement with formula and stop  eastfeeding as much because my daughter did not gain enough weight, i knew I did not want to use fomula. I found this goats milk and it not only helped her gain the weight she needed but it did not give her any GI upset. This was a god send and my 11 month old is still just as happy as when she was  easfteeding. She does not mind the taste and loves her bottles!!!
