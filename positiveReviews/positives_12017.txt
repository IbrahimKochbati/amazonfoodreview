I was pet sitting recently and the dog I was sitting for had these in her treat pouch. She loved them so I tried them with my dogs. All 3 dogs were quite well behaved whenever they saw me reach for these goodies. My son and I jokingly call them "doggie crack". They're good for them, they work as training tools, what else can you ask for in a dog treat?
