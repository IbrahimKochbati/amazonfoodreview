We have been buying this pancake mix from Ikea for years.  Suddenly Ikea quit stocking it.  So I Goggled Kungsornen Swedish Pancake & Waffle Mix and Amazon came up!  The mix is very easy to use and the pancakes are great!  Thin, moist and great tasting just like I remember when I was a young boy.  I highly recommend them.
