I just received my Juniper tree best gift and Japanese black pine tree and I am embarrassed for the company. It took 10 days to get them (not too bad) but they were packaged poorly   crooked and upside down in the box and so puny I don't think they will live. I ordered another juniper from Lousbonsai and received a juniper in excellent packaging and 5 times larger for LESS ! Lou also sent instructions to call him immediately after receiving so he can educate a bit and to call ANYTIME. 9greenbox says if problems, take it to your nearest nursery and ask for advice. Really???? Do NOT recommend this site ever. I am going to do all I can for these poor inky dinky tress. I'm sure Lou will help! Shame. Amazon reconsider this site please. Just awful.     ORDER FROM LOUSBONZAI.
