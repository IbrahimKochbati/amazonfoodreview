Big Mistake. I ordered two cases of these Crown Prince Sardines when my local store stopped stocking my usual  and (King Oscar) which were on back order. Not at all to my liking and I have been eating sardines for a couple of years. I even believe a few cans are either spoiled or off? Hard to prove but somehow I taste it?? Haha  and I ordered 2 cases, suppose I could return them but then I have to pay shipping back  ate them at first out of stubborness  but then just gave up hoping maybe I just hit a bad can or two. Lesson learned  don't jump too deeply into that online case deal  try an individual one first unless you have alot of experience with the products at hand. I will stick to Nordiac Brisling sardines for now on  have never had a bad can or off taste with these in water or olive oil.
