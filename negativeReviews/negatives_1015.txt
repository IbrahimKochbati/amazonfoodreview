I have used this mix for years for yellow pound cake and everyone seems to love it.  I'm still able to purchase the 18oz. at my local grocery.  I was going to order this product, but saw that it was 16.5 oz. and was afraid it wouldn't go with the old Duncan Hines pound cake recipe.  Hope these companies realize the damage they are doing to time proven recipes when they downsize their products.
