These taste great, and when I got them very few were  oken... on average one pretzel per bag was  oken.  They are shorter than most pretzel rods, about 4 inches each.  I was making chocolate dipped pretzels and was trying to figure out how many I could put in each gift bag, so I had my kids count how many there were per Newman's Own 8 Ounce bag.  There are about 40 pretzels per bag.  I ordered two cases trying to make sure I had enough, so hopefully this info will save someone from doing what I did  buying twice as much as needed.  Now we get to eat them.  :0)
