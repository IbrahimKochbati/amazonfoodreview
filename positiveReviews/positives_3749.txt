I lived down in Louisanna for 10 years, and Community Coffee is what you were served when you asked for a cup of coffee. Here in Iowa I can't buy the Comm. Coffee, so when I saw the ad to order through Amazon I jumped at the offer. I got 3 bags of the Hazalnut and I am in Coffee Heaven right now, Thanks Amazon.
