I didn't like this drink at all! It had a very strange, almost chemically taste to it. I also didn't appreciate Switch marketing itself as "all natural" but had ingredients like "natural flavors and colors". What are they?? Are they even natural?? I even let my three year old try it but she couldn't even swallow it and spit it out in the sink. Too bad. It would have been a good alternative to sodas but not with this horrible taste. My daughter and I much prefer the OOba Hibiscus drink.
