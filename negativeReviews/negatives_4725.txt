My local grocery store only carries the vanilla Torani syrup in the sugar free version, and so I decided to order the variety pack from Amazon to see what I thought of their other flavors.  I try to limit my sugar intake, so that's why I was so keen to get a variety of sugar free ones.  Interestingly, I found that the different flavors do better in different types of drinks.          Vanilla   This is still hands down one of the most versatile flavors. I add it to carbonated water and make my own creme soda. It also does well in hot chocolate and coffee, and I've also added it to baking recipes when I've been in a pinch and out of vanilla extract.          Raspberry   I'm not usually a huge fan of artificial raspberry flavors, and I don't like this one in coffee or hot chocolate, but it is absolutely wonderful in iced tea! Who knew? I was prepared to donate this one to the office coffee stash, but on a whim added it to my iced tea when I was out of Splenda, and wow, it's very good and seems to lose the funky aftertaste in the tea.          Caramel   I'm not overly impressed with this one, but it does work well in adding to my oatmeal in the morning to liven up the plain oats. It tastes even better with a dash of cinnamon, but I don't use this one in drinks because it just tastes kind of odd. It's almost like they couldn't decide between caramel, butterscotch and some other random flavor and kind of went with the middle ground.  I wouldn't order this flavor by itself.          Chocolate   This is another one that I've added to my oatmeal at  eakfast and have been happy with the result.  This one also works with coffee, but not tea.          Irish Creme   I'm a big Irish Creme fan usually, but this one is just kind of so so.  I do like it in a glass of hot milk for a steamer, and it's okay in hot chocolate, but tastes weird in coffee.          Hazelnut   This is a good one for coffee, hot chocolate and oatmeal.  I combine it with the Chocolate one in the oatmeal and it tastes kind of like a Ferrero Rocher, and makes my daily  eakfast feel like a bit more of an indulgence than it really is.          I ordered the Variety Pack on the Subscribe and Save 4 month rotation, and had to go in and cancel the second shipment because I'm only about halfway through the bottles. It's a toss up as to whether or not I'll completely cancel the subscription because these are sugar free and it's so hard to find flavor additions that don't come laden down with teaspoons of sugar.          Amazon   it would be wonderful if you could offer a make your own variety pack of the Sugar free syrups! I've seen other Torani sugar free choices, but I don't want to make the commitment to a 6 pack of a single flavor. I'd definitely order a lot more of these syrups if I could mix up the Variety pack to be more than just these 6 flavors.
