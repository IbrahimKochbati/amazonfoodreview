I eat a 80% paleo diet and these are a GREAT treat for me that fit into my lifestyle eating! I needed to give up my addiction to chocolate bars and the strong chocolate taste in these made it easy! A serving size is 2, but honestly just one satisfies me so well! Each one only has 2.5 g of sugar, but taste sweet (must be from the coconut oil coconut). I HIGHLY recommend these! VERY healthy and very yummy!!!!
