Golden Roasted Flax Seed, whole seeds: If you like the taste and smell of roasted nuts (peanuts, almonds, cashews, etc.), then you'll most likely enjoy TJ's Golden Roasted product.          Upon opening a bag, the oh so very seductive toasted nutty aroma wafts out, and it's heavenly. You know it's going to be good. I keep a coffee grinder on my kitchen counter. Personally I like to grind the seeds and add them to whey protein smoothies with chocolate, coffee, coconut, vanilla spice flavors. Toasted flax pairs very well with those flavors. Also delicious in yogurt with a drizzle of raw honey or maple syrup. I also love to mix together 2 Tbsp of ground seeds, 1 tsp of coconut sugar, 1 2 tsp of cinnamon, 1 4 tsp of cardamom and ginger to sprinkle on top of a bowl of creamy porridge. It makes a great nutty topping for cereals. Can be added to baked goods as well.          I love this product! Not only does it taste phenomenal, but I also feel good about the nutritional punch of Omega 3, lignans, and fiber. Scientific research points to flax having a balancing effect on hormones and  east health.          When I recently ran out of this TJ product, I tried another product to COMPARE quality, Spectrum's Organic Dry Roasted Premium Flaxseed, and was very disappointed    twice. Just today (5 9 2012), I opened yet another bag of Spectrum (2nd try), and again the product not only smells rancid, but tastes inferior. Expiration date on the bag is 8 9 2013. Spectrum also adds salt to improve the taste. Salt does not help the Spectrum product, and I won't be trying it again.          If you're going to try whole *roasted* flax seeds for the first time, then you should try this Trader Joe product first. The taste and aroma won't disappoint, and there is no added salt. TJ's is just pure whole, roasted flax seed. Pure nutty yummy goodness. Net wt is 15 oz (425g).
