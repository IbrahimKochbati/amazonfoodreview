What I mean is that the ratio of calories to grams of protein is unacceptably high, and there is too much butter used in the making. Also, the seasoning is slightly higher than mild for US tastes, although if you like Texas chili, you might like it. I think this is true for the Spinach Paneer, both of which I sampled right away on arrival.          As a precaution, don't open the packet near an open flame. All the packets I have tested spurt a mix of oil and butter when opened, maybe a teaspoon or so in all, maybe a fire hazard, but also a bugle call for any household Florida cockroaches to come running (and be dealt with).          If you want to blunt the spiciness, I recommend adding a tablespoon of protein powder and mixing in after heating. That also  ings down the calories to protein ratio.          OK, heat it in an Amazon stoneware saucepan pfaendl using a multi size Amazon lid to keep it from splattering. Pour it out over genuine Amazon kasha, with maybe some Amazon iodized table salt to taste, and the kasha justifies the butter somewhat. And, would you believe it, one (1) cashew, cooked until tender, included.
