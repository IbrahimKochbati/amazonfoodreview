I live on salt and as a result have hypertension. These products work surprisingly fast to lower your high blood pressure and to put it as nice as possible, keep you alive longer. And, that is a scientific fact, as salt is only a habit and has no real useful pupose except to cause many unhealthy habits and conditions. Keep caring about us and don't stop producing foods that are very healthy.
