I'm a bit of a stickler when it comes to my coffee and it took me a long time to succumb to the Keurig fad. I now love my K cup in the morning and finally found the perfect blend. Other K cups are too weak and taste watered down. This is truly a delicious cup of coffee. Costco sells a huge pack at a very decent price. Love Newman's extra bold.
