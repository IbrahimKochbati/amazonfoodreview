Yes I ordered 5 boxes of 24ct pecan turtles but,     what was shipped was 10 boxes of Pecan and Cashew turtles.     I E mailed back asking why they substituted without my approval and their response was: our website clearly stated that the turtles were a combination of Pecan and Cashew turtles.     Needless to say, I am not happy about it and future orders will go to someone else.     John
