Okay, so Extra Sugar Free Dessert Delights Strawberry Shortcake gum doesn't taste at all like fresh strawberry shortcake, but it does taste exactly like Strawberry Shortcake, the doll.     It tastes exactly like the dolls smelled. Or, you could say it tastes like a stick of strawberry flavored chapstick melted in your mouth. How can gum taste like wax, you might ask? Well, somehow, it has this weird mouth coating artificiality that almost exactly recreates the Strawberry Shortcake experience. In this, I am of course referring to the Strawberry Shortcake cartoon that my sister used to watch when we were 9 years old.     I thoroughly enjoyed this gum, chewing it and imagining myself tearing the strawberry scented hair from an undeserving  at's sacchirine cheerful little plastic doll, defying the little monster to attempt to stop me. It was a fantastic experience of um, fantasy.     I gave some to a coworker, and she loved it, too (but she has pica), and preferred it over the drywall she had been eating for lunch. Apparently, it's also 5 calories, which makes it slightly more fattening than that same wallboard, but less fattening than the chapstick she ate yesterday.     If you're on a diet, and have pica, and love Strawberry Shortcake, then this is your new favorite gum. Drop that wad of notebook paper you've been chewing on, and go pick some up.
