This is not the best coffee I've had. The best coffee I've had was shade grown and organic and from Cuba. The second best coffee I ever had passed through the digestive system of a rodent. I'm that guy. This coffee is pretty good. Not the best, nothing spectacular but tasty and enjoyable. And at 6 dollars a pound when you pay the same 6 dollars for 12 ounces of 6 o' clock coffee (which this is vastly superior too) at current prices it's an incredible deal.          I was a little worried about the roast, some places say french roast but really don't mean it. This is not the darkest french roast ever but the beans do have a nice oily sheen to them.
