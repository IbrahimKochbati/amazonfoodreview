Hmmm, where to start.  It's a really, really good cup of coffee.  It definitely deserves 5 stars, no doubt, happy to drink it, would be proud to serve it to my guests.  Perhaps best called caramel finish, not sweet caramel finish   might need a little turbinado sugar to get the sweet part.          I do not think it is better than the Cafe Altura Dark Roast Columbian sold by Amazon in 32oz bags.  I would consider them equals, but the Weaver's is not better, and you get more coffe for less money with the Cafe Altura.          I'm sure being called the "Best Organic Coffee" on the NBC TODAY Show was a good shot in the arm for sales, but I sincerely doubt that they are "the new standard in artisan coffee."  I think of coffee like Italian restaurants in New York  New Jersey.  The great ones have endured, and everybody knows where to go for great Italian food.  But, when everybody is making the same stuff really well, what you're left with is your personal preference.  Weaver's is lucky to have some devoted coffee drinkers, but they're not a new standard by any stretch of the imagination, way too many people growing & roasting great coffee for that.
