What was Quaker thinking?!?!  Why change something that has been so good.  I had to send them an email about it.  I did nto realize there was something different about the box, but I could tell when I ate it.  Something just wasnt right.  It made me examine the box only to find that the oatmeal isnt enriched with the vitamins it had and has less sugar.  Whatever they did   the new one is horrible and I am not searching for store  ands to replaced my beloved  eakfast.
