Lived in California for several years and was introduced to Tajin via Mexican cuisine.  I used to limit only to fruit, I loved especially on apples, pineapples, and watermelon.  After moving to the midwest I couldn't find in any store (I now live a very small town.)  So spoiled being able to buy at Walmart or Target when we lived in Cali! I ordered via Amazon and thought an 8 pack would be too much.  But after reading reviews here I was convinced to go beyond fruit and sprinkle onto savory items.  WOW, all the reviews were right, I literally use this on almost everything now!  I love it on pizza, sandwhices, spaghetti, chili, beef stew, mac and cheese, steamed veggies, it really adds that extra "oomph"!  I introduced co workers to it and gave two of them one bottle each and now they're hooked, too!  I leave a bottle in our common kitchen at work and pretty much use it daily at lunch.  The 8 pack is a great deal and received lightning fast with my Amazon Prime membership.  Thank you so much, Amazon, for making this available!
