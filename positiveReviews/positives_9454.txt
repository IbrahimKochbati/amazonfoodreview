I've been eating gluten free for about seven years, and a couple of Pamela's cookies with a cup of decaf have gotten me through my 4 p.m. "low" many times in those years. When I first discovered them, I loved all the short ead styles. Then I moved into the chocolate chip versions. Most recently it was the peanut butter, with and without chips.          I love them all, but this raisin and walnut cookie may be my all time favorite. It's tender, chewy and generously studded with nuts and raisins. Unlike some of the others, which can be a little sweet for my taste, this one seems to rely on the raisins more than sugar for sweetness. After eating one or two, I feel like I've eaten something that might be good for me (and not just totally self indulgent).          Like all the Pamela's cookies, they're a little pricey, but the prices here on Amazon are definitely the best I've found. (Likewise for the Bob's Red Mill GF  ead mixes, which are also wonderful.) Thanks, Amazon, for your great selection of GF foods.
