I have loved this tea for years. Now I find that the blend has changed: less organic ingredients, substitutions. The taste is weaker and the color has changed from clear yellow to reddish. And the box has gone from this interesting, colorful carton with lovely sayings to a cheap, thin, unattractive box that screams "Made in India as cheaply as possible." I'm looking for another Detox tea. Why mess with a great product?
