I have tried other low acid coffees such as Ola's and really enjoyed the taste.  Not the case with Puroast.          First, the smell upon opening the bag of Puroast dark French roast was underwhelming to say the least.  It was nothing that I could attach an adjective like "rich" or "inviting" to but rather made me think "what an odd aroma for coffee."  Not a good start.          The quantity in the bag seemed small in the filter so I  ewed with 10 cups of water and not 12.  I think it was a good choice because I could still see too much light through the  ewed coffee for my taste.  And speaking of taste, I found this coffee to have an ash like character.  Not rich, smoky or full bodied like I anticipate a French roast to be.  The aftertaste is unpleasant and really lingers.  Overall, not a good coffee experience.          Because taste is subjective, I will mention what coffee I find tasty so you can get an idea of what the other end of the spectrum from Puroast is for me.  Peet's Major Dickason's and Ola's Organic Uganda Bugisu are two of my favorites.
