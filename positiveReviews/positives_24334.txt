I grew up eating these extraordinary  andy filled chocolates. (Ok, I admit, I didn't actually eat them as a small child), but still, these wonderful treats  ing back some very happy memories. The chocolate is very dark and silky, and the  andy fills your mouth with flavor. (It's quite a shock to those who haven't experienced these chocolates before). If you're looking for a great gift for someone who appreciates fine chocolate and  andy, look no further.
