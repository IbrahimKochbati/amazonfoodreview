This product is NOT lemon zest.  Bears no resemblance to lemon zest   does not look like lemon zest, does not smell like lemon zest, nor does it taste like lemon zest.  In fact the label says 'Contains granules of dehydrated lemon peel'.  The picture of lush, juicy lemons is hugely misleading and if I was able to give this product no stars, I would.  I thought I would give it a try, but the consistency of the rehydrated whatever it is was mushy, tasteless and without smell.  I did not risk putting it in my ginger cookies and had to make a quick trip to the store to get some real lemons.  Don't waste your money as I did.
