For those reviews that say the coffee wasn't strong enough or the cup leaked, they simply don't know what they're doing.  First of all, use the right kind of coffee.  The first time I used it, I put in a medium roast that wasn't ground very fine.  And yes, the coffee was weak.  So I switched to a VERY FINELY ground dark roast and it was perfect.  And yes, they will leak and leave grounds in your Keurig if you don't let some of the filter hang over the edge and seal it correctly.  I had no problem with sealing the cup...so far so good.  Makes as good a cup of coffee as the more expensive ready made k cups and have yet to find any grounds in my coffee or in the Keurig.  Really a good deal, plus I had them three days after ordering.  Very quick shipping.
