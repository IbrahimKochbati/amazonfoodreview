We do pet adoptions and also run a shelter for cats. I personally own 7 cats!!! I have absolutely never had a problem with feeding these to any of my cats.          They have NEVER vommited from this treat, I have a hard time believing this!!          I do know that the recommended amt of treats is only 10.. I have never fed more then 10 12 at a time!          At home I have adopted a persian and I often use the hairball treatments with her and they actually DO WORK!!!!! I give her the suggested doce of 10 treats at a time and they are very tasty. Since, I have never seen her gag from hairballs, not once!          All of my cats come running when I open these treats. My favorites are the vitamins as well as the hairball and the regular plain I also love to feed them. They love them all!          The ONLY other treats I feed usually are Pounce and Party Mix but Temptations are there favortires!          I HAVE ABOUT 8 BAGS OF THESE IN MY CABINETS... Because I have a lot of treats!          At the shelter I run, we keep all kinds of cats and kittens and we have about 35 right now and NONE have never had any problems with these treats to date. I am sorry that others have maybe had problems but these are the most tastiest and healthy treats available. I also love that they provide GREAT dental care and tarter control.          Providing these treats I honestly feel that my vet bills will be less in the future with also providing treats that they absolutely LOVE!!!!          My mom and I pay the vet bills for any sick cats, we love cats!!! So far we have been blessed with wonderful healthy strays and none have been diagnosed with feline aids or Leukemia and we do vaccinate and have them tested.          Please give these treats a try, they are awesome! Oh and also buy the large bags because it is actually saving you lots of money from buying the smaller bags.. You get about 3x the ammount!
