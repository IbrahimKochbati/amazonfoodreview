My first reaction to these when I opened the pack was "Wow, they smell good enough to eat!"  I'm not sure that matters, since some of my dogs' favorite treats smell like something I don't even want to touch (check out their most favorite sometime, Icelandic fish skins    ick! I have to face the bag away from me when I open it.)  Nevertheless, it moved the Newman's Own treats up a notch in my own preferences.          Now, in the interest of full disclosure, I have to confess that I have Cardigan Welsh Corgis, a  eed infamous for its hearty and undiscriminating appetite.  Having said that, they loved these treats.  They found it hard to sit still to get one (standard house rules) because they had to wiggle and wag and be all over excited about them.          Each bag contains only 10 ounces of treats, which does make them expensive, but good ingredients never come cheap (if price is your only deciding factor,  ace yourself before you go look at those fish skins).  Given the healthy ingredients and my dogs' reaction to them, I would certainly buy them again.
