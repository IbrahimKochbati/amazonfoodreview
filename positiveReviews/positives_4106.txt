The product is great...but it arrived mostly melted together instead of individual drop pieces.  I am sure it was over heated in the shipping.  We live in central California where temperatures get into the 100s.  I am  able to use them, anyway, by just cutting them up.     Partly my fault...I will try to remember to order during the winter months for cooler weather.     Excellent product...
