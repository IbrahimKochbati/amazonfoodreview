This coffee, with a low acid content, is meant for heartburn sufferers and antacid consumers. First I thought this coffee is not for me, but I was pleasantly surprised by the taste and the aroma of this full bodied French roast coffee. This makes delicious coffee, and it appears that the lowering of its acidity does not affect the taste. I recommend one teaspoon for one cup of water, if you use more than a tea spoon, the coffee may be too strong.
