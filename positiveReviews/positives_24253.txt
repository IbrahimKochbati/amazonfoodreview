I love hot chocolate, heck , I love chocolate period. I was a frequent fan of a certain book store that sounds like charms and local{hee hee} they use to serve there own  and of chai and then time stood still ... they stopped selling it. I called the store frantically to see if anyone could find some in a dusty old wharehouse in Cleveland...no really in Cleveland , Ohio that is where I discovered the yummy warm exotic substance.A very good sales rep informed me that Big Train Chai has the closest taste. So off in search of Big Train. I found it on Amazon and also at a wholesale club but I paid more at the wholesale club for just one can. On Amazon, I paid 19.99 for 2 cans AWESOME!! The flavor is creamy not like chai tea but like chai milk tea and it says to add one scoop per every 6 ounces but I use less for a larger cup. The warm cozy feeling I get is so pleasing it reminds me of the Big "O"{wink, wink}try  a cup, warning chai tea may frequent gas for some, and the caffine levels are probably much lower than tea, chocolate and obviously coffee.
