I feed my 10 year old toy  eed this food and she hasn't complained yet.  Was feeding her Eukanuba her whole life before the dog food scare.  Switched then to only organic  ands like Wellness.  This product has been the best deal on organic dog food I have found and with the subscribe and save...perfect!!
