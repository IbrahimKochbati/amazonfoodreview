Earl Grey Tea can be overwhelming. Generally, when an Earl Grey calls itself "Bold", they aren't joking. Personally, if there is too much bergamot oil in the tea, it is too overpowering for me to drink. I like to drink an aromatic tea, not a cup of perfume. The Rishi Earl Grey tea is described as "bold and sweetly smooth with an enlivening aroma of bergamot citrus." I think that sums it up very well. I was a little concerned when I popped the lid on the tin, as the scent was very powerful.  However, it is a pleasant smelling tea that does not overwhelm me when the cup reaches the mouth. I can taste a high quality, rich black tea with sweet and lightly citrus tones.          I also feel good about drinking this tea because it is a Fair Trade Certified tea that is shade grown from heirloom tea trees. It's organic as well as Kosher. Rishi also says this tea can be steeped multiple times, so this tea is also very economical. I'll definitely be trying more Rishi teas.
