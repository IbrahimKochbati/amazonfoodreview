I either got lucky twice or this stuff staves off an oncoming cold. My three grandkids are with me all the time and are all under three years old. That means a lot of colds. I got sick of being sick and decided to try this product. So far it worked. It is easy to take and tastes fine. I will be taking some tonight since all three are little snot factories again. Keeping my fingers crossed.
