My wife and oldest son don't like a strong coffee, so the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend works great for them. While I myself prefer the Coffee People's Organic, which is darker and more robust   similar to some of the blends found at Starbucks (not their regular blend). The Organic is strong enough for them to re use once, after I've had the first  ew.          I also love that we can get the double pack of the Breakfast Blend 24 K Cups inexpensively from Amazon. We purchase the Coffee People Organic in the 50 K cup boxes.
