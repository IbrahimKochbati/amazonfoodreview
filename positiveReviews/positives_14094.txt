This tea is a very great substitute for coffee. I found it about five years ago as a recommendation from a friend and have been drinking it since. It has a great flavor and versatility. I like mine strong with a couple teaspoons of honey, organic sugar is great as well. It makes a good cup of iced tea and it does get milky when cold so just be aware of that. I recommend this tea to most anyone. If you have this first thing in the morning, be sure to eat something with it.
