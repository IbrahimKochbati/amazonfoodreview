I have to say the new offerings are great. the french roast and the Italian roast have a nice strong coffee flavor. I would say remember your first cup out of a keurig, the reason you bought a machine, these two flavors remind me of that.     Those first few lines are from my review for the Italian roast, they are both excellent.
