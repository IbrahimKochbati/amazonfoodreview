I buy this dog food from a local store as it is a bit cheaper, but I wanted to review on here for anyone interested. My dog loves chicken but turned up his nose at other chicken meal dog foods before this one. Before Avoderm, he would graze at his food and only eat when he was really hungry. Now with Avoderm, he eats all of his food right away, right as I put it in his bowl.          Not only does he seem to love it, it has really done wonders for his coat. His hair is sleek, shiny, and smooth. He has less dander as well.          I can feel good about giving him Avoderm because it is an all natural product. They even have grain free options if your pup is allergic to grain. And it is easy to find this item in the big box pet stores. Highly recommend, your pup will thank you!
