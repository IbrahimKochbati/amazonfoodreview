My dog LOVES to chew her toys, and I thought that with the advertising that the bottle was "bullet proof" that meant they had made the rest of it as indestructible as they could.  I would have been happy to get a week's play out of this.  No go.          My dog loved the treat aspect of this toy.  She spent a long time working the treats out one by one, and I was really happy with how busy it kept her.          Until I went to pick it up to  ing it inside with us at night.  I found several little pieces of the rope part that she had torn off.  I realize it's difficult to make a toy unchewable, but this wasn't even close to as durable as it could be.          For a dog that doesn't try to destroy toys, this would be a wonderful toy!
