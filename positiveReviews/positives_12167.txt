I first tried this  and and blend as part of a k cup sampler pack. I was immediately in love with this k cup! It's my very favorite so far. My personal preference for coffee is a nice bodied medium roast, and this more than fits the bill. It has the smoothest taste of the 6 or 7 medium roasts  eakfast blends that I have tried so far. If you like high octane, this is not going to be your favorite k cup, but you would certainly enjoy it as a nice change of pace every now and then. My benchmark for a good k cup is that I can use the large (9oz) setting on my Keurig and still get a cup of real coffee, not coffee flavored water. This passes the test with flying colors. If I need a kick in the pants to get out the door in the morning, I drop down to the 7oz setting for a slightly stronger  ew. I like the fact that the taste remains smooth, even if I make it a little stronger. I give this k cup an A+!
