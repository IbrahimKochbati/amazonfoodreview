I was just a bit underwhelmed by the flavor and aroma of this Earl Grey. I appreciate the fact that it is organic. That is always a major factor in my food purchases. The beautiful long leaves were impressive. I don't care for the fragrance of bergamot to dominate, I would say it was well balanced in this tea, but somehow the overall flavor was...nice.          For this company and price, I expected an Ooh & Ahh moment upon inhaling the fragrance and taking the first sip. Their silver needle jasmine was exquisite.          In a blind taste test, Twinnings humble tea bag would clobber it.
