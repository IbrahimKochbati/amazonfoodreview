My dog chewed up the "rope" that stops up the bottle into dangerously large pieces in a manner of minutes.  Note that in the "Medium Large" photos for this item the stopper appears to be an actual purple and white rope, but the item I received had the solid purple soft rubber "rope" that appears in the "Small" photos.  This design is completely unsuited for even moderately powerful chewers.  I never would have bought this item had the photographs been accurate.
