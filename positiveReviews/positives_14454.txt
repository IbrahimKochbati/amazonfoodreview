I have been subscribing to this product for several months now.  I've been looking for ways to incorporate more barley into my life, and this is an easy way to do it.  There's not too too much sugar in the product and it's very tasty.  My only hesitation in ordering this the first time was that I don't tend to like the freeze dried berries that seem to appear in cereals and other products these days.  But these were tasty, no weird textures, etc.  I highly recommend the product.
