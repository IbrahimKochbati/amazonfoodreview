The 'Sun Chips' are an OK substitute for the usual potato, corn, whatever chip cooked in oil and over salted.  They are not nearly as un palatable as I thought they would be.  Have added them to my 'heart healthy' diet regime.  All are good except for the 'multi grain' style, which has the texture of a sheet of plywood.
