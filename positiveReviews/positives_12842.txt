The taste of The Switch Kiwi Berry, reminds me of Jell O fruit flavored pops.  I happen to like this flavor, but I wouldn't call it Kiwi Berry.  The name "Kiwi Berry" seems little more than a gimmick since the main fruit ingredient in this soda is apple.          The Switch is high in calories, but at least it doesn't include high fructose corn syrup.  The ingredients listed seem to be natural and I do not feel sick after drinking it (as I normally feel after drinking corn filled sodas).          I recommend The Switch Kiwi Berry for people who like fruit flavored sodas without high fructose corn syrup.  Those on a diet may want to avoid this drink since it contains more than 100 calories per serving.
