The best gluten free mix I've tried.  Of the recipes on the box I can vouch for the pancakes and the waffles  the biscuits were edible if not enjoyable.  The pancakes and waffles also freeze well.  I also recommend Betty Crocker's "Glutenfree Recipe Collection" magazine for extra recipes to try with or without this mix. From the magazine I have thus far made the chicken and dumplings (the dumplings disintegrate a bit too easily but are still good) and the fruit swirl coffee cake (I used a full can of pie filling per 8X8  I used apple and lemon pie fillings.  I thought the cake tasted rather like a cobbler or dry danish pastry).  The mix is quick, it's easy, it tastes good, and it is versatile.  And hey  although the packaging of the mix into the little boxes is a bit of a pain it does serve to keep the mix fresh!
