Awesome butter and salt flavors! It tastes just like the movie theater! Next time I think I will try the 2.5 ounce version. This completely fills up the whirly popper! For 2 people, this is a little much. It stores overnight in a Ziploc bag just fine. An excellent product, that I will purchase again! Also, for those of you looking for the movie theater super buttery popcorn, you may want to purchase some additional buttery topping.
