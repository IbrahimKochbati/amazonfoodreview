Earl Grey is one of my favorite blends of tea. I usually order my favorite  and, but decided to try Celestial Seasoning when the other was out of stock on Amazon. I was surprised to find that this blend does not taste like Earl Grey at all. While other  ands vary as well, to me, this one strays so far as not to be recognizable as Earl Grey. Of course many may like it nevertheless.
