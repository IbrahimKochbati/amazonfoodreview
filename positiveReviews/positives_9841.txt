Tazo Awake Full Leaf Tea is the best black tea I have ever tasted.  It is much better than the ground tea bags you would find in the grocery store (even of the same  and and type!).  It is very smooth, yet bold, delicious drank straight or with a splash of milk and a little sugar.          The caffeine content is perfect to give you a little heart racing boost and get your day started.  I am not a coffee drinker so I use this as my morning wake up drink.  Love it and always have it on me, even when traveling.
