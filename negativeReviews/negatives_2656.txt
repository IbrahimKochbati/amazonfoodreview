...but the cans were smaller than I expected for the price I paid.  I dunno, I just expected to be saving a lot more than that when buying in bulk.  It's the same price (about $3 a can) at the local Target.  Plus, and this is a personal problem, I had a hard time being conservative with em.  They are delicious (not as good as the smoked ones though which Amazon doesn't sell for some reason) and I couldn't stop eating them!  I went through two cans in the first night!  I love to snack, but almonds aren't the best for snacking in large quantities, and I won't explain exactly why but it messes with your digestive system.  Anyways, the nuts are perfectly fine and it's a decent price (considering you're not paying sales tax outside of NY and that there's free shipping if you're patient) so I can't not recommend them, although I will never buy em again in this quantity.
