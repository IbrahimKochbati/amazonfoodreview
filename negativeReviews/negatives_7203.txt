These treats don't last, my dog can pop them out in a matter of minutes, and it's completely gone in about 5 minutes.  Add to that the seller I purchased from only sent me one (they come in packs of 2, seller opened it and only sent me one treat), I was very disappointed.  Never going to bother with these again.
