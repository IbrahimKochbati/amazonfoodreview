Zapps potato chips are absolutely delicious.  Every flavor is marvelous; we buy them at the grocery store and order the multi flavor packs online.  Voodoo is our family favorite; it has a perfect amount of Cajun zing but is not hot, just very flavorful.  A bag has never lasted more than one meal at our house   it is constantly being passed and devoured.  The lucky winner is the one who steals the seasoning from the bag liner at the bottom of the feast!  After finding Zapps, we eat no other type of potato chip.  Certainly everyone has his own opinion but for us, Zapps Voodoo is as good as it can get.  Bon Appetit and Laissez Les Bontemps Rouler!
