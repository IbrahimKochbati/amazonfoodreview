Okay, so let me preface my review by saying that I don't drink hot chocolate that often and I'm from America and don't think I've ever had hot chocolate while traveling in Europe, BUT my husband is a British citizen who grew up in India with summers in England and he has searched HIGH and low for a chocolate drink that would remind him of those from his childhood.  We found it in this drink and he wont drink any other chocolate drink now (not even the 47 other kinds that are in my pantry that I bought for him to try and after 1 cup he turned his nose up at them... men).
