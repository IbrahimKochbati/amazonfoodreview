These are my favorite cheese crisps. I love the taste and the texture.  But when they arrived, most of them were  oken.  They were very well packed with a lot of packing material around the package.  But still they were  oken.  I wanted to serve them at a party I was having so I could offer great low carb treats to my friends who don't want carbs. But, too bad, I couldn't serve the  oken ones so I had to keep them for myself instead.  Based on taste and yumminess only, I would have given them 5 stars.
