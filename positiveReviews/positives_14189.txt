I love drinking this tea, I am able to go through all 6 packs myself over a couple semesters at school. I drink it at least once per day. Tastes absolutely amazing with KAL Stevia, highly recommended to try pairing the two! I love the licorice taste mixed with the peppermint. Perfect before bed.          PROS     +Value (Amazon offers a consistent solid value on Yogi teas).      Tastes amazing with Stevia.     +Great post dinner treat.          CONS     +Herbal tea versus green tea, some may argue the benefits are greater from green tea, but I love the taste of this tea, so I tent to drink it more making it more beneficial in my eyes.          BOTTOM LINE     If your thinking about ordering this tea, grab some Stevia to go with it (I would recommend KAL  and, known to have less aftertaste) and you like peppermint and licorice, order this tea! Brew yourself a cup of tea, and add one to three servings of Stevia depending on the size, and enjoy!
