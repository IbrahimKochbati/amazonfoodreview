I'm not sure why people are giving this such poor reviews. If you dont like the taste, stop buying the healthy version of the product!! That being said, I love this flavor and I dont think it tastes any different from the "original" that everyone is complaining about. This is a great value considering the fact that each box costs around $5 in stores. If you like this oatmeal, buy this bulk pack! Its a great value!
