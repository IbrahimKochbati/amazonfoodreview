Cutting sugar out of our diet,we went to splenda. Then finding that it was also unhealthy and baking with it made foods flat and dry. We went to stevia no calorie powder, after much research proved that stevia has been used for hundreds of years with no bad health effects. The trick to using stevia is to use tiny amounts and then taste it and add a bit more at a time to suit your taste. I also found that using a stevia that has an 80% ratio is the best tasting and this is the best that I have found. Because of using VERY SMALL amounts this jar lasts for months. This is also the best price ANYWHERE! Swanson is a trusted vendor as is Amazon.
