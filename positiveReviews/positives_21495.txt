I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this gum.  Yes, the peppermint is strong at first and fades within two minutes, but it doesn't completely go away and the gum stays pliable and chewable.  The pieces are larger (75% 100%) than Spry's and you can blow bubbles with them!  There is no titanium dioxide  or glycerine in them (like Spry) and I feel this a better choice for our family.          I will continue to purchase this gum for oral health and enjoyment.  Nice to have a gum that isn't loaded with chemicals that I can give my children.
