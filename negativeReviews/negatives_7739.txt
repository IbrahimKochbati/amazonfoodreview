In Fe uary 2012, I bought these treats while traveling for my 10lbs dog.  I chose them because they seemed fairly healthy, and all of the ingredients were something easily recognizable.  After a week of giving him these (following the feeding instructions), he got violently ill.  He went outside to potty and collapsed on the deck on the way back into the house.  He deficated while lying on his side.  I called him to me, he got up and slowly made his way to me before falling over again.  When I picked him up, his head was lolling from side to side and he couldn't keep his eyes open.  I went to grab my shoes and purse while my mom looked up the closest emergency vet.  That's when he began vomiting.          By the time we were seen at the vet hospital, his vitals were retuning to normal.  I explained what had happened and they said he'd probably had a seizure.  After checking him out, they said that he seemed fine, but asked what he'd been eating, was it possible that he'd gotten into a pesticide, etc.  At the time, I couldn't think of anything.  When we retuned from our trip, I took him to our regular vet and they did a work up on him.  They didn't find anything.  A couple of weeks later I was watching the news, and when they mentioned that the next story was about dog treats making pets sick, I knew.  I didn't immediately remember the  and name, but after looking up the type and look of the package, I knew it was Canyon Creek Ranch Chicken Yam Good.  To confirm, I called my mom and made her pull out the package.  I was right.  These treats we're the ONLY thing different in his diet.          I am thankful that he only had an acute attack from these and not something chronic or worse.  I am going to write a letter to the Neslte pet division, to their CEO, CFO, board of directors, anyone, to let them know that they are making pets sick and worse.  They should be ashamed of themselves
