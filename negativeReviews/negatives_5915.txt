No seriously, she is.  My dog's "grandfather" (my Dad) sent this as a first birthday gift. I videotaped it   1st time, 23 seconds, including eating 4 treats.  She moved 1 piece with  her nose, ate treat, one with right paw, ate treat, one with left paw (she's ambidextrous), ate treat, and moved last piece with her nose, ate treat, ta dah!!  It was pretty entertaining. It won't slow down treat eating for her, but I can show her off. And it is very durable. I will try some of Kyjen's harder puzzles!
