My husband & I have always bought Lucini vinegar's but in todays economy we try to look for a substitution since Lucini is expensive. I hit the jackpot right off with Cherry Republic's Sweet Cherry Balsamic. My husband & I use the cherry vinegar straight up on our salad as dressing or on a plate of fresh sliced tomatoes so it can draw out the true flavor. This vinegar is even sweet enough to sprinkle on a bowl of fresh sliced fruit for an extra kick but tart enough to use as basting on your fried chicken or fish. You cant go wrong with this vinegar for the price.....so we say bye bye Lucini's Cherry Balsamic, now to find a great pear vinegar to replace another Lucini type we use: any idea's?
