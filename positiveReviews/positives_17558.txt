Finally! A delicious coffee has been created that doesn't send my stomach for a ride on the acid roller coaster. I am able to enjoy several cups of this wonderfully aromatic coffee without any trouble   a first for me. It was such a hit with me that I ended up ordering the Mocha Java flavor. Not exactly the best Mocha Java ever, but definitely easy on the digestive tract. Add a bit of French Vanilla creamer and you are set! Price wise, you are definitely paying for good quality coffee so it makes the slightly higher price tag worth it. My order of Whole Bean (2.5lbs) was just over $20.00. (Shipping is free with Prime). It will last you a good while   even if you are a heavy coffee drinker like I am. I wish I would have stayed with the smooth flavor french roast, but you live and learn. Please note   I drink my coffee straight black. I made the Puroast Low Acid Coffee with 1TBS of ground coffee per cup. Yep, I like it strong. My husband has severe acid reflux and was able to enjoy a cup of coffee without any trouble. He didn't try more than one regular cup (about 6ozs) for fear that he would have problems later. Generally coffee causes gas pain, burping, etc. with him so he avoids it.
