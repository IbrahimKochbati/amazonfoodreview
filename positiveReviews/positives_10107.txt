I've been a Timothy's Rainforest Espresso fan for a couple of years now but this coffee is giving it a run for the money (well not really because it's overpriced).          I delayed purchasing it (I have a $.50 cup limit and Barista runs twice that) until I found it on sale. Having used Keurig pots since they first came out a decade ago and having tried about 80 flavors, I find myself choosing this one over the Rainforest for my first cup each morning.  It's flavor is bolder and clearer than Rainforest and seems more satisfying.  We have a house full of guests now and the carousel has dozens of different coffees on it but the Barista coffees are the ones I keep having to refill.          Still I ding it one star because of price.          8 12   found them for $.60 a k cup (box of 96).  Bought two boxes which will last me two months.  Love this coffee.          10 12   Been drinking Barista Italian for 10 months now and have tried over a dozen new options in the interim.  None came close to the robustness of this coffee.
