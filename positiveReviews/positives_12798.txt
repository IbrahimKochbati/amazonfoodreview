This is a really nice drink    more satisfying than pop. It's carbonated juice with no sugar or preservatives added. Here's how they can say it's 100 percent juice: "filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates" is added back in. I'd really like to try more flavors    maybe a sparkling pineapple orange? Mmmm.
