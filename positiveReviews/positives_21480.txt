No need to review the product because I'm sure most people in the U.S. who are able to eat peanuts have had these.  These arrived fresh and in good condition.  I can't give even peanut M&Ms more than 4 stars since I think the chocolate used in these products keeps getting worse and worse over time; but they are still a fun, enjoyable snack.          I ordered this along with a box of Snickers with Almonds, and Amazon included, as part of my Prime membership, a free "cold pack".          This consisted of a very thick and sturdy Styrofoam lidded box, in which the candies were packed, along with four large cold pack freezable units.          The item was in shipping transit for approximately 3 days, and delivered to a hot, humid region.          Upon opening the container, I found that the candies were still cold and in good condition, although the cold packs were no longer frozen or really cold.          Amazon did a great job on packing this.  Thought I would share that, in case others are concerned about ordering such products from this company.  I'm even keeping the Styrofoam chest and cold packs for re use, since they are of pretty nice quality.
