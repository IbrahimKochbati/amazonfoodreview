I purchased this coffee to make iced coffee drinks.  It has very little 'coffee' taste, and the dark chocolate taste is more chemical than chocolate.  Similar to the taste of flavoring used in baking.          I will not be purchasing this coffee again.  My suggestion to those considering a purchase . . . buy something else.
