I have tried them all   from the top name  ands to the baked cheese crisps that seem to have become the craze these days. These cheese puffs simply take the cake! Not only do the pack all the flavor and texture one would want, but they are packed with the vitamins and proteins one needs! Imagine that   a guilty treat like a cheese doodle is now a healthy alternative!
