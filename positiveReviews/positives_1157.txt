Not wanting to pay $9 per pound at the local mall for black jelly beans, I came to my favorite online store, Amazon. With free shipping I could not beat the price. I went from paying $9 per pound to $3.50 per pound. I was afraid that maybe the good deal meant that they were stale but to my suprise they were fresh and delicious. I bought them for my mother for Mother's Day because she did not get a chance to buy any for Easter. With 10 pounds, I had plenty to share with my friends too.
