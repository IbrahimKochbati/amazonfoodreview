The little grocery store where I shop had a display of Kraft Easy Mac macaroni and cheese in 2.05 ounce cups. So, I thought I'd test a couple. I've always liked their boxes of easy to fix macaroni and cheese and these would be really handy to have in the pantry shelves. Well, on the first one I really screwed up on the instructions. It was my own fault. I put the cheese powder into the water before microwaveing, not after. It was a disaster. The mixture boiled over and filled the microwave tray. What a mess, but I earned it. The next time I carefully followed the instructions and all turned out well. In 3 1 2 minutes, it was done to perfection, and quite easy, I might add. The mac and cheese tasted rather bland, not nearly as good as the  and I had been using. But, it certainly was quick and easy and in a nice one serve container. Very handy.          Gary Peterson
