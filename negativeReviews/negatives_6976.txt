i was recently diagnosed w  gestational diabetes... thus began my quest for a yummy protein bar... this isn't it. i'm giving it 2 stars because my blood sugar levels were within the desired range after having it as a snack. i'm going to try the other flavors, but this one definitely is not one i'd like to have again.
