I use this olive oil for salads, dipping  ead in it, hummus, and sauteing veggies and meat. Its a very high quality oil with a delicious taste! Try the oil by itself and compare to another olive oil and you'll see the difference! I've gotten my girlfriend and my mom both hooked on it. In addition, it has been great getting to know Nick who helps manage the production (as compared to what you buy in the store from a big  and)since he goes to the farmers markets here in Cincinnati and lets people sample the oil.          I've only recently found how much better local veggies and other products at the farmers market can really taste, all for just a couple extra dollars. A bottle of olive oil lasts a long time so paying a couple extra dollars compared to buying another cheaper  and, is more than worth it!
