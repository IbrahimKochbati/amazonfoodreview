I am one of those people who MUST have popcorn when I go to a movie. Many times, its my favorite part of the movie.          So, I finally bought a movie style popcorn popper because I didnt like the taste of microwave popcorn.          When I first got my popcorn popper, I just went to the grocery store, picked up a bag of popcorn, some of that powered popcorn butter flavoring and some vegetable oil. It did the job but, like microwave popcorn, just didnt replicate the taste of movie theater popcorn.          I searched and read tons of reviews on Amazon and finally decided to order this  and.          MY GOD! This IS it! With my first batch, I was blown away by the taste. This tastes exactly like the movie theater popcorn. If not better because you KNOW its fresh.          First: The 2.5 ounce packet is enough of a serving for a person. I popped 2 of packets the first time and it was the equivalent of one of those huge buckets you'd get at the theater. I had to share. haha.          Second: When I received the box of packets, I thought the oil was going to be a liquid. Its actually a solid. I had first thought I received a old batch but no, thats how its supposed to be.          Third: Like the packets tell you... let your popper heat for about 5 minutes, then slide the "solid" oil contents into the popper as well as the corn salt mix. All at the same time.          It takes about 2 3 minutes before the popping starts but it'll pop up a TON of popcorn. And again, the taste. WOW! This is the popcorn I've been looking for.
