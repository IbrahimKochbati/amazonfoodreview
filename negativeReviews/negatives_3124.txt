Good coffee. I guess I expected it to be very strong, "European", but it was pleasant. (Of course I didn't make it strong, either). The Vine package was 11 ounces, so the "pack of 3" is not understood by me. Again, good coffee, but I didn't find it to be especially "outstanding". My favorite coffee is still the "Eight O Clock"  and, and it costs a lot less.
