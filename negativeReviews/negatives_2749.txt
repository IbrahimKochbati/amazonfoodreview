Overall, the bags of popcorn were just like those that you'd get in a regular package of 8 or 12 bags.  However, several bags did not pop correctly (or at all) and had to be thrown out.  Also, many other bags would have a burnt hole after popping.  I realize that some of this variability could be due to microwave wattage, but it was only bags from this large box of Orville Redenbacher's that would do this.  I think when you order such a large box, your chances of getting "dud" bags increase...just something to keep in mind!  Is it worth it to buy in bulk when more of the bags will be duds?
