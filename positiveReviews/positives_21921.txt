I happen to like licorice and the XyliChew  and is definitely one of the best sugar free gums.     The licorice flavor is, by far, my favorite.  I absolutely love this product not only for the taste but     texture and good sweet spicy savory balance.  It has a "thicker," more savory quality than some of     the other xylitol gums, and the licorice tastes natural, not chemical.  I love this product!
