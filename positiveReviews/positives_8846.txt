Mix1 is my favorite post recovery drink after a long run or bike ride.  I especially like the Vanilla mix1.  It goes down easy and smooth and is very refreshing.  It is a great recovery protein drink with lots of extra vitamins, minerals & nutrients thrown in. Some protein drinks are too thick or chalky or just don't taste very good.  Mix1 is my favorite.  I know it is replenishing my body after a hard workout.
