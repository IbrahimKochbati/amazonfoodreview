I'm a fan!  This tea is not bitter, and forgives a wide range of temps and steep times.  In fact, my favorite way to drink it is to throw a bag into room temperature water to flavor the water.  This works well through 3 4 refills, by which time I tend to forget and leave the room.  Steeping for hours does finally  ing the bitterness out, so that's when I toss it.          The "green" flavor of the tea is much stronger than most white teas.  It reminds me of a white and green 'fusion' tea by Stash, though I prefer this Revolution tea.  The pear flavor is delicious, tastes like real pear, and matches the strength of the strong white tea (that sounds funny as I type it   strong white tea?!) well.  If you like green AND white tea, and you like pears, give this a shot.  I'm really very fond of it.          The package comes with a "resealable freshness bag," though I've never felt the need for one before and I'm not sure I need one now.  It doesn't get in the way, and it's there if I want to travel without risking leaking tea dust . . . not that there is any tea dust.  The tea leaves are as large as loose leaf tea, which might be why it holds up through more steeps than anything else I have in a teabag, and they're very green.  I suspect it still has more moisture in the leaves than most teas, but since I'm reluctant to rip a bag open to perform tests, that will remain a suspicion.          There's no string on the teabags, and they're the fancy pyramid type.  They feel very nice.  This is a distant concern compared to the flavor (which, as I mentioned, I am very fond of), but it's worth a mention.          Enjoy!
