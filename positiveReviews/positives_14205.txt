Maldon salt is acknowledged to be the most elegant salt made. Irregular flakes make it ideal for finishing although it would be something of a waste to dissolve it in cooking. The flakes provide a 'surprise' when you encounter them, rather than an all over saltiness. For another dimension, I recommend trying the smoked Maldon salt. The smoke flavor is much more subtle than the aroma.          Maldon flakes occupy one end of the spectrum...very clean and balanced, while a good Fleur de Sel adds it's own flavors due to the microorganisms contained in it. Again, it is for finishing and would be a waste for cooking. Both represent the epitome of sea salts.          No other sea salts are in the running. Those red and black salts (colored with clay) are no more than novelty products manufactured for a curious public.
