I can't believe I have been eating store bought pasta all these years, I just didn't know any better.  The first time I tasted La Campofilone pappardelle, I was hooked. The taste and texture of this pasta is beyond compare. I have not bought store pasta since and will never buy from a grocery store again.     THE BEST PASTA EVER!
