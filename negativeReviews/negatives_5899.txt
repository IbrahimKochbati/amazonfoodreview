I have put different treats under each of the yellow covers however, as hard as my dog tries she cant pull the yellow thing out of the hole.  I think the holes are too deep making it impossible for a small dog (she weighs 9) to get it out.  She was bored with trying after just a few minutes.  She was smart enough to know it wasnt coming out.
