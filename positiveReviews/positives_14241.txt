I have purchased other potting mixes and been horrified to find bits of chewing gum, crushed tin cans, etc in them.  I've never had this happen with Miracle Gro.  Miracle Gro makes a good mix, at a decent ratio, which is great for growing most standard houseplants and excellent for growing from seed.          As for the gnats:  Fungus Gnats can be found anywhere there is rot.  Don't clean your sink for a week   see those bugs?  Same thing.  They eat rot.  They cannot live in dry soil.  THE BEST PREVENTION for fungus gnats is to water with either a drip irrigation system (plastic tubing with holes in it, hidden beneath the soil surface) or water bottom up (water the dish under the plant, and let the soil soak the water upwards).          The fastest and most common way to become infested is to overwater your plants.  I did this one year   we had them everywhere, in all our food, on the walls, and it was disgusting.  If you already have an infestation, try lowering the frequency of your waterings   your plants won't get dehydrated from a little less if the gnats have been happy with what they've had.  Let the soil top dry completely before you water   gnats and their young live near the top, in damp soil.          Yes, I've seen more gnats with this than other soils.  However, that could easily have been because the batch I had had been kept more damp in the store than the other stuff.  Water less, you'll have fewer gnats.  Get Scott's and be prepared to be disappointed (that's the  and I found the crushed tin can pieces and gum in).
