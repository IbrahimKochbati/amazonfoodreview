I originally started drinking Cafe Altura Dark Roast Decaf when I was pregnant, as I wanted to avoid caffeine.  I chose this decaf because it's made with the Swiss Water Method, meaning there are absolutely no harmful chemicals.  I continued to drink the Dark Roast while  eastfeeding, but after that I started drinking regular coffee again.  However, after just a month, I'm switching back to this Dark Roast Decaf.  I like the taste, and I feel healthier drinking it.  Like the previous reviewer, I probably make it a little stronger than the instructions specify  but then I do that with all coffee.  If you're looking for a healthy alternative way to start your day (sans Folgers in your cup), this is a good option.
