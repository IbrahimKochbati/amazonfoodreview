If you used to buy Old El Paso Refried Beans with Sausage and liked that product, which they do not produce anymore, this is the next best thing. I tried these and they are very good, better than any home made stuff I tried to do. I tried special ordering with my local grocery, but they said they could not get the product in and Amazon has a better price than the website for Latin Products. I would definitely recommend this product and will purchase again.
