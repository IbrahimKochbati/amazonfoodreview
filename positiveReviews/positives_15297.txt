Great product! Perfect for coffee lovers because you can make a delicious cup of coffee, tea, or cocoa in about a minute. There are many different flavors of coffee to buy, so you can always have a variety instead of having to make a pot of just one kind of coffee. The tea is awesome, I just wish there were more tea varieties on the market.          I use distilled water because the water where I live is hard and I didn't want to deal with the scaling issues that these units will have with tap water. I also wish this particular unit had an option for filling larger "to go" cups. But you can always run the unit twice to fill those.          The price was right and shipping was fast and free with my prime membership!          You will not regret buying a Keurig!
