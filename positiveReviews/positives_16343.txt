About two years ago I adopted a little toy poodle from my local humane society.  She had been rescued from a puppy mill and was underweight, coated in fleas and had a  oken jaw.  After trying to fix the jaw with a metal plate and it getting infected, we ended up having her lower left jaw along with all of her teeth on that sound of her mouth removed completely.  A year later, during her annual dental cleaning she had 6 more teeth removed and is now down to about 8 total.  Shortly after I discovered Greenies.  Everyday I come home from work and after she is done going outside, she sits by the pantry door waiting for her Greenie.  When I open the door to the pantry she starts "dancing" on her two back legs.  The last time I took her into the vet, they said she only had Grade 1 Dental Disease as opposed to the Grade 3 the year before    Thank you Greenies for creating a delicious product that is helping to save my dog's few precious teeth!  Thank you Amazon for offering them at an affordable price with free shipping!
