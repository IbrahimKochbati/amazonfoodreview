I would give it more stars if I could.  Our first baby absolutely loved it when he was younger, and it is extremely good for the baby with all of the different nutrients that the baby needs.  We got our first can from a friend of mine and then proceeded to buy more of it from amazon.com and ended up buying other kinds as well made by the same company.  The price is great, too.  I can't say enough good words about it.  We will have to wait and see what our second baby thinks of it.  We are definitely planning to buy it for him as well.
