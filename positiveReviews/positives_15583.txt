With six cats in the house, let me say I was THRILLED that Amazon.com offered this in their vine program. My cats eat anything that doesn't run away from them, but everyone from the year old cat, to the seventeen year old diabetic kitty LOVED this food. Even my mom's cat, who is known to be pretty finicky loved it.          The food looks like "real" food, not the loaf type food so often seen in canned cat food, and it smells great. Not stinky at all. The cats gobbled it right up, and I like that there is plenty of  oth and liquid on the food, because that helps my eldest cat, who is missing several teeth, eat it just fine.          I've been feeding wellness and Eagle Pack Holistic food in addition to prescription food. This ranks right alongside those expensive foods. Good stuff!!!!
