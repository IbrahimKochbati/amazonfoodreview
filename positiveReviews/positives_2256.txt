My aged cat has a very sensitive stomach and she cannot eat most cat foods available. However, she has absoloutely no problems with this. Not once in all the months i've been feeding her this has she ever vomited in any way. Not to mention she's acting healthier and seems stronger on this  and.          And she easily eats this dry without having to add any wet food to make it palatable. She clearly likes the taste.          All in all I highly recommend this to anyone with a senior cat.
