My cats will only get their buzz from Cosmic, even cat toys stuffed with catnip doesnt work with them. But I was becoming concerned when the last container I purchased thru Amazon had 2 ladybugs (dried and preserved) floating amidst the catnip. I have nothing against lady bugs, the idea of quality control concerned me. So I'm keeping an eye on this large container and hoping it was just a fluke last time.
