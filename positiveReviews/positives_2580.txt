Great taste and does not have the weird chalky after taste that other hot cocoa k cups have.  I've tasted several and this by far is the better one, but I have to say anything larger than 8oz tastes a bit watered down.  Will definitely purchase more, but at the rate my family downs these, we are probably going to stick to the powdered hot cocoa to be more cost effective.
