I love this coffee maker with all my heart. It's fast, convenient, neat, and it makes a pretty decent cup. I do recommend buying the more robust flavors for  ewing on the large size  especially if you take milk or cream with your coffee. Also, about 6 months after purchase, I started having trouble with the hinges sticking whenever I tried to open or close it to put a new K cup in. But I coated the hinges with some food grade lu icant and have not had a problem since.          Yes, it's pricey, and yes, the coffee doesn't come cheap, but my caffeine addicted family has eliminated leftover waste completely. It's been great for having company over, too. Instead of  ewing multiple pots for caf, de caf, flavored, etc., I now take orders from guests.          Highly recommended!
