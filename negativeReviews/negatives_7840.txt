I had previously ordered baby hulless from Riehl's Select but tried Whirley Pop this time since it was less expensive. It didn't seem to be baby or even remotely close to hulless, as many hulls got stuck in my teeth (and one still stuck at the back of my throat). It was lacking in taste, too   better off buying regular grocery store popcorn for the taste (if you don't mind the hulls). Amazon was great and refunded my money, but I'm going back to Riehl's baby yellow popcorn.
