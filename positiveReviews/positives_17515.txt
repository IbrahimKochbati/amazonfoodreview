Duck fat is awesome!  Makes really flavorful way to cook just about anything...fry eggs in it, coat vegetables and roast ( ussels sprouts are divine) or just spread on toast.          I will say though that what you get in these little cups is pretty much identical to what you get if you collect the fat from a roasted duck...but good if you use the fat a lot more often than you roast ducks (I do save fat but honestly...the grocery store only gets ducks so often).          This seems good quality...has all the flavor, strained so you get only the fat (no "jelly", duck bits, or other rendering byproducts)          Turns solid in the fridge, liquid in the cups.  Refrigerate after opening...can use about 2 4 times per cup depending on what you're doing with it.
