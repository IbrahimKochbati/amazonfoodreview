This is fabulous and it's what we drank when traveling in Cancun every morning. I just found it in our grocery and was thrilled to have it. I put the tablet in the blender and pulverize it (do one at a time, otherwise they melt). Then, you can pour the hot milk into the blender, or else I put it in a separate container and stir it into hot milk I've heated in the microwave. Each tablet makes about four cups. I'll add 1 2 heaping tablespoons. Yum!
