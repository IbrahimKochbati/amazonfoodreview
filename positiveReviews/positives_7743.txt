If you like pork rinds, then you absolutely must try these.  These are pork rinds that basically pop like pop corn in the microwave.  There is nothing quite like a fresh and hot pork rind.  The original flavor is great and so is the spicy, but the spicy can be a little hot.  I will never buy premade pork rinds again because of these.
