Got a popcorn cart for Christmas and I have been trying to tweak my popcorn proportions. NO need with these packs! They make delicious batches of popcorn that taste just like the theater! Delicious and perfect!          (I do find them to be salty, so I cut a slit in the center seasoning section and pour out some of the seasoning before dumping all the kernels, seasoning and oil into the kettle. It comes out just right for us.)
