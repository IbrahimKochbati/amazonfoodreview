Ive enjoyed the traditional mates, and was recently looking for unsmoked mate that does not contain the Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (carcenogens) found in most mates that are smoke dried rather than air dried like this mate is.     that may be linked to mouth and lung cancers.  Ive heard drinking a strong cup of traditional mate is equal to smoking 3 cigarettes, or was it 3 packs?  I know that if i drink more than 1 cup I get sores in my mouth.          It doesnt taste as strong as smoked mate  I got used to the rich smokey taste of that and was a bit let down by the taste of this, but its still an excellent high quality mate, pure leaf with no powder or stems, and I enjoy it more now knowing that its much healthier for me.          Thank you eco teas!
