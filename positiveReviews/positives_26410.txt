Our vet recommended these chews for our standard poodle; we bought our first bag from them. Amazon's price is much better than we paid at our vet's office. Our dog LOVES these chews, and they never upset his stomach. His teeth look much whiter; they really help with tartar buildup. At the vet's recommendation, I cut them in half. They still work great and last twice as long.
