My Vet prescribed Tylan Powder for my dog, for 2 weeks. She forgot to mention how bitter and yucky tasting this stuff was for dogs. My girl wouldn't eat it mixed with can food, yogurt or cottage cheese. I found these pill pockets and thought why not give them a try. They work great. I poor the powder in the center and mold the treat around the yucky powder and my girl gobbles them down.          Best idea ever. I highly recommend these for giving pills, powders or liquids (they are water proof for holding liquid med's also). If your dog cat does not like the treats Greenies does refund your money.          Nice product.
