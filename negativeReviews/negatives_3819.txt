This product is extremely sweet to the taste. The berry flavor is overwhelming to the senses.          Once you get used to the berry flavor (1 2 way through the can). It becomes more calm to the taste buds and is less striking.          If you want a very sweet rare treat this will fit the bill. I could not drink this every day though.
