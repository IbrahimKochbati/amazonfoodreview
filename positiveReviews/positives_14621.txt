YS Organic Bee Farms organic honey is hands down one of the best tasting raw organic honey products I've ever come across. I absolutely love the consistency and fresh taste and when gently warmed, use it over waffles or pancakes, or just scoop it up right out of the jar. Research the health benefits to raw honey, you just can't go wrong with this product. It's super healthy, great tasting, has many uses, what more can I say. IMO a fantastic, healthy product that I will be coming back to.
