I recently found out through testing that my son has gluten and soy allergy among many others.  My son is also extremely sensitive to texture and flavor.     This mix was the only one that had a mild flavor, none of that bean flour that is so over powering and the texture was very close to wheat pancakes.  It was almost     a seamless switch for my son.  The biscuit recipe that can be made with this mix is also very good, just have to get used to flatter shape biscuits.  This mix is also easy to     customize like adding egg or flax seed (egg substitute) for more protein and Omega 3's.     I also recommend trying the other mixes from this company.
