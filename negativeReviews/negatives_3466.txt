These are the typical rawhides wrapped with chicken, and seem slightly higher quality than the kind you get at the dollar store.  But they really skimp on the chicken, so you it's mainly a rawhide twist with a shred of chicken on it.  My dogs go crazy when I give them one but their enthusiasm diminishes when the chicken's gone and with these treats, the chicken vanishes FAST (and my dogs are TINY). So they're great if your dogs loves rawhides and would enjoy the extra zip of chicken flavor but if your dog gets bored with plain rawhide, the joys of this treat will be over in a few seconds.  I'll be looking for a  and that delivers a meatier product.
