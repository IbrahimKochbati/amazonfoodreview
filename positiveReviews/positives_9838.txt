I agree with the majority of other people who have reviewed these peanuts.  I have tried the Peanut Shop's peanuts and have been a devoted fan for years but after reading the reviews here of Royal Oak peanuts I decided to give them a try.  Very glad that I did.  The size and texture has Peanut Shop peanuts beat cold!  And you get more for a better price   how can you beat that?
