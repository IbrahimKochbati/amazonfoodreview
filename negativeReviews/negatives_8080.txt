These are, no doubt, excellent chips.     But I was looking for the # of bags being sold for $9.95. Nothing was mentioned in the writeup, so I called Amazon Customer Service and they said that, as far as they could tell, it's $9.95 for a single bag.     I like the chips, but that's a bit pricey. I'm wondering if it's an error by the 'Food Should Taste Good' folks.....
