The color and flavor is both deep and  ight. Really tasty.          So far my favorite use is to stir in a little milk, along with some cinnamon, ginger & nutmeg, then pop it in the microwave for a quick and healthy treat. It's also good added to plain yogurt, or in a smoothie. Next, I want to try freezing it in ice cube trays (after adding aforementioned spices  and whatever else strikes my fancy at the time   maybe a dash of coarsely ground black pepper, or vanilla extract?), then putting it in the Vitamix along with agave & lemon, to make a pumpkin sorbet.          Would definitely buy this again when it's on sale. No dented cans either.
