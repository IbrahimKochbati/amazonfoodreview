I agree with the other review. Beware: the plant is not as pictured or anything like it. I purchased this Desert Rose for my dad because he fell in love with the one in the photo and the description (~15 years old desert rose). The Amazon shipping weight says 21lbs, mine was UPS 3lbs. I was totally disappointed as I paid $95 with shipping just to get a desert rose that does not look like it's 15 years old. The caudex on the plant I got was only ~2 3" wide and the one in the photo looks about ~6 7"+ wide.          I contacted Lou immediately (I also have no idea why the seller's name is Sheryl when the actual seller is LouBonsai) and he is great at responding. He told me he would ship me a new plant and I kept emailing to make sure it's not just ANY desert rose, but SPECIFICALLY the one similar to the photo. However, their responses were  ief and not descriptive about what they are sending (i.e. the response was "BIGGER AS I WAS TOLD"). I felt as if my concerns were not answered. Lou said he was going to send me a new plant with a tracking number on 7 23 but I heard nothing. I had to email him on 7 25 to ask, they provided one and said I was able to track it the next day. It's 7 27 now and the UPS tracking number still says that a label has been created but package is not dropped off yet. I'm a very disappointed customer at this point.          It would be nice for them to list the actual plant they are selling because it's definitely not the one I received.          2 stars for responsiveness.
