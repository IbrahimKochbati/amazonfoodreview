This stuff is the real deal! Not too soft, not too hard, not too salty, no fat, and a great smokey flavor with just a touch of spice that makes your tongue tingle. For a commercially produced product, this is really a satisfying strip of jerky. I was pleasantly surprised and will definately purchase again...
