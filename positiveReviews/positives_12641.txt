This is a mild coffee which I really like.  I don't care for a really dark blend as it tends to be bitter, but this  eakfast blend is quite good.  I have had a few other blends and I may change and get the columbia blend some time but the  eakfast blend is not bitter and so far I like it the very best.  It has a pleasing taste and aroma.
