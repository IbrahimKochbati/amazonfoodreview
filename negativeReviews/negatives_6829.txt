I ordered this popcorn based on the glowing reviews. It's possible that I received popcorn with an expired date but have no way of telling from the packaging. Food is not allowed to be returned to Amazon so I am stuck with over 20 bags of corn kernels that are inedible. Followed the directions exactly and popped the corn in my new popper, making sure not to over cook. Popcorn came out stale tasting with card board consistency. It was dry and just awful. My first and last time ordering this.
