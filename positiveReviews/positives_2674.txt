I ordered this because so many people were saying that it was sugar free. It's not. The first ingredient is "SUGAR". It's too much of a pain to return, so I'll keep it and drink it (because it's a pretty good K cup hot chocolate). I will think twice about ordering it again though. I'd really like to get what I ordered.
