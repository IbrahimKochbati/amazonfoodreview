Because this litter is a wheat product, it attracts meal bugs. My bag actually came with the bugs in it   when I opened the bag, left it in the bathroom, and came back a few hours later, the bugs were crawling out of the bag and up the wall. I have done everything to eliminate the bugs. Naturally I disposed of every crumb of Swheat Scoop. But once you have these in your house, it is very difficult to get rid of them permanently, due to the life cycle of meal bugs. You think you've eliminated them, and then a few months later, they're back. Do not buy this product, even if you think it works great as a cat litter. You run the risk of being plagued by bugs forever.
