This cocoa powder has a deep, fruity taste  I highly recommend it.  I recently bought a vitamix blender, which means that I now make 5 smoothies a day.  This cocoa powder, plus some almond milk, frozen fruit, yogurt, and a dash of maple syrup, makes an excellent "milk shake".  Disclaimer: I like 99.9% of all chocolate, so take this positive review with a grain of salt.
