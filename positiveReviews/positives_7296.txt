We have purchased two trees and both were gifts.  The first tree was thoroughly packaged with some type of foam insulation totally surrounding the tree. Impressive. Excellent condition!  The second tree came with no insulation but with a cord attaching the tree to the bottom of the box.  A couple of small limbs were  oken off.  It is much better packaging with the foam insulation.          The gift was "assumed" by the recipiant to be artificial (fake), which in this case was not a good thing.  The gift tree was actually preserved.  It would create a much better packaging if the tree came with a certificate stating the type   live, preserved or artificial.          Love the trees!  They made excellent gifts.
