I love ThinkThin bars, but just a warning here. There's no clear marking on this flavor to indicate that it contains peanuts. The last ingredient in the fine print is peanut flour and it sent my son into a tailspin. I'm a very careful consumer on that front and ultimately, I should have known, but their other non peanut butter flavors are just fine. So heads up.
