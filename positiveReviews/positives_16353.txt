Of all the dog teeth treats, I bought this one because it was highly recommended by doggie dentists. If your dog doesn't take to it right away, have some patience. My own dog took it in strides at first  she would chew on it but not swallow it. And now she looks forward to it more than any other little treat. I don't know what it does for her  eath (which is never very minty fresh), but her teeth are sparkling white. Giving her one a day doesn't make her stomach hurt in any way.
