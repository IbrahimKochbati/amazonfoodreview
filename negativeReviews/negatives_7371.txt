I haven't quite determined that the Yogi DeTox is the cause, but since drinking it (three days how) I have had lots of dizziness. I am not going to drink it for a week to see if there is a relationship between it and my symptom. It has lots of ingredients   tastes wonderful   but it may be interacting with a medication I am on.
