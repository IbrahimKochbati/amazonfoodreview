The Switch is not a soda    it's fruit juice with carbonation. Still, drinking it is very much like drinking a soda, but you get your Vitamin C. I found the balance of sweetness and carbonation to be good, although just a little more carbonation would give this an added zip.          What I especially like about this product is that it is all natural and there is no high fructose corn syrup in the drink. However, this is not a low calorie beverage, and the 8.3 ounce can had more than 100 calories. If you are going to include this product in your diet, be aware of that. It is fruit juice    and yes, it has the calories. But this is a food and not just empty soda calories.          I gave this flavor 4 stars because I found the kiwi flavor somewhat lacking. It's not bad, I just think the apple juice was more noticeable, although the strawberry flavor came through nicely. A stronger kiwi strawberry flavor would have gotten 5 stars.          As for the can, I found the zip tab a little difficult to open because of the proximity of the ring to the edge of the can. But I'm a bit of a klutz; I have problems with potato chip bags. So take this caveat with a grain of salt. I think the manufacturer has found a good size for the cans, because you get just enough of the drink to feel like you've had a treat, but not so much that the calorie count is on overkill.
