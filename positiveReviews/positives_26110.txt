i really have to say I love this chamomile tea. Especially when I have a cough and or cold I  ew some and pour it in a bowl to inhale the chamomile vapors. It works just great. Of course I also love to drink it when I'm sick. I like the chamomile taste and that there are not other ingredients in it but the chamomile.
