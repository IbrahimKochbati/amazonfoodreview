I bought this litter and loved it, I could flush it, it had almost no dust, THEN . . . one day I opened a new bag, and 2 days later I went to clean my litter box, and there were millions (probably not exaggerating) of wheat weevils in the "cat bathroom".  It was COVERED in these tiny creepy crawlies.  They are so small, you can barely see them, until there are millions, then you can't miss them.  And their rate of reproduction is crazy!!  I loved this litter for about a year, then I got a contaminated bag and BANG!!!  I immediately threw out all of the old and new (unopened) litter.  I guess I will be going back to the reliable(but not flushable) clay litter.  : (
