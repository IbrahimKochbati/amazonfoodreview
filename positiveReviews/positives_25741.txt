I love oatmeal, and supposedly oatmeal is really good for you when you are  eastfeeding, which I am right now. So the more oatmeal the better for me!     First off the individual wrappers are really easy to open. The cookie is very soft when bitten into just like the name implies it is soft. To me the cookie taste just like oatmeal, I like the taste of it. I saw another reviewer said it tasted like cardboard but I don't think it has that type of taste at all.          The amount of chocolate and almonds is almost as consistent as the image shows. There a nice bit of almond and chocolate on each cookie. The cookie is about 3 1 2 inches wide so it is a nice size cookie for a snack.          Each wrapper contains the nutrition facts which are per cookie: 42g, 180 calories, 8g fat (2g saturated fat, 0 trans fat, 1.5g polyunsaturate fat, 4g monounsaturated fat), 160mg sodium, 26g carbohydrates, 9g sugars, 3g protein. The first ingredient is whole grain oat flour, followed by enriched flour.          I think both kids and adults alike would like this cookie. Great on the go snack if you like oatmeal.
