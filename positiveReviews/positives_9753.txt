As a longtime Offspring fan and Tabasco junkie, I finally gave this stuff a shot after hearing Dexter on the most recent Adam Carolla podcast. I feel foolish for having waited so long, because this stuff is incredible! I've nearly emptied my bottle after only a little more than a week. I will definitely be ordering more soon!
