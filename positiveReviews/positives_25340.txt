I treat my dogs to one of these large CET Hextra chews daily. They love them and at two years (today remarkably) their teeth are as white as when babies. I have used these for about 18 months and buy them a dozen bags at a time   usually from Amazon. I get the XC Large 30 count and expect to pay about 16 buck.          Make your dog happy and treat him to a white smile.     Troy
