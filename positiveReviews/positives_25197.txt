Unlike most "Factory Farmed" maple forests, the forests that Coombs Family Farms use are 100% natural forests. I don't mind paying extra knowing that these trees weren't injected with any growth hormones, grown in high density sapling nurseries or treated with any petro chemicals, unlike most Vermont "Forests," where regular, non organic maple syrup comes from.
