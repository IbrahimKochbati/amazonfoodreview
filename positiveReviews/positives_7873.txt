My candy order came quickly, packed well in a cardboard box   all 12 bags of the 10 ounce size!  I was pleased that the candy had not gotten soft or sticky in transit, as sometimes an order for the 34 ounce bag will do.  The last bag of the 12 has just been opened. . . so, as I was ordering another case, I took a minute to write a quick note.
