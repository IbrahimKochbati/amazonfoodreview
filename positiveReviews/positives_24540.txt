I have another pumpkin eating dog (it really has helped her IBD) and couldn't find canned locally. I ordered three cases of this (error on my part but not worth undoing due to scarcity) and awaited arrival with some trepidation thanks to negative feedback on damage to cans. To my very great delight, only 1 of the 36 cans had a even a small dent so looks like the problem has been solved, at least as far as my shipment goes. Can't comment on product itself beyond saying that it really is helping the dog.
