Who ever came up with the idea to give the option to purchase this on a subscription is amazing. I am deployed right now so my mom is taking care of my two yorkies and her 3 yorkies. I feel like they were eating her out of house and home so I bought this for a monthly delivery(each purchase is 24 trays) for cheaper than wallmart pricing! She called me in tears because this showed up on her doorstep as a surprise (came over 2 weeks early amazing) so she doesnt have to worry about running around town buying dogfood all the time. I do not go by serving size listed on the packaging since we use it as a treat  usually its half a tray per dog and mixit with dry dog food and leftover rice!
