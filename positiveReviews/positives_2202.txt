I tried this gum after Trident cinnamon became hard to find a couple of years ago.  (Trident told me that they were overhauling the plant that made the gum so it was in short supply but it would be back.)  I quickly discovered that the Flare 5 was far superior to the Trident and I haven't looked back.  It does last a long, long, long, time.  Unfortunatley, as other reviewers noted, it has become very hard to find in stores.  Trident cinnamon is everywhere but now I don't want it.  Amazon saves the day again.
