I'm definitely in the minority with this opinion, but the vanilla flavor was not only too strong but it tasted artificial. (The ingredients list says "natural and artificial flavors" without specifically mentioning vanilla.)  This is not for someone who is looking for a tea accented with vanilla.  I am using 1 vanilla tea bag and 1 green tea bag which makes a more mellow  ew, but I won't buy this again    the Spiced Chai Decaf is so much better.
