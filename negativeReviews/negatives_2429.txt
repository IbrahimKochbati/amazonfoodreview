I bought this out of curiosity after seeing it on the Food Network.  It does taste good.  You do have to carefully follow the directions on the bag.  This doesn't work the same as microwave popcorn.  The "bake" time is quite short, and overcooked pork rinds aren't pretty or tasty.  I think that in the future, if I want warm pork rinds, I'll try warming up a small batch of my usual  and in the toaster oven for a couple of minutes.
