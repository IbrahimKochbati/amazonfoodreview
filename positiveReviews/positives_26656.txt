My review is for the Buffalo flavor chips.     I've had buffalo flavor chips from a variety of  ands but Blair's really does reign supreme.     Just the right about of heat combined with the tang of buffalo.     Ahhhhh...........     So tasty.     So crunchy.     So utterly decadent.     So totally bad for you but who cares?     One of the best out there and another home run from the master of heat Blair.     Highly recommended.
