I have three main allergen groups of foods:  wheat, dairy, eggs. This product manages to avoid them all and still provide great taste and nutrition, decent fiber content, at a nice price.          Believe me when I tell you that on such a restricted diet (I have to watch sodium content also) amazon offers many products in good quantities at great discounts (+ free shipping) such as the Ener G line that help me navigate the waters of avoiding ingredients from the allergy groups above. I have also purchase several other items in the Ener G line of foods and have found them all to be in the 4 or 5 star categories.          Only thing to watch out for:  a few of their products have less than desirable fiber content, but if that is not a big concern for you because you get plenty of fiber from other foods, try them also and I'll bet you will like them.
