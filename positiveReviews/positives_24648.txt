This was the only pumpkin I found at a time when I needed it.  It's a good quality prouduct, maybe a bit lighter in color and texture than popular  ands.  It worked wonderfully in my pumpkin rolls.  I usually spend alot less on canned pumpkin, but it was delivered very quiclky, no dents or dings in the cans or packaging.  Overall I'm satisfied.
