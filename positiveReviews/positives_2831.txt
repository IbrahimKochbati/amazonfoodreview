Complete, protein based nutrition.  My dogs love this...although I'm not sure the pibble actually tastes it, she inhales it so fast.  ;)          Regarding the other users who have had diarrhea issues:  My gastro picky GSD (is that a word? I think other GSD owners will understand!) has had this as well.  Initially, I overfed this food, thinking that he needed to be eating the same amount as he had been eating the other stuff.     You feed MUCH less of this product.  It is nutrient dense, and not all filler like other foods.  If you over feed, you increase the risk of unpleasant side effects.          It's a bit pricey, and I haven't  oken down the cost per day, but since you feed less it might be competitive with other  ands if someone was inclined to "run the numbers".
