What a great idea!  I hated wasting a whole drawer with my various K cup boxes (tea, cider, coffees, etc).  I thought about the carousels, but didn't like the idea of having it on my counter.  I wanted something that was more: 1) discreet; and 2) space saving.          1) More discreet: Yes!     It looks nice and you can't even tell what is in it.          2) Space saving: Yes!     My Keurig B60 fits perfectly on it.          I hate having cluttered looking counter tops.  This drawer allows me to store my cups neatly, in a unit that looks nice.  I also love how it has dividers for each row to allow you to organize your K cups.  You cna slo pull the drawer out pretty far, so that you can see all of your k cups.  I also LOVE that I get my drawer (where my k cups were previously stored) back!          I do wish that the top of it looked a little nicer. The black, spongy material on the top looks a little cheap. Because most of it is covered with the Keurig, you don't really see much of it anyway, so it isn't a big deal at all.  But, the material is a bit on the cheaper side   still nice though!          Additional Notes   Things that were mentioned by previous posters already, but that bear repeating:          1) Beware: With your keurig on top of it, you may not be able to open the top.     I wasn't thinking (and failed to read one of the reviews that mentioned this) and got this without realizing this.  Duh!  Sure enough, I can't open the top with my keurig on the drawer.  Ooops.  No biggie though   someone commented with a great idea: Put felt on the bottom of the drawer so that you can easily slide the entire unit out when you need to use your keuirg. I plan to do this.          2) It is MUCH cheaper elsewhere.     At the time of this review, it is listed on Amazon for almost $50.  But, thanks to a previous reviewer, I found it on Bed, Bath, and Beyond for $25...and, I got free shipping too!!!
