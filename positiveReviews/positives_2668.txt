I've tried all the available  ands and flavors of hot cocoa for the Keurig, and this is the only one I keep buying more of when I run out. Of course it's not going to be as good as melting your own chocolate in a pot of fresh milk, but I find it at least as tasty as any non K cup cocoa mix I've had. It is richer than the same company's milk chocolate cocoa (which would, however, be my #2 pick of K cup cocoas).          One star off because of the fact that if you prepare a small cup, there will usually be some cocoa goop left behind in the K cup, which you have to move to your mug if you want maximum strength cocoa. Shaking the K cup first to  eak up large chunks of powder as recommended on the package seems to help some.
