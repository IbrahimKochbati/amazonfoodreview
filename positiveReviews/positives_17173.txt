These are by far my favorite pretzels I've ever had. The taste is mild, which is what I like in a pretzel (that's not chocolate covered), and they're just the right ratio of thickness and size, not like some that are so thick and dry that they stick in your throat, or so thin that you're chewing super salty air. Plus they're actually a bit healthier than most others. Unfortunately they're also more expensive, but I'm happy to say I always get what I pay for with these.
