I am not a doctor, but any time one of my friends starts to feel poorly, I tell them to go buy a box of this tea. I suffer from chronic sinus infections and since I've started drinking this I've noticed that the number and severity have decreased. It definitely helps with immune system support. The taste is pleasant, but if I want something sweet (or to coat my throat when it's sore) I add a little eucalyptus honey and it's divine. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!
