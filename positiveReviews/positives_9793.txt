I need hard sugar free candy to suck for dry mouth caused by medication I am on.  I bought this candy without ever having tried them since I can't buy them locally. What a wonderful surprise to find that they have plenty of delicious flavor, they don't stick to teeth like other hard sugar free candy I have tried, and they don't dissolve instantly. They are very cheap compared to comparable candy in discount stores. This is a winner all the way around.
