This  ead mix is the absolutley best replacement for wheat flour  ead we have found.  It smells yummy baking and the taste and consistancy makes a delicious sandwich.  It also makes great french toast.  This works great in a  ead machine, which makes it super easy to make.  Every other  ead we tried, gluten and wheat free, was dry and tasteless.  Give this one a try.  I don't think you will have to keep looking for a great gluten and wheat free  ead.  You've found the best!
