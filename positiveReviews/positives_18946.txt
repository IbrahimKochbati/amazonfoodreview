My two young adult Siberian Huskies love these.  They chew them pretty fast and expect seconds.  The size varies a lot.  The sweet potato piece can be anywhere from 3 4" to about 3" long and about 1 4" square (about like a french fry).  There is always duck wrapped around it, just not consistent coverage.
