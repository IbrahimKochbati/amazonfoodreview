I should have picked up on the MSG before I ordered the jerky. That's my fault.          The jerky tastes OK. It lacks in freshness and tastes salty in a less than favorable way. Also, in true MSG fashion, the jerky leaves you craving more even when your last bite was not particularly amazing.          I'm torn between two stars and three stars. I think I'll stay at three.
