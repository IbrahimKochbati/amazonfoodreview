Caveat emptor. Tasty but not "buckwheat" noodles. Although not specified on the detail page above, these soba noodles are a blend of wheat and buckwheat. Nor is this indicated on the master case. On the individual packets, however, the ingredients are listed as 70% wheat and 30% buckwheat.          I suppose the price should have told me these were a blend.  100% buckwheat noodles are usually twice this price (or more).
