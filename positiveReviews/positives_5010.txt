Nana's cookies are good eaten plain.  They are a bit crumbly compared to cookies made with wheat flour.          The cookies are individually packaged.  I find it better to cut the plastic open with scissors to avoid  eaking the cookies.          If you want the cookies crumbled, just  eak them up in the packaging and then cut open with scissors to dispense neatly.          I like to cut up strawberries and crumble a Nana's cookie over them.  With a little whipped cream, it's just like a good strawberry shortcake.  They are great crumbled over bananas, too.          Despite being somewhat fragile.  Nana's cookies from Amazon usually arrive intact.
