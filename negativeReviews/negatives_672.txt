If you love super dark, rich, bold and thick flavored coffee then this is the coffee for you...with one problem.  Personally I love coffee that embodies everything I just said.  I love esspresso and the like.  To find a K cup that is this bold even on the 10 oz. setting is great...but there is that problem again...          It smells, tastes, and leaves the after taste of burnt urine!  Like someone torched a public restroom and mopped the floor with coffee, then packaged it. Yum!          There are other dark, bold k cups out there that have a better smell, flavor and does not have a nasty after taste. You may not believe me, and that is fine, but get a sample pack before going for the 24, you'll thank me later. Try the Green Mountain Coffee Extra Bold Sumatran Reserve K Cups. Better all around cup of coffee.
