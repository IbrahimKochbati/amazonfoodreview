My wife and I switched from Peet's to Weavers about a year ago and we've never looked back. The Organic Blend is our favorite   such great flavor with incredible aroma too. Can't wait until tomorrow morning when I get to  ew another pot. Weavers is the best coffee kept secret around   not for long I'm sure.
