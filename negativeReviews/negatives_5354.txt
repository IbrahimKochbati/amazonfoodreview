i don't have much in the way of acid issues with coffee, but at times when i'm binge ing on coffee i sometimes get that burning in my gut.  Is this a better way to feed my addiction?          if i'm a pragmatist, it seems like it's easier on my body.  i didn't have any issues drinking this.     if i'm in an "i love the smell and taste of coffee mood", this isn't my choice.  the smell of coffee before  ewing is less than wonderful.  in fact, i would say it's distasteful.  it didn't make me want to  ew a cup.  Nevertheless, I  ewed a cup to check it out and was pleasantly surprised by the taste.  it  ews a pretty mellow, smooth cup of coffee.  It's not incredibly flavorful, no subtle hints of this or that, but it's many steps above folgers or other cheapie coffees.          In sum, it's not as good as premium coffees,but if you miss the taste because of acid issues, this is a good option.
