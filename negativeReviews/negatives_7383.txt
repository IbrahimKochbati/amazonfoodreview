I used to love this tea. I would drink it every morning but than the stores I  would buy it from stopped selling it, so I decided to buy a case of it on amazon. I don't know what changed, but it is absolutely awful now. It has none of the flavors in it that I use to love so much... and I'll unfortunately probably never buy it again
