Taste tested this  and against Heinz.  My son thought Organicville was Heinz and vice versa.  Hubby couldn't tell the difference.  I could tell the difference and named the ketchups correctly, but the difference is so minor that I didn't care.  The lower glycemic index of agave versus corn syrup is what makes me buy this product over Heinz.  Good ketch!
