This powdered peanut butter is quite tasty, either on its own or mixed with water as instructed. The problem is, it is about twice as expensive as normal peanut butter wherever you try and find it. I didn't like the price on Amazon, and Bell Plantation's website charges over $11 to ship their 4 pack, which makes the price of each bottle about $7. $7 is also about the price I've seen in specialty stores as well.          Unfortunately, while it is a healthy, tasty substitute for real peanut butter, I'll be sticking to the real thing due to the price. Plus, nut fats are good for you as long as they're consumed in moderation.
