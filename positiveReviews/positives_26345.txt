This sugar alternative tastes like a mild sugar, but I really bought it for its low glycemic action. And I have to say it really does give me less of a sugar spike as compared to white sugar.          I like the taste, very natural and earthy. It's not exactly like sugar, but very close.          I think it tastes less sweet than sugar, but it definitely works just like sugar, with a ratio of  1 to 1 in recipes, as promised.          Works perfectly in my cooking and in my tea!          Highly recommended!
