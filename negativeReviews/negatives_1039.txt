The price is great but I just didn't like the taste of this coffee. I'm pretty picky about coffee and love to drink strong. This one produce very acidic coffee when made strong, but if you make it thin, then it tastes okay with just slight acidic after taste. How you'd like this coffee is really depending on your personal taste of coffee, but if you are like me, drink coffee strong, or dislike acidic after taste that lasts while, then this is not for you.
