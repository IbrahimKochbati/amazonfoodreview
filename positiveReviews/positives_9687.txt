Brings out the wolf in your dog!!! My dogs went crazy for these! They last forever and they clean their teeth better than any greenie or other dental chew.  A couple of my dogs that had horrible plaque build up look like they went to the the vet for a dental cleaning!! Absolute dog utopia!!! Just keep an eye on them if you have more than one dog because if they are not used to having treats like this, they can become territorial! They realaxed after a couple of days and now they take turns. They are smelly!!! First couple of days they ate them outside but once they started turning white I let my dogs  ing them in the house and they chew on them all day and night (not continuously) till they go to bed.  Also a great treat if you have a nervous neurotic dog because this helps them channel their nervous energy.
