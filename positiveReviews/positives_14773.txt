I learned about cheese and pickle sandwiches watching a British TV series on Netflix. At first I thought cheese and pickles would be awful! But it isn't pickles it's "pickle" which I guess means relish. Anyway, I ordered a jar and it is absolutely fantastic!! Because the flavor is so unique it is difficult to describe. It has a tangy sweet crunchy spicy flavor and ingredients include cauliflower, cucumbers, onions, tomatoes, rutabagas, apples, and dates. Cheese, onion and "pickle" sandwiches have become a lunch favorite of mine. If you like a sort of tangy spicy sweet flavor you will love this product. I'm so glad I took a chance and ordered it.
