My one complaint is the package clearly indicates the pasta cooks quickly...in 8 9 minutes. Well, I've prepared it twice now and both times took a minimum of 20 minutes to get the middle to soften up. Keep that in mind when making dinner because it definitely is not going to cook nearly as fast as the bag indicates.          On a positive note, the product tastes fairly good. It also works well as a cold pasta for salads and, of course, the fact that it is gluten free is a healthy choice for those with gluten intolerance.          I gave the product 3 stars because it's a middle of the road review for me. Good points and bad...so it's about average.
