This is my second time ordering the "bulk" amount, because these biscuits have no match, and they are hard to find in stores. Packaging was MUCH better this time    bubble wrapped and double boxed. I'm giving a lower rating, though, because I received these in early August, and the expiration date is already up this December. So I feel I've been sent old merchandise. I would expect at least a year for a processed and packaged food item like this, especially ordered in this quantity. I don't know if Amazon will allow for a return or exchange.          ***Update***     Food items cannot be returned, but I was pleased to see that Amazon refunded my money! Now that's customer service.
