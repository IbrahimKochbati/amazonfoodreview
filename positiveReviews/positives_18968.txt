Whether you are on a sodium restricted diet, or would just like to eat healthier.  I highly recommend this product.  It is my favorite soup in the Health Valley line and my favorite soup from a can.  It is so comforting and delicious when I have a headache, when I am sick, when I am sad, when I don't have time to cook, anytime really.  It is great to know that Health Valley Chicken Noodle Soup is sitting there in my cupboard waiting for me with all organic and healthful ingredients.  I find the flavor to be just like homemade.  I have tried other no salt added chicken noodle soups such as Trader Joe's and Campbell's for sodium restricted diets and not only are they smaller cans with higher sodium, they taste like liquid cardboard to me.  I had just about given up on being able to ever eat chicken noodle soup out of a can until I found Health Valley's variety.  I believe the other two best tasting no salt added soups are Health Valley's No Salt Added Tomato, and No Salt Added Potato Leek.  I find those varieties to be better than there sodium containing counterparts.  The No Salt Added Vegetable and Black Bean soups are OK.  If you like chili, you should also try Health Valley's No Salt Added Vegetarian Chili.  To sum up, this can of Chicken Noodle Soup is my still my favorite canned chicken noodle soup, even after eating it regularly for over a year.  This soup just makes me happy! :)
