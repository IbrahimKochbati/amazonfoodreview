I must be in love if I'm mulling over a 12 pack of big bags for myself. I love the crunch, intense curry flavor, seediness, and the fact they are gluten free. These are one of the more original savory snacks you can find. They're very hard so you need good teeth and I love the substantial curry flavor that is not "kind of indian" tasting.
