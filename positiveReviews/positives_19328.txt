My 11 year old lab "Stella", loves to run, play, hunt. She started getting arthritis in her hips and the vet said. glucomsumine and condroitan (sorry about the spelling).  I found food called "good hips" on amazon and tried it. Then I found these treats at the local grocery store. Then they quit selling them. I looked everywhere and found them on Amazon.  I subscribe to the dog food from Amazon.  Stella is like a puppy again!  I recommend these items for anyone with a larger or older dog, it really makes a huge difference in the quality of life of our best furry friends. Stella thanks you!
