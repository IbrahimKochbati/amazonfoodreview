Certainly a great British tea product. Traditionally, such products come to the customers with at least one to two years for shelf life freshness. This end of the 2009 year purchase (six big boxes!) provided me with the product expiring in June 2010. Somewhat short of my expectations; all the more so, expiration dates are clearly written on the boxes and, I am sure, processing staff could easily note this.
