These cups are so easy to use and saves so much money compared to the store bought Kups.  You can use whatever coffee you want and have as many flavors as you want.  We are on our 9th box of these and will continue to use them.          The seller is great in regards to contact and shipping.  The last shipment arrived just a couple of days after we bought them. Long before the "due date" listed when the order was placed.
