WOW.  This popcorn is delicious.  We purchased a large 4oz popcorn machine for our game room family movie nights.  When it first arrived, I wanted to try it immediately.  So, I bought some Orville's at the store and I was disappointed with both the number of popped kernels and the taste.  After the Great Northern popcorn arrived, I was immediately hooked on the flavor and ease of use.  The packages are easy to use and the product tastes great.  Our family only uses about half of the salt flavoring and can not tell a difference in quality of the taste.  My son says it tastes better than at the movies.  Now when we go out to see a movie, we keep the popcorn bag and replicate the experience at home!
