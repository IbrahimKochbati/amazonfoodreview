I have been using this fertilizer for years on the recommended plants.  But this year I decided to try it on some other plants that typically you would not use this on.     I live in an area that gets lots of freezes and frosts and some occasional snow, though not heavy.  I also am a devoted lover of geraniums and I like to have them growing in hanging pots. But they will not withstand the winters here, so I winter them over in the greenhouse and  ing them out when they are safe from frost. When they come out they always have suffered dieback of some of the  anches, sometimes a lot depending on the winter.  So, this year, I decided to try giving them the miracle grow for acid loving plants instead of general purpose miracle grow.  It made a huge difference.  I fed them this several times until the foliage came back, and boy did it come back.  They are much more lush and green and as a result have more  anches to produce buds.  After which I switched back to general purpose miracle grow.  I decided to try the same procedure on other plants not previously treated this way, such as roses and it produced the same results.  Then of course I switched back to regular rose food.  I even tried it on my tomatoes right after transplanting them from the greenhouse to the ground.  It gave them a boost during the transition from greenhouse to outdoors, without trying to get them to produce blooms.  It has been a boon to my tomatoes.  They made the transition seamlessly.
