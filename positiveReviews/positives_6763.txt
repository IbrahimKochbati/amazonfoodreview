She's not a particularly food driven dog, so I've tried lots of organic natural foods. One that she consistently loves is any kind of Addiction's raw dehydrated food. She can barely contain herself while it rehydrates a bit. So much so, that I've started using hot water to speed the process along; otherwise, it's just such drama while she waits for it. This dehydrated option takes up so little room compared to dealing with clunky cans, and as long as she's happy, I'm happy. I try a different flavor everytime I order just to keep her interested. So far, so good!
