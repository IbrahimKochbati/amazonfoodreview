Packages came in soft container that had been crushed and one was split open.  I was worried about how fresh it would be but its aged so no worries.  The Mate is flavorful and strong.  I don't have much to compare it too but at $30.00 for 3 kilos (6.6 lbs) it seems to be a fantastic deal with a a good product.          Not Organic, kind of a bummer, but pretty much expected.  I would get this again but I will probably try another more expensive, organic version and see if I can taste any difference.
