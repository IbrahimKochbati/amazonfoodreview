I generally don't have a very discerning palate when it comes to coffee. Almost any coffee becomes drinkable with enough flavored creamer. So when I made Puroast Low Acid Coffee, I wanted to have a second opinion. I made it for my roommate, whose time in the Pacific Northwest turned her into a bit of a coffee snob.          First, I opened the package and smelled the coffee. It had the aroma of one of those motel room  ews  the kind that aren't fabulous but will do the trick when you need some caffeine. Then I made the coffee in my Gevalia coffee maker. I sampled it black to get the true flavor. That flavor was ... burned. Even after adding a generous amount of liquid creamer, the coffee still tasted burned. Next, I gave some to my roommate. She put some half and half in hers, and she could barely choke it down. The coffee was completely unpalatable, and we dumped the rest of the pot down the drain.          While I like the idea of a low acid coffee, I cannot recommend this  and.
