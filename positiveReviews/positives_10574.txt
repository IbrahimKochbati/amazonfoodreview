these pork rinds are a great value plus they are fun to watch them puff up from a small piece to a giant puffy tasty pork rind! I also like the fact you can make as much as you like.I like to make small batches so I can eat them when they are still warm.So easy to make, pop them in the microwave a minute or two and time for a tasty treat ENJOY!
