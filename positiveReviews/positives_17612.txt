I deal with GERD frequently, which limits my ability to have coffee.  When I saw this product being offered through the Amazon Vines Program, I was intrigued and thought I would give it a try.  The French Roast is not my first choice of coffee flavor and, at the same time, the taste isn't bad at all!          I'm hoping that the Low Acid Coffees will be offered in different flavors so I could test them as well.  What I would like, even more, if there was an option to make individual cups similar to the Keurig system as I don't need to make a full pot just for myself.  (I don't own a Keurig system so I would have to improvise in making single servings.)
