My mother introduced me to this candy that she had as a child . If you are familiar with Knotts Berry Farm in Buena Park , Ca they use to sell this candy but stopped making it much to my dismay . Well i got a bag of Horehounds for Christmas and found that Amazon carries them . This must be my lucky day ! !
