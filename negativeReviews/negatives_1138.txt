Buffalo Bills Premium Snacks          I realize that taste is an individual thing, but I thought I'd share my thoughts on these products.          First, customer service is excellent.  I've always gotten exactly what I ordered in a very timely manner.          So far I've ordered the following products:          1) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Mild Short Shots          2) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Hot Short Shots          The first two short shots are very similar to Slim Jim's, just not individually wrapped, I just put them in a zip lock bag and find them very convenient to munch on( about a quarter pound per bag.          3) Buffalo Bills 1.2lb Extra Smokeys     These are very smokey, but a little too dry for my taste.          4) Buffalo Bills 16oz Premium Hickory Beef Jerky Pieces (random size     Taste great if you are a jerky lover.          5) Buffalo Bills 2.1lb Pepperoni  Short Shots     Probably the closest to Slim Jim's of all the short shots          6) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Honey Strung     O.K. taste.  My wife hates the smell.  My Brother doesn't care much for them either.          All  in  all, I highly recommend these products (in the order listed) and this company.          Gunner  January, 2010
