One of our ferrets has lymphoma.  We give him a mix of the chicken, the ham, a little of the apple, peach, & banana, a touch of Ferret Vite, his prednisolone, and a bit of warm water out of the Zojirushi.  Stir it up and watch him gobble it up!  He does not like the beef, nor will he eat other  ands like Beech nut.  And when ferrets don't like it, ferrets don't eat it.  Anyway, 9 months on this diet and he is still hanging in there.
