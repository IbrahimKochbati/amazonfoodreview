I was skeptical, little Ms. Pepper can be finicky.  We were at a pet store recently and the pet store told us that every dog loves their treats, and our dog turned up her nose and walked away.  She had no interest.  She loves treats, she just doesn't want dog treats.          So we tried Newman's own treats   and I like Newman's own values and mission   and she mowed down like nobodies business.          Today, I opened the bag, and I kid you not our schnauzer started shaking, wagging her whole butt.  (and she's not an excitable animal)  She stood on her hind legs and pranced about.  I was completely amused.  I told her to sit.  (she's also very stubborn)  She sat, her little paws shaking, she wanted that treat so bad.  I said take it like a lady.  And ever so gently she took the biscuit.  And then she ate like a hog.          The biscuits are bigger than the treats we normally give her.  They smell fresh.  There doesn't appear to be any artificial color in it, at least it doesn't stain her beard.  I really feel good about giving Pepper these treats, and she seems pleased as punch to get them.  I've honestly never seen her that excited about a treat.  We'll have to get them once and awhile, she actually listens when these are waiting in the wings.          *UPDATE* We just bought more of these for Ms. Pepper and I'm not kidding you, when she saw the bag she did a little dance about sat at my feet and just waited.  Once she got her treat she took off running with it just in case I'd changed m mind, and she devoured it like a little pig!
