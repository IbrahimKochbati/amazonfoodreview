Our health care provider recommended eating 1 ounce of raw almonds daily to help keep bad cholesterol levels lower. We have tried many different  ands and these are our favorites for several reasons. We like the fact that they are organically grown and that they taste fresher and sweeter than many other  ands we have tried. We also like that the price is really good.
