This honestly good.  It does not taste like syrup or cough medicine like one of the reviewers raves.  It taste like carbonated water with a hint of Raspberry flavoring.  Everything is natural and if you add some of your favorite juice like lets say...Orange, you can easily make a nice Italian soda...Yummy!  Don't be fooled, it's great.
