I roast my own Colombian beans at home so I have a perfect "10" for reference. Right off the bat let me say that just like their Sumatran reserve, this k cup is not bitter, but smooth. The aftertaste is also smooth. My chief complaint is it does not taste like a Colombian bean. It really is missing the deep flavor of a columbian coffee, while the Sumatran Puck K cup definitely has a Sumatran taste. The "8 oclock"  and you see in many grocery stores has a more distinct flavor than this k cup. That being said, my final recommendation is that I would recoommend the Puck Sumatran over this if you like a distinct coffee flavor. However, if you are looking for a not too stong but not bitter coffee, this Colombian is a great choice. I would buy this again just because of the smooth taste.
