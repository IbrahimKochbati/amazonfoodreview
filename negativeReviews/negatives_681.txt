Well, when I bought this item....I thought it would be a direct Japan import.  It is Taiwanese.     It was bought at Costco and resold....(the price label was still the product.)          The product can be bought at Costco for half the price...if not less.          The expiration date was not printed on the product....which makes me think it was expired.     I believe this as most of the mochi is dry and tough..          Will shy away from this product.
