I have three cats that are picky eaters.  They like a very small number of cat foods, but this is one type they do enjoy.  Some wet foods are too high in fiber or protein and smell particularly bad.  This food looks like real fish and has enough juice that it keeps the kitties licking their chops for hours after.
