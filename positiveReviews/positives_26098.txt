Mild taste. Just add some honey and it's just like any other mild tea you would buy. Supposed to be great for allergies and Stomach bloat after drinking eating poorly, noticed it does calm my stomach down and aid in flattening the post drinking bloat. Worth it! Try to drink a cup before bed each night! Caffeine free!
