True, the beans were huge, moist and plump, with a good mixture of really big fat ones and smaller skinny ones.  However, the most noticeable aroma coming from the bag and the beans is best described as pungent, with a side of sour.  Is that normal?!?  I've only ever used the crappy dried out grocery store version, and was THRILLED when I saw such a good deal on these.          Can a vanilla bean expert tell me if that odd, unpleasant aroma is what I'm supposed to be smelling??
