Ordered two bags a while ago and they were a hit with anyone that came over that wanted a quick snack. The old order didn't have resealable bags which caused them to dry out (yes, I should have put them into a bag myself), but the new ones come with a zip lock built into the bag. Bonus!          I put this one on a Amazon subscription    I don't want to run out ;)
