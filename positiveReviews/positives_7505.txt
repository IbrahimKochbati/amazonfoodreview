I bought this as a gift for Xmas for my best friend, whom loves chocolate  and loves liquor as well. When she opened her gift to find this, she shined the only cheese smile and said " you know me so well". She couldn't wait to try  them. According to her the Jim Beam is the strongest and the Remy Martin least strongest if I'm not mistaken. They are great tasting and the filling is a gel consistence and the chocolate great as well. Only thing i didn't like was the dents on the packaging, noting really to complain about or call the company about cause my best friend loved it either way.These chocolate liquor bottles are a great gift for anyone who loves chocolate and liquor and don't mind them together.
