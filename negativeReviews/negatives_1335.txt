This was NOT a hit!  It's bitter, like maybe the carrots were not sweet and or not peeled?  and the main ingredient is carrots! (amazon should include the ingredients for all items) Quality control seems to be an issue. This is the second "gourmet meal" flavor with this issue. I had never had a bad experience with the EB products before, very disappointing.
