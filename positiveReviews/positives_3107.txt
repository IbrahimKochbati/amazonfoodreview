These are one of my favorite ways to eat grains  Plus they are a good source of protein.  17 chips per serving is just about right.  I wish they had a little less salt but for the calorie fat fiber content, they are pretty healthy.  Great with soup or salads or just plain.  I would definitely recommend these.
