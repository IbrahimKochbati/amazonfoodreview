The Spice Lab is a completely wonderful company!!!     I received my order promptly. The salt is very high quality and a beautiful pink color.     Due to my miscalculation, I ordered crystals that were too big for my grinder.     I sent a note and asked if I could exchange it for smaller crystals.     Customer service answered quickly and said "They were sending me a bag of smaller crystals" completely free.     How wonderful of them!!!     You don't see that very often these days. I commend Spice Lab for having such wonderful "customer service!" I am now a dedicated customer!!! Thank you Spice Lab for my quality salt!! I am going to make "Sole" and cook with it every day!!!
