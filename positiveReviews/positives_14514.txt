First good thing: the package arrived two days after I placed my amazon order.  I bought this oil mainly for cooking stir fry dishes in high heat.  The oil appears to be thicker than grapeseed oil.  The only thing I am not sure about is if this avocado oil is cold pressed.  I sent an email to the manufacturer but did not receive a straight answer.  Their reply is that all their oils are pressed by expeller presser at room temperature without using any chemicals.  I think I will try the other  ands of avocado oil that are advertised "organic and cold pressed" after I am done with this order.
