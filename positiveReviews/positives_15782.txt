April 12, 2012          I am very happy that I decided to purchase these.  The shipping was super fast.  It said estimated shipping was going to be about 1.5 weeks but it took only four days!  The packaging was great and the products are pretty large; I live alone and I know they'll last me for quite some time.          I have been on a low card no sugar diet for about a month now with great results.  I'm allowed water, coffee (with minimal amounts of extras) and unsweetened tea (it's tolerable but it's much better with sugar).  However, the only thing I've really been missing is my McDonald's Vanilla Iced Coffee (Bummer).  I have been trying to find a way to recreate my own this past month but those non dairy creamers have about 10 grams of carbs per 4 tsp   not happening!  I am not a huge fan these days of artificial sweetners but I was looking for something with low sugars zero sugars and low carbohydrates.  I'm not using it in excess, only about one cup of coffee per day so I decided to give them a try.          I only opened one so far as I just got them in the mail today.  I'm trying to be patient and only open one at a time so they keep well.  I am hoping to use the raspberry for my iced tea and the others for coffee.  At the moment I'm only making hot coffee but I should be getting a Ninja food processor blender in a couple of days and I'm hoping to blend up some amazing creations.          It states to use about 1 oz per serving but I opened the Classic Caramel (I have read that many hate this one) but it's tolerable, it's probably not going to be my favorite but I like it enough to drink it, I only used 4 tsp of syrup in a travel mug.  It's not overly sweet as the originals may be but it's not bad and it's a great substitution!          I'll update my feedback once I've opened a few more which should be a while. I'm also hoping I like all of them enough to make a repurchase in several months when these are gone.  I went to the Torani website and found tons of recipes so I'm hoping I can make something delicious!  I'm glad I didn't place myself on the auto ship because I don't think that I'll go through them fast enough but I will definitely be considering a repurchase!          Does anyone know the nutritional info on the full sugar ones?  I'd be interested to know!
