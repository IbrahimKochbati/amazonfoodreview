Without a doubt, this is hands down the best coconut water product I've tried.  The others I've experienced have a flat or slightly bitter taste but this one has that subtle essence and sweetness of coconut water drank directly from a freshly opened raw coconut.  Let me tell you, this is the most refreshing, hydrating, and re energizing elixir you can partake of.  I'll take this over Gatorade any day of the week.  Great way to start off any day.
