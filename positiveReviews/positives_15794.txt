I would have preferred them to have been made with stevia as opposed to splenda for ease of mind out of health concern reasons surrounding the safeness of splenda, but it is what it is. I also wish they'd come in glass as opposed to plastic bottles in these sizes maybe even flip tops because then they could have been recycled and used for wine or beer bottling purposes which would be great. As for the flavor I've tried 3 out of the 6 so far raspberry, chocolate, and caramel. The caramel has a nice aroma to me and tastes all right, but my least favorite so far. The chocolate seems to mix really nice with the raspberry and also seems to really stand out better to me in iced coffee. The raspberry was my favorite out of the 3 I've had the opportunity to try thus far. I think they are nice additions to flavor coffee's with, but you need to figure out the right consistencies on the amounts to use with them too much tastes a bit artificial and too little and it can be too subtle and difficult to discern the flavoring in them. I'd give them 4 out 5 overall they seem decent really, but has areas for improvement though I wouldn't exactly hesitate to recommend them or give them away as a gift to the right person.
