I had been watching this specific coffee for a few months and it was never in stock. When it FINALLY became available I jumped on it. I was not let down. The flavor isn't so much that you lose the coffee taste which is always a big selling point for me. It's a mild coffee, but a very good mid afternoon cup of coffee.          I do recommend this product!          I hope you enjoy it
