The other, 5 star, review, must be from a shill who is the underlying peddler of this awful product, or else he's an idiot who doesn't know his a** from a hole in the ground.          The truth of the matter is that this stuff is repulsive.  It has little genuine spicy pepper flavor or aroma, instead when ground it smells like nauseating dish soap. Plus it comes with about a quarter inch of the stalk still attached to each berry, which when ground into your food is obviously not helping matters any.  THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO RECOMMEND ITS USE IN COOKING, which is why the real gourmet spice outlets like Penzey's or Dean and DeLuca don't even bother stocking this garbage.          Plus, Amazon will not refund your money if you find it as disgusting as you likely will, so, again, you'll be well advised to steer clear.  Stick with a quality source for Tellicherry or Szechuan.  You're absolutely, positively not missing anything other than throwing away almost $20, like the 5 star moron's review from 3 years ago has caused people to do.
