I have this set and use all of them regularly.  I love the blackened steak one!  It's incredible, but all of them are.  The poultry one makes any chicken dish, cornish hen, turkey, or duck delicious.          I lived in New Orleans where I met Chef Paul and dined on alligator at his Lousinna Kitchen restaurant.  It was sublime, served with a mild mustard sauce.  Only the tail is eaten, and tastes like roast beef a bit.  He had his own alligator farm to supply his restaurant.  He was a local cele ity way before the rest of the world heard of him.          I highly recommend this set of spices.  You won't be disappointed.  It's excellent.
