This is absolutely delicious.  Because it is in powder form, you can make it as strong or weak as your taste buds allow.  I add instant Folger's to mine, making it into a mocha.  That also cuts the sweetness.  It really DOES taste like chocolate covered cherries    a treat I have loved since childhood!          I get mine through the "subscription program" along with several other flavors from Stephen's.  The subscription program works well for me since I travel. You can change the frequency AND the address to which it is to be sent as needed.
