I have started to drink this drink and giner latte one too during the September seasons, and believe me i hardly had a cold or flu during the winter times. One time a Chinese friend told me if you drink this drink in fall you won't have to worry about the rest of cold months. She advised me to drink it for 2 3 wks straight, every day, than stop and drink only occassionally. I have followed her advice and yes, it worked for me. I use to buy these only in Asian Stores, but since Amazon have them now available I am stocking up and giving it to all my relatives for winter. I love this tea and the latte even more (lol)...thanks Gold Kili, you have made me fight my cold, flu and sore throats!!!! GREAT PRODUCT YOU HAVE TO USE! Tastes strong, but does the job and you would love to drink it every day. I promise you that! As for being a mom, with kids and children around this prevents me from getting too many sicnesses during winter and stay on my feet... i just wish my kids would drink this as much as i could so we could be Free of sniffles all season long!
