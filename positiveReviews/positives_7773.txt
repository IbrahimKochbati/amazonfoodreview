I'm on a low carb diet, and it's very difficult to resist temptation when my family has freshly popped popcorn.  Now I have found the solution.  Lowry's Microwavable Pork Rinds pop in the microwave exactly like popcorn, and only 1 carb per serving!  Plus, I love the way the curls keep making the popping sound in my mouth as I eat them... like Pop Rocks candy!  I got the regular which is salted just enough for my taste.  I also eat them with salsa as a snack (which replaces chips). Crumbled on a salad is a great replacement for croutons. Thank you Lowry's for coming up with a product that is such a life saver to my diet!
