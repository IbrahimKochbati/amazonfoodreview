I used this product cod roe (tarako spaghetti sauce )to eat when i feel lazy at japan.     that very cheap and just boil pasta and mix this pouch because     i ate that product once a week in japan.           after i moved here america year ago i really miss some asian food because little expensive but     when i see picture i remind how good and excited because i bought this from amazon .          BUT taste little different , I was disappointed, too strong smell like a ocean .     I throw garbage because i did not remember product of japan america.           i never ever buy this in america.
