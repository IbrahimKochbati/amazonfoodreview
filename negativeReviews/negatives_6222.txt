For the price this product has NO truffle characteristics at all.  I could have been eating black pencil shavings with more flavor. Also the can was only a third full. I realize this purchase is by weight but the use.a smaller can to preserve any integrity of product.  Overall a disgustingly overpriced disappointing purchase especially with expectations for holiday meals when purchased.  Do not order. For all I know I received lack dyed leaf scraps.
