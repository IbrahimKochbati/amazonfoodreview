Been yer basic pretzel rod freak since I was a kid,and these are the best I've come across in years.  Not too salty, just enough, and not the long rods that  eak and leave crumbs everywhere (like if you're lounging on the couch watching tv, say)   these are shorter rods, the perfect size for a proper crumbless   or near crumbless   pretzel indulging experience.  They're fairly healthy, too, as far as snacks go.
