My teens and their friends drink regular soda pop by the gallon!  They're obviously addicted to the stuff   a very unhealthy habit.          I can't drink soda pop myself, it's been 5 years or so since I had one, and so I began searching for a drink that tasted like regular soda pop, but wasn't unhealthy.  I searched high and low for a suitable alternative   and then I found  Izze.          I love the fruity, tangy flavor of Izze's sparkling grafefruit soda.  The grapefruit flavor goes well with spicy mexican foods, but it is also great just by itself.          My teens love Izze and drink it now just like soda pop!  I'm so happy to know they aren't guzzling down corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors, but instead are enjoying all natural Izze, with no added sweeetners!          If you're looking for a great alternative to regular soda pop   you can't do better than to buy Izze.
