Flavor is light, mostly strawberry, as is the can. Switch is all natural fruit juice, and the ingredients are a shortlist of    well, carbonated fruit juice. Big thumbs up, when you compare the list on every other soft drink can. The portion size is 8.3 oz., which probably less than you're used to in a canned drink. The Switch seems to me to be a wonderful flavor, satisfying. It was a pleasant experience without guilt. Try it and see for yourself.
