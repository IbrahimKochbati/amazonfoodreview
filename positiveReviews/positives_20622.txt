We've been eating this for years. In fact since before they changed the name. It was originally named with a three letter word (similar to darn) that Amazon won't let me write. We've tried quite a number of variations of this and it always turns out good. Sausage works well. Add cream cheese, sour cream, cheddar cheese, or bacon when serving. We only buy from Amazon as they have the best pricing so sometimes we have to wait for stock but it's worth the wait. When we don't want to make it from scratch or just want smaller batches this is the way to go. YUM!
