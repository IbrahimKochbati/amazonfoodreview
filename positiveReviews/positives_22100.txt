My first shipment of Kind Almond & Coconut bars contained VERY solid bars that, although delicious, were just about unbite able.  I cut them up with a knife to save my teeth.  The second shipment is not quite so crunchy, and my husband suggested warming them in the microwave if they're too crisp.  They haven't needed that special treatment, but they're still not as soft as the Almond & Apricot and Macadamia Nut & Apricot flavors.  Since all the flavors comprise one sweet that I can eat without triggering allergies, they will all remain on my automatic order list.
