I purchased 144 (2 lots of 72) for my husband who was previously buying another  and at 2 for $1.  They were delivered in time for Christmas which was great because his crew had purchased an Amazon gift card as his Christmas present.  I've had no trouble with open packages and the seeds are delicious.  Meaty and not too salty, we enjoy them as part of a healthy diet (yes, I sneak them out of his stash.)  We eat less flour and sugar and more vegetables, protein, beans and nuts.  We spend a lot less money and feel a lot better.  What's not to like?
