I had heart palpitations after eating gravy made with this.  I searched for all of the ingredients online and found that disodium inosinate seems to cause this for a LOT of people.  It also contains MSG, which I don't have a problem with, but I know some people do.  Why can't companies make food that doesn't have crap in it?!?!?  $20 down the drain, I probably should have looked at the ingredients first.
