We bought a 2.5oz popcorn maker for our kids and realized all popcorn is not created equal.  Assuming the ingredients in all pre packaged popcorn is safe, the most important thing is flavor...and Great Northern Popcorn has it.  It is sooooo good!  I was competing against the popcorn from Ace Hardware.  Before now my kids begged to go to Ace Hardware which they call "the popcorn store."  Now my kids love Great Northern popcorn from home and I'm saving tons of money not buying tools every weekend.          Another thing we like about Great Northern Popcorn is they provide 2.5oz packages (most popcorn packs start at 4oz).          When friends come over with their kids the popcorn maker runs non stop.  The kids can't get enough.
