I have used this product in the past. I caught a MRSA infection from the hospital and after spending hundreds of dollars on prescription drugs to clear up the infection in my wound, I found that nothing worked. I did my research and felt that this was worth a shot. It quickly cleared up the infection and quickly healed my wound.     Fast forward 3 years and I have surgery to repair a  oken leg. Unfortunately my incision opens and instead of spending hundreds of dollars on prescription treatment, I went ahead and ordered this product. After using it for a few days my incision has completely closed. If there was a ever a miracle product, this would be it.
