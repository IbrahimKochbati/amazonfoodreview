My hubby considers himself a hot sauce expert...he was always searching for the "perfect" hot sauce, until a friend gifted a bottle of Tenessee Red Lightning! Now, while he continues to sample new sauces, he has declared Tennessee Red Lightning his favorite staple. We have to have it shipped in, but it's worth it. We highly reccomend Tennessee Red Lightning; it's just hot enough for those who like it hot!
