I like this 'Kiwi Berry' more than the 'Watermelon Strawberry' I reviewed previously: it's less sweet, but still a little too sweet for me.  It advertises 'no sugar added' and '100% juice carbonated', so I was expecting somewhat sweet tasting, but not like this ~ it was too sweet, and packed 135 calories, 36g sugar and 34g carbs in a 'no sugar added' 'no corn syrup'  'no preservatives' 'no artificial colors' 'gluten free' drink!  I would expect that from a juice like apple or cranberry, but I would also expect it to TASTE natural, and this one (for all it's claims to the contrary) STILL did NOT taste very natural to me.          It was certainly pleasant tasting, but for the tastebuds of someone who WAS a lifelong soda drinker (diet soda for the past 12 years), and gave up soda completely last May (I don't miss it at all!), this is not the drink for me.  I mostly drink water, milk, iced tea, hot tea & coffee now, and this sweet tasting, sugary tasting beverage, had way too much carbonation & flavoring for me!  The kiwi berry flavors were nice (much nicer than the watermelon strawberry), but still TASTED fake, which is weird for a drink that touts things like '100% juice' and a label that says 'natural flavors'...I would recommend this product only to those who like sweet, fruitie carbonated beverages, and aren't too worried about calories, etc.
