I had a cup of this coffee in the morning, and really did enjoy it.  It definitely has a robust flavor like they claim.  It reminded me of Starbucks coffee with it's dark roast flavor.  But it isn't quite as strong, which I like.  I'm one of the few who think Starbucks coffee has too much "roast".  I haven't tried any other low acid coffees, so I can't compare.  But this  is a flavorful coffee.  One I will try again.
