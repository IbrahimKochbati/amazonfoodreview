These are so gross I can't believe I wasted my money on them. They gave me an immediate migraine from the overwhelming artificial smelling fragrance. I am NOT that picky an eater and I generally love any GF cookie just b c I am so grateful they exist. But OMG I immediately spit this out AND rinsed out my mouth! Even my snack loving toddler didn't like these. Eating them, that is. She did have a great time massaging it into a fine powder which takes almost no effort at all. What a mess. And what a waste of money.
