Our beautiful Belle loves her daily tooth ush treat. Amazon provides an awesome price and delivers them to our doorstep. That makes it even handier. The Greenies are a proven winner for a more natural  eath freshening dog treat. Too bad Greenies doesn't get more 'green' with their packaging and lose the outer box that they use. The sealed inside bag would be plenty good enough. It keeps the treats fresh and takes up less space. The first thing we do is toss the box out    what a waste!
