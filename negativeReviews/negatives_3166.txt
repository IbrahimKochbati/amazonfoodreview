I have been giving my senior dog these pill pockets for about two years now.  Up until recently they've been great.  However, they seem to have changed the formula and now she hates them.  I have to shove them down her throat and often get bit in the process.  Because I have to give her so many pills a day, I buy them in bulk and now have a closet full of these losers in every flavor. So disappointing.
