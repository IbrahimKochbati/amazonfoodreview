I discovered this in our local QFC grocery store, which is the only place I've ever seen it, and Amazon's price is much better as I paid $8 for one package.          Growing up, my mom used to make us bowls of pastina as comfort food.  I call this whole wheat orzo my "adult pastina". :) Cooks up really quickly and is versatile in recipes and tastes wonderful.  I highly recommend it!
