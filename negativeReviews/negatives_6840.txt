After making several batches using different techniques I can only get 50% of the kernels to pop.  I used a different  and of kernels with much better results.  The only conclusion I can come to is that these packages are stale.  It doesn't help that there is no expiration or manufacture date listed anywhere on the packages.  I would recommend to not buy this product.
