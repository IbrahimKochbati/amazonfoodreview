the auto ship is a terrific way to get hard to find dog food like Newman's   I can;t find it in my area at all, and it is all my elderly dog can eat with her IBS and preservative sensitivities.       Easy and cost effective.  I only wrestle with the CO2 footprint on having it to be shipped :((  And am working on finding an offset for that. !! :)
