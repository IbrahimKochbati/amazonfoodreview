The sushi kit from Popin' Cookin' is something I have had my eyes on for months  my friend and I have been watching the videos on Youtube on making these for a long time!  It was as fun to make as I expected, and you really do get to make "popping boba like eggs" to put on top of one of your sushi rolls, which is really cool and fun!  But, for what it's worth, I would view these as completely inedible, the grape flavor is very strong and the texture is...out of this world, like eating alien goo.  But!  That doesn't diminish the fun and novelty because, like eating anything from an Easy Bake Oven or a Doctor Dreadful kit, you don't expect much but it's fun to make, which is the whole point.          And one note about the seller  they got it here about 2 weeks earlier than I expected with a handwritten thank you note!  Very classy :)
