I got hit by the same problem many others have...dented cans.  Of the 12 cans in the case, eight were dented.  When you divide the purchase price by the four useable cans that comes to $5.55 can!  RIPPPPP  OFFFFFF!!  As many others pointed out, the box was fine, it was just the cans inside.  I planned to return the offending cans, but in the meantime, I opened one to give some to my dog.  I thought I was buying pumpkin puree but instead I bought orange water.  Now that pumpkin is in stock at my local grocery stores again, I shall return to Libby or Publix  and.  You get 100% pumpkin (be sure you choose pumpkin puree, NOT pumpkin pie filling).  No water and no dents and most important only $1.49 can instead of $5.55 can.  I couldn't give this product zero stars which is what I wanted to do.
