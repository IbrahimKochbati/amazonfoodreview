My family loves popcorn; the portioned packages work well.  the only suggestion that I would have is to cut the popcorn and seasoning part out first, place them in a measuring cup.  this will make it easier to pour in the pan for popping.  I spilled a significant amount of the seasoning and popcorn at first; and the fact that it's stored in plastic makes it not such a wise decision to place the plastic next to the hot pan.  of course put the butter in first, then add the popcorn and seasoning; less mess.          just about every kernel pops.  very tasty!!!
