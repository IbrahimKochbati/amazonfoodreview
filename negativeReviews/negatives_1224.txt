THis product (which i am not allowed to return) has ingrediants of salt, spices, hydrolysed soy protein, that last item is the common industry con for adding msg to your food. Every soup on your grocers shelf contains msg, but, i digress. So, the third ingrediant is a form of MSG, further down the ingrediant list is proudly displayed ... Monosodium Gludamate, ...MSG. This does not add spice to your food, it stimulats your tongue into feeling that the food tastes good, when IT DOES NOT. MSG can make dogfood taste like hamburger. anyone who thinks this is making their food taste cajun may be serving ALPO.  Tones and Durkee (sp) do not contain MSG, I prefer Tones!          I have 8 eight ounce cans of this stuff.. would anybody like to buy some hamburger from me?
