Like another reviewer here, I use this granulated honey for my tea and I use it for my coffee.  It is oh so much better than white sugar.  I had been in the habit of using the unprocessed sugar, which was good, but this is so much better.          This product does indeed give backed goods a bit of a different, in a positive way, flavor and I use it with cookies.  I buy my granulate honey at a local health food shop and the price here, even if you consider the shipping, is quite competitive.  The other advantage is that this stuff is becoming more and more popular in my area and our local shops are forever running out of it.  It is nice to know I have a reliable source.          Highly recommend this product.
