This is the most delightful olive oil I've ever tasted! Don't even think about using it in your cooking... it would be wasted. This is an olive oil you can, and should, use for dipping. It's sweet and fruity, with just the right hint of acid. There is a tiny, very delicate, wisp of spice, and there's no bitterness whatsoever. I highly recommend this olive oil! Spanish olive oils are my favorite  particularly from arbequina olives  and this one does not disappoint..
