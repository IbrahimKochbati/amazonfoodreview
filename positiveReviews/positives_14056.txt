Being that I am on a diet, ( As of Aug 19,2010 I have lost 94 pounds) I am always looking for good protein and low calories, fat, salt and sugar.  I learned about PB2 on a web page where I can log my calories, and exercise. I ordered my first pack direct from the factory, but then found it here on Amazon and get it faster than from the factory. PB2 is only 45 calories for the same 200 calories found in most peanut butter, and it is the same 2 tbsp serving. This is great just as a snack if you love peanut butter like I do. It comes in a powder, and you simply mix 2 Table spoons of powder with one Table spoon of water, stir until thick and enjoy how ever you want. Worth the money!
