The best compliment I can give the Pamela Whenever Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Coconut Bars is that they taste the least like granola bars as any bar I've yet tasted (and that is quite a few).  They have a texture and taste more along the lines of a cookie rather than a granola bar.  They are softer than a Clif Bar or Power Bar and more tasty.  Loved it.
