Perfect tool for any musicians trying to make recording much easier at an affordable price.     Easy to open plastic case, medium sized, durable (People have said that the plastic body feels cheap     and feels easy to  eak but it's not true. The Icicle's plastic body feels durable and won't  eak if     you're not clumsy with it or  eak it on purpose). I only wished that the "Gain Control" had numbers or indications     of levels so I can turn the knob to the correct position for recording and remember it instead of guessing all the time. Sound quality is FLAWLESS! No buzzing noises or anything picked up really...just nice crispy sound recorded through a good quality microphone is all I hear. I hear no difference in it with an Icicle or a Mixer
