This is my dog's favorite food. She especially loves the large dark chunks of dried meat. She eats those first. The pieces are a good size for her. My dog is a large size small dog (not quit medium sized). I prefer she have the beef or chicken and not the lamb but lamb was all they had as a subscription. I could not beat the subscription price. Cheaper than the stores and it shows up at my door as often as I need it.
