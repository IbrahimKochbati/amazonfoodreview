Despite what many say and think about bulldogs, ours are picky about their snacks.  They love the liver biscotti which can be a hand fed treat or used in a treat ball.  They last longer than most snacks and because our bullies don't often chew their food, these are the perfect size.  I don't feel bad about feeding these either because they are low calorie and without fillers.
