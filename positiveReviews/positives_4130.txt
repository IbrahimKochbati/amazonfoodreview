This gum is delicious and since my first pack I have been hooked.  I love the Mint Chocolate Chip after meals, and the Key Lime Pie is delectable at all other times.          At $15 10 pack on Amazon, it's not really a deal, though, considering this is only a $1 a pack at target or mcwallymart.  Once the price of a 10 pack drops to about $10 or $11 I might consider buying it online if only out of pure laziness, but a 50% premium is not really worth it.
