I love Starbucks VIA!!  Nice to have around when you don't want to make a pot of coffee and you don't want to spend $100+ to get a K cup machine.  There is a slight amount of grit to the coffee from the micro ground beans mixed in with the instant crystals, however the taste is worth it and not really bothersome.  I wished Starbucks would make more Decaf varieties and more local grocery stores carried it.
