OMG I almost lost a finger as Sparky grabbed this treat out out my hand with unbounded enthusiasm! Granted, he's a black lab mix who will eat anything, but he really loved these treats. As did Miko, who is generally more polite. And both Miko and Sparky refused to leave after getting these treats   when I said "that's it", and showed them my empty hands, they usually will both leave the kitchen. But no, they both just sat there, wagging their tails, demanding more! After reading the ingredient list, I was tempted to try one myself!
