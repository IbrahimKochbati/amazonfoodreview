I love this avocado oil  rich, easy to pour, great tasting.  I buy avocado oil because of the omega 3 health benefits and because I read that it's one of the best oils to stand up to high heat, so I use it for cooking fish and burgers, etc  and still use olive oil for vegetables at low to medium heat.
