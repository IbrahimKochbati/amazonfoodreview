I keep trying to find a hot chocolate I like better, but I haven't found one yet.  Traditionally, I am dark chocolate fan but this is an excellent, rich chocolate drink.  It is also my mother's favorite and she is very direct with her hints that it's time for me to send her some when her stock gets low.          I read a review that someone thought the Bellagio  and had a chemical taste.  The reviewer might have been referring to other flavors.  There is a different taste that seems perhaps spicey, but not chemical.  I also like the fact that it contains non dairy creamer because I do not drink milk.
