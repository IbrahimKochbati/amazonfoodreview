I bought this product despite the several choking hazard reviews. I vowed to stay near my dogs while they chewed, and put their chew away whenever I left the house or was very busy.          To my dismay, neither my Border Collie German Shepherd mix, nor my beagle will chew these. I had thought beagles would eat anything, until I actually caught a wiff of one of these things.          They STINK!          If you can get your dog to like them, I'm sure they're great. However, mine refuse to chew them.
