Very high quality dulce de leche from Argentina. Compared to most  ands, it's a bit lighter colored, and the taste is more subdued and milkier. You may or may not appreciate this, as it's not the classic taste that you expect from commercial dulce de leche, but it's by far the closest to the homemade dulce that my grandma used to make. For this, I'd give it 6 stars if I could!
