We feed this to our twins. They've been on it a couple of months. I notice they seem less gassy using this cereal too. We've tried both the oatmeal and the rice and the kids like both of them. Sometimes we mix half with Earth's Best cereal to make it last longer. EDIT: It's been a few months since the original post. My kids are 10 months. They now prefer this to Earth's Best cereal. They'll eat them mixed together, but they won't eat the other by itself. Admittedly, Happy Bellies smells more appetizing to me too. Not that the other smells bad.  But this smells more tasty.
