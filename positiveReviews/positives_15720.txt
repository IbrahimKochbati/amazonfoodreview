I have a Bengal cat and was looking for a good quality food that had the taurine she needs. She was very thin when I got her (a rescue) and was a bit picky. I tried a large number of foods including some quite expensive ones, and this, by far, is the best I've found. The quality appears to be excellent. It has a high amount of taurine and the vitamins she needs to be healthy. The food looks and smells like our food!!!..with chunks of chicken and pieces of carrot in the "pot pie" and shredded chicken whichs smells just like the real thing in the "Sesame Chicken". This product (and the fish variety pack) is all I buy for her now. She eats every bit at each meal and looks absolutely wonderful!!!
