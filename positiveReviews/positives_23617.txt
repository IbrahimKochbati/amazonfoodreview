these are really tasty. it doesnt taste anything like the other dried apples ive tasted. they're definately in their own category. and yes they kind of taste like the freeze dried ones except a little less sour and more crunchy, it tastes better in my opinion. i just got the box today and am already on my second bag. and best of all it tastes awesome and i dont have to feel guilty about it! i know what i'm eating!
