This is amazing syrup.  You have to watch the price though.  It fluctuates on Amazon quite a bit.  I bought this when it as offered on a buy one get one free deal.  Two bottles for $26!  Better deal than I can find locally.  Works great on waffles, pancakes and in baking.          Original review 11 2009.  Update 9 2012     I have this item on subscribe.  It is listed as unavailable.  However, it is for sale for a *new* subscription at a savings of only 5% instead of the 15% I have waiting on my list page.  Come on Amazon!  Do you think we would not notice the price change?     Watch what you pay since the subscribes are changing so much.  Plus, even if I asked for it now, the policy is not to ship until my assigned date next month anyway.     For now, I am going with another product and wait to see if they actually send me a jug of this or just cancel my current subscription to force me to change to the more expensive offer.
