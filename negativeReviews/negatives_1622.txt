I wrote a 5 star review of the Kiwi Berry flavor.  That isn't usually my favorite flavor of anything, but it was surprisingly good.          Orange Tangerine (which would generally be among my first picks of fruit flavored beverages is flat by comparison    literally.          It seemed to lack the right amount of carbonation.  It also tastes weaker and too sweet.          Try the Kiwi Berry instead.
