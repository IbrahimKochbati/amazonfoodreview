When my wife unwrapped the new saffron package from SimplyBeautiful and opened the the little plastic pouch holding the 1 ounce of delicate deep red threads of saffron the fragrance emitting from it delighted both of us. We have been using saffron for several years in a variety of dishes, such as plain rice or risotto, hot milk drinks and some soups. We absolutely love it and would use it even more if it were not so frightfully expensive. Fortunately, just a little bit of saffron does a great job flavoring and coloring a dish in an attractive yellow hue, and 1 ounce goes a long way.          SimplyBeautiful's saffron was as fresh and perfectly aromatic as could be. We shall definitely reorder it when our present supply runs out.          Sincerely,     Charles Gregory
