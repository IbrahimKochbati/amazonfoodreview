What kind of wife would I be if I didn't have some of my husband's favorite foods to serve at his birthday (this Tuesday) and Christmas?  Since he is British Thanksgiving is rather overlooked as a major holiday for him.          As we live in a rural area a trip to an Internationally stocked grocery store is like a trip to the moon, plus the surprise element would be gone as he would insist on accompanying me.  Amazon gets rid of all the fuss and bother, PLUS is was Prime so it arrived in 2 days at our doorstep. This means I can maintain the surprise element as he is not allowed to open any Amazon boxes from Oct through Christmas.          Growing up in Britain these short ead mincemeat tarts were a delightful staple at holiday time.  They really are delicious! Since I was able to order 3 boxes in a single shipment he is set for his birthday and Christmas.  He may even enjoy Thanksgiving more this year when he has his favorite holiday tart!          Happy Birthday, Christmas and even Thanksgiving!          UPDATED: 11 03 10:  Warm them a bit and have with a cup of coffee or tea.  The mincemeat is well balanced with the crust.  They are wonderful!
