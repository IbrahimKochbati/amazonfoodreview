Energy Drinks are very popular these days.  Most, if not all, are loaded with sugar, various overloads of vitamins, and varying "energy blends."  A few energy drinks have tried adding pure juice, but have only come up with 50% at most.          If your not a young'un and can't handle that blast of sugar and crash that follows, then Switch is a better alternative.  Switch is 100% juice, ZERO sugar, and lots of vitamin C.          Switch is carbonated, so with the Orange Tangerine flavor, picture your morning juice with a little soda fizzle.  The taste is sweet, but not sugary.  Although the size of the can probably relates to the recommended serving, most people probably don't have this little juice in one sitting.          Soda fizzle meets juice benefits.  It's a no  ainer.  How about some more flavors?
