This is a great find for our family. First off, mixed vegetables is one of the best flavors of baby food. Its also sometimes hard to find in the stores near me that typically have a very meager selection. This eight pack takes care of our needs for a while, and everything comes neatly shipped in a compact little box that you can tear the top of and keep them all together. Every tub arrived and it had a really long expiration date. You cant go wrong!
