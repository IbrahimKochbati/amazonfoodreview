I like all the varieties of Stagg Chili I have tried. They are always delicious, and there are varieties for every type of chili lover out there. "Turkey Ranchero" is a good alternative for those trying to cut fat from their diet. It's 98% fat free because the turkey is very lean. The flavor profile is pleasing, with nice paprika notes, but I could have used more jalapeno and generally stronger pepper flavors. The extremely lean and thick nature of this particular chili is also responsible for a drawback. The chili is advertised as "thick and hearty" and it is definitely part of a satisfying meal, however the combination of extremely thick viscosity combined with the ultra lean turkey makes for some predictable problems for cooking, namely, the tendency is for this to stick badly to the pan, especially if overheated (I recommend medium heat at the most.) It is of crucial importance to stir this chili almost continuously when cooking or your pan will have a challenging to clean black charred residue on the bottom of it. Greasing the pan is an option, but can defeat the purposes of using lean meat in the first place if not careful. Do not get impatient: cooking this product slightly slower pays big dividends in the taste and cleanup departments.          I really like Staggs' "Turkey Ranchero" and recommend it without hesitation; it has an enormous amount of beans, a very generous amount of turkey, and pleasant (though relatively mild) seasonings that most people will like (though I like to add red pepper flakes to mine.) A serving (two per can) has 19 grams of protein and 9 grams of fiber, which for the hearty flavors makes the 5 grams of fat seem a reasonable tradeoff for most diets. Like any processed foods (and especially canned soups) the sodium levels are high at 790 mg per serving, so people on a restricted sodium diet should stay away.
