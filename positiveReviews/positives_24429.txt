First and for most 4.6 lbs of cookies is A LOT of cookies. There are 12 individual packages of cookies 3 of each type in a very nice large tin. Walkers cookies are always yummy and the cookies in this tin are no exception. I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who was amazing to me during a hospital stay. The tin is very sturdy and is tasteful in its decoration. This would make a perfect gift for any occasion!
