I have two large dogs that are super chewers; they destroy just everything so I was excited to try the tug a jug out because of the claim of durable construction.          The plastic bottle itself is holding up well.          The "rope," which is a rubber plastic flexible piece that plugs the top of the jug is another story. The half of it that extends out of the jug that is meant for tugging was chewed off in about an hour. It did not crumble or flake though, which was a relief interms of safety. Thankfully, another reviewer had the same experience so I kept a close watch on this. The other  half  still remains in the jug and stills works fine as a plug to keep the treats inside the jug.          The other rubber plastic piece that surrounds the next of the jug bottle is slowly being chewed away. Many of the flexible dental spikes were also chewed off within the first hour. After a week of use, the main piece has some tears in it. My guess is that it will  eak off soon.          The dogs really like it. One of them sat for two hours trying to get her treats out, so this was a worth while purchase in terms of a toy or  activity that actually keeps my dog busy. There was no tugging though. The dogs just sat and held it in their paws occaisionally rolling it to shift the treats around to get them out.          This toy is really not that different than the Kongs that I have, which have survived two years of chewing! The dogs could care less that they can see the treats because they are too busy trying to stick their faces into the open end. This is not a noisy toy.
