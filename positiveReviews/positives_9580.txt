I bought these in the grocery store one day to ward off an upcoming tantrum and my toddler went crazy for them.  He is a big fan of the puff type snacks and cheerios, but these and the blueberry ones are his favorite and he will pick them out of the mix I make for him with all different types of puffs.  They are quite a bit harder than the Plum Organics puffs that he also likes, but he just sucks on them and they dissolve.  The container is great because it is small enough to fit in my diaper bag and it also fits well in the cup holder of my car.  Amazon's price is much better than if I buy them individually in the supermarket.
