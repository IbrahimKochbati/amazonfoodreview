One of the other reviewers explained how Grade B Maple Syrup means that it has gone through the refinement process twice instead of once as Grade A does.  It's so much thicker and mapleier than the Grade A I'm used to buying from stores here in Oregon, that I will never buy Grade A again; plus it's a great bargain, especially on the repeating plan here at Amazon.
