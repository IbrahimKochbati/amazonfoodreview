I got the coffee for 12.50 per box.  Ordered 4 boxes!!  Such a great deal, as the coffee is a great blend.          If anyone is upset because of the website having issues when they were trying to buy it, they shouldn't review the product poorly, as it is not the product that is the problem.          The problem is that you're jealous you didn't get such a great deal on the coffee.  Grow up kids, this coffee is great!!!  Will buy from Amazon.com, LLC again for more K Cups for my Keurig.          ALL OF MY COFFEE ARRIVED PACKAGED WELL AND IN NEW CONDITION, NOTHING WRONG WITH IT!!
