I don't really understand why this coffee is so popular.  I like dark, extra bold roasts such as Black Tiger, Emeril's, and GM Double Black Diamond.  However, this coffee tastes to me much more like a medium roast, has a bitter aftertaste and is not very flavorful. If you like dark roasts, I don't think this will be one of your favorites.  However, it has a lot of positive reviews all over the place.  I ordered it twice from two different sites (Keurig and Amazon) to be really sure that I did not just receive a bad batch, but I will not be ordering it again.
