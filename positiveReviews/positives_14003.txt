I use powdered peanut butter for cooking and smoothies. I'm not as crazy about it for PB&J, but it definitely works for dishes like Thai peanut sauce and peanut butter pie while saving calories. However, the cost of a small jar of this stuff is ridiculous! I buy 2.5 pounds of it for $13.90 with $4.49 shipping on ANY amount. Just do a search for Honeyville powdered peanut butter. The stuff will last 5 10 years sealed in the #10 can it comes in.
