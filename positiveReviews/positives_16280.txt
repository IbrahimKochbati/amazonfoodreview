Greenies are one of my English Bulldog's favorite treats.  They are a bit on the expensive side, but if you get them on Amazon instead of one of the large Pet stroe chains, you get a better deal.  I tried the Costco  and of dental chews (they were about half the price) and they disagreed with my dog's stomach so I came back to Greenies.  I usually  eak them in half and put it in is kong toy so it's like a puzzle for him to get it out.  If I just give it to him he eats it really quickly.  Overall, Greenies are a great product.
