For someone who is allergic to corn, soy and wheat the Original Pop Chips are a must have for the pantry. I can finally have nachos! I think they taste much better than the traditional "chips". My family finally tried them (most foods I can eat don't taste this good!) and now they are hooked too. These chips are like gold in our house!!
