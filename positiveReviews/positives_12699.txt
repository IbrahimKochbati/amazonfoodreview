I normally drink loose leaf tea.  However, the Revolution tea bags are amazing!          1. They don't fill the bag with dust and fannings. There really are recognizably sized leaves in this bag.          2. You can tell that the leaves are decent sized because the almost clear nylon bag gives you a great view into them.          3. They leave plenty of room for the leaves to expand in the bag. It's about 1 3 full, and when you steep the leaves, you can see that they expand and flatten out nicely.          Of the two types of Revolution tea I've tried, White Tangerine Tea and Sweet Ginger Peach Tea, the Sweet Ginger Peach is my favorite.  However, I tend to like fruity herbal teas more than straight black   white   green teas.  I like to hand people a bag of the Sweet Ginger Peach and have them take a good whiff. Granted, a lot of teas are simply aromatic, but this tea isn't. It really does have the fruity taste of ginger and peach. I love it.          Also, the Sweet Ginger Peach tea makes excellent iced tea.          I highly recommend this product.
