I got a few different flavors of the HAPPYBABY food and this one in particular causes my daughter to gag and vomit. My daughter does not have a weak stomach by any means and eats a lot of different foods. But for whatever reason when she eats this flavor it comes right back out. After the third try I am giving up and concluding there is something wrong with this item.          Even more disappointed that there is no option to return it with Amazon. I did however reach out to HAPPYBABY directly and are working with them to make this purchase a positive experience. For that I have changed my review from 1 stars to 3 stars.          For now I will stick with the Chick Chick and Gobble Gobble flavors!
