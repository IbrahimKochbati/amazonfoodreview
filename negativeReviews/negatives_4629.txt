The listing says, "The diameter of this Pot is about 10 " W and POT IS 6 1 4 " IN LENGTH, etc."  This is absolutely untrue!!!  I received a tree sitting in a cheap container with 3" in width and 4" in length.  It is not only small but the tree has basically a thin twig with scarce foliage.  I do not understand how could others give it a five star in the rating.
