Hello. My name is Maggie, and I'm a finicky eater. I'm one of three furry beings that share a dwelling with our friend Two Legs, and the food that is usually served is gross. Fancy Feast! Ugh. I refuse. Poached salmon I grudgingly nibble on because of the omega oil (makes my fur shiny). I do like sirloin steak when it is cooked precisely medium rare...but wait!          Two Legs is opening up something new!     It smells wonderful. Enticing.     Looks good too.     WOW. What a flavor.     Chicken Pot Pie.     I'm in heaven.     Thank you Two Legs. From now on, only buy Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (the fishie variety is yummy too).
