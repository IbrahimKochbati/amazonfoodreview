I am a big fan of Yogi tea. They make great stuff. Always very high quality ingredients, very tasty blends. This is one of the 5 star varieties. Although it lists itself as chamomile and lavender, the flavor is predominantly a nice licorice, which combined with the other ingredients, is more like anise. It is also a moderately sweet tea. I'd call this a 'rich and full bodied' herbal tea. And, although I'm not a big "traditional remedy" person, there do seem to be some real benefits to this and Relaxed Mind. However, it might be as much due to the enjoyment of a nice hot, flavorful cup of tea, as it is due to the herbs in the tea.          Either way, the tea is full of flavor, and relaxing. Enjoy!
