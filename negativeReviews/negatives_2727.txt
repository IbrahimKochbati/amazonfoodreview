I was introduced to this  and in Aruba. This coffee is sold in Aruba's supermarkets and jar label is in  ish.     When I found it at Amazon I was very excited. I was immediately disappointed after first cup.     Coffee in Aruba is rich, tasty and very smooth. My wife and I had been enjoying this  and for more than 10 years.     The coffee sold in US is complete opposite to same  and sold in Aruba. I don't know why the same  and would be so     different unless it is a grey market product with a look alike label.     .
