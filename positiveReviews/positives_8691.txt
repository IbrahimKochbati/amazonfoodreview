Not sure I'd call this a "meal" on the go.  The can of tuna salad is like the size of a can of fancy feast. And you get 6 ritz sized crackers.  Do get me wrong the tuna salad itself is excellent.  Creamy compared to the pouch style "make your own stuff". The carrots are a nice touch.  Minimal packaging, ready to eat and shelf stable.  I wish they carried them in the vending machine at work.
