Yogi Tea's offer high quality tea that taste wonderful.  They offer more complex flavors than traditional grocery store  ands, and by purchasing them online, you get excellent prices.  My favorite teas of theirs are Calming and Bedtime.  Both seem to offer wonderful side effects of the feelings of relaxation.          If you are not a big tea drinker these are still worth a try.  The flavors are complex and unique.  They are not a single note tea.  I have found these teas to never be bitter, and they are quite good without adding extras to make them taste better.          I also like the lovely packaging, and the fortunes included on each tea bag.  I have found their blends to be unique and while I generally prefer bulk tea, that these are my favorite bagged teas.  If you looking for a tea that will help take the load off, give this one a try.
