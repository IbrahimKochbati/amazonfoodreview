For about more than 20 years... 3 cups of Plantation Mint per day.  And I'm still alive... Must be good for me.  Seriously great tea.  There is NOTHING else like it... I've tried many and nothing is bold and yet smooth and good quality as Plantation Mint.  I seriously fear the day that Bigelow discontinues it.  Please.... Don't do that!
