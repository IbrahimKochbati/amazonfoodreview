I work 12 hour days and lived on coffee and Gatorade .... Until I tried VitaminWater Essential.  It has replaced forever my other cold beverages.  Soda and other soft drinks were just too sicky sweet to drink all day long. I found the Essential orange flavor just right. It has a long way to go to replace my coffee (hehehe), but I do recommend it to anyone.     PS: I've tried many of their other flavors   they don't do it for me. Essential is my favorite.
