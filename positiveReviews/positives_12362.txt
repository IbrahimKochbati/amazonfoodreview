This review is specifically geared towards the new Nong Shim bowl design...          I live in MA, and my local Shaw's only stocks the new plastic bowls of Nong Shim now, no longer the Styrofoam kind, most people are used to.          There are two very different things to consider here.          No. 1, the bowls are deeper and hold more volume (i.e. water), meaning they aren't as spicy if you fill it to the top.  If you enjoyed their age old flavor don't fill the bowl all the way to the top.          The second difference is that these bowls no longer insulate, so please be careful after adding boiling water.  WARNING: they are hot.  It's a design flaw in order to make the bowls recyclable microwavable.          The tradeoff is that they can be microwaved now.  The lids are different as well.  They don't have the same lining as before, but create a nice seal if you simply place a spoon over them for the three minutes after adding boiling water.          I have yet to microwave a batch  it seems useless if you have a stove, so just be aware of the new design next time you go to enjoy a bowl.
