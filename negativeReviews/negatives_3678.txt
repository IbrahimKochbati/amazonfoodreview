But not great.  I will agree their taste can be a bit much, think of a garlicky artificial taste that would be on chips.  To be honest, this defeats the purpose of a roasted walnut, where you would think its roasted and perhaps has salt on them.  Granted these aren't awful, but after eating a container I'm not really sure if I would consider them good.          Pros:            One of the few "roasted" walnut options I've seen       The taste is ok, but not great          Cons:            These do not taste like the walnuts found in Emerald's deluxe mixed nuts canisters, if thats what you are looking for       The taste can be a bit much, its ok, but if you are looking for a plain roasted walnut this isn't it       Not to nitpick but these are mostly walnut pieces, not many whole walnuts          Recommendation:            I don't think I would get them again       I would suggest not buying a 6 pack until you try them first because they aren't just simple roasted walnuts
