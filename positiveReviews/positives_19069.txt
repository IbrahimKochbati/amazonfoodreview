I love this product, the pound cake is amazing, tastes great fresh, more dry afterwards, but it's ok, very low in carbs, one star is missing because of the dryness, chocking sometimes, so always drink or spread something with it. there are a lot of recipes online, no  ead recipe though.. but I'm so glad there is such mix. pancakes were good too. it does not have soy in it, so lighter color and no soy taste. some say it is salty, that is not an issue for me. But why they increased the price from 11 to 30$? that is outrageous...
