This Icicle performs flawlessly with very good audio quality for my audio technica cardiod condensor mic.  Took me a short while to figure out the little silver button on the side wasn't a button, but instead a rotational knob for setting the gain.  This device literally plugs into your USB port on a Mac, you adjust that knob, and your done.  You then can forget about the device and enjoy flawless audio performance out of your mic.  This beats the hell out of the more expensive FireWire solutions I had used before.
