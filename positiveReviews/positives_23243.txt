Since my son has been diagnosed with Celiac disease, I have bought, tried and made every  ead imaginable. I found this  ead by reading reviews on celiac.com where it is highly recommended. I love this  ead!!! This is the first time my son will eat  ead since he has been diagnosed, since it tastes like real  ead. All other gluten free  eads taste nasty, and if they do not taste nasty, they have no flavor at all. Kudos to this  ead, finally a real choice for kids with Celiac disease. Thank you so much. Karen
