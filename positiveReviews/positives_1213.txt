I totally love this tea.  It  ews to a beautiful reddish color.  It is very aromatic and beautiful to look at.  It could be potpourri.  I love the sachets it comes in   very elegant.  I just bought my third canister of it this morning.  I have everyone at my office and my friends loving it, too!  Best with honey pearls also sold by White Lion Tea.  And it's organic!
