I discovered these when I moved to Canada a few years back.  Before this I had only experienced a thicker Wasa crisp ead and was a bit put off at first.  The feelings dissolved the first time I ate one of these with light laughing cow cheese.  They are a little more "powdery" than I'd like, but they compliment most cheeses very well without overwhelming them.
