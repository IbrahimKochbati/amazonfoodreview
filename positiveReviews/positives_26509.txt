I have a picky eater 4 year old, but one of the foods he loves is pasta with pesto. Since starting him on a dairy free diet last summer, I was hard pressed to find an alternative for cheese laden pesto sauce, since I can't easily make my own. Since I found this paste my problems are solved   he loves it and eats it almost every day.
