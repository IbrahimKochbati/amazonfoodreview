So, the world's best gluten free oatmeal has met its match in its delicious cold blooded cousin, Glutenfreeda's gluten free granola!  The individual serving pouches are handy for snacks on the go, and assist in those moments when one might wish to overindulge in this decadent tasting, yet extraordinarily healthful cereal.  Generously interspersed with the delicious oats are yummy toasted nuts and perfectly dried fruits.  The only regret I have about this product is when I'm down to my last packet, which is why I'll purchase it from Amazon by the case full.  You'd better hurry and order yours, too, because I might just hoard it all for myself!
