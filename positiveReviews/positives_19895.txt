ok I admit i am addicted to these.  had them first in Ireland where they sell a 'plain chocolate' version, that is, are you ready... DARK Chocolate dipped!  Yummm.  The milk chocolate ones are ok and, yes, sweeter than the darker variety.  But still, the oatmeal. ....just golden and so crunchy..  one is enough to satisfy your sweet tooth, but they taste so good, you find yourself reaching for another!  if anyone knows where to get the dark chocolate ones...post it!
