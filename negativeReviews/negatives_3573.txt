These taste really good, and they are moderately low calorie. They are also wheat , dairy , and gluten free, which is wonderful for those with allergies.  Unfortunately, I could probably eat all of them in a single sitting; they are smaller than the average bar! Of the 180 calories per bar, 80 of those calories are from saturated fats. In the list of ingredients it states "chunks may contain traces of milk protein due to manufacturing equipment."  I'm not sure what that could mean to someone who is allergic to milk, but I probably would not want to take any chances.  The normal retail price of a package of 5 Whenever Bars hovers around $3.90.  Even at the Amazon.com price, a 6 pack (total 30 bars) would cost $19.62, which  eaks down to $3.27 for 5 bars     When this package is empty, I am not likely to buy more.
