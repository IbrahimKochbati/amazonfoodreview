For years I have grown my own habaneros to dry, crush and use for cooking.  I have been unable to do so for the last two years because of a job relocation.  My supply from previous years had run out so I purchased this product to re supply.          I have been tremendously satisfied.  Great quality, great consistency, great heat, good color, good particulate size, good price.          Without any reservation would recommend this purchase to anyone looking for a good habanero powder.          Be warned though... It is not for the faint of heart.
