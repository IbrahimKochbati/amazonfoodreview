I am potato chip addicted. I don't only enjoy potato chips, but I also enjoy any type of potato product. This product really hit the mark for me.          I consider these a full fledged snack. Each bag is packed with chips. They are moderately seasoned, and full of flavor. The consistency is slightly like a popcorn cake    but they're crisp and crunchy, not puffy. They have a distinct potato taste.          The best part? Each bag clocks in at only 100 calories! And I repeat    these are not a simple "100 calorie" snack. What you get here is a full bag of chips. What's great about the content vs. calorie content is that these are perfect to accompany your lunch without feeling guilty about eating a 200 300 calorie bag of chips.          My personal favorites were the Sea Salt and Vinegar and the Original. The barbecue flavor is sweet, not smoky. The Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, and Sour Cream and Onion flavors are standard fair. But the chips are adequately and evenly seasoned and I did not notice differences in seasoning from one chip to the next.          These are a great product, well manufactured, and a treat to eat. I'll definitely buy more of these in the future.
