This is the only oatmeal that my family will even consider eating.  I make it in the crock pot overnight and it is always ready when we are.  I use my small crock pot for the two of us.  I start with a 1 2 cup of oatmeal; add a dash of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla; add a 1 2 cup of milk and 2 cups cold water.  Place the lid on the crock pot and plug it in.  It will be ready in the morning when you are.  I let mine cook approx 10 hours.  My small crock pot has no settings  just off or on.  We love to add some  own sugar and dried blueberries or Craisins at the table.
