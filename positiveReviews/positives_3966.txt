ERIN BAKER'S ORGANIC BREAKFAST COOKIES ARE DELICIOUS AND MOIST. I AM TRULEY ENJOYING THEM.  EACH COOKIE IS INDIVIDUALLY PACKAGED. THERE GREAT FOR THROWING IN YOUR LUNCH, WORK, SCHOOL OR DRIVING ON A TRIP. ALTHOUGH, SHE MAKES DIFFERENT KINDS I FIND THE FRUIT & NUT IS A FAVORITE. SO IF YOU LIKE A OATMEAL COOKIE THAT'S WHOLESOME, DELIICOUS, & MOIST THEN THIS IS THE ONE. IT'S A WINNER!!!
