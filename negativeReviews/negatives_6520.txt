i feed my little maltese the duck, lamb, beef and chicken products.  the concern i have is that in the chicken and beef products, i have found hard pieces of bone.  i know because i  eak the patties into smaller pieces prior to feeding my dog.  i will still buy these products but, wish the company take note and be more careful in leaving out the bones.
