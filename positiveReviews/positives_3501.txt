I'm not a huge fan of coffees from the Americas; I generally find them a bit light for my taste (I'm a big fan of Sumatra and other Pacific grown coffees)  But Riviera Sunset is a nice, light coffee, smooth and not terribly acid.  It's a pleasant coffee for people who like their  ews with more  ightness and less body.          I'm also frankly not nuts about decaf, but that aspect doesn't intrude too much on the flavor here.
