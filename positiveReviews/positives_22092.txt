I first sampled this bar on a long drive from Albuquerque to El Paso.  It was the only thing I'd eaten since  eakfast and it kept me going.  I then ordered a carton from Amazon and was impressed by the crunchiness and the good flavor from the assorted nuts packed in there.  If you've never tried this product, imagine a handful of mixed nuts held together with just enough candy syrup to fill in the gaps.          One of my friends thought it was a little too hard in texture.          Please note the very low carbohydrate content    good for diabetics.
