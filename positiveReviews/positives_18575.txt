I have been using this protein powder for about a month. The first thing I noticed is that this  and mixes better than Optimum Nutrition egg protein, but still not like whey or even rice protein. The texture is not great by itself in my opinion  not awful but not great. I have been mixing Garden of Eating Super Seed with the powder before adding water and it mixes to a much better texture. I've also tried blending the two with ice to make a smoothy which turned out ok. For those of us who can't tolerate the whey or soy proteins, this particular  and is the best I've found.
