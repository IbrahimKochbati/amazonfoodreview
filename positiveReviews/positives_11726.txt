I really was expecting some nearly straw like hard thing. I was expecting NOT to like it.          Much to my surprise, it was actually very good with quite a few nice flavors coconut, chocolate, oats, etc. that all came together well.  (And I'm like Mikey on the old Life cereal commercials I don't like these things usually.)  But, I was looking for something tolerable to eat on the run or at the desk. It certainly is tastier than that.          The nutritional analysis is pretty good.  At 180 calories and  9 grams of fat, it probably is most appropriate as a snack substitute, commuter or travel tidbit, or as a meal component with your tea, coffee, milk & fruit. If you're hungry & want something good, healthy, and quickly, this is a good choice.          No trans fat, but be aware it is not low fat.  No Vitamin C, minimal calcium but a good source of fiber and whole grain.  Good source of Omega 3 Fatty acids, low source of protein (2 g).          So enjoy it as a healthy, tasty source of fiber and Omega 3 Fatty Acids, but you should look elsewhere in your diet for protein, Vitamin C, Calcium not significantly fortified there.          But, hey, it's much better than a standard cookie and tastes just as good or better!
