I have a larger  eed of dog, about 90 lbs and she loves these. At first they seem kind of hard, but she has no problem eating them. They don't take her very long to finish, but they are a nice little snack or treat for her while still being healthy. My moms smaller dog, about 12 lbs also likes these, although the smaller ones are best for her.
