Purchasing the Glace De Volaille Gourmet Gold Roasted Turkey Stock from Amazom. I used the reccomended old world gravy recipe of sauteing onions, carrots in duck fat with a cup of wine. It did not inspire me.  The traditional basted American Turkey with pan drippings for gravy cannot be substituted.  The aroma of a fresh turkey in the oven stirs the senses, exciting the cook to prepare for a perfect gravy.  This cannot be duplicated in a gravy package that is designed for a gourmet market that prefers its gravy, deaden in wine,  own onions and thyme. Maybe the old world tastes are more astute, but my American gravy will remain simply traditional.  The Glace De Volaille Gold Roasted Old World Gravy recipe, well it went into the trash.
