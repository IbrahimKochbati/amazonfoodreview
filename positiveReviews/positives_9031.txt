So, I bought the Coffee Pod Drawer thinking it was the answer to my cluttered coffee area on my kitchen counter.  Not exactly.  First and foremost, let me say   this is a great product.  It does hold the pods neatly.  It has a nice, durable, slip resistant top that lets you feel comfortable that your Keurig won't slip or tip over. This is why I gave the product 4 stars.     My issue is this:  I purchased this simply because I thought it would use up less space on my counter if my K Cups were stored inside this drawer and underneath my Keurig, as opposed to my (somewhat) bulky K Cup Carousel.  (Which by the way, is chrome, and I really despise chrome.)  Anyways, what I did not consider was the fact that it raises your Keurig up by about 3.25 inches.  Before I bought this drawer, my Keurig had just enough space on the counter under the cupboard that it sits under, for me to lift the top of the Keurig open to put new K Cups in, and to fill the water, etc.  That additional 3.25 inches really makes a difference.  I can no longer open the top of the Keurig all the way without banging the cupboard.  We all know that you don't NEED to open it all of the way, but when that's what you were used to doing, well, you can understand...  I pretty much bang the cupboard every day now.  Another drawback to the idea of purchasing this soley to save space, is that you can't keep anything in front of the drawer, since obviously, you need to open the drawer to get the K Cups out. I used to keep the coffee condiments in front of my Keurig, and now I can't.          Here's the bottom line: This is a great product in the sense that it gets the carousel (if you have one) off your counters.  But, I would only buy this if 1.) You have ample clearance above your Keurig now to be able to still lift the top open once you set this up, and 2.) You don't need to use the space in front of the drawer.          Happy Coffee Drinking!          Update:  02 20 12:     Almost a year later   I am still using the Storage Drawer.  Yes, from time to time I forget and still whack the cupboard, but the Keurig and the cupboard are no worse for the wear.  I still keep my eye out for better storage solutions, and none have really looked like they would be any better.  While the product is well made and has been durable (still looking practically new, and is heavily used in my kitchen)   I still think it's a bit pricey for what it is.  I just checked online and it still ranges from $25 to $45.  (I am hoping that nobody pays $45 for this when you can get it for $24.99, plus use a coupon for 20% off at Bed Bath and Beyond.)     Of all the reviews I have written on Amazon, this one seems to  ing some not so nice comments from people. Which is kind of odd to me.  But everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I still hold firm at 4 stars.  As I mentioned in a reply to one comment   to me, that's a B+. There's nothing wrong with a B+ product.  I think most people that buy this product will be very impressed with it's durability.  Thanks for reading!
