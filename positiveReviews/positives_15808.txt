I love to use these syrups to cut cost and calories on my lattes! I make them at home, use almond milk (the 35 calorie one) and these no sugar syrups! So nice to look forward to each morning. I only drink one cup of coffee a day and this makes a nice reason to get out of bed.          This is also a very nice variety!
