Great way to enjoy pizza on a low carb diet.  We even put a little bit of sauce over the ricotta cheese (there are plenty of low carb spag sauces in the grocery store). I also bake the crust for about 5 minutes before I put everything else on and then bake it again, otherwise the crust does not get cooked enough.
