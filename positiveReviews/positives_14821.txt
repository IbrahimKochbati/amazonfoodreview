I am hooked on Rishi Tea's Earl Grey. After  owsing the teaviews site for good Earl Grey Teas, I picked up a canister of Rishi at a local grocery store. But after the first cup, I fell in love! My coworker asks for a cup even when she's not a big fan of Earl Grey. The velvety smoothness of each cup makes me want another. Thus, the 3 pack is a great deal.          I can't imagine my mornings with my Rishi Earl Grey.
