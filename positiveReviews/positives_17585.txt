I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this item   something that was low acid. I found it flavorful and satisfying. If I hadn't been told it was a low acid coffee, I never would have known. I normally drink Eight o' Clock coffee. I was just as happy with this  and. I would definitely drink it again. I tried having a second cup with  eakfast. I also had a cup in the afternoon on another day. Normally I don't drink coffee after  eakfast time because of stomach issues. It usually bothers my stomach later in the day. However, I was actually able to tolerate it quite well when I used this type of coffee. I wouldn't drink it daily in the afternoon, but it's nice to know that if I ever need a little burst of energy to get through the day, I can  ew a cup of this coffee and not worry about getting an upset stomach. Therefore, I definitely recommend giving this coffee a try.
