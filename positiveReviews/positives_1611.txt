On a whim, I picked up a two pack of Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix recently, enticed in some measure by the already positive reviews here  and I will add to those by noting that we will be keeping a supply on hand in our pantry.          I really did not expect that this easy to prepare mix would yield waffles better than the from scratch recipes I had been using, but now the waffle iron is stashed within easy reach after being banished to the recesses of the cabinets for the last few years.          Being able to whip out crisp, airy, light, malty waffles does wonders for one's popularity in the kitchen, and pairing these with real maple syrup and fresh blueberries is the way to go.
