These bars are naturally amazing. Tasty, simple, no weird funky ingredients or stuff you can't spell hiding in there. They have good flavor and crunch, travel well in a bike jersey pocket or handbag, and stick with you.          This flavor is my favorite, but we've tried them all and they're all wonderful. How can you beat the simplicity of coconut and almonds? Yum!
