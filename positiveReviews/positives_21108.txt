I have been using Dr. Harvey's Canine Health Miracle Dog food for more than 4 years. I found this product through a friend who has dogs with similar finicky eating habits. My two dogs would pick at or just turn their noses up to any of the generally available  ands in the supermarket as well as food I got at my vet. They had also been having skin irritation problems. As soon as we changed to Dr Harvey's they wolfed down the food and after a couple months the skin irritation problems disappeared. Both dogs (1 Border Collie 13yrs and 1 BC Australian Sheppard mix 16 yrs) had developed arthritis in hip and shoulder joints prior to starting the new food and again after a few months of the new food their pain level seemed to decrease. When the BC was 15 we had blood work done and the Vet said she had never seen blood so clean for a dog this old. We are sold on the properties of this food, and have started using it on our latest rescue dog a 1 year old Australian Cattle dog, and she loves it. The con to this food is the prep time, but we make a batch and freeze half so we are not making it every night. If you care about your dogs health and don't mind spending a little extra time preparing the food then you should give this one a try. I have not tried any of the other "Health" dog foods available, so I can only compare this to supermarket and vet quality dog food but I will never go back, my dogs health is too important to me.
