This is amazing  ead. I made it for Christmas and I have to say this is the most delicious and moist pumpkin  ead I have ever had. Unfortunately it seems to be seasonal. I actually went back and bought 10 more kits to clean out what the store had left.          The kit comes with icing, the flour mix and a can of pumpkin puree. The icing is not very good, melts and turns clear after a few hours, I recommend you use your own icing.          This is something you need to try.
