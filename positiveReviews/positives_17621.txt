Puroast Low Acid French Roast          This is a dark roast coffee, and it was difficult to find out if it was decaffeinated or caffeinated, but it appears to be caffeinated. The packaging is not reseal able to maintain freshness. The grind is a very fine powder, but works great with my French press. The taste and smell of the coffee was on par with local  ands and the name  ands. I didn't find it to be particularly better than the coffee I normally drink, and the low acid part wasn't a big seller for me. I always take my coffee black without any cream, milk, or sugar, and even with double the normal dosage I use, the coffee didn't give me that jolt I wanted. The good news is that the after taste isn't as strong.          Overall: 4 5 stars, great if you like coffee but cannot handle the acid, but I didn't find it to be a better coffee than less expensive store  and coffee.
