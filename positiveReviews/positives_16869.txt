My large La adoodle puppy loves this toy.  He quickly figured out how to get the food out, but it keeps him busy for a few minutes so that he is not chewing things that he shouldn't be!  The only downside is that it makes a lot of noise on the floors; but that's OK since he is a happy boy with this toy.
