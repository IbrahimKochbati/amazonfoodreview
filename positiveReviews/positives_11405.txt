I prepared one batch by hand according to recipe using butter.  I baked 1 3 of the batter on glass, 1 3 on corningware, and 1 3 on baking sheet.  The glass batch turned out best.  The corningware batch flattened a little more than the glass batch and also was more crumbling.  The baking sheet ones tasted burnt although they didn't look burnt; the baking sheet ones looked similar to the glass batch but tasted burnt and I threw them out.  I don't know of any other gluten free chocolate chip cookie mix that is also potato free and this one tastes great.  Reminds me of the duncan hines regular glutened mix but not as good as the recipe on the back of Tollhouse cookies glutened cookies.          Another very similar mix I like a little better is Authentic Foods Chocolate Chunk Cookie Mix which AF just came out with and since Amazon carries AF, hopefully they will carry the Chocolate Chunk Cookie Mix soon.  The ingredients for them is:  Rice Flour, Organic Granulated Can Juice, Dark Chocolate Chunks (granulated can juice, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, dextrose, soy lecithin, vanilla), Natural vanilla flavor, salt, baking soda, soy lechitin   Gluten free Wheat free May contain milk & soy  To mix add 2 eggs, 3 oz veg oil and 1 oz water.  Bake 10 15min at 375.  The Authentic Foods Chocolate Chunk Cookie holds together a little better than Pamela's.  The AF cookie has a more buttery taste whereas Pamela's has a more cocoa taste to the cookie.  I think they both get their chocolate chunks from the same supplier as they seemed identical so it is just the cookie part to compare!
