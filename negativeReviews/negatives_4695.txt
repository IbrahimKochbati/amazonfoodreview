I have three cats.  Now mind you, all three of theses cats LOVE to eat.  One cat is part Maine Coon and weighs about 28lbs, one is 17 years with a thyroid condition and constantly wants to eat, the third is the Coon's twin and she is a bit of a glutton.  ANyway, each of these cans has about the equivalent of two tablespoons of food and the rest is all liquid.  That was a reall turnoff for my guys.  The actual protein content LOOKS good, but they all three pretty much turned their noses up at it.  I have been using it as my "emergency supply" but have to say, I would never buy.
