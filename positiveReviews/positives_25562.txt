We lived in Kenya for 6 years and cold hibiscus tea was a favorite daily drink    loaded with vitamin C and antioxidents.  We bought the hibiscus blossoms in the local market and  ewed it in room temperature water for a few hours. Now, back in the US, we have a half gallon in the refrig at all times.  We've read several articles stating hibiscus tea, in addition to its other health benefits, lowers blood pressure.
