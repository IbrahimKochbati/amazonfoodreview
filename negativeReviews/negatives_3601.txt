The oatmeal itself is tasty and pretty healthful.  It's not the best oatmeal I've ever had, but it is quite good.  And it is great to see yet another vegan certified product on the market.  This is a great option for busy vegans (like me!) looking for a quick  eakfast.  You can probably make better oatmeal from scratch, but it would take a lot longer.  So, really, this is a good product.          But I have two (somewhat related) complaints.          First, the serving size is *ridiculously* small.  Each packet of oatmeal is about 120 calories.  That's just silly.  Unless you're a child, or you're planning on eating much more than oatmeal for  eakfast (or adding significant quantities of fruit to your oatmeal), you'll want to open a couple of packs each time you sit down.  That's a bit annoying.  (You could solve this one problem by buying the larger cups.  But they're a much worse value, calorie for dollar.  And the second problem, below, still applies.)          Second, there is so much packaging and unnecessary waste.  It's absurd that ~50 ounces of oatmeal is spread out over six boxes, each of which contains eight microscopic paper bags of oatmeal.          These problems could be solved by just selling single container bags of oatmeal.  The result would be less waste and packaging and an easier time serving.          Still, overall, this is a good product.
