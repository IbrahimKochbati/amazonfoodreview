Ugh.  This flour is really good.  I was hoping there was not much of a difference compared to the other organic flour I buy because these little 2 pound bags are expensive.  It makes my pizza dough so good that my  other, the pizza connoisseur, said it was the best he had ever had.          The  ead I make is better too with Hodgson Mill Organic White Flour, but there is not enough difference in my  ead to justify the cost for me.  I make lots of  ead because I don't buy store  ead.  I live in the boonies.          I mention my  other's comment about the pizza dough because I have been growing my own organic produce, baking  ead, drinking raw milk and more for about 4 years now making me suspect for a normal review because I am a tad more sensitive, I think, than many with the differences in food and, in particular, how food makes me feel after I eat it.          So, yeah, dang it, it's really good.
