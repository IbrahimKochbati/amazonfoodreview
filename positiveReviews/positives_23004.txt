This is one of my family's favorite cereals.  Even my son likes it, and that's saying a lot.  It's light and crunchy, full of cinnamon flavor with just a touch of sweetness.          Low in fat and calories, sugar is not too bad in my book (that's always debatable depending on who you ask, but I don't think 8 grams per serving is horrible).  It even contains fiber and protein and 9 vitamins and minerals.          We love this cereal for  eakfast, or any time we need a quick on the go snack in a bag.          per 3 4 cup serving:     Calories   120     total fat   1.5 grams     protein   3 grams     fiber   2 grams     sugars   8 grams     total carbohydrate   25 grams
