I am a health & fitness coach who helps people get healthy online for free, and one of my customers was praising Coach's Oats, so I had to try it.  I do NOT like oatmeal.  I can't stand the mushy texture, and whenever I have eaten it in the past, it was strictly for nutrition's sake rather than enjoyment.  I LOVE this stuff   it has a steel cut texture but is ready in 5 minutes instead of 500 like steel cut (&lt;  slight exaggeration).  Such a great flavor & texture   I'm a customer for life!
