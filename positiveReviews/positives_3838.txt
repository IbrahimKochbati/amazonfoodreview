This is really good green tea without bitterness or the orange discoloration which is a sign of "old" green tea. Stay away from the big  ands like Lipton, Twinnings, and Bigelow. They do well with black tea but not green.          For green tea go with this, Uncle Lee's, or Tazo. You'll never be able to go back to the others, which will taste like swill from a polluted river.          This is real green tea. And it's not expensive. Recommended.
