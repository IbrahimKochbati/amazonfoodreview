I could not believe how GOOD this ketchup is! It's actually a perfect blend of flavors and my entire family loves it. We had 4 teenage kids for dinner one night and every one of them commented about how good this ketchup was on their french fries and hamburger. They all loved it. I have since tried Heinz ketchup in a restaurant and have found I can't enjoy it. It's too tart tangy for me... which is amazing since that's all I've ever eaten.          Organicville ketchup will be our ketchup of choice for as long as they make it and Amazon.com sells it (of course my local grocer doesn't sell it)! I just wish it was on auto delivery. I would definitely sign up for it! I also bought Annie's Naturals Mustard when I bought this ketchup and the Mustard is EXCELLENT too! Try them, you'll love them! I promise.
