I picked this box accidentally at the grocery store instead of Yogi Skin DeTox. Quality wise, Yogi makes fine herbal tea in my opinion. I mostly drink plain black tea but when I want it decaf and I'm too lazy for loose tea, I go for Yogi :)     As for this particular combination, I found its taste pleasant but not everyone agreed with me on this. It has a strong ish black pepper mixed with cinnamon taste and a bit of (lemony?) ginger. I'd say if you are looking for some herbal tea only for the taste of it, this may not be it. Yet, just looking at the ingredients list makes me want to drink this tea.. it just looks so healthy. So I'll keep a box around and alternate it with Skin Detox maybe, which has a much milder, rosy flavor to it.
