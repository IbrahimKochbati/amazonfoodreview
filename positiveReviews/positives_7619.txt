They are what they claim to be.  The sweet flavors are sweet, and the gross flavors are GROSS!!!  My 5 & 7 yr. old boys loved these from the Easter Bunny, but I thought the adults that were adventurous enough to try them had even more fun with them.  You can't tell what you get by sight or smell   not until you bite into them do you know the truth! Highly recommended if you are into this sort of thing!
