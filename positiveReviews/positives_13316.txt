I can make the best gluten free  ownies you've ever tasted without using a mix.  But that recipe calls for melting chocolate in a double boiler.  It takes multiple mixing bowls.  So, sometimes, for convenience, you want a mix.          One box will make an 8" square dish of gluten free  ownies that I readily serve to my wheat eating friends (and I get very positive feedback).  You want to take the  ownies from this mix from "good" into the stratosphere of "awesomeness"?  Here's my tip, stolen from the Paula Deen website.  Mix up the  ownie mix.  Pour half into a baking pan.  Chop up a toffee bar (the supersize symphony bar works well) and spread over the bottom half of the batter.  If you're feeling like a super delicious extra heavy  ownie, just lay down the whole bar and get another half of a second bar to make a complete layer.  Then pour in the other half of the batter and bake according to the directions.  You will soon be eating the best from a mix  ownie you've ever eaten, gluten free or otherwise.
