Tried these for a Gold Box deal and LOVE them!  They do have a bit of a crumbly texture, although they seem to hold up well in the package.  And if you don't like coconut, you might not like these.  But to me, they taste like yummy cookies!  I don't eat gluten free or dairy free so I can compare these to other bars that can't make those claims and tell you that these are good.  Soft and sweet (and a natural tasting sweet, not artificial), just the right amount of chocolate chips if you're eating these as a snack to not feel like a treat.  Great ingredients.  I will definitely buy these again!
