Slightly biased because this company was started near my hometown, but I've been a fan of Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies for years since I first noticed them popping up at coffee shops back home.  Now living on the other side of the country I was pleasantly surprised to find them on Amazon, and even more excited to find them at such a great price!  Store them in the freezer, pop them in the toaster and it's like eating a fresh baked cookie that is full of good things for you and keeps you from getting hungry till lunch.  High in fiber and much better tasting than any energy bar out there, who doesn't love a cookie for  eakfast?  I love these things, will be ordering more soon to keep our freezer well stocked!
