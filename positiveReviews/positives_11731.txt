I was surprised by the flavor of these bars, and while they seemed a bit small at first, I found them to be pretty filling. They were very popular with my family, and the box was empty almost as soon as I opened it!          Calories are ok, about what I'd expect, and even though I'm not a fan of coconut I did not find it bothersome. I tasted more chocolate than anything else, and you can't complain about that.          I would definitely buy them again, though I might have to hide them for myself next time!
