I first tried this energy drink on a 1500 mile "Iron Butt" motorcycle ride in which you have 36 hours to complete,not an easy task, but AMMO energy shots kept me alert. Small container, so carrying a few was compact. No adverse affects from the caffeine. We had the After Dark flavor and now I want to try the others.
