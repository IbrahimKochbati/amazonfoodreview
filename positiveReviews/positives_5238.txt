After the JP Morgan Corporate Challenge road race in Boston, they were handing these out at the finish line.  Not only was I able to try the tangerine which I got from Amazon I was also able to try a few of the flavors.  They were all really delicious.  They weren't heavy like a lot of sodas and you could taste the real fruit ingredients instead of the usual artificial flavorings.  The tangerine was especially good.  It was crisp, tart and refreshing and actually made for a nice recovery drink after the race to get some carbs back into the system.  My only complaint is that 8.3oz left me wanting more like a 12oz can.  Very good.
