These taste like factory duds... like they forgot to put the cinnamon in them, and decided to sell them any way.  If you gave me one and didn't tell me what it was, I'd doubt that I could guess cinnamon!  Very disappointed, and of course they are non returnable, what a rip off.  I also bought the Wintergreen ones (in the rolls), they were better, I could taste the Wintergreen flavor in those.  I canceled my auto ship on these "Cinnamon" mints.  I LOVE the ones in the tins, they have great Cinnamon flavor, I've signed up for auto ship on those instead.
