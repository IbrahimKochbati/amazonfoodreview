We were given a Keurig coffee machine for a gift. We really like the ease and convenience of use, but the K cups can be very expensive. I've done extensive comparison shopping, and this particular deal is the best I've found (in online or retail stores, and even different packs here on Amazon). There are not a lot of K cup decaffeinated choices, but since I like hazelnut flavor, this is a good choice for me.          This is a nice mild hazelnut decaf at a good price.
