The product I received came in a different package than what is pictured but that is fine because it was a little bigger than what I expected. The oil doesnt really have a smell so that is good because I intend to use it in a mixture of oils for my natural hair. The delivery was fast and even arrived a day prior to the scheduled delivery date. I've only used it once so far and mixed it 50 50 with Olive Oil as a hot oil treatment, it wasn't greasy at all and left my hair nice and soft. I gave it 4 stars because I haven't had time to use it enough. I will update this review after I have used it for awhile and can make a better assessment.
