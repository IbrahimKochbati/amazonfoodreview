I was very nervous ordering a plant online; especially because this was going to be a gift for my boyfriend for Valentine's day. It was shipped to us very quickly and wrapped really well. It is perfect. Definitely smaller than I had expected but it's meant to be small. It definitely looks just like the one in the picture. The container it came in is very nice as well. Very happy with my purchase.
