Just plug and play with your preferred software.  No hassles, worked great for about 3 months then just stopped working.  Didn't drop it (It is made of a flimsy plastic and is light as a feather   feels cheap).  It just stopped working.  When I buy a product I don't just want it to work great for three months.  Totally dissapointed.
