For those who normally steep a few Rolaids or Tums in their mug of Joe, a low acid coffee seems an ideal alternative to those upset tummies. Puroast Low Acid French Roast is one such alternative, but there is a definite trade off. The coffee is certainly low on acid, leaving me feeling well after a cup or two. But, the Puroast lacks that robust bitterness that regular coffee has, making it less rewarding on the palate. It's not that the flavor is undesirable    in fact, it tastes just fine; it just isn't as rich, due to the process of removing the acidity (?).          Overall, Puroast will certainly due in a pinch, and is great for those who suffer major acid indigestion from consuming regular coffee. But if you can tolerate a little discomfort and don't mind taking Pepto, you may wish to stick with your grande latte from Starbucks.
