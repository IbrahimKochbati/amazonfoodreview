I used the full packet of seasoning mix and I though the  oth had much more depth of flavor than most noodle cup type meals with distinguishable notes of lemongrass and ginger. I would rate the heat level at medium with a pleasant tingly mouth burn. Less salty but still plenty of sodium, there is plenty of  oth so this would be a good one to use as a base with added vegetables and meat. Weak points are the dehydrated chicken and vegetables that have a distinctive dehydrated flavor.
