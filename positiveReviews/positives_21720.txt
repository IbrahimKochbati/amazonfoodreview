It would be very hard to purchase any other  and of split peas after having had the pleasure of tasting these. Each pea is perfect; no imperfect ones to toss out. The final result is mouthwatering. I made a big pot, threw in some vegetables, and can barely keep myself away from having too much now and not enough left for another day.          And, being organic and GMO free, wrapped very carefully in gunny sack material inside a plastic bag, it is a healthful contributory to the diner, not a questionable one.          I'm really glad I discovered these split peas. I can't imagine anything better.
