My fiancee  ought this home from his moms and my cat went crazy! She inhaled an entire can in seconds and then begged for more. I completely grossed my fiancee out when I tasted it and let me tell you as someone who is an avid cook the Chicken Pot Pie is very good. I make chicken pot pie and reading the ingredients were like reading the ingredients in a chicken pot pie you would make or buy for yourself. The chicken did not taste processed. The first time I saw the can of food I thought it was gourmet tuna and had to read to make sure it was cat food. I can't say that I blame my kitty for enjoying this so much. We have a local health food store that carries it so it's easy to find for me but the deals online are amazing! I'll be going via Amazon from now on. My cat reacts to this the way she reacts to fresh tuna, she goes nuts!
