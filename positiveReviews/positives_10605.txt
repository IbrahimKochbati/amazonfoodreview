I add a sprinkle of this salt onto meat, salads, etc. just before serving.     It gives a sweet salty taste and has delicate crystals that give a wonderful     crowning flavor touch to nearly anything.          I believe that I have often tasted this sort of thing being done at high end restaurants.          I know the salt is a splurge but it has really opened my eyes and is the best one I have     ever tried. I have tried to find more reasonably priced substitutes in gourmet stores but     have not found anything close.          I suggest you try it once and am sure that you'll be hooked, too.
