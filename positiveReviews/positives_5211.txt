I'll admit that I don't care for drinks that are carbonated   the carbonation in soda makes me burp, they tend to be too sweet, or the diet drinks have a weird taste to them. So I wasn't sure what to expect when I drank this.          To my surprise, the carbonation is very mild   it's more like a light buzz in your mouth instead of a lot of carbonation (you won't hear the contents fizz when you drink this stuff). The orange tangerine flavor is a nice combo    stronger in the tangerine flavor than orange, though as someone who doesn't like any sugar in my drinks, I found it to be a tad sweet (though it is advertised as no sugar added), but less than I expected.          I'm not sure when you would drink this though   it's a small can and I can't imagine someone who drinks cans of soda drinking one of these instead   especially at the price they charge for this. Are they thinking that this will replace a glass of orange juice first thing in the morning?          Overall I think it's tasty and if someone offered me one, I'd take it, but it's not something I would buy.
