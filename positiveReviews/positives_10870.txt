The dog loves Newman's Own Dog treats. I know this because she spins in circles and nearly takes off my fingers when given one. She never does with this other treats except for steak. The treats are nice little squares that you can  eak in half if you want. They have a slight greasy feel. The ingredients are high quality. No bad smell.          There's only one problem. The dog passes gas a few hours after a treat. It does not smell good. Your dog may not have this problem, but ours did. That is the only negative I have. Otherwise, recommended.          Update: The dogs gas problem went away with continued use of this product.
