i was really ready to hate this, but as they say on the packet   unusual but unusually good.  Its 100% manioc (tapioca) and you add oil and eggs and milk or water (i used rice milk).  The rolls I made came out surprisingly  ead like, chewy in the middle, crispy outside.  I think they taste better once cool (less eggy smell) but    seriously    a lot more like  ead than i ever imagined, and a healthy tasty snack.
