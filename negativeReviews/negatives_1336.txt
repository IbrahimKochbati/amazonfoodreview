My girls seem to like this food   they've only ever shown an opposition to green beans.  But it is SO messy.  It's apparently tomato based, and it gets everywhere.  Where we usually just wipe their faces gently, you really have to clean them.  It simply turns their skin orange.  And the bowls and spoon end up crazy oily, even after soaking.
