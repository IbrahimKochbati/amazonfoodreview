This tea has lots of flavors.  I first started loving Chai tea about 8 years ago.  I have tried many of the boxed liquid teas and I do like them.  I have preferred the  and Einstein bagles uses, but since I have a Starbucks close by, have grown to like the one they use as well.  My favorite is the "masala" tea made my a local Indian restaurant.  This most closely approximates that.  I am still trying to replicate it, but for now, this is the best I can do.  I really like this tea.          As a bonus, if I forget to empty the basket when I leave work, when I get in the next day, the whole area smells great!
