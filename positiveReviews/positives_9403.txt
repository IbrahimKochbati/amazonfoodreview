I've always been a snob when it comes to my chicken; nothing but fresh chicken would do for me. Then one day I found an amazing recipe which oddly enough, called for canned chicken. I trusted the source of the recipe so I bought a couple of cans at the store, and I am SO glad I did. This stuff is great.          It's true that it doesn't have the same consistency as freshly cooked chicken. It feels more like rotisserie chicken, as it tends to fall apart very easily. This is actually great for casseroles! I prefer it over the texture of sauteed chicken.          All in all, I'm very pleased with the product, so I came to Amazon and bought a whole lot of it to put in my pantry. It was delivered, for free, in two days! Thanks Amazon!
