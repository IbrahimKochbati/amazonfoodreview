We purchased this syrup for making popsicles (fresh fruit and very little sweetener) some time ago based on what we now have discovered to be crap science and misleading advertising.          We normally are very strict in our choice of foods and nutrition and are members of a group who spearheaded the research on trans fats (partially hydrogenated oils) forcing the FDA's hand for trans fat labeling.          That group, a good source of easily understood food science, and nutrition is The Weston A. Price Foundation.  I've just completed some research on their site, and others, and discovered some disturbing facts about this so called agave nectar.  It has a quite dark history.  Type "agave" into their search engine and you'll find a number of articles reports.  You might also try a general internet search engine and do the same.          If you are concerned about your health, may I suggest you do this research and get the facts about this man made, very high fructose syrup?  I believe it is better to have all the information available to weigh against the agave industry's partial truths.  One article even suggests that current agave syrup labeling does not conform to FDA requirements.          The consensus of non vested conscientious science is that agave syrup is another bad guy.  The power of the advertising dollar is really something isn't it?          We're going back to real maple syrup (NOT any of the "original" artificially flavored high fructose corn syrup syrups).
