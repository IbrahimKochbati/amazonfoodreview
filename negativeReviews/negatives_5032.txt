It seems like a nice durable toy but my dog could care less.  A few sniffs, nose up, and that was that.  Doesn't matter what treats are in it or even if we dispense them.  I thought it would be nice for a bored dog, but this is a dog that, apparently, prefers boredom to gastric pleasure.  I gave it 3 stars because it does seem to be well constructed, but not five stars since it was utterly pointless purchase, at least for me.
