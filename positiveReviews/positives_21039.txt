My only wish is that this can could be bigger...it says that it makes up to 24 quarts but I like to use 1 1 2 cups to make it a little bit stronger using a Gatorade water bottle I bought from Amazon too. I've tried using my CamelBak water bottle with a bite valve, but if it isn't washed out right away it will start to mold up a little on the inside of the bite valve like if I try to use it for night time drinking.
