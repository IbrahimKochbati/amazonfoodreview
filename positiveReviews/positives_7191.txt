Excellent quality pet food with no inert ingredients, filler or potentially unhealthy meat by products. I used to have to travel several zip codes away to buy it, and it was well worth the trip to give them food I was confident was of the highest quality. My cats can't get enough of it and the price is very competitive, especially if you are a Prime member.          Still in doubt? Try this test:          Open a can of your current cat food and smell it.. then compare that to any flavor of Merrick. It won't turn your stomach.          When it says fish, there are huge chunks of  you guessed it  fish. Not a weird extruded looking grey or stinky  own paste that you could mistake for what comes out the other end, but actual food in a can. Speaking of which, the post meal 'litter box stink' period is dramatically reduced as well, as is fecal volume. Less to clean :)          Give it a try.. remember to mix it with your old food for a day to two to ease the transition, but your cats will thank you for it.
