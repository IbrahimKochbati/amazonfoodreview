I was definitely skeptical about trying powdered peanut butter.  Grew up with Peter Pan and as a choosy adult, have been choosing Creamy Jif for a decade, but just had to try this based on 85% less fat and all the amazing reviews.  Recently been losing weight with Weight Watchers, so figured I'd give it a shot especially as a substitute in cooking and baking.  Received PB2 a few days ago    WOW!  Love the stuff!  I've been telling everyone about it.  It's got a great flavor, and then when you consider that it's got 85% less fat, it's got AMAZING flavor!  Really!  I don't think you would be able to tell the difference on a sandwich.  I'm a by the spoonful kind of girl and the PB2 is totally satisfying.  Give it a shot.  I don't think you'll be sorry!
