This  ead is very easy to make. It is far superior to gluten free  ead available in stores, even health food stores.  I've been adding poppy seeds to add a slightly different flavor.  It still has the heaviness that all gluten free  eads have, but it is lighter than most and toasts well if not cut too thickly. I cut the loaves in half and freeze one half. I use a regular mixing machine.
