Although highly rated by experts, too much garlic smell for my taste. Going back to Shark  and after 4 bottles of this.     Notes:     1. Smaller bottle than most; may be convenient at table.     2. Like some other good imported  ands, no chemical preservatives. US Huy Fong has chemicals, probably because it' s left out all day on restaurant tables.     3. Top is weak  hinge  oke off before fully used.     4. After #3 top very hard to put back on.
