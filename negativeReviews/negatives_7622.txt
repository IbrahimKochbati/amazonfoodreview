I have tried many different types of Mate over the last few years. Flavored, unflavored, with herbs, with sweeteners, roasted, and organic. This is the first "Unsmoked" Mate that I can recall having tried and it has turned out to be the strangest Mate yet. My taste buds really hated me for sticking with this Mate. I can now say that the bag is finished, the damage is done, but man it really is bad tasting Mate. I gave this stuff and fair try and thought maybe it would grow on me, but like hell! This stuff tastes more like dirt and hay than it does Mate! As for why the taste is off, it is difficult to say what is actually going on. It is entirely different from the traditional taste of Mate. The bad taste has nothing to do with it being "Organic", that much I know. I've tried several "Organic"  ands and this is the only one Ive had a problem with. I toyed with the idea that it may be a bad batch, but I know that's not the case as I've bought two bags of this stuff and it's the same taste. The only obvious problem with this Mate is it being unsmoked. So if you are looking to buy that traditional tasting Mate, look elsewhere. And another problem, perhaps, is a simple issue of it not being aged long enough? I don't know. I've heard that two years is the ideal length of time, but really don't know much about the subject of aging Mate. Anyways, I looked on the website for any information on how long it is aged but found nothing.          As for recommendations on other Mate, and really I suggest finding another  and, here are some  ands worth looking into; Titrayju (highly recommended), Roapipo (a personal favorite), Taragui, Cruz de Malta, Amanda, Nobleza Guacha, and Rosamante.          Rosamante, Cruz de Malta, and Taraqui are all found on Amazon I believe. Good luck!
