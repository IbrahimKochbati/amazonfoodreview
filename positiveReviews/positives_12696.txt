These crackers seriously taste like little mini pizzas. A lot of times I'll eat them with slices of sharp cheddar which just amplifies the flavors even more. Sure the ingredients list is a little longer than I'd like, but I don't eat these too often so not a big deal. Still better than most chips out there.
