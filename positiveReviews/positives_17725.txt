To be honest, I do prefer some other  ands of coffee, if only they didn't affect my stomach and intestinal tract so badly. That is why I was excited to try Puroast. It has a perfectly fine flavor. It also has the added benefit of being low acid, at least if my heartburn   or lack of it   is any indicator of that. I used to be in denial, remembering college days when I practically survived on coffee...and pizza. But I've bowed to reality, after far too many years of thinking the heartburn would eventually go away   permanently.          Coffee is the one thing that gives me heartburn...not spicy foods, not anything else. Now I can have my coffee and ditch the antacids when I drink Puroast. So I figure this is a win win situation. I'm saving money on antacids and enjoying my coffee at the same time.          Having noted that, I know people can be very selective when choosing a favorite coffee. So this may not be to your taste but it certainly hit the spot with me. Give it a try and   if you have time    give a shout out about whether you like it or not.          I also have to confess that I'll probably have some weak moments and drink regular coffee when I don't have the Puroast close at hand. But I'm hoping I'll cut down on my antacid use by at least half or more. I know I'd be able to give up those antacids completely if I drank only decaf but then I'd be walking around in a sleepy state much of the time. Compromises, compromises.
