I came across Canidae when we adopted a 3 week puppy whose mother had transitioned.  We didn't know how to care for him properly so we went to the local pet store and they said Canidae was the food to use and to use it throughout his life.  We simply wet the food for the first few weeks before going completely dry and he has loved it throughout.  We also feed it to our 65 pound Goldendoodle and he loves it as well.  Definitely a great find.
