I have a problem with getting my coffee strong enough with Keurig makers when using commercial K cups.  I make 7oz  ews with ex. bold K cups.  Newman's Own Organics Special Blend (Extra Bold) is the first  and I have found that IS strong enough AND tastes smells good also.  I normally use the aluminum caps to recycle the cups and refill with excellent Viet Namese coffee that I grind as needed. This  and (Trung Ngyuen) can be bought through Amazon. This works well but the cups can only be recycled so many times and you need a source of replacements. Also, because of sleep fog, that FIRST cup often needs to be faster than the refill version   these work admirably.  The commercial K cups are soaring in price and they are MUCH more expensive than refilling with your favorite loose coffee or fresh ground beans.
