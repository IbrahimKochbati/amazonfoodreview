The stargazer lillies in this bouquet have an amazing scent that fills a room, which the recepient told me was "heavenly". They live quite long when cared for properly, but it's important to remember that these particular flowers ship in bud form    on delivery day, they aren't like the picture on the page here, but will reach that point in 3 or 4 days' time. Take that into account and plan ahead.          The reason to choose this one over the standard version is the extra stems of the stargazer lillies because, as I mentioned earlier, the scent they carry is fantastic (the more the merrier!).
