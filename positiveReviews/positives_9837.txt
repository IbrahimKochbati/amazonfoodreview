I like peanuts, like I like other kinds of nuts.  But peanuts to me are usually just filler for the "better kind of nuts."  These peanuts though are surprisingly good.  I gave them to a colleague who was skeptical (capital S) at my suggestion that these peanuts were just that good.  Long story short, he agreed.  If you like peanuts at all, these are pretty special.
