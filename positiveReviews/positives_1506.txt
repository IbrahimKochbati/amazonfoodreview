I have had my herb savor for a few weeks now, and I was waiting to write a review until my herbs went bad, so I could tell you how long it takes, but it never happened. For the first time ever, I used all of the herbs before they went bad. I have not had any problems with leaking. Everything closes up nice and tight on mine. Plus, this thing just looks really cool!
