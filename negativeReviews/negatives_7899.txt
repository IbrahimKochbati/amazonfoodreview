*sigh* I kind of hate it, can't really  ing myself to use it.  But I still haven't planted basil seeds for my own supply yet. This needs to be doctored with cheese but it is still too dark and oily to be recommended.  It may do in a pinch in lieu of dried basil (and who would use THAT anyway?)          Don't buy it.
