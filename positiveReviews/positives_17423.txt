We use this food for our two Welsh Corgis.  One has food allergies so he can't have any chicken.  The other has a slightly sensitive stomach so the non baked version of this didn't work for her.  The food is about a half inch in diameter so it forces them to chew rather than gulp it down like they tend to like to do even for smaller dogs. They love it.  We think it's a better grade than most non super premium foods without all of the hype.  They're skin and coats are perfect with this food too.  This is on my regular re order list.
