I was expecting this to taste like a weak version of what I make with my juicer. I was incredibly wrong. It has a very empty, dull taste to it while being fairly bitter (NOT sour!). It's extremely unpleasant, and now I have lots of this stuff I likely wont drink.          I understand taste is a very subjective topic, and I'm sure there are people who might enjoy this. However, it tastes absolutely nothing like other drink mixes and absolutely nothing like lemonade you'd make yourself (from real lemons). Keep that in mind if you're looking for a more natural alternative to common drink mixes (as I was); this is not the answer.
