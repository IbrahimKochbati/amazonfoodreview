I love this tea. It has this very clean taste, not bitter at all. I am from the south and love ice tea, but the caffeine and sugar made me search for a healthier option. I began to use green tea w  a little mint in place of the traditional black tea. I use very little sugar and filtered water. My daughter likes it way to much and my northern husband is hooked, so is his mom. I have made the tea with several  ands and this by far is our favorite.
