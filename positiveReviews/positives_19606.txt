I ordered these mixed pastries 4 days ago, and they are sooo good! I was worried about shipping during the summer, especially since I live in Louisiana and these were coming all the way from MI.  But, they arrived in 2 days after I ordered and were in perfect condition.  (That was w  expedited FexEx shipping)          I have to say that this was the best mix of baklava that I have ever had, and I have tried a lot.  They tasted very fresh also. My boyfriend is from Egypt so these were for him, and he enjoyed them too.  I will definitley order again. I only wish that we were closer to the bakery!
