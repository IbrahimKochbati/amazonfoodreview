I honestly don't care for the taste of the white cheddar. It was too bland and chalky for me (not smooth and creamy). My husband is finishing the case for me since he is not picky about food as long as it is made for him. The shells were yummy and when cooked long enough I found them to have a nice consistency and were tasty without the white cheddar sauce. Don't forget to mix the power and the milk together before adding the pasta, I know it is on the box but who takes the time to read the box?
