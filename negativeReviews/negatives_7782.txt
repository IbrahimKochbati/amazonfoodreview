I have had kitty on Natural Balance Chicken, Duck, and Salmon (salmon being the least favorite as far as taste)   I like to switch it up for her (who likes to eat the same crackers day in, day out?) and recently purchased the ultra formula (because she is a senior citizen at 15).          Anyhow, her little 'gifts' to me since having her on the ultra formula have been the stinkiest little stink bombs I have ever experienced. I get up in the middle of the night thinking "she must not have buried that pile of    ," only to discover that she did fully bury that pile of    ." It just smells like    ! I'm dying whilst writing this review.  Ugggghh.
