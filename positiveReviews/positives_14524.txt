I love the higher burning point. I can cook in higher heat and not create smoke or blackening as with Canola oil (PS   for those who think canola oil is bad for you, do some research.  It's no longer made from rapeseed and doesn't contain the high level of erucic). I can see them being ok if used in small quantities. And even though I'll use the occasional spray of canola on a pan, I prefer this to Canola or Olive Oil.          Unfortunately I have a mild skin allergy to olive oil. This is just as good and I prefer the taste more. I use it in a misto sprayer. Great stuff. On my second order.
