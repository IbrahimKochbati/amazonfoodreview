Delicious. Bought both these grape ones and the strawberry. I prefer the grape, my wife the strawberry. I used to buy llicorice from Allan's candy in Canada. They made the best licorice belts that were a flat kind of ribbon about 1 2 inch wide. They stopped making them for some reason. Now I find the Gustafs  and the best licorice.
