I typicaly drink Mountain Dew or more recently the Picth Black but this is my favorite soda! Beaware they have tried to change the logo and add the words "Fruit Punch" ... as if we don't know. It's just a bad logo change and someone should be fired for it. Unfortunatly I have yet to find a substitute for the times when I can't find it so get it while you can!
