Getting grain free treats for training usually leaves three options: hard biscuits (and who wants to work for those?), cooked meat (which is gross to handle), or commercial meaty grain free treats which cost an arm and a leg.          These on the other hand, are very affordable, not gross to handle, and the dogs think they smell AMAZING.  They work great when your dog's attention is wavering   a waff of freeze dried beef liver usually snaps them back to attention!          Also, being as they're only beef liver, I don't feel bad feeding my dog as many as needed for training.          Highly recommended.
