I have a dachshund.  I have fed her Newman's Own Senior Formula for the past few years.  I used to feed her Eukanuba, but then when there was that pet food scare with China, I started to investigate and found out that Eukanuba contained the same undesirable chicken parts as the cheaper dog foods.  I wasn't happy.  I contacted Newman's about whether the products in this food are sourced from the U.S. and I was told by one of their scientists that they are.  Recently, I moved and was unable to get Newman's locally, so I tried a couple other organic  ands.  My dog didn't like them and she seemed to have a larger stool.  I decided to go back to Newman's and order from Amazon, who I can always count on to carry everything.  Now she's happy and so am I!  And, we're supporting a great cause, because Newman's doesn't compromise on quality and also supports charitable endeavors.  What more could you ask?          One important thing to consider   if you have a senior dog, it is important to feed them the senior formula so they can digest the food easier.
