I bought this statehood gift basket to  eak apart the items into smaller gifts for friends family.  It's over priced so I will not buy this again.  The contents are mainly food made in China,  like graham crackers and taffy etc. One of the reasons I wanted it was for the beautiful XL ceramic coffee mug in this set.  Basket item  is really large due to all the fancy packaging like novelty wrapping cardboard for bulk, so there is not that much in there.  It's fun to open and it will  ing back memories of a state you resided in.  Overall I was delighted with it but not the outrageous price for China made items and some items listed in the product were NOT included in this particular gift.  ( items vary per set )
