Not something I'll buy again   rather bland puffed rice and nuts (mostly Brazil nuts and almonds), sweetened with glucose syrup and with some raisins mixed in   the only fruit I could taste, though the ingredient list includes apricots and peach.  The result is bland as well as overly sweet.  Though "Eat Natural" yogurt coated almond & apricot bars are even sweeter, they're far tastier and would be my choice if I were to buy "Eat Natural" bars again.  I prefer Larabars to either   though I know they're not everyone's cup of tea.  (And the dates and other fruit used to sweeten Larabars seem more natural ingredients to me than the glucose syrup used to sweeten "Eat Natural" bars.)
