Bought these Jack Link's Beef Sticks a second time because I was so pleased the first time I purchased them. This time the quality had gone down significantly, they were much greasier tasting and less flavorful. Then, they began to get moldy... within two weeks of receipt! Needless to say, I was not happy with this purchase.
