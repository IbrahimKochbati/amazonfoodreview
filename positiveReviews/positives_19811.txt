I always wanted to try Haribo Gummy Pink Grapefruit, but I waited for Amazon to have a sale, and it was worth the wait!  These gummy pink grapefruit slices are good sized, tart and tangy just like real grapefruit   and they smell good too!  You can't eat just one!          A 5 pound bag goes a long way.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who can eat sugar and loves the tangy, tart taste of pink grapefruit.
