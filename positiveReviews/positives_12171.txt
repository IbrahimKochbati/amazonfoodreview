Having had my Keurig Mini Brewer for several months now, I have ordered and tried several different  ands and flavors of K Cups. Green Mountain's Nantucket Blend seems to be the one I go back to after trying others. It is a medium roast coffee with no bitterness that suits my palate more than any others I have tried.
