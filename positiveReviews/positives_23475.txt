This is like other lokum I have had in terms of the gel like texture and inch thick powdered sugar packing around the pieces. The rose aroma is strong, like a grandmother's old fashioned perfume and the flavor matches it exactly. Americans are not used to eating floral flavors, even in Europe you only see violet as candy, so rose is very unusual to our palates but very delicious and exotic. I recommend people try it.
