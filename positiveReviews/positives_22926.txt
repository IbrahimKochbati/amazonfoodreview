I've enjoyed the Bigelow Plantation Mint tea for years. I've tried other  ands of mint, and I always come back to this one. It has a very pleasant, soothing mint flavor. It's the only hot tea I drink without adding sugar. It's hard to find locally, so I decided to check Amazon, and they had it by the pack of six boxes. Each tea bag is in a sealed pouch, so it lasts a long time. Plus, it was cheaper to buy this way than when I could find it by the single box in a store. If you like mint tea, you'll love this one.
