It was time to order cat food again and I thought I'd give the Natural Balance line a try.  My cat loves fish, so I figured that the Tuna and Shrimp Recipe would be a big hit.  Nope.  Both cats in our house gave it two thumbs down votes   neither of them would touch it.  What finicky little critters they can be sometimes [sigh].
