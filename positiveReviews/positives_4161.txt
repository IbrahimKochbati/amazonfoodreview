We discovered Earth's Best when my oldest started solids years ago.  They had a more limited selection then, but offered more variety than the "regular"  ands.  For him, we only bought a few jars each trip, those flavors that we couldn't get in another  and.  For our second child, we added a few more.  With the 3rd baby, we started out on the larger  ands, but he wouldn't eat them.  Who can blame him!?  They're runny and lacking any flavor.  Not to mention, no matter how good sweet potatoes are, how many jars can you eat?  He gobbles up every jar of Earth's Best without any problems.  When we introduce a new flavor, he's all for it.          I agree with other posts that some of the flavors are very runny.  We just add a few tsp. of cereal and problem solved.          Earth's Best is more expensive.  I calculated that every 2 weeks of food costs me $15 more than buying the other  ands.  However, we decided that since he eats it all (vs. being very picky with other  ands) it's a wash.          If you want to use Earth's Best for your baby w out  eaking the bank, try these tips:     *Visit Earth's Best's website and print off all the coupons they'll allow (usually 3), have family and friends do the same          *Buy at Whole Foods.
