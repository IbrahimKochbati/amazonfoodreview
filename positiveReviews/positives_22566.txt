I received a popcorn maker for Christmas. It has a small drum (holding 1 4 cup unpopped corn). I have never used a machine like this and wasn't sure if this popcorn size would be too much for the drum. It was perfect. The flavor is great, very similar to theater popcorn, although I am no popcorn connoisseur like others on this post. I just know what tastes good and this definitely does!
