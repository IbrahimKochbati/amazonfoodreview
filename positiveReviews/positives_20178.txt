I am so happy to have discovered Madhava Coconut Sugar.          My family has a collective sweet tooth and we baked all the time. I used this blonde sugar in our pancakes, a chocolate cake and in my husbands tea (all without letting anyone know). Everyone loved the pancakes and the cake and no one had a clue that there was a healthier sweetener being used. My husband did notice a slightly different taste to his tea but he assumed it was the tea leaf and enjoyed it.          I will continue to use this product. So happy to have found it.
