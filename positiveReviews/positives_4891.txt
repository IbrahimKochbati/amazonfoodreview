We've been trying various rices including Aquarello Carnaroli and this Vialone Nano is by far the best. It's very forgiving of lapses in technique and produced the creamiest risotto of the five  ands of rice we've tried.          Be sure to have an airtight container to store the unused rice from each package   the vacuum pack plastic is too stiff to close well.
