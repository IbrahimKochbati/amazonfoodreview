This product is easy to make, healthy and tasty. Of course it's no substitute for real Indian food, whether homemade or take out, but it's perfect when you're home alone and need something flavorful and quick to eat. I purchased this meal to cook when my husband travels. I made it tonight and added about of 1 4 cup of additional cottage cheese and topped it with some nuts for more flavor. For $3 and about 5 minutes of my time, this is was one of the better meals I've had this week. I will definitely eat this again and I look forward to trying more of their products.
