I have been a fan of the More Than Gourmet product line for many years (I think since right about when they started) and this stock reduction is one of my favorites. Unlike their duck, chicken, veal, lamb and seafood products, this one can be added to almost anything. Soups, stews, sauces, what have you. This will add depth to all of the other More Than Gourmet stocks and glaces.          They start with a classic "essence de champignon" (which is a mushroom stock containing sherry, salt, garlic and spices) and then they reduce it to 1 20 of it's volume. Since it is bound with a starch (Tapioca) it will help to add some body to a sauce. It can be used minimally diluted and poured over carrots, fish (really just about anything that would taste good with mushrooms), or added to an existing sauce or dish.          I often make my own mayonnaise using safflower oil, egg yolks, Dijon mustard, lemon juice and various seasonings. I usually serve it as an elegant topping for fish or vegetables (it's great on asparagus) but I always thought that it could be better. I now add just a teaspoon of the More than Gourmet Essence De Champignon Gold and I can't believe how much better it is!          I am a lifelong carnivore but some members of my family are vegetarians. When I cook for them I substitute this for a veal, chicken or beef demi glace. I even add it to vegetable stock to give it that extra dimension. Sometimes I buy it in the 16 oz. tub, other times I like the convenience of the small 1.5 oz cups. If you can think of a dish that would would benefit from the hearty, earthy flavor of mushrooms then I recommend that you give this a try.
