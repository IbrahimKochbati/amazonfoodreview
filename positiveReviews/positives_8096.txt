I was very satisfied with my purchase of Nutiva hemp seeds. I ordered a 2 pack of them and it arrived fairly quickly. They taste great on their own, but I usually add them to protein shakes to enhance the amino acid profile, or sprinkle them on top of salads for added flavor and texture. My supply is almost gone so I'll definitely be ordering more.          One of the reviews said there were still shells in the bag but I didn't find any in mine.
