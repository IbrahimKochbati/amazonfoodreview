We have a lab who is a TOUGH chewer...this lasted about a week.          I got the first one with the rope top, and our dog chewed through the rope in 5 minutes and had the purple ball off in another 10 minutes. I made the mistake of using Gorilla Glue to put it back on, then realized that its really bad for dogs so threw that one away.     Ordered another one  this time with the rubber rope  and our dog was through the rope in about 20 minutes, again got the purple ball off in another 10 minutes, and went to work on the neck of the bottle. A week later we had to toss it because he had chewed off the neck of the bottle and it was cracked all down the sides.     He did LOVE it while he had it...but $10 for a week of entertainment is a bit much...
