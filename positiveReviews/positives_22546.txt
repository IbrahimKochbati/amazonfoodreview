This stuff worked really well for a school fundraiser.  Everyone loved it and there were very few kernels left after it popped.  Others complained about the oil being solidified but that happens when it gets cold.  After we had it outside for a while it all liquified but it works fine either way, I just squeezed the package and it came right out.  Great product...I will purchase it again if we do another fundraiser.
