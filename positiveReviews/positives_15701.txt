With 12 cats (1 outdoor, 2 part time outdoor, 9 full time indoor), it didn't take me long to test this product!          What do you get in this package?          SIX FOUR PACKS of cat food. Each serving comes in a small tin, (3 ounces each), 24 tins all total. EACH four pack includes:             one Red Snapper Entr&eacute;e        one Steamed Tuna and Shrimp Entr&eacute;e        one Steamed Tuna and Sole Entr&eacute;e        one Yellow Fin Tuna Entr&eacute;e          As I said, each tin is a  eakfast or supper sized serving for your cat. These are the smaller type tins, not the larger Friskies sized ones (from which I get two servings).          I gave each of my cats a tin of this (I included an equal number of each flavor) and just let them go to whichever bowl that they wished, which is how I always feed them (They normally get Science Diet hard food twice daily and then canned catfood once every two days for a special treat). They went after the "gravy" first and, after licking that all up, they ate the chunks of seafood. All the cats ate all the food. These cats are all orphans (former strays) and some were really ferrel when we first took them in    now they're all spoiled and calm. Most are pretty old (seven of them are over 10 years old). One cat is especially finicky about her food but she ate this product just fine.          This catfood (like most catfood) is sort of nasty looking when you open a tin but that's because all the good chunks of meat have settled to the bottom. The fairly clear gravy has some thickness, not watery.          I'll give you the ingredients list here from the Red Snapper Entr&eacute;e: fish  oth, Tuna filets, Red Snapper Fillets, soy bean oil, tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, calcium sulfate, Carrageenan, vitamins and minerals (Vitamin E supplement, Vitamin A supplement, Vitamin D3 supplement), zinc sulfate, thiamine mononitrate, manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfate complex (source of Vitamin K activity), Riboflavin supplement, folic acid, Pryidoxine hydrochloride, copper amino acid complex, iron amino acid complex.          Guarantee analysis: crude protein (min) 13%, crude fat (min) 1.5%, crude fiber (max) 1%, moisture (max) 85%, ash (max) 3%, taurine (min) 0.1%. This catfood contains no Wheat Gluten.          The  eakdown on all four flavors runs about the same. Two of my cats are diabetic (they each get two insulin injections per day) which means, in the real world, that they throw up quite often. This food did not make them throw up.          I can definitely recommend this catfood with these two caveats:             it's pricey.        they still like one type of Friskies  and slightly better (they fight over it): Salmon Dinner.          Given those two items, this catfood is a winner. Highly recommended.
