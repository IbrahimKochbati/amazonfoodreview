Mini Ravioli's were something I liked as a child and now my son loves them too. While I wouldn't recommend them for your childs main nutrition, I think they are great for a after school snack or a mini meal on the weekend. They are very easy to prepare, less than a minute and they are done. Unlike the can version I like the easy clean up aspect of the container especially nice for a quick on the go meal for RV'ers.          I recommended this product.     4.5 stars
