For some reason it is hard to find the Uncle Ben's Original.  This is just as good, but a bit different in flavor, and reasonably priced.  Just wish the packaged rice makers would lay off the insane amount of salt.  I only used packed rice boxes if I am in a real hurry.  Usually make my own, much less expensive.     The secret to making your own rice like this is plenty of dried parsely and garlic.  Heck of allot cheaper and no hypertension salt.
