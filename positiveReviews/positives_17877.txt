I hadn't had Shake n Bake since I was a kid, and I'm not sure if they've changed the recipe, but the flavor seems much more savory than I remember.  It added a nice coating to the pork chops and they came out moist and very flavorful.  My husband, who's not easily impressed food wise, really liked the flavor of these.  I didn't realize they still made Shake n Bake, but I'm glad to have revisited this childhood favorite and will definitely be making pork chops this way again in the future!
