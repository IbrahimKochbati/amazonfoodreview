We bought these for our two dogs: a 65 pound, year and a half old lab mix and a six year old, 80 pound shephard lab mix.  One of the bones splintered and  oke in the first hour of them chewing it.  I removed it immediatly and have requested a refund from Amazon for the product.     Be careful with these and watch your dogs.  It is a sizable piece that  oke and really could have caused some damage if swallowed.
