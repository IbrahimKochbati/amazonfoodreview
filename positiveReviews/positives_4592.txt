I like it, it reminds me of food from my childhood. Not something I'd eat everyday.  Kinda like the way I feel about grits. You need to cook them for a long time. How you serve them makes all the difference in the world.  Great for baking, but you have to know the product before you try baking with it.  Taste?  Real wholesome, good stick to your ribs food, takes some effort like granola. Healthy eating?  Yes.
