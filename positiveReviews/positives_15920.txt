I'm glad I discovered Cameron's on Amazon. (Maybe it's available in stores, but not where I live.) Every flavor I've tried has been delicious but Caramel Creme is a particular favorite. The caramel flavor is noticeable without overwhelming the taste of the coffee itself. Also I think some flavored coffees use the flavor to cover up for substandard coffee, but Cameron's always tastes like the coffee is very good quality as well.
