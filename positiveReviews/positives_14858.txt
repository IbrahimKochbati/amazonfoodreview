Rishi is a wonderful tea company.  They are one of the best of the best.  Earl Grey is no exception when it comes to their line.  It starts by being double sealed to retain freshness and aroma and doesn't stop there.  It is a premium black tea with just the right mix of bergamot for a crisp, citrus note.  I have had Earl Grey's that overuse the bergamot to hide a less than sterling low note of underpar black tea to try and carry the flavor.  RISHI does it right.  You can have a taste and aroma experience, perfectly balanced to deliver maximum satisfaction.  I normally like a little raw sugar or honey in my tea, but this beautiful blend can stand on its own.  Nothing needed here but boiling water and a short wait to enjoy an excellent tea experience.  Well done RISHI!
