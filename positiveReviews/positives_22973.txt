I'm not exaggerating when I say that I was a hardcore caffeine addict last semester with microbiology and organic chemistry to study for. I'd say 4 5 cups of coffee day would be an accurate count   that is until I realized how jittery i'd become after my 3rd or 4th cup. I stopped cold turkey once finals ended and the withdrawal effects were horrible   I could not wake up past noon. I always liked how mio made my water taste better, but I wished it had some kind of stimulant effect...and then, voila! mio energy! i was immediately drawn to it's appetizing color and loved its apple kiwi taste. It's a lot cheaper than buying a cup of coffee day and it doesn't go bad. I bought a couple   one for my purse, another for my backpack and even gave one to my sister. It's the perfect energy boost for when a yawn creeps up during the middle of the day. boost of energy without the crash!
