Forget about just using it with milk and hot water, I put it in smoothies even when I put acai and other fruits in. I was just disappointed the way they shipped it, in a USPS Priority Mail envelope. They charge almost $10 for shipping, and I would expect it to come at least in a box, not just squeezed into a thin cardboard envelope. Otherwise, no complaints about the product, delicious.
