Mrs Bryant's Strawberry Apple Sauce tastes like a summer day  with the  lovely taste of ripe strawberries mingled With the  pure taste of apples.  With no added sugar I was able to give this to a friend with Diabetes and she was able to enjoy it as a special treat   making this sauce even more special.
