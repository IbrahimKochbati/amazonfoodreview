We ordered a case, and it arrived in perfect condition, i.e., we did not have a problem with open bags stale contents as some previous reviewers have had.  This is a better alternative to cheetos or other junk food, but I would not condsider it healthy  just a better tasting, more natural junk food.  It is satisfying and, based on the ingredients and taste, I'd rather eat Pirate's Booty than cheetos.  I subsequently bought a bag of Veggie Booty and was pleasantly surprised, though its flavor is a little more unconventional than Pirate's Booty.
