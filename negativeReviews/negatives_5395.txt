Puroast Low Acid Coffee Low Acid Coffee French Roast is not a coffee that I will try again. It was very, very bitter.  Some may like the bitter French Roast, but I do not. I found it to be unpalatable.  I sweetened the coffee and added cream to try to tone down the bitterness, but that did not work. I was left with an undrinkable cup of coffee.  Sorry, Puroast, I cannot recommend this product!
