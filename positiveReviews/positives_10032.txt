The aroma from this coffe when I opened the bag was amazing.  The coffee flavor was bold and yet not overpowering.  It was not bitter and had a nice crisp flavor. My husband also enjoyed it.  Would be curious to try the same coffee if it comes in decaf to see if it retains its flavor.     Would serve this to guests at a dinner party.
