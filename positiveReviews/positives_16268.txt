These things are awesome.  These Greenies really clean your dog's teeth very well.  When I first opened the container I was a bit skeptical because they smelled pretty bad but after a week of using these.  My dogs  eath was great, and I used to not be able to bear her  eath.  It's a must buy for any pet owner.
