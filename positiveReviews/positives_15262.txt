Being an organic, health conscious family, we turned to Happy Baby for our food needs outside of the homemade foods we make.  Not only does my 8 month old literally beg for more with every bite, I can tell that her digestive system takes well to the hearty and top of the line organic ingredients.  Happy Baby   Happy Mama!
