I made delicious banana pancakes last week using this product and over the weekend, remade a family favorite from years ago, Chicken and Dumplings, which was on the Betty Crocker Website under GF.  We couldn't tell the difference between the GF and regular mix in the dumpling results.  I made the recipe from scratch for six, using chicken  easts and thighs simmered till tender in chicken  oth, baby carrots, celery, cut green beans, onion and seasonings and stirred up some white gravy to pour over the dish before serving.  Husbie loved it.
