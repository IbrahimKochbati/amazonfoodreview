This is the second time I've ordered this chocolate peanut butter, but I liked it so much that I ordered it in the 4 pack package.  I like it better than the regular version, probably because I am a chocoholic rather than a peanut butter enthusiast.  I especially like the fact that a two tablespoon portion of this chocolatey spread only has a one point value on Weight Watchers, not only making it a great snack but also a low point one.  I love putting it on a rice cake, either plain or with a tiny bit of preserves, or just eating it off the spoon!  I love this stuff!
