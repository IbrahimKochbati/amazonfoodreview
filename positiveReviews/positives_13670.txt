These make a great snack to be left in the glove compartment of my vehicle. Available when I need them. They don't seem to melt together when they get warm.  The white belly texture is almost like a toughened up version of marshmallowish texture. Interesting on the tongue.  The flavour of the frog is interesting as well.  Some say a pineapplish sort of green tea pear flavor. Same flavor as green frogs I've found in department store food places, so I'm guessing its the universal frog flavor or the same  and more likely.
