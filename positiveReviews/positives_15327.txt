A friend offered us a cup of decaf after we had been out to dinner with him and his wife.  We accepted and enjoyed the coffee made with a Keurig very much.  My wife said to me "your birthday is coming up, would you like one of those"?     I looked the product up on the Amazon website and placed the order in just a couple of days.     I received an early birthday present and we really like it.     Today, I received a K Cup reusable coffee filter from another Amazon order that I placed just about two days ago.
