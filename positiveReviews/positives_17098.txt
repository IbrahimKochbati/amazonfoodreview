My 8 month old Jack Russell, Fritz, loves his jug. I fill it full of kibble and a few finely  oken biscuits before I leave for the day for work and Fritz plays and plays for hours. I had to get a second one for him to have at my boyfriend's parents house because it's the only thing he truly loves 75% of the time.
