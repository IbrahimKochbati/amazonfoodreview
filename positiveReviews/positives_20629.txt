We live out in the country and we were happy to find we could order our favorite chili through Amazon.Com.  It shipped that very night and we had it within just a few days.          This is our favorite chili. It's so easy to make and it doesn't take much time (about 30 to 40 minutes.) We seem to always have chicken or turkey, so we put pieces of either one in the chili and enjoy the chili with hot corn ead.          The best part about the chili is it's not just plain old chili. It has a variety of beans as well as rice and some pepper which make the chili very tasty.          This really is "Darn Good Chili"!
