Ok,lets start of by saying that my microwave is not very good for popcorn,but in my local grocery store I can buy Market Pantry popcorn for $ 4.25 for 18 large bags and not all the pop corn kernels pop but very yummy,and I went through 2 boxes in less than a month,but then we have this one Pop Secret and my first 3 bags BURNT  and was not happy so I decided not to follow the instructions,so I decided to put microwave at 3 minutes and let it stop when it got to 20 sec's,ok so it didn't burnt it,but due to me not placing it microwave on high,it took a very long time to cook it,and so anyway's it began to pop,and so I thought great,at least no burnt popcorn,and I was so excited and HUNGRY to try it,due to the ratings on this site,I began to eat it,and my first reaction was,oh my good ness,DRY DRY ,where is the butter ?..its called butter pop corn so where is the BUTTER ? did it get all dryed up in microwave ?
