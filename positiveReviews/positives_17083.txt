I am always looking for play toys for my 120lb, 2 yr old Mastiff. So far the ONLY toys that lasy over 2 days are the Kong  ands (which I HIGHLY recommend). But anyways, this toy keeps him entertained for a long time here are my pro's & cons for it:           Pro:      not expensive      has several different areas to hold his interest (the bottle, the rubber spike ball & the rope)      durable      Cons:      If your dog shakes toys around then that hard heavy plastic bottle can do some damage to you or your walls      your dog may do what mine does &  ing me the toy to set it up for him to get treats, defeats the purpose of him figuring it out      my dog didnt love the treats that are made for the toy, so I just bought small size dog treats & cut them in half, works great!          The pro's definitely outweigh the cons & I highly recommend this to other dog owners, especially ones that are strong & destroy other toys
