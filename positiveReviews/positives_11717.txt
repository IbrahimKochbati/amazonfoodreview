The Whenever Bars were incredible.          My wife is allergic to wheat gluten and I choose not to eat it as well.  Because of this, I was very excited to Pamela's Whenever Bars.  Not only are the bars gluten free, but I can actually pronounce every ingredient.          As for taste, the chocolate and coconut are very pronounced.  I felt as if I was eating a macaroon. I can't wait to order more of these soon.
