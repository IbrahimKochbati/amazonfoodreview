We lived in Charleston for years and always loved the availability of fresh seafood   especially oysters!  Now we live about 24 hours away and I do miss being able to swing by the seafood market when I'm in the mood.  I had no idea that I could have it delivered to my doorstep within a couple of days!  It was well packed and smelled as fresh as if we bought it off the boat.  Impress your friends and throw together an oyster pasta dish.  SO much better than the stuff in the small plastic containers at the grocery store!  These were HUGE.
