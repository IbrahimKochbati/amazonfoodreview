Like the bad reviews say, the organic formula constipated our daughter. However, by alternating every other feeding with regular (non organic) formula the problem was resolved. I'm a believer that some organic is better than no organic. We've used this method for 2 months and our daughter is full, happy, and growing well.          I would recommend this if you are looking for an organic formula with milk as the first ingredient (as opposed to rice in some of the others).
