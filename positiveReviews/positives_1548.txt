I received this mix along with a waffle maker as a gift.  It's so good that I keep buying this same  and mix when I run out.          I cut the Farmhouse Waffles recipe in half (so that's 1 cup Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix; 1 egg; 5 8 cup water; 2 tablespoon melted butter) and it's more than enough batter for 2 waffles in a full size Belgian waffle maker.          Easy to make and very tasty.
