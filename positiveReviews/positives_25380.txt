Since reporting a problem with the thickness consistency, i.e. some (quite a few actually) chews were very thin, they resolved the problem. I ordered extra large for my 70 pound dog and wanted something she could get her teeth into. My dog loves them and they do a great job keeping her teeth and  eath clean and pleasent. The quality is now very good again.
