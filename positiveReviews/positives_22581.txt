This is truly the best popcorn I have ever tasted. I also bought the bulk bag of recommended popcorn from Amazon and was am disappointed in it; but THIS is the bomb. Why waste storage space on the coconut oil and popcorn kernels? It is all wrapped up and ready to go in these handy packets, which I use in the Orville Air popper gadget we have had for 12 years or more.
