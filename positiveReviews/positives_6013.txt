Wow, organic lentils, how great is that! Lentils are one of the planet's top 10 super foods, extremely high in protein and fiber, extremely low on the glycemic index and inflammation scale. This is one food I try to eat everyday. I live in a pretty unsophisticated town in the central valley of California, and you'd think our "high end" supermarket, Raley's, would carry organic lentils, but of course, they don't, and even if they did, I'd have to pay an arm and leg for them. Amazon is my lifeline for quality organic foods and other products. Incidentally, I don't make the typical lentil soup with these. I simply cook one bag (16 oz.) with about 7.5 cups of non fluoridated bottled water (fluoride is extremely bad for your thyroid), salt them to taste, and only cook them for 25 minutes. This way, they don't get mushy. They keep their firmness without being too chewy, more like a bean, and then I keep them in the fridge for a week, and have them with a little organic shredded cheese on top. YUMMY!
