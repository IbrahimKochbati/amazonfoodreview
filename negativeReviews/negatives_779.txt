I tried to find the ingredients for this hot cocoa before I bought it, but couldn't find anything online. Turns out it has one of those mile long ingredient lists, and yet, that didn't help the taste at all. It is awful.          I had three boxes of the stuff sitting around for a month and couldn't find any takers. I finally got rid it of it at the Christmas White Elephant gift exchange at work. I put it with a nice cookbook, which was the real present, and wrapped it real prettily. Unfortunately, the boss ended up with it. I haven't asked him if his family enjoyed it because I don't want to put him on the spot. Judging by the reviews, there are a lot of people who like it   hopefully, he will, too. Maybe it just depends on how your taste buds are trained. Mine grew up with hot chocolate made on the stove, with milk, cocoa and sugar, and maybe a tiny pinch of salt.  Compared to that, this stuff tastes like a chemical experiment.          Anyway, instead of trying one of the other  ands, I now heat some milk in the microwave, stir in a couple spoonfuls of Hershey's cocoa and some sugar to taste. It takes about three minutes, and it's delicious. Now, where did I put those mini marshmallows?
