I had high hopes for this gluten free  ead mix, and although it had many good qualities, I probably wouldn't buy it again because I didn't care for the flavor. I made it in my  eadmaker and it rose nicely and held its shape reasonably well after I took it out of the machine. I let the  ead cool before I cut it as all gluten free  ead can fall if cut while hot, and the  ead sliced very well. Each individual slice had a spongy, soft  ead texture. Actually it was almost a little TOO soft for me, but those who like soft  ead might enjoy it. I cut a slice and put margarine and honey on it, expecting to have a tasty bite of fresh  ead  but something about the flavor bothered me, and I had difficulty enjoying it. I have had almost every kind of gluten free  ead on the market and have been gluten free for a long time, but I don't know how I feel about this new Sorghum craze. Although it yields decent nutritional value and good texture, similarly to bean flour, if there is too high of a ratio of sorghum to neutral flours (White rice, tapioca, etc.) I think that the flavor is negatively impacted. I prefer a more subtle mix, like Bette Hagman's four flour blend, which has less sorghum and thus gets the good qualities of the flour without negatively impacting flavor. I toasted the  ead for sandwiches for a few days and my husband ate it without complaint (he is not gluten free), but because I didn't like the  ead and it reminded me a little of playdough, I don't think I'll buy it again. My entirely subjective opinion aside, if you are looking for an easy gluten free  ead mix for your machine, I would recommend that you try this mix, because only trial and error will help you find a  ead mix that suits your palate. I prefer homemade bean flour blends, Bob's red Mill GF  ead, or The gluten free Pantry's favorite sandwich  ead, but you may find this mix fits the bill perfectly!
