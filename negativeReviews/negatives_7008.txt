As ground coffee, this product is OK; but I was looking forward to a flavor: "Vanilla nut pumpkin pie."  Maybe I received an old package or something, but when I opened the package there was no aroma of any significance, and when  ewed, no flavor of any significance.          I can buy ground coffee anywhere and for a lot less.  Won't buy this again.
