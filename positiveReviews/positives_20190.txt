My husband has diabetes and I bought this as an alternative sweetener recommended from the book Diabetes without Meds, by Suzie Cohen.  I love the product and to know that it sweetens without being overbearing like the artificial stuff along with knowing it is all natural and unrefined so we are getting the mineral benefits as well is awesome.  No one knows the difference and my husband's sugar levels do not spike when I use this.  Absolutely get the product and buy the book which is chuck full of info...All available at Amazon.
