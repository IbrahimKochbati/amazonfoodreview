I have an interesting relationship with Skittles.  When I was about 10 years old, I absolutely thought they were average at best and couldn't understand what everyone loved so much about them.  "Too sour, not tasty enough" was my impression.  Later however, I entered my teenage years and it actually took until I nearly graduated from high school that the taste caught on with my tastebuds and became super delicious to me.  What also got me hooked is this kid I remember from 10th grade science class who would ALWAYS  ing in a bag of Skittles *every single day* and chew on them, and all the girls liked him because of his good looks and smooth personality, so Skittles sort of gave me the impression that COOL kids eat Skittles.  However, please buy bags of Skittles from your local grocery store  it's not worth it here on amazon with the high dollar price.  You can find plenty of places in your area selling them for cheaper prices.  My only complaint with Skittles is that, despite the color, they *all* taste exactly the same to me!  Purple, green, red, orange, yellow... I really can't taste a difference between these supposed "different flavors".  Then again, I don't have a favorite color in a rainbow so maybe this makes perfect sense!
