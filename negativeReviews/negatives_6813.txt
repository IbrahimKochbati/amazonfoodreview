Perhaps I got an old batch, but I found the popcorn to be a bit stale when it popped up. In terms of ease of use, nothing could be simpler. Add the oil, turn the kettle on and when it's smoking add the popcorn and seasoning (and if you're me, when it's done popping put it in a bowl, drizzle with real butter and microplaned parmigianno reggiano  OMG SOOO good). No one else has complained about it tasting stale in my house so I might just be too picky. I'm not sure if we'll buy this  and again, but in the mean time it is working fine for us.
