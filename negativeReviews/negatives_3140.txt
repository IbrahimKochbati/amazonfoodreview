Why the heck can't Townhouse just get crackers right for once? Remember that feeling of dread you got when you slept over a friend's house and they had  ands foods not part of your world? That's the feeling that these crackers arise. A little too crunchy, a little too "fried", a little too much olive oil spice imbibed (yes, despite the olive oil and sea salt proclamation on the box, there is garlic and onion present). Hey, you see these at your next sleepover, make up a rambling excuse referencing obscure food allergies, and flee.
