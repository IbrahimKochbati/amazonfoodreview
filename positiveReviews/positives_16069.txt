I love McVitte's Digestives, plain or with milk chocolate or dark chocolate topping.  This  and of biscuit, as they are called in England, are a cookie with a slightly less sweet taste than American cookies.  They have a malty wheat germ taste that no other cookie biscuite has. The closest thing we have would be the Graham Cracker.  The name of the biscuit, Digestive,  is as distinctive as the taste.     While they are great for dunking, ya got to be fast! They soak up hot tea or milk like a dry sponge.  If you are not fast enough it will  eak off into your beverage pretty fast.  It's a game I love to play and quite addicting.  Usually Amazon.com has the best deals available for most English foods.  Check on some of the subscriptions for food and you'll find even lower prices.     No, I don't work for either company.     I am however as English as Winston Churchill and have lived in England several times in Suffolk County. Very beautiful part of England.
