I really like these small bowls   they are the perfect size to toss in the overnight bag for a short trip. Pop it in the hotel's microwave for a small dinner and you've saved $5 to $10 that you would have wasted eating out. At home in 60 seconds you have a snack or meal on the run that tastes good and requires zero effort with zero cleanup afterward. I have just gotten into the habit of always keeping some of these around for visiting kids as well.
