I love to cook at home and enjoy using a variety of spices. I also love camping but have not found the best way to transport spices (when I remember to pack them.) This little tin is awesome! It has several different spices that you tend to use all the time in individual packets. The one teaspoon pre measured amount is perfect for small meals over the campfire.
