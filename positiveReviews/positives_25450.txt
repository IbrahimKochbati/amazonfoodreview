This, and all the Lakewood, PURE, Organic Juices (that I have tried), are absolutely, the BEST available. Each juice tastes like the ripe fruit actually tastes, but you can stock up on it! Think of having a case of this juice in a natural disaster, when water may not even be available.  It is precious with nutrients AND water that comes in the juice! To have AMAZON deliver this to your door FREE is a miracle, especially for those who can't get out, or get it up the stairs if shopping at a local store. Time is valuable too, as is fuel to drive around. I NEED this juice for my health and immune system.  Thank God for AMAZON!  They have everything I look for!
