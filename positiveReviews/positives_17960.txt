I remember the Shake n Bake commercials from when I was a kid, but I don't remember my mom ever using it. In fact, my mom fried pork chops so much when I was younger that I stopped eating them. I will cook them for my sons occasionally.          Now I am no chef, never wanted to be. I am a quick and easy crockpot kinda girl. I always bake chops, not because baking is healthy but because it's lazy..I don't like standing over a stove thank you very much!          What I like about the Shake N Bake is, it added a nice flavor to the chops and didn't dry them out. (my main problem when cooking pork chops..dryness) So it was a pleasant surprise to bite into one and not get the feeling I was eating a  ick of sand.          I'm also not a health nut, so I can't tell you about calories and the such, but I can tell you this. It's easy, simple and tasty. good enough for me.
