I've been using Lourdes Chimichurri for years   The stuff is awesome. I use it mostly when cooking fish but have recently started to put it in my family's sandwiches. We're also big fans of the guava and mango spreads. Highly recommend these products if you're looking for great taste without the preservatives.
