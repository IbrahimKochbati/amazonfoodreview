We used to love this product feeding it to our son twice a day for several months.  About 3 months ago, we opened a can and there was definitely something wrong with it.  The consistency was clumpy instead of the normal light, fluffy flakes.  The color was off as well.  The most notable change was the terrible smell.  I did contact the company and they responded to me right away.  The answer made some sense and it has been quoted by others here in this forum.  My problem now is that it just makes no sense!  How on earth is there no recall or some other investigation of this product by the FDA?  It was very noticeable that it all but disappeared off of store shelves and online stores for a few weeks.  The price here on Amazon has gone way up.  I was still buying it but will no longer.  I was still opening cans that were rancid and others that are not.  It is not cheap so I can't afford to keep playing the guessing game on my dime.
