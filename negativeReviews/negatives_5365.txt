This Puroast Low Acid Coffee 'French Roast' was just ok   the flavor was too dark and bitter, and I actually prefer a good store  and coffee (Wegman's French roast is quite nice).  I had to add a bunch of half n half and some sugar in order to drink the cup, and gave up after a bit and poured the rest out...I just didn't like the flavor, it was too strange and bitter.  I love espresso, I try various coffees and lattes and coffee flavored drinks all the time, and this was one that was just not for me: it may be something you may like, and if you need a low acid coffee you may want to give it a try, but I would not recommend this product.
