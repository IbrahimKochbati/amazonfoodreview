From my wife Sarah: I see the other reviewers saying that it didn't cause irritation and one even had it used as a throat soother. I personally do find them on the acidic side, and if I eat too many I find they do cause a bit of irritation. It does take a lot of them to get me to that point though.          Still, I do find these to be delicious. They're very flavorful and fruity. They make a nice treat to throw into the mix with the other flavors from this  and. I especially like the honey flavored candy.
