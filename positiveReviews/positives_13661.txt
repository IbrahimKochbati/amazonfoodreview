I don't eat gluten free, and everyone who knows me raves about my baked goods; in fact, I have a small, custom order baking business.  I first tried this  ownie mix when I was planning my Christmas gift baking last year and a cousin announced she had to eat gluten free. I was hesitant to invest in a lot of expensive ingredients I might or might not use again, so I purchased a box of this  ownie mix, then tried to think of ways of how to doctor it up and make it into something that I hoped would be special.          I came up with an idea, shipped the  ownies off to her, and waited to hear if they were any good.  (I warned her that it was my first experiment in gluten free baking.)  Well, let me tell you...that grown woman went through the entire batch of  ownies in under two days   they were a hit!          I tried another recipe this week for her birthday, which is today, and the results are just in:  in her words, "You hit it out of the park with these!"  Happily, my reputation as a fabulous baker now extends into the gluten free realm...with a little help from Arrowhead Mills!          Here are two ideas to get you started:          #1   Get a box of this  ownie mix, and also a box of the Arrowhead Mills chocolate chip cookie mix.  Prepare each mix according to the directions on the boxes.  Place little mounds of the cookie dough randomly in a 9 X 13 pan, then spoon the  ownie mixture around the mounds to fill in the empty spaces.  Bake.          #2   Prepare  ownie mix according to directions and pour into a 9 X 13 pan.  In a separate bowl, mix 8 oz. of cream cheese, one egg, and a tsp. of vanilla.  Drop dollops of the cream cheese batter onto the  ownie mix; run a knife or spatula through to give a swirled, marble effect. Bake.          I'll definitely be buying this again; I have a lot more recipe ideas I want to try out on her, and may even offer fancy gluten free  ownie creations to my customers.
