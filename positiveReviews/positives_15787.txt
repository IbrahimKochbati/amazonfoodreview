I haven't found a use for all the flavors, but this is a great value.  The bottles are huge.  My favorites so far have been the chocolate, raspberry and caramel.  These are great for low carbers and nice mixed in your tea or coffee.          The flavors have varying potencies so sample a drop or two at a time until you get to know them.  The chocolate is very strong.  The raspberry seems weak.
