I grew up in Ohio and lived in the woods where sassafrass trees were plentiful. I would dig tender roots or "bark" a few trees for a delightful tea.  I purchased Breezy Morning Sassafrass tea and although was quite good it was very expensive for only 20 average size tea bags and shipping was as much as the product.  Not a good bargain.  I switched to Pappy's extract.
