Oh, yes! Great coffee.          My daughter had been raving about Melitta so I wanted to try it. Would an only sometimes coffee drinker like me think it worth the extra price? The answer is yes. I need but one assurance for that price, though. I'd like the package to tell me that it is organically grown and forest friendly. Is it?
