This came exactly as I expected and on time. It has a great flavor. I'm a very, very good cook and I can tell you that marinating overnight (as they suggest on the package) is not really necessary. A few hours is fine. That said, prepare as directed and the flavor is exactly like the familiar Chinese ribs you get in a restaurant. My only concern is the vi ant red of the marinade. There was a real scare about red dye in foods a few years back and I'm still a little wary of any product that uses dyes (such as red dye #3, used here). I'll probably use what I ordered but I doubt I'll use anymore because of the dye additive. Seriously, why does it have to be red? Why can't it just be great flavor?
