I did not purchase mine from Amazon, but I did base my purchase on reviews I had seen on both Amazon & another site, which were all glowing.  So I thought it was fair to give another point of view.  I love popcorn more than any other food.  This is possibly the worst popcorn I have ever had.          Normally, I use canola or peanut oil, fresh locally grown corn, & sea salt.  It is absolutely delicious with very few hulls or unpopped kernels.  It is much better (& better for you) than microwave or any other popping method using oil.          This stuff was stale, & had way too much sodium.  The coconut oil mixture was disgusting. The taste was so bad that I threw the rest of it away after a few handfuls.  I had split the original batch in half, & gave 1 2 to my neighbor, who usually will eat anything.  Even she thought it was poor quality.  Now I'm stuck with 2 boxes of this junk.          I gave it 1 star because every kernel did pop, and the cooking time was quick.  But I'm going back to, & sticking with, my old method.  I think it must be the locally grown corn (FRESH!) that spoiled me.
