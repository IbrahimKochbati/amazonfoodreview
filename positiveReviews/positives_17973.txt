Organic India Tulsi tea is, to me, the absolute best tea I've ever had...both in terms of taste and effects.  I have tried several types and have found that I enjoy Chai Masala and India  eakfast the most (I enjoy them separately, but also, 1 bag of India  eakfast and 1 of bag of chai masala makes a perfect iced chai.)          Black tea will give most anyone an energy boost, but Tulsi tea is unique to me in that it truly does (as the manufacturers claim) leave one feeling both energized and relaxed (perhaps "centered" or "focused" would be the best word).  Tack onto that the purported health benefits of tulsi, and you've got yourself one fantastic tea!  There are a number of non tulsi teas I enjoy, but Organic India's Tulsi Tea is the only tea I purchase on a consistent basis and that I always have on hand.  Also, it is the one type of tea I am frequently recommending to friends and family.  Give it a try!
