I must say that Melissa's soyrizo is the best I have ever tasted.  Even my kids love it! It is so much better than the real stuff that is greasy and full of fat.  I mix it with egg whites and put it in a tortilla and it is delicious. Takes a minute to heat it up in the skillet, then add the eggs and it's ready!  Doesn't get any better thank that.  Thanks Melissa's for such a great product!
