I eat meat and vegetarian foods , and prepare a wide variety of both....but just let me start out by saying , this stuff is flat out creepy!!! the texture is very slimy and not like jerky at all , and has like thick stringy veins in it....nothing like real meat jerky at all...very rubbery and hard to stomach...iam a big fan of stonewalls jerquee and will stick with that!!!  i just dont get trying to be all disgusting with the drippy sinewy veins that they are trying to win you over with??? even real meat jerky has a more palatable consistency.
