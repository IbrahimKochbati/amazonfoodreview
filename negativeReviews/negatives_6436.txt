Unfortunately, this is the only asafoetida (hing) that is readily available in the US. It is preground and mixed with edible adulterants to make it easier to handle. Unfortunately, due to this processing, the quality is not high. While it will certainly work for your recipe, it is nowhere as good as the chunks of pure sap that are harder to find in the US. Search out the good stuff if you know a reputable spice merchant.          If you're in NYC, I've found better quality hing at Dual Specialty Store in the East Village. It's still not as good as the super stinky chunks of Afghani asafoetida that I picked up in Varanasi, but it will do.
