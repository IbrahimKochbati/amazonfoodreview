After dissolving one tab on my tongue, I ate 1 4 of a large lime, and it tasted mostly sweet with just a hint of tartness!  I would have eaten the whole lime but was worried all that acid might upset my stomach.  I didn't notice any difference when I ate parsley, though  the parsley still tasted somewhat bitter to me.  Miracle Berry worked extremely well for me with sour stuff, but not at all as far as I could tell with bitter stuff.          Still, well worth the price to experience this amazing transformation in taste.          Edit:  I had a craving for blackberries and bought a large container of them from a warehouse type store.  I planned on eating them all at one sitting, but after one or two I couldn't eat them  they were mostly sour and hardly any sweet.  I remembered that I had some of these tablets left, so I rolled one around on my tongue until it dissolved, and thereafter the blackberries tasted pleasantly sweet, so I was able to finish them all.
