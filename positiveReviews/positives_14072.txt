I'm always trying  new types  ands of coffee. I found this one about 3 years ago.  It now is one of my favorite flavored coffees. I've served this to several of my friends and most all of them have liked it. In fact 4 of them now buy it on a regular basis. So, if you like flavored coffee, you might want to give this one a try. Enjoy.  ###
