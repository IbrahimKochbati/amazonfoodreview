This drink wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. It's supposed to be Kiwi floavord but the  it doesn't quite make what it's going for. It does have a sweet fruit juice flavor and is carbonated as the description describes, but somehow they don't blend well together. I think kids would like the flavor. They would be easily fooled into thinking they're are drinking soda. But for an adult it is overly sweet.
