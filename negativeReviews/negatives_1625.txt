"Switch `Orange Tangerine'" is advertized as 100% juice with carbonation.  They were accurate as far as the 100% juice and (light) carbonation goes, but imagine my disappointment when I checked the ingredients, and I read the following: "100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, tangerine, orange, and acerola juice concentrates)...          BTW   acerola is also known by the common names Barbados cherry and wild crapemyrtle. It's a berry that has extremely high amounts of Vit C.          Anyway, back to the drink.  When I ordered this item I was expecting a carbonated "orange tangerine" drink, but that was not the taste I got.  After all, tangerine and orange are present in smaller amounts than grape and apple juices.  As a result this drink had a flavor more like a mixture of sparkling grape and sparking apple combined, with somewhat of a light citrus twist, but less carbonation than either sparkling grape or sparkling apple have.          The overall flavor of "Switch" was all right, but it was not, in my opinion "orange tangerine" at all.  In that respect this drink was a great disappointment.  The manufacturer would have been more accurate to name this drink "fruit punch" or "fruit cocktail" or perhaps "grape apple".  There is, by the way, already a "fruit punch" version...I wonder what's in that flavor that's not in this one?          The can size is just adequate at 8.3 oz, but is, I would say, fairly expensive at nearly $1 can, especially when it's not what you thought you were getting.          The drink does, to its credit, have 100% of the recommended daily amount of Vit C, and has only natural juices in it.  That is probably true, but...THIS IS NOT A DIET DRINK.  Just because the can says "no sugar added", that doesn't mean that there's no sugar in it.  There happens to be a significant amount of sugar in this drink (given the total volume you get can)...if I recall correctly the contents label said 35g of sugar.  That's because 100% fruit juice is loaded with sugar, sugar like fructose.          OK, frankly, the taste combo doesn't particularly appeal to me, that's why I didn't order the grape version of this product, and now that I know what's in the "orange tangerine" I wouldn't order it again.          I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars though, simply because it's not really an orange tangerine drink as advertized.  I guess I'll have to go with 2 stars.  (I don't know why 3 stars showed up for this product!?)  Alas...
