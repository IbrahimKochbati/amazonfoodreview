I waited long and with bated  eath for Amazon to restock the bulk packaging for this product, as European style rice cakes are a pretty specific niche, and they can be a bit difficult to find at local stores (not to mention expensive). These are a very different beast from the American style rice cakes that most people associate with the name  as other reviews suggest, these aren't quite so air filled or crumbly, having more the density and thickness of a cracker or crisp flat ead. But unlike those, these are gluten free, oil free, unsalted, and contain only one ingredient: 100% puffed  own rice. They've got a nice light crunch that makes them good for snacking, but they're a lot healthier than chips or crackers, and the  own rice is definitely preferable to a more processed white rice cake if you're mindful of blood sugar impact. They're also great for the occasional mild tummy upset, since they're light and bland and don't require the preparation of other bland foods.          Try them with hummus! My personal favorite: peanut butter, jam, and a sprinkling of chia seeds. Yum!
