Being a French Roast lover, I decided I would give this one a shot. I did not receive the pack of 10 like the page suggests but I received just enough to make one pot  2.25 ounces, I guess this would just be a taste test to let other potential buyers know if it's good or not.          The taste i'd give 4 stars. I'm not sure if I would buy it because i'm hooked on one  and of French Roast in particular, but this wasn't a bad cup of coffee by any means. It had a smooth taste, was still somewhat strong despite being smooth but not too much so.          It's a smooth full bodied 100 percent gourmet coffee with half the acid. If you don't like a bitter roast but still want to experience a rich full bodied taste without heartburn, acid reflux or stomach irritation  then this is for you.          My only complaint is I wish Amazon sent me more   Recommended.
