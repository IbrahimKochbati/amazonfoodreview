Cuban Style Black Beans:     I have prepared them "from scratch", tried more than 10 different  ands in cans, and the winner is "El E o Black Beans Cuban Style"!  Not very many groceries (outside of Latin market areas) have these, but when I find them I buy 2 or 3 cases at a time   I have friends that think these are the BEST they have ever tried (from a can).     I live in Ocala (Fl), and Winn Dixie here does not sell them and cannot get their warehouse to provide them, while the Winn Dixie in Marion Oaks (30 miles South of Ocala) has them on their shelves!          If you LOVE black beans and yellow rice, get some of these El E o beans and some Vigo Yellow Rice.
