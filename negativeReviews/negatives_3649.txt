Green Mountain now colors the box light green but this product is caffeinated. Wife got Snookered caused she thought Medium roast didn't have caffeine; just cause the box was light green. Don't you get fooled too.  Coffee had a bitter taste had to put MORE French Vanilla creamer in it to make it have a smoother taste. ( that was medium roast)  Going back to Newmans Medium roast Decafe..by Kuerig.
