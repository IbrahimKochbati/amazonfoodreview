The first pan was pretty oily, in fact I think the oil weighed more than the kernels. In the second pan I used only half the oil that came with it, it popped the same as the first pan and would have tasted good except for the extreme amount of salt.  this popcorn is so salty I couldn't eat it and my husband who is a salt addict even complained about too much salt!  I will add that the butter flavor does not taste like butter and has a very slight chemical aftertaste. I bought a case so we have a great deal to use yet.  in the future I'll try to sift the salt out of the popcorn before adding the kernels to the pan.  there were many old maids and the popped kernels were not as big and fluffy as Redenbacher's.  Also one pack only made about 1 2 pan of popcorn in my whirley pop popcorn maker which is too bad as i had hoped it would be just the right amount.  I'm very disappointed in the quality of this popcorn.  At the price I expect a so called gourmet popcorn to make a whole pan, taste better and pop fluffier than what I can get from grocery store kernels.
