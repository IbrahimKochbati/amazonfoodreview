This filling is great! In fact, I enjoy all the Solo fillings. A little pricey but worth it. Pulled out a package of Puff Pastry from the freezer and 1 can of this filling and had 8 BIG turnovers in no time! Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and you are a hero. This product is very fruity tasting and I believe you will enjoy it as much as we do!
