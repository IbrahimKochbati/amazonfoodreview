Our cabinets are filled with every salt free seasoning there is. We rely heavily on Mrs. Dash, and really love it. However, I saw this listed on Amazon.com, and it was the first time I had ever seen it. Based on good reviews, I not only purchased it for my house, but sent a package to family members with heart issues. Now that we have all used it, the reviews are in    all of them great. So far, we've used Cavender's on chicken cutlets, whole roast chicken, talapia and cold pasta salad with chopped vegetables. We love it and will make it a definite part of our spice rotation.          If you are looking for something new to zest up the flavor of salt free food, Cavender's All Purpose Greek Seasoning is really quite good!
