Okay, I'm a complete coffee nut: I've even been known to grow my own beans, and when I run out of my private label, I tend to enjoy the baddest Kona or Jamaican Blue Mountain I can find.          Still, sometimes I just want a quick cup of respectable coffee without all the fuss, and this is what I was hoping for in the Melitta Riviera decaf. To a good degree, I was happy with it, but it's certainly not something I'd curl up with when in the mood for a really outstanding cup of coffee.          The positives are the aroma, the uniformity of the grind and the overall taste, which I'd rate as fairly mild and maybe a slight bit on the acid side. I found I liked it best either in a French press or in my Viviano espresso maker   two techniques that make the most out of somewhat weak coffee. Brewed conventionally, I found I could compensate by using somewhat more coffee than usual.          Still, although not a serious competitor to the world's best coffees, it doesn't cost $50 a pound, either. I'd have to say that for the price, it's definitely worth trying.
