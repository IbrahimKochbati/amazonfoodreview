A friend of mine had tried hibiscus tea and said it was a great "fruity" tea. I bought the Davidson's and was pleased with the product. It is a loose tea and can be steeped for 3 5 minutes. I used roughly a teaspoon per 8oz serving. I sweeten it with agave syrup or honey. It's great served over ice too!
