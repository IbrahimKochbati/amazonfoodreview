At first my three dogs had no problem with these chews.  They love them and I think they are good for their teeth and to occupy them when they can't be outside running and playing.  But after a few of these treats, one of my German Shepherds started choking on it, and I had to pull it out of the back of her throat.  She wanted it back because she loves them so much, but it made me too nervous. I took them away from the other two immediately, even they were having no problem.  I wish they would come up with a chew that was safer.  I never give my dogs a chew unless I am right with them, but being there doesn't mean I would always be able to dislodge the piece that could potentially kill them.  Not worth it!
