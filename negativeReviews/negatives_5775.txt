I'm ALWAYS looking for great deals on low or no sodium organic food. This is very good if you like very basic, healthy, no frills, organic food. Only real complaint is that it's a little skimpy and you definately need to make a salad on the side to get "filled up".  Also, when you buy in bulk like this you save close to a dollar a can compared to what my local supermarket charges for these.  It's not worth the price that way.  It's just barely worth it to me at the usual price (in bulk) that Amazon sells it for. Health Valley should lower the price just a bit or add more noodles and vegetables in the can.  I'm pleased enough overall, though,  and am going to continue to buy for now.  Peace and all good things, L.
