This is a superb product at a great price.  I rely on it for baking ,especially around the holidays.  The almond taste comes through. It is clean and pure with no bitterness. It is a high quality ingredient.  Each box contains paste encased in foil so it remains nice and fresh.  Amazon's price is great, far better than any supermarket.  The Odense website also provides many nice recipes.  If you love to bake and need almond paste, Odense can't be surpassed in flavor, freshness, quality and price.
