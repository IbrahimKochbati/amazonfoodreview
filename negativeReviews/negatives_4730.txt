I can be a little timid when it comes to trying sugar free products. Many leave that horrible aftertaste or at the least take some serious getting used to. But I gave these a shot because I'm not willing to consume 4 cups of coffee a day with each having an extra 70 kcal shot of the regular syrup. That's an extra 280 calories at the start of my day! But these were positively delicious with no bad taste or guilt from empty calories.          So I gave the variety pack a go, knowing I was sure to find a quick favorite.          My favorite was the Vanilla. Sweet and earthy just like vanilla should be. I will definitely be buying this one again.          The Irish Cream was my second favorite out of the six. It adds an amazing creamy, buttery finish to each sip of coffee that you are sure to die for.          In third, was the Chocolate syrup. I am generally not a mocha fan so I used the chocolate syrup a bit sparingly at first. But soon I was splashing in even more. It has a very gentle dark chocolate flavor without the bitter notes usually associated with dark variety.          Next was the hazelnut. I am neither impressed nor detested by this flavor. It is a bit mediocre when compared to the more full bodied syrups but will do in a pinch if you're craving that touch of sweetness.          Second to last we have the Classic Caramel. This was absolutely disappointing. I hoped for hints of cream and  own sugar, but instead got a simple sweet syrup with hardly any actual flavor. It did the job of sweetening my coffee but did not provide the caramel heaven I desired. I have heard the Salted Caramel is much better, so that flavor has been added to my "To Try List".          Last is the raspberry, my least favorite. I am detested by the idea of fruity coffee (ei. blueberry, raspberry, etc.) so this was not a good coffee syrup for me. Instead, I decided to make raspberry tea with it. After several tries with black, green, and cranberry pomegranate tea, I have decided this syrup just doesn't work well. As most of the syrups are made to add a subtle flavor to robust coffee, you have to add much more syrup if you want to actually flavor your tea. And all of that extra syrup just makes it way to sweet. This was also the only flavor I actually tasted that sugar free aftertaste, though possibly because I had to use so much.          It's hard to give a good rating for a variety pack as there are three spectacular flavors and three slightly disappointing flavors.          Overall though I say this sampler is great if you're new to their syrups and would like to try a good variety of their flavors for a great price. But if you already have established your favorites, I'd suggest buying their 3 pack of a single flavor at the same retail reduced price of under $5 a bottle.
