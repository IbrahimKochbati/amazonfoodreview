This is by far the best  ead flour that I have found. It is all we use. The flour has excellent consistency, and always yields a perfect loaf of  ead, biscuits or whatever you are trying to bake.          We buy this flour because it is the best, but also because of the great supporting material the company provides. They have a great WEB site with spectacular recipes, and even provide customer support for the recipes and baking products they supply.          I am impressed with the product, the customer support, and the company. They will always get my business.
