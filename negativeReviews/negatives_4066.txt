I should have known not to get the extra bold. This usually refers to the amount of coffee, but when I  ewed it on the "tall" setting so that it is not so strong, it still was way too intense for my taste. I only ordered this blend because of the reviews, which I cannot really understand. I have to mix almost a half cup of almond milk to cut the bitterness. I will probably not buy this again.     Side Note: I only got this to use with my office keurig machine. At home, I use Equal Exchange Organic Coffee and it is WONDERFUL!
