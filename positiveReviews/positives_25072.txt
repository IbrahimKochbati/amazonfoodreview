The jelly beans are absolutely fantastic. I was set people up and ask if they want so, well of course they do. It's so funny when they respond by spiting it out and say "That taste like moldy cheese." I crack up:^D hehehehehe!!! I recommend these jelly beans to everyone. I really wish they would come out with a poop flavor. I heard they have owl's poop. However, I never seen it.
