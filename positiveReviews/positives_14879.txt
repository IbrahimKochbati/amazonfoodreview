Along with the Macchiato flavor, this is my favorite. A very pleasant drink. As the label suggests, this is a good "morning cup of coffee." I've been drinking it regularly most mornings for a couple of weeks and still enjoy it. The standard recommended serving size for this one is pretty small (only 4 ounces). The recommended Americano portion is 6 ounces, which I prefer. The flavor is dark and rich and really wakes you up in the morning. It also develops a nice cream on top at the end of  ewing. Yummy!          5 5
