This tea is heaven in a cup! It's like drinking a warm, liquid cinnamon bun. When my local grocery stores (all of them!) stopped selling this variety of Bigelow tea about four years ago, I searched high and low for a replacement, to no avail. You can't just add cinnamon to regular black tea. Herbal cinnamon teas do not taste the same. Nothing else can compare to Bigelow's cinnamon stick tea. Then I found the tea online through Amazon, and I ordered three cases of six 20 count boxes. That's 360 bags of tea, enough for half a year if I ration myself to two cups a day, which is hard to do. You get the picture ... I'm crazy about this tea. Try it, you'll be glad you did.
