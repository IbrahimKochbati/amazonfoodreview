Here's the problem:  I love green tea and all the health benefits, but I can't deal with caffeine after about 3pm.  So what to do?          This tea does the trick!  It's really tasty, if a bit lacking in bite, and I'm confident it's quite good for me.  I'm now drinking this instead of my multiple glasses of water in the afternoon :)
