I've been a fan of Carbquik baking mix for sometime.  After a few experiments, it has become a staple in my kitchen. With that said, I wouldn't recommend paying this price for it  it's exhorbitant.  I found it much cheaper at netrition.  Until reviewers hold amazon vendors accountable for overpricing, they'll continue to do so.
