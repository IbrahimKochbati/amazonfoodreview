Use only strong decaf in the morning, but often like a flavored decaf in the evening.  Needs to stay robust as that's what my wife prefers.  Both the flavors in this decaf are subtle and do not mask the good coffee flavor.  This is probably the most robust flavored decaf we've found.  I'd recommend without hesitation as it was also a good value.
