The taste of raspberry is pretty much all I get out of this.  I do not taste nor smell chocolate! The raspberry is too overwhelming which ruins the coffee.  Now I have 2 boxes of this which I'll probably never finish.  I love coffee and hate the fact that this flavor destroys the coffee taste.. and completely leaves out the chocolate!
