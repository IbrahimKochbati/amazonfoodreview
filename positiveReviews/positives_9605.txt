Now that my daughter is 2, I really appreciate that the HappyTot pouches really seem to keep the toddler's needs in mind, by offering a good size portion pouch for them, great flavors and especially this one, is my daughter's favorite in the veggie options.  I tasted it too since the combo of Sweet Potato, Apple, Carrots really seemed like a "Thanksgiving" meal to me and wow, it was! It's like eating a pureed version of the Thanksgiving Meal side dish!  I loved this side dish with my Turkey so it's so funny that my daughter does too.  Chock full of Vitamin A, being organic and all veggies and fruits, it's a great snack for her and meal supplement to her other foods.  The portability is perfect and that extra dash of cinnamon, makes me have a great respect for the company which shows how they really want the product to be tasty while maintaining the healthy offerings too!
