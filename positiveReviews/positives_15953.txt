I looked everywhere for this when I heard this flavor was coming out.  I get the peppermint mochas at Starbucks during the holidays so I was very excited when I got the Tassimo email that this flavor was available for the holidays.  Of course when I went to buy it, the Tassimo site had these on backorder and even Amazon.com didn't have them available.  I finally found some at my local Bed, Bath, & Beyond and bought every package they had (only 3).  These are sooo delicious and I plan to look for more so I can stock up and have them even after the holidays are over.  This can be made with other variations as well.  I made it as a mocha with the chocolate and espresso discs but then also added a milk disc to it.  It was delicious and more of a latte with the chocolate peppermint flavor.  I used it as a hot chocolate for my kids by leaving out the espresso disc and only using the chocolate peppermint one included in this package and a milk disc from a different package I had.  It was so good and the kids loved it.  If you like the peppermint mochas at Starbucks, then get this limited edition set. This is one of my favorites now and I wish they offered it year round.
