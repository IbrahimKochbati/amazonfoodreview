I thought this would be a easy way to get a quick dinner for the baby & for babies used to eating processed food this may work but my granddaughter will not eat more than 2 3 bites before she turns up her nose and shakes her head no.  I have found it much easier to just cook her small amount of veggies and cut up cooked chicken that she can finger feed herself and she is much happier.
