These crackers are made from whole flax seeds so they aren't like your usual chip or cracker.  Some people I've shared them with don't care for them at all, but some loved them.  I am on a raw food diet, and I use them as chips to eat with guacamole or or other raw dips.  Raw meals sometimes take a lot of advance preparation and when you're really hungry, these will fill you up fast!  Just make sure you drink a lot of water and don't eat too many at once.  I personally liked all the flavors.  The onion was just a bit strong for some, but I thought it was ok.  Will definitely be buying again.
