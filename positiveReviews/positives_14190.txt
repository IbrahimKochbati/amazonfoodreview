I am a devoted coffee drinker, but I was served this unusual tea at a spa and instantly became a fan.  If you don't like licorice, please still try it.  Most people including myself don't identify it as having licorice flavor, just a very soothing peppermint tea with a hint of mysterious sweetness.  Try it!
