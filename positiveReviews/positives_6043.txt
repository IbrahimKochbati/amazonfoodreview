I pass around favorable endorsements very seldom but this is one of those occasions.          I'm almost 69 and this bacon would be as almost identical to the bacon I ate if it were a bit saltier and had the rind left on.          If you want the old time southern bacon without all the salt and the rind, this is it.          I'll admit I do salt the bacon just a tad before I fry it.          This is good stuff if you appreciate great bacon.
