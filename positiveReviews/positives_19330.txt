For organic mac 'n cheese, this is the best so far.  Could be a bit cheesier or flavorful though.  Package size is perfect for this family of four (2 adults, 2 teen boys) and I make it as a side dish with a meat and usually  occoli, which complements it well.  To perk it up, I sometimes cook as directed then bake in over with a little shredded cheese and  ead crumbs on top.  Yum.
