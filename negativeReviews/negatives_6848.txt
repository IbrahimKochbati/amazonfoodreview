I ordered the Deluxe 6oz Red Popcorn Maker Machine by Paramount Entertainment and as an accompaniment I also ordered the Great Northern Popcorn, 6 Ounce Portion Packs (24 pack). The popcorn maker I like very much but the Great Northern Popcorn is terrible. The flavor isn't all that bad but only 2 ounces of the 6 oz package pop. With one pack, I thought I would give extra time but the unpopped kernels just burned, they never popped. The package itself is hard to use and I needed to cut it apart with a scissor before I could use it. Also, and this is the worst, one 6oz package has 900 calories. I usually eat popcorn as a low calorie treat but not this stuff. One person will end up eating the amount that pops and with the calories being in the grease package, all of the grease calories are put on the 2oz that pop. The last few packages I popped, I fed it to my dogs (which usually love popcorn). They had a few bites than left it alone. My solution   off the shelf popcorn with 3oz of canola oil and some sea salt   Â¼ the calories, 90% kernel pop and much better flavor.
