If you order more than one of these Equal sweetener tablet dispensers, BE AWARE that while they are all shipped in a single package with negligible weight [** even   10   of these dispensers would not weigh more than a half pound, if even that!], you will be charged $1.99 shipping and handling for EACH DISPENSER in your multiple dispenser order! I wrote to the seller about this matter and through Amazon but I did not receive a response from the seller. In my case, I ordered 6 Equal dispensers which amounts to $17.34 but then I was charged $11.94 for shipping [$1.99 for 'each' dispenser] even though they were shipped together in a single package with very negligible package weight. I asked the seller to perhaps consider [no matter who orders the product] a more reasonable [read: equitable] shipping and handling charge based on the actual weight of the package and the fact that the multiple item order is shipped in one single package, but as I said, and to date, I received no response from the seller.          So too, various of these dispensers have tablet jamming problems and you've got to often bang on the thing to get the small tablet out in one piece. Further, it's difficult to find these tablet dispensers in supermarkets, the why of which escapes me, but when they first came out, the dispenser had a small lid on the bottom and the tablets came out intact and freely but when the Equal folks moved to the newer tablet 'click' dispensers, the tablet jamming became a problem and this 'may' account for the Equal folks going with the sweetener 'granule' or sweetener 'powder' packets for their sweetener vs the hard tablet dispensers.          I think charging $1.99 for 'each' dispenser but which is shipped in a 'single' package borders on shipping and handling fee inequity. In the future, I'll simply order the dispensers one by one and 'then' I can at least justify the seller shipping and handling charge even though I'll wind up paying the same but it would then have to be sent in multiple packages! I think the seller would do much better in 'adjusting' the shipping fee for multiple item orders that they mail out in one package and based on true mailing weight considerations.          Doc Tony
