My husband I both like a mild tasting coffee.  We thought we would give Wolfgang Puck Breakfast in Bed a try.  We were pleasantly surprised by the full bodied taste but without the bitterness of some of the stronger tasting coffee's.  We are very satisfied and will be drinking this for a long time!  Now if I can only get my husband to take the name literally!
