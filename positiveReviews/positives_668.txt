I'm happy with the quality of the product and the price. Like the other reviewer, I would prefer if there was a plastic liner to preserve freshness. However, I will continue to buy this product regardless as it is quality oatmeal at a good price.          Edit: I'm on my 4th bag, quality continues to be high.
