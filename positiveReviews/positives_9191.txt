I ordered this product because i love pasta but need to start modifying my diet because i want to start fighting competitively again and need to get myself back to peak performance. I was skeptical from all the talk of "fishy smell and taste". Thus being the reason i ordered the single pack. I prepared them as instructed and prepared them into a soup. I used chicken  easts cut into strips, boiled them into a  oth with sliced carrots, green onions, and  occoli, and then poured it into the bowl over the noodles. Me and my girlfriend tried it and it turned out great. She put some soy sauce in hers because she liked it better that way, but we both loved it. It did not have the fish smell after rinsing, nor while eating it. The texture is comparable to the rice noodles you find in Vietnamese and Japanese dishes. I am a convert to miracle noodle. I fed two people off of one pack, not bad i say. Also noticed the difference in the curving of my snack urges(didn't even touch my yogurt, orange, or nature valley peanut butter bar until near the end of my shift at work), and could wait longer before i took my lunch at work. I work 10 hour night shifts, so that's why i ate this before work. These are a great tool into any nutrition plan in my book.
