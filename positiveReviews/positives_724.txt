From 6 month to 12 month, my son barely ate any solid food.  He was so picky.  We tried many different flavor from various  ands and this was the only baby food that he'd actually finish the whole jar.  I didn't expect him to like this since it has very green vegetable scent to it, but I guessed it wrong.     Now he is 18 month old and he is a pretty healthy eater.  His current favorite seems to be tofu, but he still loves corn, zucchini,  own rice and carrot which are the ingredients of this.  I highly recommend to try this baby food.          Also, Earth's Best makes not only the best baby foods but their toddler foods are fabulous as well.  My son doesn't really like any snacks from Gerber  and, but he likes most of the products from Earth's Best.  Their foods taste great(even for us adult) and so good for you too.
