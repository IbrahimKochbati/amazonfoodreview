I understand that a lungo is a long espresso. This is also touted as being an "Americano" by running more water through it. I guess a purist may not agree with that, but then again a purist probably isn't using this machine. I like it most days, Americano style...it is a nice morning cup of coffee...nice frothy top and good flavor. It does sort of remind you of watered down strong coffee (rather than a milder blend) and some days that is the reason I don't like it, but different people have different tastes. So I also have a Keurig, but like the foamy ness of this Lungo, none of my Keurig k cups get a froth. This and the Chococino are the ones I choose most often...I am not into the milky ones.
