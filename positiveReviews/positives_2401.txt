Since I started making Hodgson Wholesome Potato  ead, my husband will not eat store bought  ead anymore!  We make about two loaves a week, in different varieties of the Hodgson Mill  and.  The honey whole wheat and white  ead mixes are also great.     I like using my old  ead machine to make the dough, then shape into loaf and bake in the oven.  Makes perfect loaf every time, also makes delicious rolls.     Glad I discovered this  and of  ead mixes on Amazon  they are wholesome, and I know what I'm putting into the  ead I bake now.  Great product!
