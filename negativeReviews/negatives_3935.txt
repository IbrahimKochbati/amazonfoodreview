The initial taste does hint of something, but then the apple and grape juice filler comes to fore and dominates the after  taste.  Comparing this to the Black Cherry drink, Kiwi Berry has a better taste and after taste.  However, if you would have told me that this was the Black Cherry flavor, I would have thought that to be true.  I could not note any significant difference between flavors.  The carbonation offers no benefit in the taste or feel category.  The price is high   about $1 per 8 oz can.  If I want juice, I'll stick with real juice without the carbonation.
