This cup o noodles knock off is fine tasting. It is not as aggressively hot as some Korean foods. I would call it mild to medium minus in the spiciness arena. It has instructions for both microwave and "Add boiling water" methods of preparation. The one reason I would take off a star is that the picture on the top implies wholesome chunks of chicken and veggies. What you get are noodles that look like the noodles. Broth looks similar, too. The meat and veggie particles are tiny, 6mm chunks. You really won't have to sharpen the teeth for this stuff because the meat is so small.          I am sure that there is some fine print saying it's a serving suggestion and you should add your chunks of meat and vegetables, but given that, they should have just not attempted to put the tiny freeze dried pellets in there. One of those things that highlights the issue.
