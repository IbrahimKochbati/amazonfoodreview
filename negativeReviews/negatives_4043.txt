I was looking for a non peanut mixed nut that was pre packaged in a small quantity for taking to work as part of lunch or for a snack.     Overall, this met the criteria, but there were problems because they used walnuts. Walnuts are less stable and go rancid faster than other nuts typically used in "mixed nuts". So, after the first few encounters with bad walnuts, I just began avoiding the walnuts. The mix would work better with pecans instead of walnuts. They hold up better.     I'm not likely to buy this again
