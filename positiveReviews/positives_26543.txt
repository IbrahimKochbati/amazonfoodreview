Caribou Coffee is one of my favorites in spite of the fact I have to order the regular type online since we don't have any where I live. I ran into these K cups at Target and thought I'd give them a go.          I have occasion to offer people coffee in my office and the K cup Keurig  ewer is perfect for this as it makes just that cup for that person and it's fresh. Without exception everyone I served this too has loved it and asked for the name to purchase for themselves. It is full flavored but not dark and it has a very smooth taste with no bitterness (this is important to me..I find many K cups to have a bitter aftertaste that affects the aroma of the coffee as well). A normal adding of cream and sugar works fine as well   you don't need more or less than your usual (again helpful when you are making it for clients and such).          This is THE favorite for my office and one we will continue to purchase. Enjoy!
