I had never heard of coconut sugar and expected an overly sweet taste. I was pleasantly surprised by the natural sweetness of this sugar. It was not powdery and over sweet like most sugar alternatives. I enjoy baking with my kids and I feel slightly less guilty using this sweetener. It is easy to substitute 1:1 for regular sugar. I started using a teaspoon or two in our  eakfast smoothies (which are made with unsweetened protein powder, fruit and unsweetened rice or almond milk) and suddenly the kids were asking for seconds. I also like it in my tea and coffee!
