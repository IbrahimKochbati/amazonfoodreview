I've been feeding this to my dog for months and I have just realized his stool has been pretty runny the whole time, today he had diarrhea again, probably the second or third time during that period.  I came online to see if others have been having the same problem as me, and sure enough the answer is yes.  I'm done with this dog food, I'd suggest you do the same, it's just not right.
