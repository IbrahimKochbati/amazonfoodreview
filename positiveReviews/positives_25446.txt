I've purchased several juice flavors from this  and, organic and non organic and have not been disappointed. I bought the organic version at harris teeter which is a grocery store chain for four ninety nine. The juice is not real sweet, almost like eating a mouthful of pitted bing cherries without having to chew. I also add it to a lot of things for flavor and color swirls, namely Oetker's organic vanilla pudding, yellow cake mix, white frosting, pancake mix, and lemon poppy seed muffins. Thus far Amazon has the best prices on Oetker products for my area. This juice is also very good to freeze as popsicles. I've thought about making a sorbet, but haven't yet.
