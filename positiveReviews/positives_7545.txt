I couldn't wait to get my package of these little seeds because of the health benefit they provide and plus I am trying to lose some weight. I've only tried them once but they made a lovely pudding.     1 2 cup coconut milk     2 tsbp chia seeds     1 tablespoon of cocoa powder (i used amazing grass chocolate powder 'cause it's all I had)     1 tablespoon cinnamon     1 tablespoon honey          mix well in a container or small bowl, making sure to incorporate the cocoa powder.     Cover and place on a counter for about 30 minutes, stirring a few times.          It will turn into a wonderful gelatin esque yummy dessert!
