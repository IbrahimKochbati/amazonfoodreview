My husband and I were excited to try them. We bought pineapple, beer, lemon, lime, hot peppers, cheese and wine. The only thing we noticed any difference in was the lemon and lime. The lemon was pretty easy to eat because it added some sweetness   it remained quite sour though. We each let one tablet dissolve on our tongue as directed so not sure what the problem was.
