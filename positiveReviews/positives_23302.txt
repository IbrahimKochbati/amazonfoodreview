Having only recently discovered my gluten intolerance, my experience with GF products is limited...BUT, one thing for sure, the  ead substitutes in the freezer departments of most grocery stores don't do much for the taste buds.  In fact,  the whole experience can be compared to trying to chew sawdust. (No, I haven't tried Udi's at Whole Foods.)          With that in mind, and after reading the reviews, I decided to try another option  and bought the Pamela's GF Bread and Pizza Mix.  What a difference.  Yes, is is a bit spongy, but that's not an issue with me. What is important to me is it has texture and flavor. I made it my  ead machine on the dough setting and baked it in the oven following the package directions for oven baking.  It got very  own at 60 minutes (rather than the 70 the package suggests) so I took it out. Let it cool (almost) and when I tried it   WOW what a difference.          As I said, I'm new at this but, I recommend it over ready made.  Next step will be to try and make my own from scratch   but, I'm not quite there yet.
