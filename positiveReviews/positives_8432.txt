My 4 month old female lab shep hound mix loves these.  She likes to fling them around like a cat and they keep her busy for a good ten minutes.  They are also a bit chewier than other treats so she takes her time finishing them and considers them an ultimate reward when she does something good.  They can be hard to find in stores but are readily available on Amazon.
