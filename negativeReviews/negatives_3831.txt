If you are really thirsty this drink will be a welcomed choice, although almost anything would at that point.  However, I did not like this flavor as much as the Switch watermelon strawberry flavor which I found extremely refreshing.          The Kiwi Berry is also 100% juice. Although the drink is good, it has a strong syrupy berry flavor which reminded me a little bit of the Robitussin cough syrup I dislike. I also didn't taste any kiwi.          At 135 calories for an 8.3 fluid ounce can you might want to drink it sparingly.
