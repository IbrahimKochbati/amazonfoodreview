I love Virginia peanuts and these are among the best I've ever had. They are nice and crunchy with just the right amount of salt. I eat a handful of them a day as a treat and would highly recommend them, especially, to any sports fan as the 40oz size gives you plenty to pass around to your friends and family while watching your favorite team.
