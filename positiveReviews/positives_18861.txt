My dog Denali loves the Ziwi Peak food.  It is all meat and we supplement with a little people food and snacks but there is no filler and no byproducts and she eats less volume.          It was not available in this area, even though the local specialty store Paw Prince gave us samples and carries the snacks made by Ziwi Peak.          I will continue to purchase this product from Amazon.
