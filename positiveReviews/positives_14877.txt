This product from Ye Olde England is simply the best condiment for accompanying lamb roasts. It has a very delicious upfront mint tang as opposed to those icky sweet plain mint and apple mint jellies most of us are accustomed to having with our lamb. Forget those mostly corn syrup and "mint flavored" concoctions and opt for this traditional English condiment. As I said it is tangy and sweet all in one. Mostly because it is just mint leaves ground into a delicious paste and some vinegar and sugar added for just the right combination of flavor. A perfect addition to the mildest to gamier cuts of lamb. Try it, and enjoy it!
