I am so glad I tried this premium dog food at a great price for a small (but not too small) bag to try it. My dog loves it and I feel better about giving her something healthy. Next I will try the canned food. I do wish these companies would offer 6 can deals however instead of just 12 and 24 can deals for "taste testing". Not every dog likes a drastic change from junk foods to higher quality food. Meanwhile, no more Purina ever!
