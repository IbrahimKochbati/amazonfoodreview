I bought this tea because it is supposed to have clinical proof that it lowers blood pressure.  I didn't realize that it would be so delicious!  It has a very fruity and tart taste, very similar to cranberry juice, without all the sugar.  Of course, you can add sugar if you like it less tart. I have found that it is best ice cold, although it is drinkable hot too.  The most amazing thing about this purchase is how huge the bag is. You can't really see that from the listing picture. It weighs a solid pound and is almost a foot tall.  SO much tea for the money, this is the best value for hibiscus tea that I have found.  Get it!
