there is very little taste, from the herring or the lemon...but there is a hot pepper kick. the fish meat is whitish, soft and flaky. it is not firm nor does it have the fish flavor as in the other kipper product we bought.          it just seems that they used whatever was left over , the  oken and the flakes....added some lemon and pepper to make it have an appeal to a buyer. a good way to use otherwise less valuable parts of the fish?          this will not be re ordered by us.          we buy a LOT of such fish product at amazon and rate each one, this gets our lowest rating.
