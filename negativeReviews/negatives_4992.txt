I have two boxers, male and female. After about 30 minutes of the expected use, the male grabbed the end of the rope, shook and shattered the plastic threaded bottom right off the bottle against the corner of a door frame.          Concept is intriguing for the dogs but the plastic is too  ittle. They didn't have the toy long enough to get to chewing on the rubber ball at the end.
