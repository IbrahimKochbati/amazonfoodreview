Worst tasting macadamia nuts ever because they arrived rancid. You feel sick after eating a few. This should not get even one star, it is rancid, meaning it is poison. Can't believe Amazon would sell rancid food and then not allow a way for it to be returned for refund. I will be thinking twice before I order any other food item through Amazon. I don't trust Amazon as much any more.
