Although its always nice to find gluten free products available to those who suffer from Celiac Disease, its also troubling to find many of these products also are high in sugar. I found this to be extremely too sweet for my taste. If I purchase something that is chocolate I want to taste chocolate not be overwhelmed by sugar.Rice flour in itself is high glycemic and with the added sugar this product made me feel ill from the sugar content. I have been baking for years the old fashioned way with whole wheat but after developing Celiac I no longer could consume it. I learned later from a nutritionist that sugar was also a problem for people who have Celiac. Through trial and error I found this to be so true. Can't the makers of these mixes back off on the sugar? I removed the chips as well as they were too sweet. Other than that its okay for a rice flour mix cause we all know rice does not compare to whole wheat.
