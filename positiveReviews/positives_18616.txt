I've been buying this cereal from Amazon for quite a while now but in the 24 oz. size..4 boxes to the carton.  If you're counting pennies this size is the better value.  Little more cumbersome to deal with but worth the savings.  I love the Subscribe and Save.  Don't have to worry about running out or taking the extra time each month to place an order.  Amazon takes the work out of shopping for my favorite cereal and saves me a bundle too.  By the way, if you've got IBS with constipation this cereal plus Activa once a day REALLY makes a big difference.
