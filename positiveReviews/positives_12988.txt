I was hesitant to buy a larger bottle at first because I had read some reviews regarding a clear bottle and a decrease in quality from OliveNation, so I bought the smallest container to try it out. I encourage you to ignore the previous review about there being alcohol in the extract: all extracts are suspended in alcohol  normally an pure fruit oil and alcohol mixture.          Anyways, the extracts were well packaged and shipped quickly. I was pleased to find that the 4 oz container is tinted glass and the aroma is superb. I have used the extract in various baked goods and it provides a lovely hint of lemon.          The only con about this item is that it is very subtle. I need to add what seems to me to be a lot of extract to get the dominate lemon flavor in things like lemon poppy seed muffins.          I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who is in short supply of fresh lemon juice. This makes an excellent substitution.
