I have been so called a hazelnut coffee freak for about 10 years and I have to say that I finaly found the match to the hazelnut coffee my father in law offered me whenever I was over visiting. He has passed away so I can not say if it was from Coffee Bean Direct. But darn it. It sure taste just like what he  ewed up. Thanks you for the good cup of coffee and at a reasonable price. I got this page book marked for later orders. TLA
