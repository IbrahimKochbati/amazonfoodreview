I have long been very fond of Kellogg's Oatmeal Crisp With Almonds cereal, but in recent months it has vanished from all the stores in my area (San Francisco Peninsula).          It was a big surprise when I found Kellogg's Oatmeal Crisp listed on Amazon.com, so I ordered six boxes of this product, and they arrived in just a few days.  Now I have all of this cereal I want without needing to search in remote stores to find them also out of it. NEAT !!!  This has been a really great service.
