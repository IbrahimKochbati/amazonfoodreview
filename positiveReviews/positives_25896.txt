My Beagle has been a vegetarian for almost two years now.  We feed him this product, Pet Guard Vegetarian Feast canned and their vegetarian dry.  He has never been healthier and his coat has never been softer.  Now he can be cruelty free with us. Don't EVER let ANYONE tell you your dog can't be a vegetarian!
