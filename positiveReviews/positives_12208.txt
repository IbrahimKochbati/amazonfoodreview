I had tried many of the K Cup coffee varities, but settled on the Green Mountain Nantucket Blend as the one I enjoy the best.  Here, it is hard to find it in the stores and I had no idea Amazon would carry this item?  The 50 count is perfect.  And I see one can have it sent on a scheduled time.  Wonderful idea.
