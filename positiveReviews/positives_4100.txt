The best thing I like about this sports drink, is it's not an energy drink. Low calories (15) and less caffeine then 8 ounces of coffee.          Plethora of natural anti inflammatory ingredients, which mitigates aches and pains. And it's not necessary to take over the counter Acetaminophen when you have this.          When I first had some, I felt different. Not a amp different, rushed. Just different; scared me a bit. 3 days later I tried it again. The feel different was the pain level going from the constant 8 9 to a 6 (which is manageable for me). The feel difference, was me feeling better.          This is giving me the 4 5 year window I need before I have to get my neck and spine fused (again).          At our house now, we have at least 3 cases and this month, it is 4.
