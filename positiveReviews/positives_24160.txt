I love izze sparkling soda, they are so tasty and refreashing.  This one does not really have a blueberry taste but that is a hard flavor to mimic so for the flavor that this soda did taste like it was very nice.  It taste alot like the blackberry only more tart, I like it but pomegranate is my favorite so far from the flavores that I have tried.
