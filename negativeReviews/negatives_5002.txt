This toy is great for keeping a dog entertained, but not very sturdy. Granted I have 2 huskies who can destroy anything anyways, but...I have tried the KONG  and and never had a problem. Other toys as well. This one didn't last 30 minutes in their presence though.          It is a good idea for smaller dogs.
