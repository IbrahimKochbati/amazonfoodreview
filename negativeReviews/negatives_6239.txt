My first can of Happybellies oatmeal was cream colored and odorless, my second can was greenish  own and smelled rancid (I immediately threw it out), and the third can was also greenish  own in color but smelled a little less rancid.  Serious quality issues considering the high price and  and image.  I don't recommend this oatmeal until they acknowledge and resolve this issue.
