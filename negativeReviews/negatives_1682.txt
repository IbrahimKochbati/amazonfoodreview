I will start by being kind, It is a good idea to save money with an item or concept like this. It makes good sense to use your own coffee beans and avoid the cost of the pre filled commercial K cups you buy at the store.          Now, I received my DisposaKups over a month after ordering them and put them to use.  I was immediately disappointed, filters did not hold very much coffee, It was a struggle to get the lids to fit together with the filter and outer plastic cup.  The coffee was very weak.          This product actually creates more waste in a landfill than the commercially made K cups. The body and lids are plastic.  Normal K cups do not have a plastic lid.  Notice they say 100% disposable....So put them in the trash. They are not recyclable   landfill.          They are not convenient, they are a bit messy, a pain to put together and still expensive.  Not worth it! There are better alternatives out there that will save you money, make better coffee and not go into a landfill.          Sorry, I wish I had better news, I think I will return these.
