I really like the pop chips, but I do not like all the flavors. The only ones I like are the originals.  The rest of these flavors were really not good.  At least not in my family.  I gave them away to a senior center and most of the seniors didnt like them.  Sorry but it is a matter of taste and most things should stick to the originals, they are the best.          This snack (originals) fits into my daily ww program for allot less money then snacks made for the programs specifically.          I will continue to buy the originals and leave the others to others.
