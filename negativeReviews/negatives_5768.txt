I bought a case of Merrick Surf & Turf with high hopes for my clutter of nine cats.  Alas, the hype didn't live up to the reality.  The product is essentially a wasted purchase, as virtually none of the cats will touch the stuff.  I'll be donating the rest of the case to my local animal shelter for their pet food pantry.          The ingredient list drew me to the product, being grain free, and offering a nice mix of meat and seafood, plus lots of complex carbohydrates for filler.  Upon opening the can, it was clear that the beef and beef fat content was pretty high, with little seafood scent detectable.  It came out of the can in big globs that were sticky to try to mush down for my gang.  Have tried two feedings for my gang with this stuff, and they just can't be convinced that it's both tasty and good for them.          I realize that different cats have different sets of taste buds and some cats will eat anything, but when none of my nine will touch the stuff, I can't recommend it to anyone with an even semi finicky cat, as a number of my gang will eat most anything, and to find them turning up their noses at this somewhat pricey stuff is kinda eye popping.  If you're cat is very picky, but you know s he likes beef, then this flavor will probably appeal to him her, but otherwise, I wouldn't spend your hard earned moolah on this stuff.  Save your money and your frustration.          I give it two stars simply because of its relatively healthy ingredient list; I'd otherwise give it only one star.
