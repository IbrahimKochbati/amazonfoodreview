I'm another one who bailed on this product when they stupidly changed the formula, and now I'm back to my addicted status.  The price on these, when you use super saving shipping, is a little less than local stores.  My Walmart just kicked it up by about 60 cents per can.          I wish I knew why I liked this stuff so much!  It's just...unique.
