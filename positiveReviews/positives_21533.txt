The Maple and Brown sugar flavor is very nice. Here are the nutrition contents for a single 43g packet:     Total Fat: 2g (1g mono unsaturated)     Sodium: 260mg     Total carbs: 32g (3g dietary fiber, 12g sugar)     Protein: 4g          There's 12g of Sugar in each packet, so I tend to not add anything but water and it's good enough for me.     Overall I would recommend trying it out.
