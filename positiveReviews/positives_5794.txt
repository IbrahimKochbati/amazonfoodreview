I have eaten in various restaurants operated by Wolfgang Puck and have always found the food to be delicious.  This soup is no exception.  The only problem is that it is exceedingly high in sodium, fat, cholesterol and calories in general. Per servings totals are 200 calories, total fat 11g, saturated fat 8g, cholesterol 30 mg, sodium 540 mg! This sodium total is 22% of what you should get for the whole day!  By comparison, Campbell's Chicken with Rice soup has 70 calories, total fat 1.5g, saturated fat .5g, cholesterol 5 mg, sodium 820 mg.  Almost double the sodium (salt) but much healthier in every other category.  The bottom line is, if you want healthy soup, make it yourself.
