I have 15 documented food allergies and it is very difficult to find decent goodies.  These are the best allergy friendly cookies I have tasted yet!  I tried them for the first time today.  I needed to use up a Starbucks gift certificate and found these cookies in a basket in the front of the store.  Boy was I pleased when I discovered they were as good as any cookie made with wheat and eggs. Not the bland, dry, grainy taste of most GF cookies. Also the price is much better than many of the other allergy friendly products I have tried.  You will not be disapointed in these.
