I am a bit of a foodie and have become quite picky over the years.  I have to say, hands down, this is my favorite olive oil.  It's affordable and non pretentious.  Amazing flavor.  I use a lot of olive oil in cooking and this is great for that and just by itself to drag a piece of crusty  ead through or to drizzle over caprese.  I definitely recommend this to anyone looking and unsure of what to buy.. because who knows?  But this one is a keeper and a must try!
