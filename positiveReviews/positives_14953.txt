For those of us who have nut and peanut sensitivities, we are always looking for some tasty spread, and this pumpkin seed butter fits that bill.  The green color might put you off, but don't let it!  It tastes wonderful, slightly salty and very flavorful.  I spread it on organic  own rice cakes, sprinkle a bit of cinnamon on top with a few raisins and some raw sunflower seeds   tastes awesome...!!!  What a wonderful snack or desert and high in protein and very nutritious...  :)
