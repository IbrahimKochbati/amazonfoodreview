I had tried to use grocery store oil and popcorn in my countertop popper but it always tasted stale and not a bit like movie theater popcorn.  Decided to try this for a party and it made a world of difference.  Tasted just like fresh popped corn at the theater.  The packs were easy to use.  Just cut across the top and dump all 3 packets into the heated popper.  I will definitely buy again.
