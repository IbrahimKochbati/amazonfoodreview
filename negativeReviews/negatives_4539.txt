My baby does not like this kind. I do not like it either, it tastes sour. The taste of tomato is too strong. Tomato has lycopene, a antioxidant for good health, but my son just won't eat. He like other happy baby productx like spinah, mango and pear, blue berries, banana and beet and  occoli, pear and peas. This one needs seasoning or I will not eat it either.
