I looked into how to duplicate how they make Chai's at the coffee shops, and I had no clue how to do that.  I found Oregon Chai mix at a local grcoery (then later I found a cheaper bulk 3 box pack at a grocery warehouse store), and I tried it. It can't be compared to a professionally made Chai (at least the way I make it), but it totally satisfies my requirement to be able to make it at home anytime I want.          Bear in mind, I use Rice Dream instead of real milk, but it still qualifies as something that I can call a decent Chai drink conveniently made at home.  Extremely easy to make: you use 50% of this mixture and 50% of whatever kind of milk you use. And heat it up.
