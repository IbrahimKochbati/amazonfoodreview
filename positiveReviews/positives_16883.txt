I bought this toy a year ago for my Golden girl who would wolf down her food and forget that she had eaten. I saw this in a store and was hesitant that she would 'get it', but after a few tries and showing her where the food came out she mastered it. When she's hungry she'll  ing it to me and place it at my feet. It takes her a lot longer to eat and she's content and happy while doing it now. I've since bought her the round version of this because she's mastered Tug A Jug.
