Pleasant mixture of fruit tastes and the level of carbonation is refreshing.          However, I found  particularly in the initial tastes   the drink to be too sweet. You may well enjoy it, though, since I prefer carbonated fruit drinks more on the citrus sour end.          The over sweetness isn't accomplished with added sugar, or non sugar additives; the sweetness comes from the apple and grape juice concentrates, which are the top two non water ingredients.
