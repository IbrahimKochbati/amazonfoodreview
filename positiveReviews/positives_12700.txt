I originally found the peach ginger tea at the grocery store, of all places, it said it was a close out and was going for $2.50 box!!!! I was so excited to see the nylon see thru bags, how elegant and special, and the tea was as great as the presentation! A wonderful taste of peach, no funky aftertaste, and even when you smell the whole leaves in the bag, it smells like peach.     Try it, you'll be amazed by this tea like I am.
