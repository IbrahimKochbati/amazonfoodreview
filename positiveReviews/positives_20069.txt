I have been very interested in Starbucks Via instant coffee line, and it made me take a new look at Taster's Choice. I was pleasantly surprised by the good taste.          I am a coffee fan that is often on the go, and I am going to use Taster's Choice to keep in my  iefcase and car.          Give it a try, and you'll enjoy Taster's Choice. Via costs $10 for 12 servings with only a slightly better taste. I would rather pay a tenth of the price and have the convenient tubes of Taster's Choice.          Frugal is in and so are Taster's Choice Single Sticks.
