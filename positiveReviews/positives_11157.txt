We got some of these in a sampler pack and really enjoyed them.  These are not the "extra bold" that have the 25% more grounds so you can make the larger (11 oz) cup, but it holds up nicely on the 9oz setting on my  ewer.  Body is deep, good aroma with some bitterness that you would expect from a French Roast blend.  The Keurig review mentions that it uses a minimum of 50% rainforest alliance beans.          This is not a flavored coffee, just a nice blend, so don't expect chicory coffee : )  Now that Amazon sells them, we will put this into our rotation.
