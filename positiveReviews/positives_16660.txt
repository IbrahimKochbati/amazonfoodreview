This was an Excellent value of buying on Amazon versus the pet stores.     It was packaged and labeled well for shipment.          However   the manufacturer's plastic top of the box itself is a little cheap and less functional than I expected.  Frankly, the whole top has to come off each time I want to give my dog a single chew.          So   I'm actually putting these chews into a Dog treat jar that has a open and close top with a tab.          The manufacturer could simply change the bulk packaging to a bag.  Frankly, a Ziploc bag would be just as functional (and probably have a lower manufacturing cost) than the box.
