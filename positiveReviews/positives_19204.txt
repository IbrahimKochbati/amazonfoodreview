My border collie loves it. She figured out to lift the cups, but she needs to be supervised or she would chew them. My wolfhoud mix couldn't use this puzzle because his nose is too big. The cups are too small for him to get a grip on with either his mouth or paws. For a normal size dog, up to about 75 pounds, this is a great toy.
