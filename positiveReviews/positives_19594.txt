I bought this for my feline friend, Princess Pia. Actually I am taking liberties in calling her my friend.  I'm really her servant.  She loves it, and recommends it to all minions who work for cats.  Who am I to argue with her seal of approval?          It's good stuff, according to her, and she reminds me that she has exquisite taste in catnip, among other things.  Your cats will probably love it, too.
