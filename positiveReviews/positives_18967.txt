Overall good It has a creamy green tint to it, The first bit i was thinking "i need salt" but i ate it all and NOW feeling satisified! For it being organic & salt free i am suprised how yummy it really was. I would suggest this soup to anyone. And will eat it over & over again! True it MIGHT not have a lot of chicken, but the tiny 5 pieces it did have were good. I liked it like that.
