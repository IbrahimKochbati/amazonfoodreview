This is the second bag of coffee I have purchased from Coffee Bean Direct and they get a 100% approval rating from me! The prices really are great, and with the Amazon Prime shipping  the overall price truly can't be beaten. I love french roasted coffee  and this does not disappoint. If you do not like the smokey taste, then simply, do not buy any coffee that has the term "french roast" on the package!          I didn't know what to expect from a Papua New Guinean coffee, and I was pleasantly surprised. It has a smokey, chocolate cream taste. If it were a wine, it would be a Pinotage!          Coffee Bean Direct roasts their beans fresh to order. When I purchased the first 5 pounder in Fe uary ('11) of the Brazilian French Roast, it had a roasting date of a few weeks earlier in January. On this package that I ordered in June, it also had the roasting date of January. So, it appears that Amazon is selling a large shipment they acquired from them months ago  be informed of that possibility.          I have seen many people concerned about the five pounds not staying fresh once opened. Whatever you do  DO NOT REFRIGERATE OR FREEZE  that is some sort of urban legend myth (lol) and actually speeds up the stale taste!  This is an easy fix!  Do what all coffee distributors do: store in a vacuum sealed foil package. How? For the five pound bag, you will need about 10 gallon sized VACUUM food storage bags (found in supermarket) and basic aluminum foil (also in supermarket.)          1)Rip off one sheet of aluminum foil about 12 16 inches long     2)Lay foil flat on counter     3)Gently pour, roughly, 1 2 pound of coffee beans into the center of the foil sheet     4)Fold both of the width side edges neatly over the center of the beans     5)Fold the length side edges neatly over the top and towards the center (much like sloppily wrapping a rectangular present)     6)Place this foil package in the vacuum food storage bag  making sure that longer portion of the foil package is put in the bag parallel to the seal of the bag, which would leave much empty space between the foil package and the top of the bag.     7)Seal the bag, then vacuum seal the bag by using the hand pump (can be purchased with the vacuum bags)     8)Do this with the remaining coffee beans (leave the amount of beans in the bottom of the coffee bag that you will be using within the next few days)     9)Check each plastic bag, by using the pump again to make sure they are vacuum packed.     10) Place each bag neatly and carefully either in a box, or a canvas bag (or some sort of storage to keep light out)     11) Store in a room temperature closet (about 60 75 degrees F)  making sure the bags will not be moved around too much or dropped as the vacuum seal could  eak.     12) Check the vacuum seal periodically and re pump if necessary     13) This coffee will stay fresh for months this way!          May seem like a bit of work, and adds to the cost with the price of the vacuum food storage bags  but, it's worth it!
