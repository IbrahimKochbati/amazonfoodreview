Our friends from Germany visited with us a few weeks back, and one of them adores Manhattans. She had them here 15 years back, and when I no longer could find a bottled mix locally, I ordered it from the Internet. This is my first experience with Master of Mixes, and the Manhattans turned out great, just as good as if I had made them from scratch. A great product!
