I use this for my little guy every night in lieu of his bowl now.  I had to put a leather boot string in the yellow cups for easy removal, otherwise it was nearly impossible to lift off.  The dog needs positive reinforcement to the reward, so the string helped the learning curve and reinforcement. No hard or sharp corners....
