I love this tea. It has a mild flavor and no caffeine. The only problem is that the string comes detached from the bag after about a minute in hot water. This doesn't happen once in a while, it happens nearly every time.          Triple Leaf Tea, please fix this bag issue. It's frustrating to the point where I may look for a similar tea from another company.
