A lot of phobias about whole wheat pasta tasting horrible can be put to rest with this pasta. It has a nice smooth texture unlike other  ands that are reminiscent of tree bark.          On a diet? This pasta will FILL you up! You wont want to go back for seconds. I could easily eat twice as much white pasta.          The only reason your not buying this pasta is because it costs more. You are correct this pasta is 5x more expensive than good old white pasta. Here is a little hint: (buy in bulk) Thats what I did. Amazon has this pasta in cases of 12 that sell for 30% less than what my local mega mart charges.          Until I find another whole wheat pasta that is cheaper and tastes as good as this one. I will not buy any other  and.          Update May 2012     Still the best pasta. My local grocer finally dropped their prices on this product to a realistic level. Buying in bulk online is still cheaper, but just be mindful as prices fluctuate. I really wish they made more shapes in this pasta, like orzo or pastina.
