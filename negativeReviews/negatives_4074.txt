I bought this (herbal) tea for relief from (a couple months of)  eathing issues. Thinking that I may have asthma (I've never been diagnosed). At first it was grand, helping my cough, soothing to my throat and chest. Then surprisingly my stomach started to gurgle and I was frequenting the loo, stopped taking things were fine. Finally, last night I tried nettle (2 caps) and some ginger with honey added tea..ahh relief, sleep! Tonight I will try angelica root and see if that helps.
