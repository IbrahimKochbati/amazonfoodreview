We loved this coffee. The "K" containers they come in are AWFUL! Out of 14 boxes we have used 21 cups have leaked and spoiled the  ewed coffee. Tullys did send us a  box to replace the cups from our 1st order of 4 boxes from Amazon. 3 of those containers leaked. We tried 2 local food stores for 6 boxes at various times and the cups in those leaked also.We have stopped using Tullys, we are sad. :(          (the foil lids become detached from the container causing coffee grinds and water to leak out and into the coffee cup)
