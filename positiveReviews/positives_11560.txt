My grandfather owned a small bakeshop in Scotland and I remember that Nairns oatcakes were the most popular with his customers.     As a kid oatcakes did not appeal to me but I subsequently developed a taste for them and like most of my grandfather's customers found that Nairns were the preferred  and. They were fired a little longer than other manufacturers oatcakes producing a crispier bite.
