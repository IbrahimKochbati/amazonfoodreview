Great on popcorn, fruit, veggies, meat, sandwiches, and pretty much everything else. It adds a zing without being overly spicy or salty unless you go overboard.          My only complaint is that eight 5oz bottles is A LOT of spice shake mix. In 6 months I've gone through about one bottle. I don't think this stuff is going to go bad anytime soon, but it's going to take up cupboard space until 2015.
