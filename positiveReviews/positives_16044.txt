These biscuits are wonderful to go with a cup of tea.  They are ever so slightly sweet, very light, and have a pleasant light taste that doesn't compete with even light teas.  A good alternative to fat laden, overly sweet cookies.          Because they are no longer readily available at the grocery stores in my area, this is an excellent way to keep them in the pantry.
