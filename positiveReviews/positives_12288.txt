We bought a smaller version of the Bisquick Shake and Pour at the little store by where we camp and were really happy with it.  So easy to just add your liquid, shake and pour out into a skillet.  We did this on a camp stove and this will definitely be put into the rotation for our camping trips.  What a nice treat to have pancakes while we sit under the trees and enjoy nature! Can't beat the convenience!  It is comparable with the box mix pancakes when you add in eggs and liquid.  Makes great tasting pancakes quickly and easily.  Two thumbs up on this one!
