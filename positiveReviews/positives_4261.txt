I have been having blood sugar and yeast issues, and I've had to cut out sugar.  I had never tried sugar free Kool Aid before, so I was a bit nervous about this one.  Luckily I found the taste to be really good.  Even my picky kids love it!          I love the fact that these come pre sweetened in individual pouches.  You just tear one open and stir it into 2 quarts of water.  It couldn't be faster or easier!  It even dissolves well in cold water.          I just ordered a case of the cherry flavor, too.  My kids and I can't get enough of the tropical punch flavor, so we're excited to try cherry, too.
