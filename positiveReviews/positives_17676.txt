My impressions:  The coffee tastes fine but is unspectacular.  French Roast really burns a good deal of flavor out of the coffee bean and sort of homogenizes coffee flavors, so what you get is a dark roasted coffee (some might even say it tastes a little burned) that's deep and mellow.  If you're a fan of Latin American coffee flavors, this will NOT be the roast for you.  If you like Sumatra or are a general fan of French Roasts, you'll find this palatable.          I made a point of drinking this coffee on an empty stomach to test the acidity and it did not give me any stomach upset after 2 cups.  You can interpret that any number of ways.  ; )          In the interest of full disclosure, I was sent one serving of this coffee by Amazon to test drive.  Because I was not able to  ew more than one pot, I cannot adequeately comment on how this coffee might affect someone who suffers from acid reflux anecdotally.  I assume that the target audience (and only buyers of this product) would fall into that catagory, and sadly, I cannot advise you fairly on how this is going to affect you gastronomically.  Also consider that each case of GERD (Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease) is widely variable based on the individual, therefore this product might be fantastic for some and still too acidic for others.          So at this point you may be wondering, should I buy this?  Sure.  Start with as small a quantity as possible, test it for yourself, see how you like the flavor and whether or not the "low acid" aspect of this coffee meets your expectations.
