Nothing compares to fresh passionfruit but this concentrate is the next best thing.  I use it sparingly (mixed ~1 to 8 with sparkling water or tonic water) and don't need any sugar, though it is tart on its own.  I've tried a number of other passionfruit concentrates and this is the best I've found.
