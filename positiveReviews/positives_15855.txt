I grew up in Hawaii and adored my "seed" and when I moved to the mainland I was only able to get it when I stumbled on it in an Asian food store, or at Christmas when my Hawaiian friends would send it to me knowing my love for it.  The family  and is by far and away my favorite  and, It's very sweet and tangy and wonderful and glorious...the company that sent it to my was very quick and sent me a little sample of a different type of seed that was also very tasty and they were kind to email me It's status all the way to my welcoming arms....yay, Christmas came early.
