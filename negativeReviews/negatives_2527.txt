I had high hopes for this product...just to be completely let down by the  oken lids on both jars which let the ghee leak all over the shipping box!  It was shipped with  oken lids from the seller because the 2 pieces of  oken lid were NOT in the box!!!!!!!!!!  I will NEVER buy anything from this seller again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  BE WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The ghee was runny, probably from sitting in storage at the seller's business with air getting to the product through the  oken lids.
