This is pretty good jerky, it goes really well with a  few beers. Smells kind of funky tho... It's also a little moist for me. I like my jerky dry and stringy, but it is proper jerky. It's not that chopped and formed stuff, and it is really tasty.          All in all, for the price, I haven't found any better...
