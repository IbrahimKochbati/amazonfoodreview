My wife and I really didn't like any of these flavors, with the exception of the Texas BBQ.  It is a sweet barbecue, which I normally don't like.  Our kids selected the Texas BBQ as a trail snack for camping combined with some round crackers and ooh baby did it hit the spot.  That said, I think all the spicy Stonewall's jerky varieties and peppered Tofurky Jerky are a superior jerky.
