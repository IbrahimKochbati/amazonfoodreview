Our veterinarian suggested these for our dog to replace the raw hide chips we were giving him so our dog gets the benefits of the teeth cleaning. I was worried our dog might not like them since the raw hide chips I was buying were heavily coated in flavoring but he actually likes them just as much. These are definitely his favorite treats and I'm happy knowing they also help keep his teeth clean. The package arrived on time from the seller.
