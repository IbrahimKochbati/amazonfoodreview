These are great because they're only 100 calories per pack and are just as good, if not better, than other chips out there.          The "Original" style taste exactly like Munchos, but don't come with the high calorie count.  The other flavors (Sour Cream & Onion, Salt & Vinegar, Salt & Pepper, Cheddar, and BBQ) are all delicious, as well.
