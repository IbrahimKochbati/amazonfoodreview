my very VERY fussy cats gobbled up the chicken flavored ones, along with the med inside it! and my cats don't even like their regular food changed. still can't believe it was so easy! used to try everything including tuna with oil (no luck) but i followed the other comments and made sure i molded it around the med so it didn't show. it took one lick or two and then gobble! i gave them an extra as a treat too.
