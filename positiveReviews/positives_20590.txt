Our Yorkie was on Canidae since the day she came home from the rescue, but recently Canidae switched their formula and the new formula did not agree with her.  The Solid Gold Wee Bit came highly recommended from several trusted sources, so we switched.          Because the new formula of Canidae wasn't working for her, we switched her cold turkey to the Solid Gold.  Normally I like to switch gradually, mixing in a larger percentage of the new food with the old each day until they are completely switched over.  This normally prevents upset stomach and loose stools but we were unfortunately already there.  : (          Our Yorkie took to the new food immediately, and the loose stools stopped within one day.  She loves this food, so much she was eating too much and had to be put on a restricted diet.          There have been no negative affects from this food (aside from some weight gain).  Her coat looks great and her energy level is high.  5 stars!
