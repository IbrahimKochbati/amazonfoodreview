You're crazy if you don't have a soft spot for Chuckles.  You know darn well that they were one of your favorites as a kid, and you can't resist a package (or two) even today.  I love the Cherry flavored, and wish that they would introduce a Red only package of Chuckles (if only for a limited edition, and boy would I hold on to a few of those for posterity).  A tip for you Chuckles lovers   freeze 'em!  They last a lot longer that way and are well complimented by your favorite non caloric beverage (we ladies need to watch our expanding figures, unless the stork is on the way).  God Bless Chuckles.
