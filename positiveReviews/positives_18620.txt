This is a nice sized box (well two boxes, if they send what they promise) with two packs in each box. Each pack is big, not the disappointing slim bags you get in some cereal boxes, so this can last for a while even if I'm in the house.          Unfortunately this price compares poorly with the price I get locally for the same item. I bought a single 2 pack box (total 58.8 ouches) this week at a regular supermarket (not a club place) for less than nine bucks. Seeing this item and the price for it here has been an eye opener for me in regards to Amazon pricing.
