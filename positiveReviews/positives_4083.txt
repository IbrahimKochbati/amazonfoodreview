Childhood nostagia all over again! I LOVE peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but I don't often make them because they're rather messy. These bars solve that problem   the oats and stuff provide a perfect compliment to the peanut butter and jelly flavor that's in the bar. The best part is that I can eat this on the go and not have to worry about my hands or clothes getting messed up.
