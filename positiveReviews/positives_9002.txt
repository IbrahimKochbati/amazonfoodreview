Little BITZ chicken treats are the best treats I've found for my little dog. Not only are they good for him but he LOVES them. I'm so disappointed that the stores where I live stopped carrying them and thrilled to death that I can order them here. My chihuahua is very fussy because he's very spoiled. These treats are the only ones he'll eat, plus they're healthy and good for his teeth. Doesn't matter if they're round or bone shaped. Great to use for training.
