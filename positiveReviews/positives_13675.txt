I recently bought a bag of these on here to try, my fiancee and I love Haribo candy, especially the Gold BEars and wanted to try these...I must say, I usually do not like candy with a marshmallowy texture(like that strawberries and cream type candy) But these are so GOOD! The bottom is marshmallow, and the top is apple flavored gummi. Not too sweet either, just right. Nice and chewy like you'd expect from Haribo candy, I just love them!!!
