Have been enjoying Mueslix since early '90s.  Some reason, I can not locate mueslix in local supermarkets in New York, so I order through Amazon.  Taste is perfect not so sweet.  I do not care too much about raisins but in this cereal I do enjoy greatly.  It is enjoyable way to supplement fibers with whole grain, a perfect  eakfast that lasts until lunch time!  Tried all different kind & choices of many cereals out there but there is nothing like Mueslix;
