I like to have the boxed meals that don't require refrigeration handy in my office for quick lunches. I have tried the Hornel and taco bell meals but they tend to be dry and very processed tasting. Healthy choice does take a little more preperation but it's worth the time because they taste better. The rice and pasta taste and feel more like the natural kind.
