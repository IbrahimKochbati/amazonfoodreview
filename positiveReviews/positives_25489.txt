I love these lollipops. They are only 80 calories and last a long time, at least 20 minutes.  I am a weight watcher so I really am careful about what I eat and find these hit the spot.  The only problem I have is trying to decide which flavor to chose.  I got a sample of one of the lollipops at Christmas at the mall and loved it.  I tried to find a place near me who sells them but they are not close by so I order from Amazon.com  I have ordered twice so far and been happy with the product and the service.
