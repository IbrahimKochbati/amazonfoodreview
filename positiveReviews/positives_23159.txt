Gluten free  ead mixes are often disappointing. They come out too dry, don't have a good flavor, fall apart when used for sandwiches. But Pamela's Bread Mix tastes good, has a good texture, and doesn't have to be toasted to be enjoyed. It makes great sandwiches, and the several variations offered on the bag make for a nice variety of  eads. My husband especially favors the cinnamon  ead for  eakfast. As a sandwich  ead he really enjoys the plain  ead recipe with about 1 3 cup of added sesame seeds in the batter and extra sprinkled on top. Since we found this mix we have stopped experimenting with the various GF recipes we have collected. It does it all and is easy to make.
