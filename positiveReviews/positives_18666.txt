If you happen to have someone in your house that isn't overly wowed over an entire chocolate cookie, but just wants a taste, grab these!  I buy both these and the chocolate variety and they're loved as much as the chocolate.  It's just nice to have that difference when you're "chocolated out" at Christmas, and just want something a bit lighter, particularly in the summer.  The boys in this house love them as much as the chocolate ones and actually, prefer them most of the time.  The chocolate creme centers in this version is the same as the regular Oreo, just not overly rich.          Great, great product, been waiting for YEARS for these to come out.  Highly recommend!
