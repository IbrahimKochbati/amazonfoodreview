Peas taste as good as those I've bought at the market but are much cheaper per ounce! I store these in the big bag they came in, with a twist tie, and eat them out of an old can that I refill from the bag periodically. I snack on these at work and will be set for months! Only warning: the wasabi on mine is white, not yellow, not that it matters.
