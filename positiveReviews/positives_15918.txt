When I ordered this Hazelnut Matcha, I figured I'd like it, but, I didn't think I'd enjoy it quite this much.  This is really, REALLY good!          From the moment that I opened the package, I could smell the delicious aroma of Hazelnut.  I didn't even need to lift the package up to my nose, the fragrance is so strong and so authentically hazelnut.  I could feel my mouth starting to water at the prospect of enjoying delicious hazelnuts   one of my favorite nuts!  (It better be, I'm from the Northwest!)          The flavor of the hazelnut is strong here, but, I'm glad it is.  It tastes so wonderful!  I can taste the vegetative sweetness of the Matcha, not so much of the bittersweet but more of the sweet here, hints of the bitterness are in the background though, and offer a nice contrast.          Very deliciously nutty ... all that's missing is a nutty crunch!
