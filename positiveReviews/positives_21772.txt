I liked this flavor and the whole single cup system. I am not a avid coffee drinker, but I do like an occasional couple of cups a day. However, I will go several days between drinking any coffee.The single cups last and store longer with no waste.The key to this and all single cup coffee's is the water level. Just a bit more or less water in the coffee blend is critical to the taste.I find that if I fill my coffee cup with too much water, the flavor is watery. I find that the best level is really too small a cup of coffee, however adding the flavored creames allow you to use more water making a larger cup without sacrificing taste.
