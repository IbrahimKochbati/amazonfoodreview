My daughter in law was able to purchase this wonderful dressing at a market in Atlanta.  When that market closed, she was not able to find it no matter where she looked.  She was able to order from the manufacturer by the case (6 units) on line.  When I sampled the dressing, I loved it as much as she did. I was unable to find it in my home town of Macon, Georgia, however and was relegated to order a case unit on line. I too ordered on line from the manufacturer. I had no problems with my order, and I would rate the service excellent.  I really wish the dressing was more readily available in the local market in quantities more customer friendly.
