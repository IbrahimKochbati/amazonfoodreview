I love this tuna.  It tastes great and is packed in olive oil, which is a big plus for those of us who like flavor.  I wanted to order more today, but it apparently isn't being sold because some people had complained about it.  I read the reviews from some disgruntled (probably overly picky) people who were upset about the consistency of the tuna.  While it may be that you don't always get a solid chunk of tuna or sometimes it's packed a little looser than other times, you still get a whole can of tuna instead of a fourth of a can of flaked tuna and three quarters of water like the regular cans.  I am really bummed that I can't order this right now because of the complainers of the world.  If you don't like it, nobody forces you to order it.  I hope Amazon has the good business sense to make this available again as soon as possible.
