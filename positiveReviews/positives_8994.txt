OH MY THIS SYRUP IS DEVINE, DELICIOUS, VERY THICK, SILKY, GOOEY SMELLS SO GOOD     I AM IN LOVE. MY MOM KEPT THIS IN THE CABINET I GREW UP ON THIS STUFF AND TODAY I STILL LOVE IT. I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH MY WEIGHT HOWEVER THERE IS NO SYRUP IN MY OPINION THAT COMPARES TO KING SYRUP. ANYTHING YOU POUR IT ON IT JUST SOAKS IN LIKE A SPONGE. I EAT IT ON HOT BUTTERED WAFFLES, PANCAKES I USE IT TO MAKE MY THANKSGIVING MARSMALLOW CANDIED SWEET POTATOES AND MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS LOVE IT AND ALWAYS ASKS FOR MORE CANDIED SWEETS. MY DAD BEFORE HE PASSED USED TO EAT IT ON BREAD, BISCUITS HE HAD A SLIGHT SWEET TOOTH AND THIS FIXED HIS CRAVING EVERYTIME.     YOU MUST TRY THIS SYRUP.
