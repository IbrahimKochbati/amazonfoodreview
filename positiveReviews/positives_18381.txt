As any dieter knows, it is difficult to give up one's favorite snacks, especially if you crave salty, crispy chips.  I have kept 40 pounds off for 2 years, and these Popchips have been my go to snack; in fact I EAT THEM EVERY DAY!!  They fill my craving for salty chips for very few calories.  One small bag does it for me.  I like the original, but the other flavors are also good!  Without these, I may have had to eat regular chips and had difficulty keeping my weight off.  Popchips are a dieter's dream!
