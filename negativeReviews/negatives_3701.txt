I've been a fan of Nong Shim spicy noodles for years, so when this instant version came along I had to try it. I love Korean style fat noodles and the fact that it's instant is a big plus. Unfortunately, it didn't taste as flavorful as their other lines and by comparison I find this version a little plain. No comments on the health factor since instant noodles by nature is junk food. But there's a time and place for them.
