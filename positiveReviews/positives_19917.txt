I love Kettle Brand Chips!     I've been in love with the Honey Dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavors.          Sea Salt & Vinegar Chips are TANGY, SOUR, and make my lips pucker when I eat too many at a time.  I got 12 big bags for a steal from amazon ($11 WHAT?!?).          Personally, the flavor is too much for me, but my mom & aunt LOVE them and they hate potato chips.
