We have two small housedogs that we dearly love. When we need to give them meds I just hated putting pills down their throats. It seemed to frighten both of them. We tried the pill pockets and were thrilled that they were thrilled. They consider it a treat. We use the chicken as it is easier on their stomachs. Amazon has a reasonable price, too.
