Each of these flat ead crackers has 4 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber, and only 100 calories, so they're substantive and filling by themselves. However, because they're so firm and sturdy, they make a good base for more complex snacks.          One very simple addition is to sprinkle shredded cheese on top of a cracker and microwave it until the cheese melts (~15 seconds). You could even stack another cracker on top before microwaving to make a tightly bonded cheese and flat ead sandwich.          Just about any recipe you would normally make on top of a cracker or on top of a piece of toast can work here.
