This loose tea is hard to find in stores, I had to order it online and discovered it's a better tea than I usually get with an added bonus of being less expensive so I'm very pleased. I use it only for iced tea, so can't say how it is when hot. It's a stronger tea so I use less. I hope you continue to carry it because I plan on buying more in the future.
