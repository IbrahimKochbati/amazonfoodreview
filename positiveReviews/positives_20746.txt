This is my favorite tea and since it was no longer available in grocery stores, I began ordering it from various sellers through Amazon.  I just bought 6 boxes of 20 at the ridiculous price of $46, BUT NO MORE!! For those of you who also love this tea, there is great news.  Lipton has a Spiced Cinnamon Chai tea that has all but one of the same ingredients of the former Spiced Chai.  So do your self a favor, keep some of your pennies in your pocket and get the same taste with Liptons Spiced Cinnamon Chai.  Now this same vendor I purchased 6 boxes from is selling it for $56.00 taking advantage of the fact that we love this tea.  Go back to your local grocery stores and purchase the Lipton Spiced Cinnamon Chai so that these won't also disappear from the shelves.
