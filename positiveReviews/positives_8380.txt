This espresso coffee is an excellent coffee.  It has a wonderful head on it and a great flavor.  I only wish it were a little stronger.  It is a mellow espresso flavor and I prefer bold rich flavors to my espresso coffee.  My wife who likes a milder coffee thinks that this is the best espresso she has ever had!
