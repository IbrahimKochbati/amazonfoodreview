I love peanut butter, but I don't want to get the fat and calories that the real peanut butter gives you so I purchased this PB2. I sprinkle it dry over sliced apples and it pretty good. It is a bit on the salty side which I really don't care for.  I sprinkle it on top of vegetable salad instead of salad dressing and it's pretty good as well.
