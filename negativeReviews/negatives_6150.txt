I woke up today, Sunday, to find my Sunday newspaper for the Chicago Tribune wrapped in a plastic bag with the words, "our instant tastes rich not expensive (sorry Starbucks)"          Naturally, I decided to put your Taster's Choice packet to the test.  Could you please define the word "rich" according to your dictionary.  To the rest of the world, rich implies full bodied in a drink.  Nothing about your instant coffee is rich.  It is quite the opposite actually.  The finished product with 6oz of water look exactly like that, dirty water.  Looks like something that would come out of my rain gutter, not my coffee pot.          It's tastes is repulsive.  In fact, if I liked drinking hot water, you might have a market.          I would reason that the fact your coffee costs "4x less than Starbucks Via" is because it is made with 4x less quality.  The taste is in the cup.  You should be embarrassed that you call yourself "Taster's Choice"  Who's choice?  A zombie?          Also, how low can you go?  Your text font on your bag is exactly as Starbucks VIA in their stores.  Come on!  Be original!  Don't sit on the defensive side and use the same ideas as others.  It sounds like someone is losing business on a product that has been horrible from the beginning and is facing real competition.  Maybe you should spend less money on the marketing of the same recipe of Taster's Choice and more money on the development of something that actually is able to compete with VIA.  Back to the drawing board Nescafe.  Your product is horrible and the taste is in the package.  I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  In fact, as a coffee lover, I will make sure everyone I know makes "the smart choice" and chooses anything BUT Taster's Choice!
