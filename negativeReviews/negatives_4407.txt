I purchased two bottles of this stuff. The capsules of one bottle were dark and the capsules of the other bottle (which I started on yesterday) are a light  own color and I can clearly see the movement of the fluid inside the capsule. With the first bottle, I did not notice an increase in my supply and although I've only been using the second bottle for a day, I came home from work on my  eak and pumped 4.5 oz in ten minutes. I am usually only able to pump 3oz in ten minutes. I haven't changed anything in my diet to explain this sudden increase so I do believe it was the use of the new pills.          I think the first bottle may have been older and so the capsules may have lost their potency. That is the only theory I have to explain the dark color and my inability to see the fluid in the capsule. I guess just be careful with this stuff. I haven't tried another  and but there are other  ands of this stuff that are much less expensive. After I am through with this second bottle, I think I will try a least expensive  and I saw on Amazon.
