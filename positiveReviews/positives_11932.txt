I have been feeding my greyhounds these treats for years.  My hounds can be a little finicky, but they love these treats.  They are expensive, relative to other biscuits, but I find they are a good addition to their diet.  The treats are easy on the teeth.  Since they are protein treat, be careful not to overindulge your pet on a regular basis.  They are great treats to take on walks as you can stuff them in your pocket easily.  I have found prices can vary from vendor to vendor, so shop around.
