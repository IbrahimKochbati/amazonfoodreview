The problem, for me, with this oil is that it tastes so, for lack of a better word, gross.  It was said to have a "nutty" taste, but to me it tastes like marijuana smells, only stronger.  Not an enjoyable or pleasant taste at all.  I purchased this to help with migraines, but haven't been able to stomach it.  Fortunately, I found that magnesium is helping, and going gluten free has worked miracles overall, so I am not too disappointed.  And the reason I gave this three stars?  It works great to make a beeswax, coconut, hemp oil blend that I can use for a lip balm (just melt together in the microwave and wala!),  I can't taste it when I use it this way either, as the coconut oil and especially the beeswax nicely overpower.  And my lips are feeling great this winter!
