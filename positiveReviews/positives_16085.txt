I'm a big fan of all the Newman cookies, although I can't claim to be Cookie Monster.  These Fig Newmans are delicious, but not quite as good as their competitor we all see in the grocery store.  One important fact that many would like to know it that they are not a gluten free product.  If you need anything wheat  and dairy free, these are probably some of the best cookies you'll find.          Many people do have certain dietary restrictions or things they like to avoid, so I added the ingredients and basic nutritional information below.  I did find a few differences between my packaging and that listed on the Newman site, something that you might want to take note of, especially if you have food allergies.          Taste?  They were excellent, but I did find the outer cookie coating to be a bit drier than expected.  Fig Newtons are a bit moister, but these definitely an excellent choice considering the ingredients.  They aren't tops on my list, but were quite palatable.  One of my all time favorite cookies are the peanut butter Newman O's.  If you do want a wheat  and dairy free fig cookie, you can't get much better than this one.          INGREDIENTS:          Organic Barley Flour, Organic Sugar, Corn Syrup, Organic Figs, Organic Brown Rice Flour, Organic Yellow Corn Flour, Organic Palm Fruit Oil, Water, Glycerine, Natural Flavors, Leavening (Sodium Bicarbonate, Monocalcium Phosphate), Vanilla, Xanthan Gum, Salt, Natural flavor, Soy Lecithin (an emulsifier).          A couple of  ief notes on the ingredients:  The contents listed on may package differed slightly than those on Newman's site and also in the order of the ingredients.  For example, mine lists vanilla as an ingredient, but they did not.          ***  There is a cautionary note on my packaging that states:  "Manufactured on equipment that may process products containing peanuts, other nuts, and milk powder."  ***          NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION:          Serving Size   2 bars (38g)          Calories per Serving 115          Calories From Fat 15           Total Fat 1.5g       Saturated fat  0g       Trans Fat  0g           Cholesterol 0mg           Sodium 170mg           Total Carbs 26g          Dietary Fiber 1g          Sugars 12g     Protein 2g
