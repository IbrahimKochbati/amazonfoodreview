On most days I'll have a couple packets of Quaker Oatmeal (any fruit variety) for  eakfast with my morning coffee. The only drawback to this is the fact that most of the flavored varieties of Quaker Oatmeal are loaded with sugar. I've started mixing one packet flavored oatmeal with one packet original flavor. This immediately cuts my morning sugar intake in half, extends the time between purchasing the more expensive flavored packets and I still get the fiber from the fruity flavors I love.
