I love these chips and ordered them after I had some in Florida.  My case of chips came without any packing inside.  All bags in a box with no cushioning at all.  Needless to say most of the chips were  oken and I would not order them again.  A great item but if they can't package to aid in minimal chip  eakage then one is wasting their money.
