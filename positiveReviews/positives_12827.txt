Small can of tasty though very sweet carbonated soft drink.  You need to have a sweet tooth, but if you do, you'll love it.  The can is small, 8.3 oz, but it seems sufficient, given the sweetness.  Goes well on ice.  The fruity combination of flavors works well.     Recommended.  There are 36g of carbs.
