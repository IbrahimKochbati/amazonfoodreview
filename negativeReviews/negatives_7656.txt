Oatmeal cookies are one of my favorite cookies and so I was looking forward to trying these cookies, made by Quaker.  Needless to say from the title of this review, the cookies are dry, bland and taste nothing like the oatmeal cookies I can make at home with Quaker Oats, using their recipe.  This cookie crumbles easily and the consistency is akin to drywall.  No thanks!
