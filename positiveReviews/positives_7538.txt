I make chia gel with this and add a large spoonful to my yogurt and fruit in the morning.  I tried to make cookies with the gel and that was a failure!  Great for subbing in sauces to add bulk without fat.  Easy to sprinkle on top of any food product too since they have virtually no taste.  Very versatile and easy to eat.
