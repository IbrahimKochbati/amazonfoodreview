This Lady Grey loose tea is a sensory experience. It is light and citrusy with just the right kick of caffeine. The flower petals are pretty but I cannot taste any difference they might make in the steeped tea. It would make a nice gift for a woman who you don't know very well. All in all it is worth a try.
