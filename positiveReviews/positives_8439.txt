Found these at Walmart and instantly loved these cookies. The taste is so good and it's a great example of a healthy choice to make without leaving out anything on the taste. Too bad these bars aren't widely available anymore. Luckily Amazon helps me out every time and delivers some boxes to my doorstep when my personal stock runs out. Wouldn't know what to have without these. It's without a doubt the best flavor in the series!
