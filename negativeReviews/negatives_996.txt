I regularly purchase this item in the bulk and loved it because it was also dairy free.     However, my last purchase was disappointing, after opening a  and new package I noticed a black thing in the mix, carefully removed to find out it was a dead flour beetle! I sifted the mix and found more DEAD BUGS!          This is the second time I writing this review. Amazon didn't publish my first review. Thank you AMAZON.     I will not be purchasing this item again.
