I used my 24 oz Tervis Tumbler with mine (I had to go in at an angle). My husband used a 16 oz glass. His was pretty much filled to the  im (we used the large option on our  ewer, which is a 3 setting one). To get the perfect amount of sweetness, I put in one packet of sugar (I use stevia in the raw) and then ran the  ew system, then added another packet on top. What is nice is you get a lot more of a beverage because it melts the majority of the ice when it  ews. In the larger size, you have a bit more ice remaining to cool off the tea. I'm so glad we got these.
