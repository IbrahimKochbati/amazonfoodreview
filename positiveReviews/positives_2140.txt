I used to be a buyer at a natural organic grocery.  This is the best soup I have ever had in a can.  I am very picky about my clam chowder soup as my favorite is The Ritz Carlton's clam chowder.  Just add butter, milk cream, and black pepper.  Have some fresh corn  ead and butter and you are in heaven.
