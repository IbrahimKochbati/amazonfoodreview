Read through the other reviews and you will find the same situation I had with the creamers.  It does not arrive in the blue dispenser box that is shown, the 192 creamers arrive loose inside a cardboard box with no padding.  Perhaps less creamers would burst during transit if the display box shown was wrapped inside a cardboard box.  The box arrived completely undamaged on the outside. None appeared to have frozen during transit, it appears that the creamer singles pop during high altitude transit or perhaps when the box is thrown by the shipper or pressure is placed on the box.  It is a sticky mess when it arrives.  The creamer taste and convenience is great, but it is unfortunate that so many people have commented on this problem and Interational Delight has not fixed its packaging and shipping issue.
