Shake and Bake has always been a staple at our house. We love the different varieties they have for chicken, so I was quite happy when I was offered a chance to review their recipe for pork chops! I wasn't disappointed.  Both my husband and I and our 9 year old daughter really enjoyed this product. I worried about the chops getting soggy, but they came out nice and crisp. The chops stayed nice and juicy. A wonderful dinner when paired with a nice salad and simple side dish. We will definitley be purchasing this product in the future.
