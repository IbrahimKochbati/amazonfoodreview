I work at the public li ary and we have family movie programs on a regular basis. There could be anywhere from 10 to 60 people watching the movie and I need to have the popcorn ready at a steady pace. We have one of the big popcorn machines on a cart and use Great Northern Popcorn's 8 ounce packs. The popcorn tastes great and the packaging is perfect for our needs.
