I've been buying this for some time. It's expensive but I only eat it once in a while. But now my teenage daughter has discovered it and I can hardly keep the pantry stocked. So I'm glad I thought to check on amazon. With Subscribe and Save it's cheaper than I ever find it in the store (and only one store in my area carries it).          What a great food for a teenager to be eating! She makes a parfait with granola, berries and yogurt.          Ingredients: whole grain rolled oats, evaporated can juice, pineapple juice concentrate, pear juice concentrate, peach juice concentrate, vitamin E, natural flavor.          It is very hard to find granola without added fat. And I really dislike puffed things like rice krispies in granola and it's hard to find that too.
