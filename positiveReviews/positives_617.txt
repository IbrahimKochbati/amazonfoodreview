My son is a SB fanatic so I was so excited to find this for the 2010 holiday season as every year we do some version of ginger ead. I knew by reading reviews that there wouldn't be enough yellow frosting so I whipped up so edible glue (water and confectionery sugar) to hold the levels of ginger ead that make the pineapple and save the yellow frosting for the outside   this worked great. It was a really fun idea that we enjoyed creating. The licorice was worthless though...
