This drink would have gotten 4.5 stars from my kids but as an adult, this drink was much too sweet for my husband and myself.  We would never drink anything this cloyingly sweet.  It's made with fruit juice concentrates and flavorings reconstituted with filtered sparkling water.  What I'd rather have, and what I make at home frequently, is a normal fruit juice, such as pineapple (no sugar added) and sparkling mineral water.  It cuts the sweetness of the juice, has just enough flavor, a little fizz and is even good for you.  Switch, I'm afraid has none of this, it's just too sweet and has too much fake flavoring.  We tried the Kiwi Berry and it tasted like overpowering strawberry fake flavoring, like strawberry flavored candies.  Sorry, Switch, but you could make this simpler and better very easily.
