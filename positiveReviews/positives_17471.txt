These make GREAT Swedish pancakes and are less expensive than other  ands.  Also, since I don't keep flour around the house, it is great to have when a recipe calls for a few tablespoons of flour.  My family is always happy when I take out the box of Kungsomen Swedish Pancake mix and the crepe pan on the weekends!!
