I have not used this in few years,but a bought the biggest bag lowes had for around 10 or 12 bucks.I planted some seedlings in a hurry , no sooner got them potted and realized the mistake I made.It is 50% wood chips and pine bark that actually smells like it came from a forest fire.There is nothing it it that even looks like soil.This is just a friendly note to anyone thinking of using this.DONT DO IT,this is crap,junk,the worst.I wont call it garbage,because decomposed food would be way better.I will never buy anything with the Miracle Gro name on it again.
