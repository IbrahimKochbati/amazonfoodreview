I enjoy getting the my senior catfood this way and have not stopped receiving deliveries. My cat lives on this and other flavors of Friskies due to the poor guy has lack of teeth. The problem I have is who do I speak to about a particular case of this food I received 2 months ago (I get deliveries every 2 months)and it was so dented that the product quality was compromised. I opened 2 cans and the food was spoiled. I opened up one and it seemed OK but my old cat got very ill. He is 17+ years old and cannot afford to be sick.  Amazon Help!
