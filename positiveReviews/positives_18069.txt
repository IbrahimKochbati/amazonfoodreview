If you've never used these mixes before, they're easy enough even for a lazy oldtimer who doesn't like to spend time in the kitchen.  I'll sit in front of the TV and spend two minutes whisking it up on the coffee table, right in the measuring cup itself, which makes it easy to pour into a bowl or bowls.  I usually fix two packages at a time, so use my four cup Pyrex, available on Amazon (geesh, that sounded like a commercial).          The result is... well, much more than worth that two minutes.          Flavor is a matter of taste; but, for me, this pistachio is one of their better flavors.  You won't find big chunks of nut floating around; but there are enough little granules to remind you that this is pistachio.          Unless you don't feel like a nut, I'll recommend this flavor and this easy dessert.
