I was excited to be able to give these to my dog because he has tried and liked other Newman's Own Organics dog treats, like the cheese treats, so I figured he would enjoy these as well.  My dog is a Cockapoo and although he is generally not a picky eater, he likes some treats more than others.  (So far the Science Diet treats and Milkbones have not been winners.)          My first impression was that I really liked the ingredients list.  Unlike a lot of dog treats, I actually understood and recognized all the ingredients and the fact that the ingredients were all organic were a plus.  Of course, I knew none of this would make a difference if my dog didn't like them.          So what was the result?  Most of the time he really likes these treats, though he still prefers more of the jerky style and chewy treats.  (I know this because there have been a few occasions when he has turned these treats down for whatever reason but will still gladly accept one of the others.)  Most of the time though he seems very happy to have one of these.          Worth noting, these treats seem a little large for my 20 lb sized dog.  They can easily be  oken in half, but  eaking them in half again from there can be tricky.  Unlike some other large sized treats he doesn't have a difficult time eating these, but boy are they crumbly.  Because he has to take several bites to eat one crumbs usually go everywhere.  He's a thorough eater so generally I haven't had a problem with a mess being left behind BUT I don't know that I would want him eating these treats on carpet or another surface where crumbs could get trapped.          Overall, they are a good treat.  I appreciate the ingredient list and the fact my dog likes them, but wish they were a little smaller so he could eat them without them crumbling everywhere.
