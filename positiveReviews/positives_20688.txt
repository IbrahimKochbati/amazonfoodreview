This product used to be on the shelves at the local Trader Joe's up until a few years ago.  I gave up trying to get them to re order it, and couldn't it find it anywhere in San Diego.  So I turned to Amazon, and there it was!  Hurray!  Directions for serving:  cut two slices, put on a plate, top with ice cream and enjoy.  Haagen Dazs White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle is a particularly good choice.  Leave unused cake in the foil wrapper, insert into a Ziploc bag, squeeze out the extra air and seal tightly.  Keeps forever.  Super product.
