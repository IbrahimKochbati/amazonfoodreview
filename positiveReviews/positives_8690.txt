If you have yet to try rooibos tea you are in for a treat. This smooth delicious tea is excellent any time of the day. I like that rooibos is naturally caffeine free so I can drink it late at night and not worry about staying up all night. I used to drink rooibos when I lived in Africa so this  ings back fond memories. What I like most about this tea, besides the flavor, is that this is organic and the company supports fair trade practices. So you can really feel good about drinking a cup of tea from a company that is making the world a better place. This tea is also rich in antioxidants and contains calcium. Some parents make this tea for their children when they have colic (use it like water in baby formula). It is a good natural remedy. This tea does taste best with milk and I add stevia too although it is also served with lemon and honey.          ~The Rebecca Review
