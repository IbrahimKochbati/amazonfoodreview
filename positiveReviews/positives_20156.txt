We were happy to find an "angel hair" version of GF pasta as my husband prefers this style to "spaghetti".  Although a box of this is comparable in price to a box of spaghetti, I do find I need to make more   our family of 4 will finish off close to 2 boxes in one meal.  The texture and taste are great (I also enjoy Tinkyada Rice pasta and Mrs. Leepers corn pasta).  The only other downside is that this pasta really seems to stick to itself once it cools off a bit.  It gets difficult to scoop it out of the dish during dinner as it has become one giant ball of pasta.  (We can't add the sauce to the pasta in the serving dish since not everyone in the family can have all the other ingredients   we are dealing with more than just GF.  Adding sauce may solve this problem for others.)
