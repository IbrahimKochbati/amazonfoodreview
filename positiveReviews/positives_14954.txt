I ordered 15 boxes of this flour, or at least that's what I thought!  The carton in which the flour was delivered sat unopened until recently (September 5, 2012) and lo and behold   only 11 boxes!  I would advise caution if buying from this vendor!!!  The flour itself is great (or I should say was, because General Mills for some reason stopped making it, at least as packaged in 2# boxes).
