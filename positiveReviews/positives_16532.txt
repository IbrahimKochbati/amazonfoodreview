I should take a video of my dog drooling when I ask him if he wants a Greenie!  No other treat can compare as far as he's concerned    and this is a dog who will eat just about anything.  He happily trots into his crate every night at bedtime because he knows that's when I'll give him this special treat.  Seriously, if he could skip, he would skip.  At a little over $1.40 per treat, Greenies are more expensive than I would typically pay, but I like how they freshen his  eath, clean his teeth, & are generally healthy for him.  There may be other products out there that claim to have the same benefits, but none I've tried so far have that "tail wagging drool" factor which, to be honest, makes me feel all warm and fuzzy at bedtime too :)
