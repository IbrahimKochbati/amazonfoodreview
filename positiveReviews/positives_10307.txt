I don't know who would review this poorly. It is great. After you freeze it, you just push the portions out and they come out clean. I love that it is non toxic, easy to use, easy to clean, and that I can have freezer bags of small portions of baby food prepared and ready to use whenever. I hesitated to buy it because of poor reviews, but am very happy I got it. I am using it every other day right now.
