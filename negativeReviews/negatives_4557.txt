We have had it less than three months. We have to descale about once a week. Our water has 1 gram of hardness. Almost perfect. They have sent new water reservoir (which by the way Keurig has great help line). But, honestly for the money the Mr. Coffee is better.  You just have to add the water each time. But it works each time. It is very hard to get a consistent full cup of coffee out of this Keurig machine.
