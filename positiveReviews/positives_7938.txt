I saw this tea from my friend's room and asked for a couple. She has the Super Slimming tea and the Detox tea. I usually combine the two. It made me go to the bathroom more frequently than usual, but I feel much relieved like more refreshed. My pimples went away and my back acne is non existent. The store in my area stopped selling this kind of  and, sucks! I have to purchased it on line now.
