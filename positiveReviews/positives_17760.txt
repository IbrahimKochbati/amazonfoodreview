Ok, this stuff is not thick and chewy like the other reviewer posted. My husband likes root beer more than I do and he likes this  and. We very very rarely ever buy soda but when we do we buy this  and and Santa Cruz Organic as well. He usually chooses this root beer over all the other flavors. We only consume organic foods and so we do not care for chemical tastes or high fructose corn syrup. If you are not used to organic and natural sodas than this may not be the right choice for you
