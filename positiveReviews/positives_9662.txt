I've enjoyed this bar when being gone for the day hiking and exploring.  So easy to stick in my pocket and savor when lunchtime approaches.  Eating it slowly helps me enjoy more fully.  I keep a stash of them at home.  Great for taking on trips.  They were somewhat difficult to find and I was glad to find a selection at Amazon.
