The Switch Kiwi Berry is a nice refreshing alternative to the typical carbonated soft drinks on the market.          The taste although unusual at first is rather pleasant once you get used to it. I'd describe it as a cross between those Dole Blended juices and soda water. Strange as it sounds it actually tastes good.          Although I suppose it's slightly better for you than soda   The Switch doesn't use High Fructose Corn Syrup   it's still full of calories and carbs.          Still for people who generally don't drink soda such as myself but find themselves occasionally craving a carbonated beverage this is a nice alternative.          The can is only 8.3 oz. which does make it considerably smaller than a can of soda. As long as you can stick to only drinking one you'll be slightly better off than drinking a typical non diet soda.
