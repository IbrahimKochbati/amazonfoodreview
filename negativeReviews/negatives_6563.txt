The new formulation tastes horrible.  I would be interested to see a chart of their sales before and after implementation because their responses to the long time consumers is that "product testers" like the new formulation.  I would like to know if the "product testers" are buying the product because from these reviews the "long time consumers"...like myself...are not.  I have two boxes at home that i would not feed to my dog.  you suppose it would make a good facial...no it smells terrible also.  maybe wallpaper paste.
