When I drank the strawberry kiwi, the flavor reminded me very much of the strawberry Pop Rocks candy. It was very sweet, but not so much that I felt like I needed to drink water after it. The carbonation was apparent, but not strong. Kinda like the carbonation in a Pellegrino, as opposed to a Coke. The can was a little on the small side, so I could see myself drinking 2 at once. I'd drink it again sometime, but it's not an everyday buy.
