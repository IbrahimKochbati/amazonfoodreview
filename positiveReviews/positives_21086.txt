As part of my healthy eating plan, I gave up eating anything made from processed flour.  Bread and cereal weren't a problem    lots of good whole grain alternatives available    but great whole wheat pasta has been elusive. My main complaints: its general mushiness, even when cooked according to direction; and its bland texture.     The DaVinci  and, most notably the penne, is my new favorite.  It has a rich taste and a nice texture, and it seems to resist the mushies, particularly if you cook it al dente.  Delicious.          And best of all: Amazon delivers a case of it to my door every three months.
