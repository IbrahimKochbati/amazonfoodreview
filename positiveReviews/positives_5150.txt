I _really_ like this drink.  My only complaint is that I'd need to drink 2 3 cans at a time    8.3oz is a wee bit on the petite side for me.          If it came in a 20oz can, I'd be much more likely to buy it, and the packaging would be much less costly.          Really tasty product, though, and I've got no quarrels with the ingredients.  Yum.
