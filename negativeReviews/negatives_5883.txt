i called up Kyjen customer service for a recommendation on a puzzle toy, and *bonus* got a iive person on the phone ( ownie points for great service). I have a mini dachshund, who, although adorable, is not so  ight and difficult to train. Kyjen kindly recommended the star spinner. But upon receiving this item, my dachshund figured it out within minutes   i thought she had to be a Border Collie to solve it so quickly!          Unfortunately, I wanted this toy to last for a while but this one unfortunately is too easy.  See, If you spin the star just 20 degrees, *all* the treat trays are exposed, and all the dog has to do is walk around to each open tray and eat the treats. If the trays were exposed one at a time or randomly. it would increase the dogs playtime and challenge them further.          However, my dog does love other Kyjen Toys    the Tail Teaser,  Egg Babies platypus and Hide A Squirrel in the junior size. Based on the great customer service and other toys, i will try some different Kyjen puzzle games instead.
