This product does exactly what it's intended to do. Unfortunately, it is not a very large mat, and my cat just steps out on the side of the litter box sometimes rather than onto the litter mat. However, when he does step out onto the mat, it does a great job of catching the litter off his paws. Good value for the price. Fast shipping!
