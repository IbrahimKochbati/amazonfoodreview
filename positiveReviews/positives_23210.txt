My daughter ordered 6 packages of Pamela's Bread for my birthday this year.  It makes the best loaf of  ead I've had in 6 years.  The texture is wonderful, the taste great.  Great for sandwiches, toast or just plain  ead and butter with your meal.  I think the  ead is so good that I would highly reccomend it to everyone.  In fact, my husband who is not a celiac, loves it too.
