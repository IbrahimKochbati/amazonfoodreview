I like coffee a lot.  I drink my coffee black, and I love the varieties from Starbucks, Seattle's Best, Gevalia, Arriba!.  So when I had the opportunity to try this new coffee from Melitta, I was eager to see what they had to offer.          My setup is a Gevalia 12 cup coffee maker using Melitta No. 4 unbleached cone filters.  For the trial, I  ewed 6 cups of the Melitta the same way that I do my Starbucks   two rounded scoops using the Gevalia coffee scoop.  I was a little surprised at how light it came out, and it did not have a lot of flavor.  It definitely came out lighter than the other coffees that I have used   I have been getting satisfying results from my coffee maker and  ands listed above using this method for 5 years.  For the next few pots that I made I used "heaping" scoops to try to get it stronger.  While it came out darker, I was disappointed in the overall flavor.  Since this is listed as a "medium" roast, I was looking for something on par with either either the Starbucks House or Peru Chanchamayo roasts.  This may be unfair since these are both Latin American beans, and I could not find anything about the origins of the Melitta Classique Supreme.  I found the flavor slightly earthy, but there just wasn't a lot that stood out.  I like coffees that are have citrus flavors or rich and nuttier.  Ultimately it is more of a lack of flavor that stuck with me.  It is unoffensive but underwhelming.          If you are a current Starbucks or other coffeehouse drinker, you will likely find this somewhat disappointing.  If you are looking for a step up from Folgers you might like what you find.  As I think about a little harder, I would say that this compares favorably with Millstone coffee.  You'll probably like this coffee from Melitta if Millstone is right up your alley.
