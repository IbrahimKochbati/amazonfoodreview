I love these cookies and I love Erin as a result. These cookies make me smile. The texture makes my eyes googly. The smell reminds me of beautiful spring days and how awesome it'd be to spend them with Erin, have her  ing the fresh cookies out of the oven and us enjoying them together on our outdoor swing listening to the birds and enjoying the creek that passed through our backyard.          The only thing is that this kind and the other kind (raisin) don't differ much in taste. They both taste the same  taste of Heaven.
