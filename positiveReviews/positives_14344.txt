This tea has an excellent flavor and I reuse the tins by buying larger quantities in bulk and storing in the tins. I have a "tea station" on my counter with a tin of this and a tin of the Earl Gray always at hand. A note to those of you who prefer your tea iced...use this with a coffee filter in your iced tea maker or through sieve and you won't be disappointed!
