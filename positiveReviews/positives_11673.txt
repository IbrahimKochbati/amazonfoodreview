If you crossed an Almond Joy candy bar with a cookie, it would taste like this. I'm happy that its less sweet than most cookies or candy bars. I don't like overpowering sweetness. Instead this tastes slightly sweet with lots of nutty, coconut flavor and a bit a chocolate.  Love that its Gluten Free and 180 mg of Omega 3 fatty acids.  It has lots of organic ingredients and is sweetened mostly with agave.          I only have one gripe:  Manufactured on the same equipment with peanuts. I really appreciate that they tell me.  I just wish they didn't do it, because that means its to dangerous of a product to keep in our house.  (Guess that means I need to hurry and eat them all).
