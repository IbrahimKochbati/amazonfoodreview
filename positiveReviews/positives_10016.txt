I've been a fan of the Melitta system for years. It's simple, and eliminates the expense of an     appliance. For one or two persons, it's a great way to make coffee. I have always used regular     grind coffee with a Melitta basket, but the Classique Supreme has changed my mind. Melitta's     coffee is ground very finely, almost to a powder consistency, which works better with their     drip basket system. I often ran the water through twice with regular grind, but don't need to     do so with the Melitta coffee. Whenever I can eliminate a step, I'm happy.          This particular Melitta coffee, the Classique Supreme, has a rich flavor compared to the     rather ordinary coffees that I've gotten used to. Taken black, it has a smoky, vaguely     Espressoesque flavor that I find quite delicious. Adding a little creamer (I use the     liquid variety) cuts that flavor considerably. The package directions specify two level     teaspoons per six ounce cup, which I find inadequate; twice that amount is much better.     Classique Supreme may be a bit pricey, and there may well be better "gourmet" coffees     out there, but it works for me, and I certainly would get it again in the future.          My only complaint: the package is difficult to open without spilling some contents.
