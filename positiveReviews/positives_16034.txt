These biscuits are excellent and have become a staple in my cupboard. I will have to agree that the packaging and shipping from Amazon leaves a lot to be desired. I have received two shipments on this product. The first shipment was great with little to no crumbling or crushing....as good or better than what I found in my local grocer. The second shipment arrived in very poor condition. The box looked like it had been dropped kicked a couple of times. There is no effort to cushion or protect these biscuits from shipping damage. The six biscuit packages are simply put in the shipping box, and shipped. My first shipment was obviously a lucky shipping experience without need for cushioning, but the second shipment had obviously been mishandled. If you're listening amazon....you need to start using air pillows with this product, and enough of them to actually work. My last experience has left me wary of ordering again without improvements to the shipping packaging.          Product   5 stars     packaging   1 stars
