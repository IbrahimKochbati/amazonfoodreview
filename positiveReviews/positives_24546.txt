I've been eating pumpkin from the can for years. All it takes is a can opener and a fork (and unless you're from Maryland    one should never use a spoon) and a bit of pepper.          Yum! Pumpkin is my favorite edible gourd. Though I do miss the delicious pumpkin seeds you can get from fresh pumpkin. Sometimes I'll bake the seeds and throw a little sea salt on top. That's a nice treat on a cool Fall day. I'll make a steaming hot cup of tea and eat pumpkin seeds and just think about things out on my porch.          I imagine that Susan Lucci and I are married and that she's very experimental in the bedroom and not afraid to invite company to join us. One time I imagined this so hard I blacked out. I woke on my porch with pumpkin all over my chest and a slight burn on my calf from the tea.
