If my two cats were to write this review, they's give Petite Cuisine Chicken Pot Pie and Chinese Chicken eight paws up.  They like it; I assume that they like the flavor and consistency.  And the liquid isn't 'water,' it's  oth and the first part that my guys eat.  I like that it's 'kitty healthy,' but the cost is a bit steep.
