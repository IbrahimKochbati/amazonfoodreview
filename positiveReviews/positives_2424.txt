Water tastes good. I typically prefer only purified water (did a study on this in grad school back in the day) but for use at the office, this fills the bill. I think it tastes good and looks presentable.          Bottles are (of course) recyclable, so I don't feel guilty saying I like the quality of the bottle as well. I once had someone pickup water, and they got a chain grocer  and at a steal   but the bottle was so flimsy. I don't like that one bit. This is the best of both worlds.          Shipment arrived fully intact for me.
