The problem with Ancho chili is its scarcity in commercial markets.  We don't have ready recourse to a decent Mexican mercado, a sadness, so I turned to Amazon.  There is simply something wonderful combining Ancho and maple syrup for a splendid porc chop sauce, for example. I'm grateful.  So are the happy palates around here.
