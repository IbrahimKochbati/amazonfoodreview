This item didn't have the pleasant taste that most of Hodgson Mills products have, such as the Wild Blueberry Muffin Mix.  However, I found it greatly improved the flavor & added nutrition if I grated an apple into the mix. It increased the much needed moisture, & it was certainly a nutritious  eakfast.
