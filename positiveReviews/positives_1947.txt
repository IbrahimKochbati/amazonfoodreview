I picked up a box of this in a discount grocery store in paso robles. The cake was heavenly. I liked it so much, I found another store that sold the mix as well as the icing, and there is even a pink lemonade cookie mix which I bought but haven't tried yet.          The taste, is of course lemon, but it reminds me a bit of that flavored mix Country Time I drank as a kid, but less tangy. Its very light and refreshing.          I simply loved it. Hope this is more than just a seasonal flavor.
