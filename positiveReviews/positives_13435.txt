This is become my favorite blend of coffee in the K cup.  My house used to live on the "Coffee People, Donut Shop"   (still a decent K cup.)  I bought an 80 pack of Newmans Own, Special Blend at Sams Club for $40 just to try it, and we were hooked after our 1st cup.  This is a delicious balance of a darker roast that isnt too over powering.  I would recommend this to anyone   5 stars.
