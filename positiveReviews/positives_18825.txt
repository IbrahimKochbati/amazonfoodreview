I just had a bowl of split pea soup for a part of my lunch. It was Amy's Organic Split Pea Soup and it was quite good. It says that it is low fat, but the ingredient list has no fat at all on it so it must be very low. The sodium, on the other hand is a bit higher than I like, but the fiber content is good. The taste is somewhat bland, but I'm not complaining. I get tastes out of the other foods I eat with it. It's a vegan product and has no added MSG or preservatives and is gluten free. A product like this should have great appeal to those who are on restricted diets, for whatever reason. Relatively pure foods are hard to find.          Gary Peterson
