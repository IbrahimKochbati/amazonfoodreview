I have three adult indoor cats, and I feed them Goodlife indoor formula in the chicken flavor. I wanted a moderately priced cat food that wouldnt make me go  oke, but also wasnt full of ingredients that were unhealthy for my kitties. I used to feed them Iams, but at 17 bucks a bag I knew there had to be a food out there that was comparable!          Goodlife Indoor with Chicken has high quality ALL NATURAL ingredients that taste good (well I dont know that they taste good but my cats LOVE it)          Inside it has:          *REAL chicken and skim milk for strong bones and teeth and lean muscle mass.          *WHOLE grain  own rice that has alot of good vitamins          *Natural Garden Peas and Spinach with Iron and Folic Acid that helps metabolism          *High quality protein and taurine needed for a healthy heart and eyes.          *Whole Grains rich in fatty acids and fiber for healthy digestion and a shiny coat          *Colorful veggies that provide antioxidants for a good immune system          My cats have a clean bill of health, shiny sleek coats, no plaque on their teeth, and my oldest one who is 12 has a healthy urinary tract system which we all know is the number one killer of senior cats!
