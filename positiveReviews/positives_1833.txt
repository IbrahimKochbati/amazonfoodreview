I was looking for some nutritious snacks   with fiber   and came across these.  I've tried this variety and the oatmeal flax ones and both are very good. They have a dryish texture but are full of flavor.  Wouldn't say they're like home baked, but there is no "artificial" taste at all. They're generous in size (3 4 inches diameter, almost an inch high) and though not calorie lightweights (120 140 each depending on the variety), they have 3 4 grams of fiber each. Highly recommend these for healthy snacking or even a quick  eakfast.
