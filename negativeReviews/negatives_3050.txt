The packaging is great for a gift.  The teabags are pyramidal in shape.  As far as taste, if you're just looking for a tea that tastes like vanilla, then this Tazo  and will do it for you. If you're looking for rooibos tea with the pure rooibos taste, then the addition of vanilla at least in this  and of tea, Tazo, will disappoint you.  The raw rooibos taste, without these "improvements" such as vanilla, is full bodied and has its own unique taste.  I found myself being drawn more to the pure rooibos teas from Twinings, Republic of Tea, and Numi.
