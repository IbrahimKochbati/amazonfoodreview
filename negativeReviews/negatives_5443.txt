Taste: This coffee tastes like the coffee you get at a convenience store like 7 11 or at a bad fast food restaurant. It's weak flavored.          Smell: Smells like mediocre coffee. I prefer the rich aroma of starbucks or dunkin donuts coffee. McDonald's coffee tastes better and smells better.          Low acid: I didn't get heartburn after drinking this so I guess it works for that. I'd rather have a tasty cup of decaf than pay to drink this stuff.
