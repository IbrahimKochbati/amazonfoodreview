I was first introduced to these mustards in Ireland.  They are amazing and I was happy to find them on Amazon.  My favorite of the three is the Irish Whiskey flavor.  The Guinness flavor is amazing as well.  A little pricey for the amount you get (7.2 oz) but they're so good it's worth the expense.  Highly recommended!!
