My vet gave me this tip. I have had two cats with digestion problems, problems that they liked to make mine! My vet suggested 1 2 jar for a 10 lb or larger cat, 1 4 jar for a less     than 10 lb cat...per day or every other day. For some reason this settles their stomachs.     And they stopped purging on my carpet or my down comforter! They think it is a kitty treat.     I think it is a miracle.
