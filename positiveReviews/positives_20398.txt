We had such a time getting the little one to eat cereal b c everytime her stomach would hurt. Luckily, we found this at our local grocery & it worked great...No more stomach ache. Sadly, the item was discontinued at the local store so we searched Amazon and found it! Definitely saved us until her tummy started getting used to real food!
