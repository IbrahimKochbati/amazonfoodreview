I added this to my order since I was going to be paying shipping charges anyway.  I didn't expect anything unusual.  There probably are as many jerk recipes as there are residents in Jamaica.  But this one surprised me pleasantly.  It wasn't full of sugar and added a really pleasant note to everything I cooked with it.  I will be buying it again.
