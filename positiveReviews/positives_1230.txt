Harmony Farms produces EXCELLENT dog food products!  Our 8 month soft coated wheaten terrier is sensitive to gluten, corn meal and other products generally found in the popular   ands.  We were preparing to take him to the vet at about 4 months old b c he had great difficulty eliminating    to the point of whining as he would attempt to go.  After more research on the  eed we purchased Harmony Farms at a local store    it was expensive but quickly resolved our puppy's digestive issues.  After 5 8 days on only Harmony Farms products our puppy was happy and healthy!          I was so happy to find Harmony Farms on Amazon!  It is more economical AND delivered right to our door.  Our puppy, Connor, eats only Harmony Farms dog food and treats and is a much happier puppy now. Definitely recommend it for soft coated wheaten terriers and other  eeds that have difficulty digesting the popular  ands.
