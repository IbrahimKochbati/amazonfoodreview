When I first started eating gluten free, I was happy with GF's Pantry's White Bread. As time went by however, I started looking for more taste, less crumble, and more versatility. I found it with Pamela's Wheat Free Gluten Free Bread Mix. The addition of sorghum flour lends a honey whole wheat taste and a nice structure to the finished product. I have made beautiful baked goods with this (all by hand, no stand mixer) including cinnamon buns, yummy chewy pizza crust, pie crust, French  ead, pretzels, and the BEST gluten free bagels I have ever had. It's also vegan. So those with dairy or egg intolerance can play with it too! Amazon's Subscribe and Save program makes this an affordable option that I can share with my whole family. It's not just called, Mom's  ead, now.
