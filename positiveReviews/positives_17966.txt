My wife and I have been long time Shake N Bake fans... but seeing that they now have the mix in great smaller packages has made it even better.          With 3 of us to feed, the traditional box size Shake N Bake is too much. The new size provides plenty of mix to coat several pork chops.          The taste? The same great crunch you expect. The product is always fresh and never stale because of the small pouch.
