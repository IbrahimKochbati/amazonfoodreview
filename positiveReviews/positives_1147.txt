These smell so good and are cute and a great size, with a bend in the middle to help roll, and holds together really well with tasty glue. Definitely recommend. Smell like strawberry bubble gum, doesn't really affect flavor too much, but better than plain ones and very sweet. Box says "printed with soy ink" so it's clean and I don't have to worry about ridiculous chemicals for the graphics.
