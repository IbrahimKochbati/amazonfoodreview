While living for a month in Scotland in a self catering we had settled into this tea from the Co Op as our favorite. When we returned to the states we put away our coffee machine and went with pots of tea for  eakfast. Great stuff! The longer you steep it the fuller the flavor ... max about 8 minutes. Brought home 4 boxes in our suitcases. The tea was so good we donated clothes to the local charity to make room for it. When we got back to the states and ran out we replinished our supply with Amazon ... thanks for being so global Amazon! : ) Cheers!
