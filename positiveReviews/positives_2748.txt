I ordered two of these bags for my three dogs   a mastiff, a lab, and a terrier mutt.  They arrived well packaged inside cardboard boxes.  The dogs like the food, their coats are shiny, and the mastiff didn't vomit when beginning this new food.  He has problems when switching foods, but he started on the Diamond Naturals with no problems.  I'm going to continue to buy this food for my dogs.
