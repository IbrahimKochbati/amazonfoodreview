You have to plan ahead a little bit, becuase the dough has to "rest" for an hour, but I was REALLY satisfied with the outcome. Since going gluten wheat free about 2 months ago, I have not had my very favorite food   pizza. Today I planned ahead and made the crust with Pamela's mix. I don't have a heavy duty mixer, so I just stirred it by hand with a wooden spoon for 3 minutes (the directions say to stir with the mixer on medium speed for 3 minutes). It turned out just fine. I used cooking spray on a large rectangular insulated cookie sheet and it  owned nicely and didn't stick at all (even though my oven usually runs hot and burns). After I topped it I put it back in the oven for 10 minutes, and then slid it off off the cookie sheet directly on to the rack to crisp up a bit. It tasted great, although if I could criticize at all it was a little on the sweet side for pizza crust, but it was still great and satisfied my pizza craving.
