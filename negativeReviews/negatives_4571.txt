I got this as a gift loved it...I even got everyone I know to buy one  after they used mine...BUt sadly after about 8months to a year my started to have problems cups were not filling all the way or no filling at all...I know alot of K cups are plugging and not allowing for full strength...then about the same time several people I know that have them had the same problem..I have the carbon filter and use a whole house water softener system so mineral deposits are not my problems....Search the internet this is a very well known problem..
