When I was young, my mom owned a couple goats that gave our family fresh milk.  Recently, I discovered Meyenberg Powdered Goat Milk and was surprised to find out that it tastes just like the fresh goat's milk I remember.  It even has the thick cream layer fresh milk has.          However, it would be awesome if the product came in larger cans.  I ended up emptying the 12 ounce can rather quickly because I used my large Blender Bottle to mix three cups at a time, and this, unfortunately, depleted one can of powdered milk in record time (one can makes 12 cups liquid).
