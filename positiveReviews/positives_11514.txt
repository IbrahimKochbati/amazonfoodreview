I have been using different seasonings for years. I have found that with this seasoning, Vegetable Magic, that I do not have to use anything else when seasoning my food. It has just the right amount of spiciness to it. We use it on everything, including meats, soups, etc. Not only vegetables. I would give this 5 stars and would recommend it 100%. We tried it about a year ago for the first time. We went through a whole canister in a year and there are only 2 people at home. It goes far, but we love it!! I just got another one!!
