I thought our days of having delicious grinders, Cuban midnight sandwiches, calzones and other treats were over when I found out that my children and I had celiac disease.  Not so!  You can make all kinds of goodies with this mix, and we keep it as a pantry staple.  It's quick and easy to mix, needing only egg, oil and milk and unlike a lot of other gluten free doughs, it's not sticky which makes it easy to roll out, or form into shapes. We love it.
