Yes this is a good deal on coffee, but at least for this variety and roast I was kind of let down.     I like a dark roast on coffee, French Full City Italian. When I opened up this bag I was pleased with the aroma and the oil on the bean. The  ew itself was good, but I couldn't shake the burnt after taste, this kinda ruined the next cup for me.
