After 2 years, this took one too many headers off the stairs and  oke into (large) pieces, which Destrcto dog enjoyed chewing on (but not chewing up).  Smarter dog took a few hours to get the hang of this one    she still barks at it occasionally   total crack up!  Destructo dog was just baffled till there were pieces...  Good thing Smart dog shares!!
