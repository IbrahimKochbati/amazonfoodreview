These are great, only wish I had tried them earlier.  I had originally put off purchasing these thinking I wouldn't use them, but I was wrong.  I use these daily, in oatmeal, yogurt, on top of salad, mixed into soup.  They taste like whatever you mix them with and really help you feel full longer!  Highly recommend!
