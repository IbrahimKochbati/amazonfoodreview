I bought a multi box of flavors but this was the absolute best flavor (IMHO) in there so it's the one I'll comment on.  Spicy, sweet, flavorful, fun, crispy, lower fat than chips, I loved it.  I'll be buying more but only of this flavor.  The other flavors weren't so great (salt & pepper and cheddar aren't too bad) but this one rocked.
