Fergus (1 year old terrier mix) loves his tug a jug! It dispenses his kibble just often enough that he stays interested, but not so quickly that it's empty in a few minutes. Plus, it's pretty big (I bought the small medium) and doesn't get stuck under the furniture, unlike some of the other, similar toys I've tried.
