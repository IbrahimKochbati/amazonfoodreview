i dont have picky dogs, they eat just about anything you give them, and these were no exception. didn't have any problems whatsoever, just happy dogs! would recommend these if you're looking for organic treats for your dogs. all of my dogs are around 25 30lbs, so they're small but not tiny either and they didn't having any problems getting them down.
