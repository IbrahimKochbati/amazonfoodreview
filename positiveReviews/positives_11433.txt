About two years ago we bought a product from China at Costco that was "dog chews".     I have an Australian Shepard that can chew up anything, and she ate the Costco chews and was literally coughing up blood.     I couldn't imagine it was the product, after all Costco is a good store.     We took her to the vet and she checked out fine.     So a month later the dog had been fine, decided to try again. Same Result, once sick dog, blood coming out of her mouth.     The chews did not cut her. We took her to the vet and he could find no reason for her to be bleeding, it was coming up from her throat. I called and reported this to a lot of people and heard from them similar stories. Only thing that bothered me was Costco didn't seem to care and didn't respond to our calls and letters, which were courteous, we didn't blame their store, just wanted them to know the product they were selling was harmful.          Made me very upset that I was so stupid to trust anything from China, and especially that I gave it to my dog again. I still feel very badly about it, and have not bought ANYTHING from China since that day, nothing, not cloths or shoes, nothing. Makes it hard to shop in Wally world.          Thank you for carrying these products.
