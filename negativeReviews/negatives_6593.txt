I was highly disappointed in the popcorn.  I have the whirlypop maker and couldn't wait to get this popcorn to have the theatre popcorn taste.     The first time the popping liquid was runny and the second time it was solid.  Each time it didn't work as the directions said it would and when it does finally start to pop it burns.......... HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED   sorry I bought 3 5 packs
