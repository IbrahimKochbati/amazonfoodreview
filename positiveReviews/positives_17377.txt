I ordered these this week from my organic foods delivery service. OH MY WORD! Spicy (but not burning spicy, more like tongue warming), sweetish, salty...a really strongly flavored and delicious chip. If you like barbecue flavor, this is a nice sweet Mexi fied barecue.          I also like that it's organic.          I ate the 5 oz bag in less than 15 minutes. My bad. But dang, if they're not sinfully delicious.          Granted, 5oz is not a whole lot (it was skimpy for the price, which is often the case when it comes to organic), but it was 750 calories at a pop. Geesh.          Yes, 150 cals per 1 oz serving. That's about par for the course for fried chips.          Verdict: Fattening, crispy, flavorful, delicious. Best to stick to very small servings on the side of a low fat sandwich or soup.          Enjoy.          Mir
