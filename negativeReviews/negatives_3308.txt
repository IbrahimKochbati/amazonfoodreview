I was excited to offer these seemingly healthy treats to my dog, as I love other Newman's Own products such as their spaghetti sauce.  My dog Kirby was very excited as I opened the package and announced "Ooooh, I have a treeeeeat for you!" in the high pitched voice I use to get him worked up.  However, it was all downhill from there.  He eagerly took a cookie in his mouth, then gave me a look like "Seriously?"  He will eat them, but only if there is nothing better going.       My husband was going to try one to give a second opinion.  However, after smelling them he announced that they smell like burnt oatmeal and probably taste like it too, and he refused to try them.       I give these 2 stars because I would like my dog to eat them (as opposed to fatty pig ears), but he really doesn't care much for them.  He gets about as excited to eat these as I do to eat a Triscuit.
