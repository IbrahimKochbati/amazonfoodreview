I purchased this canned pumpkin to have a ready supply of it for some low cal, weight watchers type desserts that I like to make in the fall and winter... I am totally satisfied and happy with this purchase, as I have been with all products that I have purchased thru amazon.com... and their service is always perfect; they let you know when an item will be shipped, and give you a chance to skip a shipment if you want to as well... have never encountered a prob yet here, I am happy to say... and their prices cannot be beat...
