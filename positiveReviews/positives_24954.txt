I have a beautiful oldie but goodie huskie who was suffering from hip and joint pains. After trying other products, I happened upon Happy Hips. He absolutely loves the taste and I was amazed at his results. He is back to actually running up and down stairs again. He is 15 years old and could not be doing better.
