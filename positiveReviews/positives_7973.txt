I eat a mix of this along with the [ASIN:B000E4ALF6 Nature's Path Organic Heritage Flakes Cereal, 32 Ounce Bags] nearly every morning.  This is good healthy food unlike the popular sugary cereals most Americans eat.  I enjoy the taste, and it doesn't leave me starving by mid morning.  The price is also more reasonable when I buy it by the case.
