No caffeine, no high fructose corn syrup, 100% juice, nothing artificial. What's not to like?          I hate to write anything negative because I don't want to discourage development of any products that avoid HFCS. But, to be honest, The Switch Orange Tangerine doesn't smell very good. If you're familiar with Airborne Cold Remedy, well, it smells like that. I think I was expecting a fragrance like Tang instant beverage. I certainly didn't expect it to smell like it does. It's not all that bad, it's just not real good.          I also think this product would actually taste better if it weren't carbonated.          The calories are about the same as a typical soda. But they're fruit juice calories instead of HFCS, so that's a big plus in my book.
