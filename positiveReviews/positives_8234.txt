It's true. If he doesn't get his delicious  eakfast oatmeal he freaks out. So we buy it by the case and everyone stays happy. It's a better price than our local grocery.          This is a great, easy hot cereal with plenty of fiber and other good stuff. Despite all the added seeds, the flavor is still basic enough to support add ins like dried fruit,  own sugar, honey, etc. It's also good plain and will keep you satisfied all morning. I also like this  and's cold cereals.
