This bags are very difficult to open with the aid of some tool, such as scissors, don't even try without scissors.          They are crispy and taste like chips that aren't advertised as being salted. They definitely aren't healthy, because I can feel the grease all over my fingers when eating them, and I can see the grease at the bottom of the bag, too.          They are high quality chips, and deserve to be put on your table.
