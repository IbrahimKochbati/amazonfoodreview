They're alright. But not what I expected. I was hoping it would be more like the other  ands of dried apples   crispy, but then melt in your mouth. I bought these for my toddler, but the pieces are big, hard, and do not melt in your mouth. I'm afraid they present a bit of a choking hazard for a one year old.          On the  ight side   they are NOT made in China! I suppose if you're into dried apples for yourself, they should work.
