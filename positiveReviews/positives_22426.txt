This stuff is great. I use it in my whirley pop and it makes perfect popcorn. Flavor is pretty darn close to movie theater. Everyone in my family loves this stuff. I do like a bit more salt on my popcorn but this can be a bit too salty even for me. I cut the salt pack open before the rest and take out the salt. I would say I use about half to 3 4 what comes in the pack. Then I cut the rest of the pack open and dump it all in. This is about the right amount of salt for me. The only problem is the salt is butter flavored so you loose a bit of flavor doing this. I'd say make a batch like normal first and then adjust the salt to taste if needed. That's an easy fix. I save the salt and then I use it for future popcorn making without the kit.          If I can find some smaller sample packs to try of other  ands, I may look into that in the future when it's time to order more. But if I don't ever find anything else, this stuff is pretty good.
