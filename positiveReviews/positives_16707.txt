I purchased these for my 19 lb beagle.  They actually came in a holiday box (I didn't know this until I opened my amazon box), which would've been great had I been giving them as a gift.  They are the perfect size for my dog, and she devours them!  Note:  It is recommended that you give your dog only one treat per day.
