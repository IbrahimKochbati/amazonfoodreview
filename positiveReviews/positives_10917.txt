To handle these treats, one would believe that nothing short of a table vice would do much damage to them. However, before I had opened the bag for the first time I had already used the word treat in front of our Papillon and Pomeranian and, as any dog owner knows, there is no turning back after the T word. I was honestly afraid that my dogs might chip a tooth on these treats, and so I hesitantly offered one up under close observation. Amazingly, after being dropped and picked up a couple of times, both dogs dedicated a few minutes to the treats and refused to give up.          While I would not imagine that these would be enjoyable, or edible, for my dogs, they absolutely love them. I suppose if they were human treats my opinion would weigh a little more on my rating, but they are for dogs and my dogs love them.
