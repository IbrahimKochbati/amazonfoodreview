Okay, these are pretty darn tasty.  I have tried several different  ands of veggie jerky, and so far, these are my faves.  I've tried several different flavors (Texas Barbecue ranks at the top of my list), and they're all pretty good.          They are pretty moist, almost to the point of being a little saucy.  They can be just a bit messy to eat, but the benefit is that they are GREAT to eat on a sandwich!  Terrific by themselves and amazing on  ead... makes me smile.          The packaging can get a little frustrating.  They are serrated at the top, so in theory, you should be able to tear the edge and open the entire package along the side of the strip.  Unfortunately, it doesn't exactly work that well.  A lot of times it will rip off and make it difficult to get the strip out of the package.  I just use scissors now.  Just a minor complaint.          But seriously, these things are delicious.  Even my carnivorous friends like them (and it's usually impossible to get them to touch a substitute).  Definitely recommend!
