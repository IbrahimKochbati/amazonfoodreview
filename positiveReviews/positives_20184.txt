I purchased this after watching a Dr. Oz show. I'm looking for the sugar substitute that doesn't have side effects. This takes a little getting use to because it has a different taste. You measure it just like sugar and it is very nice in whole wheat chocolate chip cookies and works just like sugar. I is a pale  own and acts like  own sugar and tastes a little like it also.          I am glad to have this safe choice. Is not suppose to spike your blood sugar and I think that is worth adjusting to it's taste.  Amazon has the very best offers for this product of all the places I looked.
