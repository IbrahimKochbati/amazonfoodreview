I went on a search for Japanese Black Sugar (from Okinawa) after my local Japanese Markets all stopped carrying it. I was introduced to black sugar while living with a girl from Kyoto for 3 years. She preferred using black sugar because she believed it was rich in minerals (I cannot confirm or verify this), but I came to prefer it in my coffee. bigtime. The taste is quite unlike other sugar.. with a strong molasses taste. the blocks are often darker on the outside, however, the taste is unmistakable, and this is quite definitely Black Sugar.     I am a bit of a coffee connoisseur, and I prefer to drink my coffee with real japanese black sugar or "Kuro Sato".     When I last ordered this product, it qualified for Free Super Saver shipping, which made it a good deal. Now the only shipping option available costs $10, which probably means that I'm going back to the local Japanese market, as they've started to re stock the granulated variety. If the shipping were a little more affordable I would favor this, as the price is decent, and the product is top notch.          that's my two cents anyways.     thanks!
