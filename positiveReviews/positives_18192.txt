These sweet potatoe chips were tasty with my only real objection being Maltodextrin which is hardly the "all natural nothing fake of phony" as advertized.  Yes it is derived from wheat or corn but this highly processed food flavoring is hardly what most would consider when we hear "all natural no fake flavors"   of course they are technically telling the truth it is just a natural sourced  highly processed, sweetner from starch and a source of carbs.          So aside from the weasel words in the label the product is fine  I just wish they wouldn't try and pretend to be something they are not   they are  snack food   we expect some downside
