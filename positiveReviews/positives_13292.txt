I tried these  ownies per recommendation from a friend.  They are truly delicious and in my opinion the best gluten free  ownies out there. They are a cinch to make in a moments notice and great just as they come, however I tried them with coconut and chopped pecans and they were beyond heavenly...hmmmmm...perfect with a cup of coffee..  These truly were a hit with everyone....Gfree or not!
