To Other Prospective Purchasers of Altoids Wintergreen Mints,       I have enjoyed these mints for many, many years. however, the latest batch I bought, after Wrigley's purchased the company, are truly horrible. You get a short burst of minty flavor and then at least an hour's worth of a synthetic chemical aftertaste which is quite unpleasant. I'll not buy them again unless Wrigley's returns to the original recipe. I guess they are saving a few cents by changing the recipe, but they are going to lose a whole lot of customers in my opinion.       I would have rated the old Wintergreen Altoids with all the stars in the firmament, but the new ones rate none at all. Don't buy them unless you have to.
