My friends, this is the original 40 oz tin! You get not one, but two tins! That's FIVE pounds! Royal Oak is the Industry standard in High Class Virginia peanuts.     These nuts are fresh, LARGE and CRUNCHY. You will not be able to keep your hands out of the tin. The very best Virginia Peanuts are Royal Oak in the Blue tin!!!
