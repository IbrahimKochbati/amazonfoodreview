Being married to a person from England, as most people know, they are known for their custom of having tea in the afternoon and always being made in a tea pot with loose tea. It is getting harder too find this in the stores and we are ever so grateful that we can buy it through Amazon. This is our favorite  ewing tea and it tastes great! Wouldn't get any other and the price is fantastic. So,if you are a tea lover like we are, give it a try.     Thanks for letting us keep up with tradition!!!!!
