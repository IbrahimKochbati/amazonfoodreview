My 13 year old cat wants to skip meals....all he wants is Whiskas Temptations!  He particularly LOVES the ones for hairball control.  He will find the place that they are stored and either knock then off a table or come to me, put his paw on my hand and look me straight in the eye until I give him.  He likes nothing  better that these treats! Got a good deal for them on line...saved several dollars on 32 bags!!
