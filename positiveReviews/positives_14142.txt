I would not feed my dogs anything but blue buffalo.  I have tried various very high quality dog foods, but for many different reasons they did not meet all of my criteria for health and likeability for my dogs.  Blue Buffalo meets their standard as they love it.  Their coats are noticably improved.  I love the fact that I can buy in quantity and have it delivered to my front door.
