I cannot recommend buying this product.  I think the manufacturer is fobbing off its dented cans on Amazon customers!  Out of a package of 12 cans, only 3 were not dented in the package I received    and I see from other reviews that I am not the first to experience this.  I wish I'd read the reviews before placing my order.  I don't think this was an Amazon fault, since the flat was pre packaged and I think Amazon simply shipped the flat as they received it from the manufacturer.  Amazon took immediate and very good care of me in this situation, exceeding my expectations, so I have no quibble with them.
