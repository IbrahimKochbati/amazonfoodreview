This is the sugar I use for all my white sugar needs. It's very fine, somewhere between the dust like qualities of powdered sugar and regular sugar. It dissolves very well into drinks without that somewhat odd tastes powdered sugar can have because of the corn starch or the granularity of not dissolving completely like granulated sugar which makes it perfect for cold drinks.     When baking with it, because it's so fine, I usually use a scant cup (1 cup   1 tablespoon) instead of a full cup. That seems to work well for me.     Excellent for meringues and fudge because it's so fine and dissolves so well.
