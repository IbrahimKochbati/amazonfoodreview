Cat grass, also known as wheat grass, is a great plant for anyone. I typically don't do any type of gardening, but I had no trouble getting these seeds to sprout and grow. These seeds make a great project for gardeners, cat lovers, and children, too.          The hardest part of caring for these plants is keeping your cats from keeping from devouring them completely! That's what happened to mine, at least, and my cats still    several months later    will check the area where I kept the cat grass for more of this tasty plant.
