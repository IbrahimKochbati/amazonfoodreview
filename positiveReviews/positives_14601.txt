Green Tea is amazing! I was first exposed to it while stationed in Okinawa many years ago. At first I did not like the taste because I was used to that cheap orange pekoe Lipton junk I grew up with. But after a day or two, I was hooked. Twinnings has captured that classic Green Tea energy. This tea is both relaxing and energizing, which makes it difficult to both describe and explain. However, when you try a tin, you will know what I mean. We now buy all our teas on Amazon because they have made it most affordable and very, very easy. Kudos to both Amazon and Twinnings...a winning combination!
