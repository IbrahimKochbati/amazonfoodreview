I love Shake and Bake   it's easy to prepare (shake it in a bag and toss it in the oven...DONE!), tastes great (and not overly seasoned), and clean up is easy (toss the bag...DONE!).  Like the Chicken Shake and Bake, the shaking bag is no longer included, but it's easy enough to use a Ziploc bag or put the Shake and Bake in a dish and coat your pork with it.  It bakes up quickly and keeps your pork fairly juicy.  To get the whole pork chop crispy, bake on a wire rack or crinkle your foil before putting the pork chop on top   if you place the pork chop directly on the pan, you may end up with a soggy bottom, due to the juices leaking out.  Still as "yum yum good!" now as it was when I was a kid!  Highly recommended!
