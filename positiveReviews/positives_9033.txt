I can finally get rid of the five boxes of K cups sitting on my counter.  The padded top of the drawer shelf means I don't get a rattling vi ation noise when the  ewer runs, and the drawer slide action is very smooth.  The drawer extends far enough out that it's easy to get the last cup in a row, so you can see all the cups at once   much better than digging around in a bunch of boxes.  The whole thing feels very sturdy, and has a nice modern look to it.
