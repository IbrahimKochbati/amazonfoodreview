Had high hopes for this coffee, as a reviewer stated that it had a natural coconut favor.  It is dreadful.  The product smells like coconut, but has an awful chemical taste.  It has a hideous flavor coupled with sickening vanilla background taste.  To top things off, it leaves a bitter after taste in your mouth.  This product is not drinkable.
