Zuma my Hairless Chinese Crested pup is a very finicky eater and would rather starve then eat something he doesn't like. The only food he will eat is Cesar Gourmet Filets in sauce...... OK  now to find a dog treat he likes. My husband  ought home "Cesar Grilled Chicken softies dog treats" and he LOVES them. The treats do look and smell like a dog treat and I thought there was no way Zuma would eat them.  So hundreds of dollars spent at numerous bog bakeries  and a year and a half spent shopping all all over the place, we found Cesar grilled chicken softies dog treats. We are not only thrilled, but relieved.
