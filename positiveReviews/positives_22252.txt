I got this set for my husband for part of his Christmas present and he loved it.  He didn't know that Dave's Insanity wasn't the hottest he could get until now   he immediately opened the Ultimate and started "practicing" eating it on crackers until it wouldn't make him sweat so he could embarrass his  other by making him sick with it when we went home for the holidays.  Next year I'm getting the bloody mary mix as a stocking stuffer, and maybe the nuts too.
