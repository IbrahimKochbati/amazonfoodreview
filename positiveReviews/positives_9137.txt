Erin's "cookies" are the awesome   great for an on the run family when there's no time for a longer  eakfast.  I keep them on hand at all times for my kids so they can grab one when they go out the door to school or work......I even keep two in my car console for those moments when I need some fast nutrition while driving.  Tasty, good for you and quick    as an active family, what more could we want?
