I normally don't give my dog rawhide, because they usually make him throw up.  However, based on the reviews here, I decided to try these since he is getting older now (9 years old) and does need some help keeping his teeth clean.  Here is my pro con list:          Pro:       Amazon ships these to you fast       dog loved these at first lick       I ordered large size (my dog is ~80lbs) and it kept him busy for about 20 30mins.  A normal bone (busy bone, dentabone, etc) would normally only last 5mins       Seems to make his  eath smell better too          Cons:       Price, but for what you get, this might not really be a con       I think it gives my dog gas          I recommend trying this product, especially if you have tried normal rawhides with no success.
