Mild Everidae sauce is like a condiment. It goes on everything and doesn't take over the flavor of the food but enhances it. I use this sauce on burgers, shredded pork, grilled chicken, baked chicken, eggs, as a pizza sauce substitute, and basically anything. My kids love the mild kick and flavorful enhancement of the mild sauce. My 10 and 6 year old put it on everything and rave! It will change your cooking and challenge you to try it on everything!
