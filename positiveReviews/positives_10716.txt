I have two dogs, an Alaskan Malamute and a Shiba Inu. Generally speaking, neither of them are exactly treat shy and will eat almost any snack you put in front of them. That being said, when I opened up the bag of Newman's and let them try one of the Lamb and Barley treats, they loved it. Usually with dry treats my dogs will sniff them and give you a look of "Ok, this is nice, but where's the dried chicken or duck jerky?" and only eat them after realizing that there's nothing else coming. With the Newman's Own, they sniffed them once and immediately started chowing down without so much as a "What else ya got?" look.          While these treats are amazing and made with 95% organic ingredients, there are a few caveats. First they are very, very dry and hard. Each treat is made up of two squares, made to be  eakable down the center scoring if you wanted to divide the treat up. Each square is approximately 1"x1". Breaking apart the squares will help release a little of the odor of the biscuits   after the first time I gave the dogs these treats, they started snubbing them a bit until I would  eak a piece off. I think that perhaps the outer portion of the snack gets dried out and no longer has any smell that the dogs can detect (or it's really faint). Once you  eak them apart, the dogs recognize the smell and eat it up. Since they are so hard however   if you have an older dog with teeth issues, this is probably not the best treat for them.          Second, since the snack is so dry, it is very crumbly. If you have a dog that only eats the chunks and never cleans up the crumbs, you'll have a mess to deal with every time they eat these. As my dog  eaks apart the treat, it deteriorates into several pieces including minute crumbs. My dogs generally lick the floor until everything's picked up, but if you have a plush carpet, this might be something to consider.          Other than that, my dogs love these treats and I'll probably be picking up more in the future.
