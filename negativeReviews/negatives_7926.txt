Here is some better info. It is a voluntary recall for the Venison line mostly. It's not related to the other deaths.          [...]     Natural Balance Pet Foods,Â® Inc. Issues A Voluntary Nationwide Recall on Specific Venison Dog & Cat Food Products          Contact:     Consumer Inquiries:     (800) 829 4493     Media Inquiries:     Daniel Bernstein     310 275 0777          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Pacoima, CA    April 17, 2007   Natural Balance, Pacoima, CA, is issuing a voluntary nationwide recall for all of its Venison dog products and the dry Venison cat food only, regardless of date codes. The recalled products include Venison and Brown Rice canned and bagged dog foods, Venison and Brown Rice dog treats, and Venison and Green Pea dry cat food. Recent laboratory results show that the products contain melamine. We believe the source of the melamine is a rice protein concentrate. Natural Balance has confirmed this morning that some production batches of these products may contain melamine.          The recall was prompted by consumer complaints received by Natural Balance involving a small number of cats and dogs that developed kidney failure after eating the affected product.          Dogs or cats who have consumed the suspect food and show signs of kidney failure (such as loss of appetite, lethargy and vomiting) should be seen by a veterinarian. We recommend our customers immediately stop feeding our recalled venison products regardless of date code and return unused product to their retailer for a full refund.          The products are packaged in bags, cans and zip lock treat bags and sold in pet specialty stores and PetCo nationally.     No other Natural Balance products are involved in this voluntary recall as none of our other formulas include the rice protein concentrate.          Although the problems seem to be focused on a particular production period of the venison products, over the last four days we have notified our distributors and retailers by phone and e mail to immediately stop selling and return all recalled Venison dog foods and treats and the Venison dry cat food. Venison canned cat food is not involved.          The source of the melamine appears to be a rice protein concentrate, which was recently added to the dry venison formulas. Natural Balance does not use wheat gluten, which was associated with the previous melamine contamination.          We continue to work closely with the FDA in their ongoing investigation.          Consumers with questions may contact the company at 1 800 829 4493 or email [...]          another one:          Breaking Voluntary Recall News: Thursday, April 26th, 2007          Our canned food manufacturer, American Nutrition, from Ogden Utah, just informed us that they are recalling all canned products made in their plant that contain rice protein concentrate. American Nutrition continued by telling us that they added this ingredient to four of our canned products without our knowledge or consent. The four products involved are:          Chicken Formula Canned Dog Food 13 oz     Lamb Formula Canned Dog Food 13 oz     Beef Formula Canned Dog Food 13 oz     Ocean Fish Formula Canned Cat Food 3 oz & 6 oz          There have been no illnesses reported related to feeding these formulas, however, to comply with the American Nutrition recall of the four products, we are pulling all dates and batches of these four formulas. We also ask that our customers return unused product for a full credit to their store.          To make sure that this does not happen in the future, we are demanding from each of our co manufacturers daily production record of all of our formulas before they are shipped to us and written certification of NO rice protein or any deviation of our formulas. We have reviewed all of our other products and determined that they are free of rice protein concentrate and that all of our other product labels are accurate.
