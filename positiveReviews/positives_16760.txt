I have tried all of the Madhava Organic Agave nectars,  this is my favorite for using with the Celestional Seasonings Herbal cold  ew teas, it keeps the teas fresh and clean without a too sweet taste. I use this for all my cooking  and tea making,I highly recommend using this as a healthy alternative to white sugar. What I like best about using the agave, I use less and have the same results and at times much better results.
