I confess, I was originally looking at a different "name"  and, but they were out of the salt and vinegar, which is the only flavor I eat.  I had never even heard of Uncle Ray's, let alone tried them, but the price was reasonable and it helped me qualify for free super saver shipping.  I am happy to say I was very pleasantly surprised with these chips.  Somehow or another, even though they just seem to be in a normal box, when I opened that first bag I had a nice mix of big chips and little chips.  The salt and vinegar blend well, so much so that the flavors sometimes sneak up on you   it sometimes seems that with the first crunch you taste salt and the second crunch gives the vinegar.  In any case, they're terrific.  I was a little reluctant about buying a somewhat large quantity of an unknown product, but I'm very glad I took the chance.
