I decided to buy the Stash ORGANIC chamomile tea this time and since I drink a lot of it, I decided to use the "Subscribe and Save" feature to save 15% and receive it regularly. IT IS TASTELESS! Hope Amazon will give me a refund.  If not, I am stuck with 6 boxes that will end up in the green waste bin. Cancelled the "Subscribe and Save" feature. Calling Amazon for a refund right now.
