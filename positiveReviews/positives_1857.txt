This is probably my favorite k cup so far. I'm no professional taster so talk of flavor notes in coffee or elsewhere usually leaves me scratching my head and thinking, "if you say so...". But at my first sip of this dark, smooth coffee, I though chocolate. It's not flavored or sweet but, for me, it has a "note" of good, dark chocolate. Highly recommended if you like your coffee strong and full of flavor.
