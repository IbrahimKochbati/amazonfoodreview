Two of my dogs were having occasional seizures.  So with a little research, I was told to give them foods treats low in preservatives.  At first some of my dogs were not to crazy about the blander taste, but they soon adapted.  It's been about 3 4 months since I made the switch to low preservative foods, and I've witnessed no more seizures in my dogs.
