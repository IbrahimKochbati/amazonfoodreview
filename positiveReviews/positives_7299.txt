This makes for a great centerpiece on a dining room coffee table as well as a great conversation piece!  I have to convince friends that this isn't a real live Bonsai tree when they see it.  It's very convincing, which is to be expected considering that this is just a real tree that's been preserved.          My tree doesn't have the look of the picture, and the  anches are much more bushy wild, but it still looks fantastic.  I could always trim it if I wanted to make it more sparse but I like it how it is.  The moss is a nice touch, and the pebbles look great and are glued in so they won't fall out.          Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase!
