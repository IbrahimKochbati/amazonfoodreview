This 8.3 ounce can of carbonated beverage is tangy and tasty. And the slimmer size can means that you are drinking a smaller serving than an ordinary can of soda. But although it's 100% juice, it still packs quite the calorie punch. One can is 140 calories, which is almost exactly the same as in a 12 oz. can of regular Coca Cola! So it may be slightly healthier than drinking Coke since it has no caffeine or high fructose corn syrup and it has 100% of your requirement of Vitamin C. But it's not going to make you as slim and attractive as the packaging!
