My dogs (English Springer Spaniels) get a chew every morning after their  eakfast. But I always make sure that it is a specific kind of chew and CET Chews meet that requirement.  The dogs like the taste and eagerly attack this chew while cleaning their teeth in the same mode.     The chews I purchased are a nice size for medium to large dogs and if you are looking for a good dental chew, then this product comes highly recommended.     I will surely purchase this again for my dogs.
