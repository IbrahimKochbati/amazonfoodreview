My large puppy (8 mo., 70 lbs, Doberman Am. Bulldog mix) needed a lot of help getting the food out while the rope was intact, but after he shredded the rope after about two days of gnawing, everything changed.  I cut the inside knot off and left it inside the bottle so that it would slow down the exit of the kibbles.  So now the kibbles come out much easier, but not too easily.          Bottom line, with this slight modification, my puppy LOVES his purple bottle, and the 10 minutes that he spends throwing the bottle around to get his food out is 10 minutes less that he's chewing on things that he shouldn't be or otherwise being naughty.
