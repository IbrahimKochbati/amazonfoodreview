Try putting a tennis ball inside the bottle. My Border collie chewed the rope out too  to make it more challenging then just knocking it over and treats spilling out really easy, I put a smaller sized tennis ball inside so she still has to work the bottle back and forth in order to get the treats to go from the back of the bottle to the neck. Hope this helps!  Ali & *Kylie *the border collie flat coat retriever mix
