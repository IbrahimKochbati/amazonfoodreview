My dog loves Stella and Chewy's, especially the carnivore kisses (dog crack), so I thought I'd try these.  My dog refuses to eat these.  She won't even bury them for future use.  She just gives me a look and spits them out.  I tried giving them to my mom's dog since mine won't eat them, but her dog doesn't want anything to do with them either.  I don't know why they don't like them.
