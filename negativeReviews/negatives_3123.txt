I love a good cup of coffee & the scent of it is one of the best parts, from how it smells before  ewing to the final product. So when I got the chance to try out the Melitta  and of coffee (something I've seen in some of my local grocery stores) for free, I figured what the heck? What resulted is a cup of coffee that is better than many of the average  ands out there, but still not as good as the coffee that I  ew at my bookstore job (when I work in the cafe).          The scent of this coffee is great, so in that aspect it really didn't disappoint. It's also french press friendly, but then most coffees are. (But I thought I'd mention it since that's how I  ewed my coffee.) I like my coffee strong, so I put more than the recommended amount & came out with a cup of coffee that was a little weaker than I generally like it.          The taste of this is very good & is better than the Folgers coffee my mother gets (which I can either take or leave), FAR better than the shoddy Aramark coffee that is served at my full time job (but then anything is better than that stuff), but not as good as the stuff that I make at the bookstore (my part time job) or the Dunkin Donuts  and coffee that a coworker makes. (He's got a specific way he makes it.) And compared to the pricey gourmet stuff my dad buys? This is swill in comparison. (But in all fairness, even my precious cafe coffee is swill in comparison. Like I said, my dad buys the good stuff.)          Would I buy a bag of this product with my own money? Sure, if it was on sale in my local grocery store. It's a decent cup & I'm curious enough that I'd try some of the other flavors out there. Offhand though, I'd rather spend 8 to 12 dollars on a bag of the stuff at my bookstore job & drink that instead. Before buying bulk amounts of this coffee I'd recommend that any potential buyers purchase a bag at their local stores first. The price for three bags of this is decent (six dollars) since the bags of this go for about seven to eight dollars in my neck of the woods.
