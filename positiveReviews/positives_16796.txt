This Chocolate Sampler Gift Basket arrived today, October 25, 2011.  I noticed, with delight, that one of my favorites was included....Chocolate Covered Peanuts!  When I opened the box, I expected to munch on a few.  Imagine my dismay when I discovered that everything had melted together in one BIG messy clump that was awkward to  eak apart!          It appears that this shipment had been left somewhere warm, where the chocolate melted, then was placed somewhere cool where the chocolate hardened into a clump.  I haven't opened the other packages of chocolate yet so I'm not sure what I will find when it comes time to open them in subsequent days.          Update on October 26, 2011:          I opened the small package marked "Kenzi Confections, All Natural Chocolate Napolitans Milk Product of Belgium".  This small box was wrapped similar to a gift.  However, when I took the Kenzi wrap off, I discovered that it covered a box labeled:  "Royal Orange Gelatin"!!!!  Inside was a handful of individually wrapped milk chocolate pieces which, like the chocolate covered peanuts, had been left somewhere warm, the chocolate melted, then was placed somewhere cool, and the chocolate re hardened.  Unfortunately, this made these chocolate pieces look unappetizedly funky!  The lack of appropriate nutritional information on this particular package was also irritating.)          Update   Thursday, October 27, 2011:          Opened the package marked "Kenzi Confections, All Natural Chocolate Napolitans Dark, Product of Belgium" and discovered that it actually covered a box labeled "Nestle Raisinets", which made it IMPOSSIBLE to know the appropriate nutritional information on this handful of candy.  These also had been melted and re hardened just like the other candies which caused them to look just as funky.          No Pun Intended but wrapping up my reviews   regarding the Kenzi Confections inside other boxes such as Goya Spanish Flan Style Custard and Kellog's Fruit Loops is off putting.  Makes me question the viability of the Kenzi Confection Company and why they can't afford their own packaging.          The Lindt Lindor Mint Chocolate Truffles could have been better if they had not been melted first.  The filling inside had oozed out during the melt which resulted in a messy unwrapping that was not fully anticipated.          The last, large, box looks suspiciously like a Kenzi Confection product because of the way it is "wrapped" with a label stating:  "Life is Like a Box of Chocolates", a well known quote from the film "Forrest Gump".  As of this writing, on October 30, 2011, I am about to open it to see what damage has been delivered.          Update   Wednesday, November 30, 2011          This evening, I received the official gift basket with a note that what I previously received was a prototype that should never have been released to the general public.  This official gift basket looks better than what I got about a month ago.  The chocolate covered peanuts are MUCH better this time around!  I'll still need to check the rest of the candies in the coming days.          Update   Tuesday,December 6, 2011          I've been sampling the new basket that I received and have been enjoying the chocolates this time around.  I have two more boxes left to taste, within the basket, and I'm looking forward to that.          Update   Wednesday, December 7, 2011          The final box I sampled was labeled:  "Life is Like a Box of Chocolate", like the line from the movie "Forrest Gump".  This box included candies such as salted(?!?) caramel, chocolate covered pretzel, chocolate covered graham cracker, chocolate marshmallow cups, chocolate peanut butter cups, and small biscuit cookies with chocolate on the bottom.          Others might like these.  The marshmallow cups didn't impress me much as I'm not into that kind of candy.  The salted caramel I didn't care for much either as I don't like the taste of salt to begin with.
