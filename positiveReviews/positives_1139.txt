   class "tiny"  Length:: 1:38 Mins              skip the Pad Thai. go for this.     edit: this soup has moved up to the #6 spot when I typed in Dr. McDougall today. I'm glad, because I want to order this for a while, and don't want this soup to be seen as unprofitable by Right Foods (Dr. McDougall).
