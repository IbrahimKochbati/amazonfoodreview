Let me say this first:  our family of 6 keeps a high protein, low carb diet, and we eat a lot of jerky each month ( avg 30 lbs).  We have tried a vast majority of jerky out there, and can tell a good jerky from bad.  I have no idea how can anyone leave this jerky a positive, not to mention gleaming review.  Must be the first time trying jerky.  FIRST:  there is NOTHING natural about this jerky.  Few noticed, but their packaging used to say "all natural", but NO MORE, because they know it is not.  Now it says " naturally hickory smoked", or the like.  WHO CARES.  your jerky has so much cr_p in it that naturally smoking it makes no difference.  This jerky is full of salt.  this jerky is packed with MSG   and i mean PACKED!!!  This jerky is quite greasy. NOTE:  Bulk packaging ( 1 lb bags) are a bit better than smaller bags, and meat type in bulk bags is different.  YES&lt; this company has absolutely zero consistency.  If you take 20 chunks out of a bulk bag, you will see that there are 4 5 different kinds of meats there.  some wil be moist and chewy, others will be nothing but rubber, some with thick tendons running through, and some are quite marbled.  Just when you find a piece to your liking   you are back searching for a lucky chunk again.  smaller bags, especially teriyaki is very greasy and has so much coating that you taste all the chemicals way before you get to meat flavor ( if you can call it that).          i'd give this jerky a 2 if there was meat consistency, but its a total crap shoot.  you can find LOTS of other   better tasting jerky in the same price range, here on amazon.  even the middle of the road obertos is much better than this stuff.  WILD RIDE JERKY IS A JOKE and IS GROSS.  Buy at your own risk, but know that you are buying a truly chemically processed and preserved jerky   full of MSG and 0ther additives.          OH, and those 1 lb cowboy stips bags?  Well,  there was exactly 10 oz of strips in a bag   rest was jerky shavings and bitsNpieces   similar to what oberto sells as bulk packages salad topper shavings of jerky   NO STRIPS!!!  we tried every flavor in their bulk  packaged variety and this holds true for every single package.
