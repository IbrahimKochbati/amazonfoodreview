Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B, 32 Ounce Jug:          I remember when my grandmother would make pancakes, waffles or potato pancakes and the maple syrup was just so delightful to the taste. She would warm it up on the old gas stove.  You'd think that all of the major  ands of "pancake syrup maple flavored," would stop using high fructose corn syrup.          One day last week I had the chance to take my granddaughter out grocery shopping with me.  Not one of my best things to do, but I thought, how would she learn to shop and look for the good stuff, not the crap that's advertised on television, but the products that really work and the one's that are good for you.  Reading the labels is a major chore as what you thought was in the product wasn't even close to being in the product. Somebody has to teach her and it was my lucky day.          Take for example, pancake syrup or what used to be called maple syrup in my day.  You look at the labels, today... never is there mention of a maple tree, not even close, all fructose or high fructose corn syrup.  So, I told her that maple syrup comes from sugar maple tree sap that has the water content reduced and I asked her if she could find a reference to a maple tree in the contents.  Well, you know the answer, there isn't any on the major or store  ands.          I told her that Coombs makes a maple syrup that reminded me of when I was growing up.  Well, after a few grocery stores later and checking their stock we came across the Coombs Family Farms Maple Syrup.          Now, I know, I've been telling my granddaughter about how I grew up, so she wasn't going to let me off the hook so easily.  You guessed it... I made pancakes and we used the Coombs Family Farms Maple Syrup, warmed up on the stove just like grandma did.  She said, "That's the best Maple Syrup I've ever tasted."  I told her that's because it's real maple syrup.          A lesson learned, and I was pleased to make pancakes for my granddaughter, this is one of those moments you don't forget in life.
