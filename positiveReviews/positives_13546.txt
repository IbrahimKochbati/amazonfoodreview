I love this tea! Just as another reviewer said, Yogi Tea's Breathe Deep is phenomenally effective for asthma!     I recently moved into a rented house where a cat lived for 7 years; I have cat asthma, and have struggled to regain my normal  eathing. I still use my Albuterol inhaler when necessary, and check in with my doctor (read: I'd still recommend traditional medicine), but nothing has worked as well as this tea! I've been drinking 3 4 cups day, and have noticed a substantial improvement    not just during the rest of the day, but the following days    even when I drink only 1 cup. No one can underestimate the feeling of being able to  eathe freely. This tea is a lifesaver!
