I am amazed by how well this tea works to relieve my chronic congestion and recurring sinus problems. And it's not just a "quick" fix either    its therapeutic effects last for hours. I was a bit worried the tea would be a bit too "licorice y" since one of its main ingredients is licorice root, but the fragrance and taste are mild and incredibly soothing. If you think this package of six boxes is too much, you'll be happily proven wrong ... I would stock my entire garage with this tea if I could!
