I found this to be a nice alternative to juice and to the usual pepsi that I normally drink.          It had a nice light flavor with just a little carbonation.  I don't believe tangerine is the right name for the taste. I would say a tart orange juice is more accurate. However, the name of the drink does not take away from the quality of the product.          I let my children try a little bit of this and they too thought it was a very good taste.          The cans are small, smaller than a coke can, but I found one to quench my thirst better than any of the caffeinated drinks I would normally pick up.
