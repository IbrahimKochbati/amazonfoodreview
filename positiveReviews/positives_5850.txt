A great sauce if you can find it locally.  My Giant carries it for less than a couple of bucks a can.  The flavor is great, very good tomato taste with a good bit of tanginess.  Not sweet at all but there is a hint of tomato sweetness.  I never thought I'd find something this good in a can.  I bought one because it looked out of place on the store shelf so it had to be good.  I've read reviews on a pizza making forum and most of the people grudgingly concede its a good sauce.
