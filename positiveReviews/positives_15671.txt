My cat is diabetic and was on insulin twice a day. I started researching and found that this was the highest protien lowest carb wet cat food I could get. My 15 year old cat now eats Petite Cuisine morning and night and has Purina DM Diebetic management dry food available 24 hours a day and he is no longer on any insulin. He loves the Petite Cuisine it is ALL Natural and looks and smells like people food. I'm afraid to taste it but the ingredients are all good enough for humans so they are great for my cat!! I strongly recomend this food.
