I never write reviews for things I purchase.. but this product is definately something I'll never go without for my babies! I switched my 3 cats to this approx 10months ago, not only has my cat lost weight (he was weighing in at 23lbs while eating meow mix, he now weighs 17) all the cats have better  eath and are much more playful.  I purchase this at walmart at only pay about $14, which is only $2 more than what i was paying for meow mix. My babies love this food, and its obviously a lot better for them.. looks like we've found a food of choice!!          Spook 17bs, 3yo     Twinkie 8.5lbs, 6yo     Betelguese 7lbs, 1yo
