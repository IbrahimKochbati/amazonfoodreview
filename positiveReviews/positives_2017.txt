Gum made without sugar substitutes isn't easily obtained these days, so I was happy to find Chiclets through Amazon Prime.  Sugar substitutes present problems for persons sensitive to them, so it's good to have the option of gum made the old fashioned way. Another source for this and other gum from yesteryear is Vermont Country Store online; however VCS sells the same box of Chiclets for $14.95, so clearly Amazon is a better deal.  Amazon Prime (free shipping) makes it a much better deal.          My Great Grandpa used to come home with Chiclets from time to time, so this gum isn't just loaded with long lasting peppermint flavor, but long lasting, happy memories, as well.  I guess you can say there's a lot packed into such a little piece of gum.  Hope you enjoy as much as I do.
