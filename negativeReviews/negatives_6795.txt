The first bite was horribly rancid, and I rushed to the garbage can to spit it out.  Then I rushed to the bathroom to  ush my teeth and get rid of the last foul particles.  Even though this was not a normally refundable item through Amazon, they did give me a full refund, but they were not interested in my offer to ship it back to them at their expense to find out what went so horribly wrong.  The food safety system in this country is horribly  oken.  After the peanut scancal of last year, it would be nice if something had changed and people were more responsible for what they put out there.       In my opinion, the problem was improper storage temp. at the ware house, or ingredients too old.     Really a shame because it is such a good cause otherwise, and I love nuts.
