I have two Beagles and they LOVE these treats. Keep them in a sealed container or they get hard and stale quickly. Your dogs may not mind though. To keep my beagles happy I play a game with them called "Find It". I put them out in the garage and then hide pieces of treats all over the house.     Then I open the door, making sure I'm not standing in their path and say "Find It!". Not that I actually have to say anything at all. They know the game. These treats are great for that because you can tear of cut them up into pieces for hiding or rewards.          This treat comes in Chicken Flavor too. Eight Paws up from Snoopy and Chester!
