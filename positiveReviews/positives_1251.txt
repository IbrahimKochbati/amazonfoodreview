Got this item on a one day only sale on Amazon.  Love having the single serving portion as I am following WW plan.  Only 3 points plus per serving.  Tasty and on the same line as the Special K crackers.  The variety is nice to have and the box will last for awhile.  Cheddar and BBQ are my favorites.  Try them...
