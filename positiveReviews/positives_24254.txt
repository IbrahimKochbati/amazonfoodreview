After discovering chai tea a few years ago, I have since been hooked.  I have tried several coffee shop versions as well as a couple store bought varieties as well and can easily say this is my favorite chai tea.  The taste reminds me of that of a cinnamon roll with a very rich, smooth flavor.  Most other chai teas taste more like ginger ead to me, which while enjoyable, not my "cup of tea".  ;)  My only minor complaint would be that I usually end up with small amount of pulp in the last sip.  I'm not sure if this is due to the water not being hot enough but it's not enough to keep me from loving this product.
