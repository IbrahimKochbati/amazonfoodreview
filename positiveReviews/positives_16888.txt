My dogs love this and each figured out different techniques to get food out   took a while for them to get good at it. The Pit Bull holds her paws around the rubber ring and turns it over to pour some out. The Heinz 57 bats it around until something falls out, just beginning to hold the rope with 1 paw and hit the jug with the other. They are tied for time to get all the treats out!          This cannot be played with on tile or wood floors   too noisy for people and jug slides too much for dogs. It would work in a crate, but I won't leave my dogs alone with ANY toy of this sort.          It is hard to find dog goodies that will come out most are too thick to pass through.
