First of all  I love tea, particularly Earl Grey and variations of Earl Grey...          This tea contains Yunnan province black tea and bergamot essential oil.          This is a loose tea and the packaging is lovely.  While I have had many loose teas that come in tins, I do appreciate that under the outer cap, this tin has an additional metal stopper that is very easily removed but also prevents an explosion of tea leaves.          The stopper not only serves as a seal, it is also useful in measuring the tea for  ewing  this little inner stopper holds approximately 1 Tablespoon of tea (not packed, fairly loose...I measured it as I was curious...) which is the recommended amount for 8oz of water and proper  ewing... Many folks do not like tea because they have not had properly  ewed tea, so this is an impressive extra measure to ensure the  ew is as intended...          When you open the container the bergamot hits you in the face...I was hoping the overwhelming bergamot would settle down during the  ew, but I still found that it was overwhelming to the point of being excessively perfumey (for me it was like being trapped in a small space with someone who bathed in a bottle of eau de anything)... It was quite drinkable when I attempted to get past the bergamot slap, and the Yunnan black tea was smooth and rich and delightful...Not bitter in the least, and very flavorful and tasty... Unfortunately, I could not get past the overwhelming bergamot... But I plan on trying some of Rishi Tea's other varieties as I do like this varietal of Yunnan black tea...          I do also appreciate that this is USDA organic, Fair Trade certified and the tin tells the story of the tea and the people who cultivate it...          I prefer my Earl Grey to be more balanced, with the tea aspect or the bergamot in harmony....
