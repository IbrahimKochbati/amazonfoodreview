The package says that this is supposed to be practically  eak proof, which I thought was perfect for my year old Beauceron who is a pretty aggressive chewer.  Finally!  A toy that would make his  ain work and keep him occupied.          Three uses.  First one he very quickly discovered how to get the treats right out.  Second, he learned how to get the screw off bottom to come off of the jug.  Third time   he chewed the plastic to bits by the time I got it away from him   and he was in the same room with me!          I'm a dog trainer and only recommend high endurance products for my clients.  This didn't even come *close* to meeting my expectations!  Total disappointment.  Will not buy another 'Premier' Busy Buddy toy for my chewer!          At almost 3 years old, we still rely on the blue K9 Kongs, Holey Moley, and Everlast Treat balls to stand up to his strong jaws and chew drive!
