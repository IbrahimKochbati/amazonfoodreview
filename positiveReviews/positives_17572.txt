The lower acid level was something i noticed in two ways, first that it didn't cause the stomachaches other coffees do. And secondly it left far less residue stain in my coffee mug than usual.          Flavorwise it was above average restaraunt coffee quality in flavor and aroma. Try it, you'll like it.
