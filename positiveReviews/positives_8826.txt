This salt is so tasty!  It tastes nothing like the iodized table salt.  This has a light, mild taste that greatly enhances meats, vegetables, etc.  It's pink peach color also looks very pretty in my clear Cole Mason grinder.  It grinds very finely with no issue.  In fact, this salt grinds so finely that it leaves a fine coating, almost like a powder, around the inside of the clear grinder.  If you're a neat freak, this might bug you a little and you might find yourself wiping out the top of the grinder.  Great salt and the bag lasts a long time.
