I bought these beans to experiment tofu making. They are okay and will make nice tofu but the taste and quality of beans could be better. I only used these to experiment and yes I did eat the tofu but I used higher quality beans for guests and friends' tofu. Also   can not tell if this is GMO or non GMO   package does not say, which I think means it is GMO, which could have harmful effects to your health. I won't buy again since I don't know if it is GMO or not.
