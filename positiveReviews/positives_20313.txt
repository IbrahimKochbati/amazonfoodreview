My baby loved it and she can be a picky eater. There are a lot of nutrients in it which is always good. Overall satisfied. The only disadvantage to this cereal is it needs something else added to it. If I didn't add fruit my baby would not eat it. Some of the other baby cereals I've bought she would eat without any fruit in it. But not this one. It had to have fruit.
