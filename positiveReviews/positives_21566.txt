Quaker Instant Oatmeal is such a healthy and filling  eakfast.  I like to start my day with a five mile run and when I come home this is my  eakfast of choice, especially in the winter.  My favorite way to fix it is by dumping a packet of oatmeal, 1 2 cup of water and I always add 2 tablespoons of Old Fashion Oats too.  Cook it for a minute and then add cinnamon, raisins and milk.  It is sweet and healthy  a great mix!  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to eat healthy foods, yet has a sweet tooth.
