I got a free sample of these once, and now  we're on the subscribe and save program.  Not much of a chip fan, I love the slight spiciness of these (from the pepper) and the exploded texture of the chip.  It's so nice they're not greasy, and they manage to hit those little salty + crunchy cravings that hit everyonce in a while!  Definitely recommended.
