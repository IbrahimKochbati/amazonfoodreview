I just re ordered this decaf coffee.  We have tried several decaf varieties looking for that perfect cup.  The Donut House is our reigning favorite.  We had been drinking Donut SHOP decaf and just tried Green Mountain Breakfast Blend decaf.  While both of these coffees are pleasant, neither compares to the Donut House in aroma or flavor.  This coffee is full bodied in taste and very smooth.  We  ew it on the 8oz setting and think that is perfect, although we make the next size larger for my mother who likes her's a bit weaker.  We'll probably keep looking for the perfect decaf; this one is excellent.
