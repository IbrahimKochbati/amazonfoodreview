My husband is a diabetic, my grandchildren are healthy eaters and my 85 year old parents, we all eat Pirate's Booty. It's a great all time, any time snack for all of us. I ordered a case for my father,who will eat a bag all by himself, for his 85th birthday present. I then proceeded to order my family a case.          Thank you so much for the perfect snack.
