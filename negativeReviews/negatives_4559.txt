I bought this  ewer because we have one at work that is awesome.  This one doesn't  ew a large enough cup of coffee.  It fills your cup up about to the 1 2 or less mark.  The K Cups are too expensive to just get 1 2 cup of coffee!  The taste of the coffee in this one is kind of a chemical taste.  Not a good cup of coffee at all.  Very dissapointed.  Now they tell me this is an item that can't be returned either.  Ughhh!!
