The title really says it all   if you enjoy  ewing tea and drink it daily, this is a great everyday sencha. It has a good, clean flavor you can only get from a full leaf tea like this.          Now   a thing or two about Rishi's actual  ewing instructions. This is the second Rishi tea I've tried, and like the first, the quality is great and I've been thoroughly enjoying it. If you follow Rishi's  ewing instructions, however, you will get an overly potent, undrinkable mess instead of the mild, subtle yet undeniable flavor of a properly  ewed green tea. Green tea isn't supposed to taste like the crap you get at Panera or from Lipton   you're not supposed to be assaulted by intense flavor when you drink it. If you follow Rishi's instructions though, that is what will happen and you'll probably end up writing reviews about how it tastes like grass.          1 tablespoon per 8 ounces of water is beyond overkill. Brewing that for 3 4 minutes is even greater overkill. Like most other full leaf greens, 1 TEASPOON per 8 ounces of water  ewed for between 1.5 to 2.5 minutes is what the  ewing instructions on this tea should be. If I were to put 3 tablespoons of this stuff in my tetsubin and  ew it for 4 minutes. . . I don't even want to know what would come out of the spout.          So, 1 teaspoon 8 ounces of water for 1.5   2.5 minutes (2.5 is even pushing it) and you'll get an amazing green tea that has the subtlety and smoothness that you're supposed to get out of a green like this. If it's bitter or you feel like you're on a green tea roller coaster, you've  ewed it wrong.
