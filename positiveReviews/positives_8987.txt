I grew up on King Golden Syrup back in Pennsylvania, and have missed it greatly since moving west in 1978. Until recently, I had depended on the generosity     of family members to ship me the occasional bottle, which we would then use so sparingly that sometimes I would forget that I had it on the shelf! So nice     to find an entire six pack for such an affordable price.  Tiny bit of disappointment when it showed up in plastic dispensers, as opposed to the classic glass bottle pictured in the add.  Pleased to announce that the quality was still very, very high!
