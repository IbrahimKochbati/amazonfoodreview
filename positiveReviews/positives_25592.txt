I just purchased this because I have recently been diagnosed with high blood pressure and really want to go the natural route.  By itself, I found it a little too fruity, tangy flavored, but that is just my personal preference.  I really wanted to like it enough to want to drink it all the time, at least 3 cups a day.  Being a tea drinker anyway, and having lots of tea at my disposal I started blending it with other teas.  For evening I use a heaping t. each of red rooibos and  African honeybush (both Davidson's) and 5 or 6 pieces of this tea and steep for maybe 10 min.  Add a dollop of raw honey  delicious.  I will sometimes steep this a second time.  I enjoy it every evening before bed.  For daytime I just make my regular gunpowder green (again, Davidson's) or my oolong, or whatever I feel like that day.  Sometimes I even mix them, and add 6 or so pieces of hibiscus leaves and a dollop of honey.  The hibiscus adds just the right fruity tangy taste and results in a wonderful tasty tea that I enjoy drinking throughout the day.  I am hopeful that using it this way I will be drinking enough of it to reap the health benefits that it provides. The bag is huge and I am sure will last me a long time.  When I finish it off, I will for sure buy some more.
