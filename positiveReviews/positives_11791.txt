This is by far the best GF pasta I've tried.  Holds up well when you cook your sauce gravy and want to add pasta directly to the sauce gravy.  Doesn't fall apart when stirring and will even hold up when refrigerated overnight and reheated and stirred in oven. Also, is great for cold pasta salads. Won't  eak down and pasta tastes like I remember regular pasta tasting like. I like that I could purchase in bulk since my local grocery store only carries one weird shape I don't like. It's great I can order here on Amazon.  Delivery was prompt and packed nicely.  No  oken pasta.
