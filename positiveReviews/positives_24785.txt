This is excellent popping corn with a light rich flavor, it pops well, has significantly less hulls than most other popping corns we have tried, tastes great, and holds flavorings and cheese well. The popped corn is smaller than many other  ands and we like the flavor better.     Cons:     The un popped kernels are lighter than many other popping corns, so a few more get blown out un popped by our hot air popper... towards the end when the number of kernels remaining to be popped in the air popper gets low. If you don't mind having a few un popped kernels it's works just fine in the air popper.     The quantity of each order is bit large   twelve pounds at a time (you get six two pound packages per order) which  makes this premium corn price very competitive with lesser popping corns (when buying through Amazon.com).     We find the quantity not to be problem though, as we like this corn better than other corns we have tried, so we use it up faster. Of course dried corn keeps very well, and we have found that our friends love receiving a package or two when we visit, and it also makes a great remem ance gift for soldiers overseas, or college students away from home.
