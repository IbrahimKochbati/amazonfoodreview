Petite Cuisine is a proposed competitor to Fancy Feast.  Insofar as taste, well, my cat, Matt, will eat anything, and this is no exception.  He plowed right through all four flavors:  red snapper, tuna and sole, tuna and shrimp and yellow fin tuna.  Matt is a food addict, and I have to control his intake, giving him four measured meals a day.  Only one of those meals per day is a half of a 3 ounce can of Fancy Feast or a worthwhile substitute.  The caloric intake is such that giving him any more than that would double his already 17 pound size.          In any case, I compared the Guarantee Analysis of Fancy Feast to Petite Cuisine, and here are the numbers:          1.  Crude protein:  Fancy Feast...minimum 14.0%; Petite Cuisine...13%.     2.  Crude fat:  Fancy Feast...minimum 3.0%; Petite Cuisine...1.5%.     3.  Crude fiber:  Fancy Feast...maximum 1.5%; Petite Cuisine...1%.     4.  Moisture:  Fancy Feast...maximum 78.0%; Petite Cuisine...85%.     5.  Ash:  Fancy Feast...maximum 3.5%; Petite Cuisine...3%.     6.  Taurine:  Fancy Feast...minimum 0.05%; Petite Cuisine...0.1%.          In particular, I noticed that Petite Cuisine is much runnier than Fancy Feast, which has a fairly thick consistency in ground varieties and much thicker gravy in those versions as well.  All together and based upon the comparison of content, I would prefer to purchase Fancy Feast; however, another factor you should consider is overall cost, especially if you are feeding more than one cat.
