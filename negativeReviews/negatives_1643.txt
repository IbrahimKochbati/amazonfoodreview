This drink is very, very sweet, and only mildly carbonated.          I don't drink soda, but i do occasionally like bubbles in my drinks. I had some hope that Switch would be a nice bubbly fruit drink to fill this need, but it's not. The ingredients may be all natural, but it's still syrupy, and has an odd aftertaste that i think is from the added vitamin C.          For regular soda drinkers, the sweetness may not be as offensive, but for anyone expecting something that tastes like sparkling fruit juice, this will be a disappointment. I'd still choose this over an orange soda, but i'd choose to have nothing at all rather than this.          Also, note that the cans are only 8.3 ounces each, smaller than normal 12oz soda cans.
