This is my daughter's favorite. Lindt chocolate is one of the best I know on the market. But: this time I want to review also this shipper. This shipper deserves 10 stars!     The chocolate was shipped on days with extremely high temperatures and I was worried in what shape it's going arrive to. Surprise was on my side: all chocolates were in zipped food storage bag, which was inside of small styro foam cooler together with 4 ice packs. And all that neatly accommodated inside of clean white carton box.     When I opened the cooler, the contain was still very cold! I could not be impressed more. And all that effort for value of $30 merchandise with the free shipping!!!! WOW!!!
