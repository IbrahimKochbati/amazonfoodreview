I bought a big bag of these and I don't mind the strong pepper taste. What I do mind is the bag implies these are Potato chips.          There is absolutely no potato taste left in this snack; if you like eating extremely salty onion powder this snack is for you.          Going by the bag I expected: REAL potatos, a little oil and baking, finally sprinkled with salt and pepper only? Not a long list with things like Cane Sugar, Rice flour, maltodextrin......list of ingredients goes on and on.          If you're looking for BAKED POTATO, salt and pepper chips don't bother with these!            VS
