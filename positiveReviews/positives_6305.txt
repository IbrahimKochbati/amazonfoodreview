We love anything with onions and this certainly is a great product.Wonderfull flavor, sweet and tangy;delicious on so many things. We have tried this on plain chicken, omelets, and even hamburgers.Will be trying this on pork over the weekend. Great price; I hope this will always be available through Amazon.
