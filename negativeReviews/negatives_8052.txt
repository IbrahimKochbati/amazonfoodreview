There's finely fuzzy white mold all over this stuff, and Amazon's return policy of food: You're SOL.  DISGUSTING!  Looks I've learned that grocery shopping on Amazon is not a particularly good idea.  Since I bought three different 1lb bags of this stuff in different flavors I'm out some cash.  Granted this one was the only one with mold, but the other two were complete inedible as they were made from cartilage scrap cuts   the stuff that either gets thrown away or fed to the pigs.  This flavor probably was, too, but since it has mold on it I'm not about to find out.
