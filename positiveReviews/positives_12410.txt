i purchased a can of this at a grocery store after a night of vodka and ojs... so we all know WHY i bought it...          on a more serious note... it's good... if you don't like the flavors in fruit cake, or cooked raisins this isn't for you... to me it's kind of like a super moist fruit cake without nuts and those candied fruits...          also... it's awesome to whip out at parties... and then say things like "you just put     in your mouth"
