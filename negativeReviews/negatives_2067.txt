I was so excited to try a new BOLD coffee.....needless to say, I am disappointed. I would rate this coffee as a MEDIUM. If it would have been listed as a MEDIUM, I would have given it a higher rating because this is truly a MEDIUM strength coffee in taste and flavor. I will still drink it from time to time  flavor is smooth, not bitter. Overall, I wish that I would have ordered some more Jet Fuel or Black Tiger.
