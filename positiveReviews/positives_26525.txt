I'm a big fan of Illy coffee. It is a very smooth coffee. I was tired of having to work (clean stuff)to make my coffee so I purchased a Keurig.          I purchased a sample pack. The only coffee I was impressed by was the Caribou. It's a slight bit weak for my taste but it is oh so smooth and flavorful. I actually purchased this pack because it was so good. It's as close as I can come to Illy on my Keurig, so far.          I also purchased the Caribou Mahogany but it has not delivered yet. I'm hoping it's stronger, yet smooth like the Caribou blend. I like strong but smooth. I'm not interested in bitter.          If you want a delightful smooth full bodied coffee, this is it. I drink coffee more for the taste than anything else and I'm extremely picky so I was pleasantly surprised when I was pleased by the Caribou Blend.
