I'm hooked on this stuff  it's 100% mint, nothing else  I put it in my permaplastic tumbler with cold water and ice, and in 5 minutes i have the BEST iced mint tea ever  and it keeps steeping, so you can add more water as needed and it's still not overly diluted.  A bag lasts me an entire day on average, with several refills keeping it going.
