I'm a college student, so that means that my meals need to be quick and easy to make, but also nutritious. This is tough to find, being as I'm someone who is not only a celiac, but is also lactose intolerant! This mix is free from darn near everything, it tastes great, and all that you have to do is add water to make it the consistency of regular pancake mix. This product is perfect for all celiacs out there yearning for a good pancake or waffle.
