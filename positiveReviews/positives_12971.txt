When my daughter saw that I had a can of this to try out, she said, "Oh, you have Switch!"  Apparently it's her school's answer to soda.          I really liked this product.  It's a very small can, but for the same calorie content as a similar amount of soda, one can have a carbonated beverage that doesn't have added sugar and has some vitamin benefits as well (100% of vitamin C).          It was not too sweet, and the flavor was not too strong.  Normally strawberry kiwi is NOT my favorite flavor combination, but I'm glad I tried it.  I would definitely try it again.
