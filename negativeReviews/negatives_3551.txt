I was on subscribe and save for these mints, but have switched to Spry due to Xylitol USA's awful company policy and customer service. If you buy something from Xylitol USA that arrives in bad shape and you want to return it for a refund, the company will tell you that they do not accept food back. When I insisted that the product was old (in my case two bags of xylitol sweetened dark chocolates that were old, whitish and tasteless) they said that they would NOT refund my money and, amazingly enough, offered a 25% discount on my NEXT purchase. I disputed the payment and my bank took care of the situation got me my  money back. No more purchases from this company for me.
