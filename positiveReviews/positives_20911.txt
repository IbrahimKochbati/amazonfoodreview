I usually  ew with the individual components, and ordered this not realizing it was 2 large cans that you simply poor into the carboy and add yeasr.  It is perfect for beginners.  For more advanced  ewers, I would keep on looking          For a stout, it is a little on less alcoholic side, I would recommend adding a bit more dextrose towards the end of the fermentation to keep the fermentation going or closely observe the specific gravity.          Taste of good, but unremarkable.
