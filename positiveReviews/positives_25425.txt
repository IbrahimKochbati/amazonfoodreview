These chews are very helpful in keeping our puppy's teeth clean. We cut them in thirds and give him a third at a time, because he's such a fast chewer.          Fortunately, they appear to be digestible, and he has not choked or gotten sick from them, unlike our other dog who had major issues with the Greenies  and.          The only draw back is that although we buy the extra large chews, sometimes there are thin ones in the bunch. (Our puppy needs the thicker chews because he's such a strong chewer.)          I would give them a five star rating if they were all thick. But for the most part, they mostly contain the extra large size in the package.
