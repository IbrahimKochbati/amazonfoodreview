This review is about Musselmans apple cider purchased at Walmart.  This cider has the same poor taste that I experienced with Whitehouse apple juice last year.  In the case of the Whitehouse  and I found that, despite the proudly displayed American flag on the label, the juice was actually from China.  I would bet $10 that the Musselmans juice is from China despite the label saying otherwise.  I remember having great tasting cider when I was a kid in Pennsylvania. Doesn't seem to exist anymore.
