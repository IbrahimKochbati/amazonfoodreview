We had Fabulosa on chicken while visiting in Texas, and we were hooked.  We can't find this stuff locally, and are happy to be able to purchase on Amazon.  The sodium is high, but that's really to be expected for a fajita marinade.  It is smoky and delicious on meats and veggies.  Great for grilled meats, too.  It truly IS fabulous.
