This game was great...for about 3 days.  My 7 month old lab mix spent a lot of energy (yay!) figuring out how to get the treats.  Unfortunately after about 3 tries, he had it totally mastered.  Even tightening it up to the max was still too easy.  It also completely  oke after about the 5th use.  Might be great if your dog is smaller or less energetic.
