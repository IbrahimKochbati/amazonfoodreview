I have managed to find these crackers in other countries on our travels but had run out. I love that they are individually wrapped small packets in a stay fresh container. This makes them great to carry in my purse, take to work or on airplanes for snacks etc. Also love that they are not overly salted like so many American  and crackers. Company that shipped them did a great job   fast too!
