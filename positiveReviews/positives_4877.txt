I really like this product   when my grocery stopped carrying it, I ordered it through the mail.  This is more of a quick  ead than a cake, and it requires a can of cream style corn.  The result is very moist and has a good corn flavor.  I bake it in muffin pans in cupcake papers, and a dozen are small.  It makes about 8 good sized muffins.  I also bake these longer than specified on the package, because I seem to like things that are more done than many people.  These store well in a plastic bag in the refrigerator   if they are not all eaten by the end of the meal.
