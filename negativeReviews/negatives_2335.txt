Not worth the cost.          I have only had these as free samples.          I would pay $5 for a pack of 10. I may even be willing to pay $10.00 for a pack of 10.     Anything more than $10 is total robbery.          So, obviously, $17.99 is WAY too much.          This product is SUPER cool, and I LOVED how it worked.          But, really? $18.00?          Mberry should Market their product as a food enhancer, not as a "Flavor tripping experience".          If Mberry does that, and prices their products reasonably, it WILL gain customers.          Keeping there product around as a "Flavor tripping experience" will surely make it a passing fad.
