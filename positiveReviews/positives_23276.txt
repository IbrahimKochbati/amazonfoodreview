I had been making the Red Mill  ead, but I have to say this blows away the competion in both taste and ease.  I don't have to add a bunch of extra different ingredients (like egg whites, butter, etc).  Good flavor & nice looking loaf.  The  ead is soft as one reviewer mentioned. We don't mind, but some might.
