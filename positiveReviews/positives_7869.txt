THESE ARE VERY TASTY FOR A QUICK SNACK, BUT THEY ARE A LITTLE TRICKY TO MICROWAVE. EACH MICROWAVE OVEN COOKS DIFFERENTLY (SIZE AND POWER WATTAGE) IT TAKES A FEW PACKS TO COOK JUST RIGHT. VERY EASY TO OVERCOOK OR UNDER COOK AND THIS EFFECTS THE TASTE GREATLY. AFTER YOU LEARN THE EXACT SECONDS FOR YOUR MICROWAVE THE BETTER THE TASTE. IF YOU OVERCOOK THEM THEY HAVE A CHEMICAL LIKE TASTE...YOU MIGHT AS WELL THROW THEM AWAY! (IF NOT COOKED JUST RIGHT)... I LIKE TO WATCH THE BAG COOK FOR BETTER RESULTS. I TAKE THE BAG OUT AT THE POINT OF INFLATION, NO LATER OR THEY WILL BE OVER COOKED. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LIKE NUKING POPCORN, BUT IT IS MORE DIFFICULT.          +++UPDATE 1 04 10....WE GO THROUGH ABOUT 2 3 BOXES PER MONTH BECAUSE WE ARE ON A LOW CARB DIET.
