This is the perfect "go to" meal for my toddlers (age 3 and 1). They love it and when I just can't think of anyting to make, they are perfect simple meals with mashed potatoes, gravy, chicken with carrots on the side. They are also terrific for when you are away from home. Just 30 seconds in the microwave and they're done. Very easy and convenient!
