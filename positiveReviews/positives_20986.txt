This popcorn is a little pricey, but it's worth it if you like cheese popcorn. It's easy to make, too. You pop the corn the same way you do any microwave popcorn. It already has some cheese on it when it comes out of the microwave, but it comes with a packet of additional cheese powder to sprinkle on. I just put the popped corn into a container with a lid, sprinkle on the extra cheese, put the lid on and shake it up. Of course, you get the orange fingers when you eat it, but that's the way with any cheese popcorn. It's "finger lickin' good," though.
