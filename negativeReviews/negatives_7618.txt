That said, they are the best tasting things around so if you love a hard, cruchy pretzel, this is your  and!  They just taste superb but they really play havoc on my teeth so I really cannot eat them.  Or, just soak them in a glass of Coke like the children do and well, you get two treats in one!  Highly recommend!
