I absolutely adore Cheezies and make it a point to pick up a few large bags every time I go back to Canada. I was so excited when Amazon started selling them. I bought 2 bags thinking I would get a decent size for the price. Sadly the bag is only 210g or 1 2 lb (smaller than a regular bag of chips). The bags I received would have cost about $3 in Canada. Not worth it for the $7 price offered on Amazon. This is the first time I have been disappointed with Amazon and their prices. This is not worth the investment.
