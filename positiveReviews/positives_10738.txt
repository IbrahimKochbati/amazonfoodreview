My dogs ate up my package of Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats.  My little Bostons ate them as quickly as their little teeth allowed, and my German Shepherds enjoyed them as well.  I like the use of organic ingredients in these pup snacks.          I will buy this for my pooches again, and probably try other flavors too.
