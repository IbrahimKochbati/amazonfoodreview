A little while back, Newmans Own Tea was on sale and we have enjoyed all the other products under the  and name and appreciate the fact that proceeds benefit charities! The tea is phenomenal~ has far less bitterness than others, has a mellow flavor, lovely hue,whether your preference is to have it plain, with milk, with sugar,lemon or orange wedges, iced, or with a few oz. of pomegranate juice. I am not at all uncomfortable with having 6 boxes of 100 bags in my house for my husband and I and guests....my sister in law just decided she thinks it's the best there is and I gifted her with a box!There's no chance of it lasting long around here. It would also make a great Christmas gift with a lovely antique tea cup and old fashioned sugar cubes!
