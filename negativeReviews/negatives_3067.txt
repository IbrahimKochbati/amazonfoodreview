I bought this candy on a whim because I love pretty much all things coconut. I figured it would taste like a m&m's version of an almond joy minus the almonds, but was much disappointed. It tasted like an overly sweet waxy coconut body lotion, with a hint of chocolate and candy shell. UTTERLY DISGUSTING. Too late, i noticed on the ingredients list there was no coconut at all to be found  it's all artificial flavoring.     I had to throw the bag away.
