Ok.. based on the 2 previous reviews and their descriptions.. I bought this product. I cannot tell how much this product rocks. I love it. If you like a fairly bold coffee in the european style (I lived in Germany for 3.5 years) then I would highly recommend this. I've tried all the Starbucks (African Kitamu is my fav from that line but I always stopped it a bit short during  ewing to keep it a bit stronger) and this is way better. This is now going to be part of my tassimo collection and probably my daily coffee.
