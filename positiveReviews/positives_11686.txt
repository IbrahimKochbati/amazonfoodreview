When these came home, I was less skeptical about what I was getting. The name says it all, oat, coconut and chocolate, in a bar form. Sounds more like a cookie to me. Tasted a lot more like a cookie than a bar that was healthy for me. Which is good. I want to taste my food and know it's healthy, than not want to taste my food while knowing it's healthy. There was plenty of chocolate in the bar for me and it wasn't concentrated in chunk or random chips. The chocolate pieces used had melted nicely, so the chocolate was very prevalent throughout.          I definitely could taste the coconut, but it was a more fresh flavor than say something you'd buy in a bag at a store. It also did not overpower the rest of the bar. Coconut is a powerful ingredient. It's good to know it was used in moderation. The oats and the cookie part of the bar lend well into reminding me of a great oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. I could take a bite and got plenty of the cookie texture I want more of, with bits of oat and smaller but still flavorful coconut.          I think it'd work well to think of these less as a bar (like a healthy food bar) and more of a great tasting, small cookie.
