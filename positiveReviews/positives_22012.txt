This is our second machine. Both this dog and our previous dog love it. It's easy to train them and they enjoy accessing their treats. Wrigley takes laundry to the hamper and then is rewarded by clicking her treat machine. Our friends are amused by her ability to know when she can and cannot retrieve her reward. It's fun!
