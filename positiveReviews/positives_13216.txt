These taste alot like a "Mounds" candy bar, Only fewer unecesary ingrediants, hence fewer calories. Mounds has 257 calories, 31 gr Carbs, 14g  SFat,25g sugar. The Oskri bar is made with Coconut, Rice Syrup and Dark Chocolate(Cocoa butter, Chocolate liquor, soy lecithin,natural vanilla. The Oskri bar has 190 calories, 8g Sfat, 24g carbs, 2g fiber,18g sugar. The chocolate coating is thinner than a mounds bar, but perfect balance for the taste of the coconut. I often only eat half of one these at a time. Satifies my sweet tooth and hunger during that mid day slump. I feel the price is decent for an organic product considering most candy bars will run you about a buck. Long shelf life also, my box has a expiration     date of 8 2013!
