I was having trouble finding pet grass consistently in my area and decided to take a chance using a grow kit. The kit was very easy to use and the grass grew like crazy. Since I have only one cat I am now using about 1 3 of planting soil and seeds at a time and this works out great. I highly recommend this product.
