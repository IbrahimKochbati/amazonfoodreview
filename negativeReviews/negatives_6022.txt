The first thing I noticed is that it smells JUST like the canned cat food I give my cat. This was a big turn off, but I have had good experiences with wheat gluten in the past, so I gave it a shot. The flavor is nice, and has a decent aftertaste. The texture is OK, but not what I would expect from a "jerky".. I would have preferred something much chewier. I did eat them, but it's not something I will purchase again.
