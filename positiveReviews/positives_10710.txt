My dog buddy is the pickiest eater. Dog food has to be "just right" and forget the dog treats.. he won't touch anything that says dog treat.. until these..     He really liked these and kept wanting more, even wanting to forego dinner for these treats.     These are a quality product that I like and so does he. Good, no wasted money on treats he'll turn his nose up at.     Two thumbs up.
