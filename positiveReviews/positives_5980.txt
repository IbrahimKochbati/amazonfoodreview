I have been drinking hibiscus tea off and on since 1984.  When I went to Germany in 1984, my mother told me that it is quite popular there for blood pressure issues, so every day while I was there I drank it.  When I came back to the US I found it and drank it for a number of years.          About a year ago my husband's blood pressure became elevated because of health problems he is experieincing.  So, I went to the local co op and got some hibiscus tea.  Ever since he started drinking it his blood pressure has been in the normal range    well under 120 80.
