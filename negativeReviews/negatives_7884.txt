   class "tiny"  Length:: 0:39 Mins              So this might be a gross video to watch... but I'm posting this so that others might see what they are in for.          I have an adult boxer dog with dental problems (gum overgrowth, as do most boxers) so I bought several dental health products including these chews.     I bought the large size chews, and for the first half of the chew (they are rectangular shaped), it worked great.     Then towards the last bit, he didnt know what to do with it. It wasnt firm enough that he could hold it and chew on it, he had to put the whole thing in his mouth and chew on it. He tried to swallow it, then realized it was too big, so kind of hacked it up, and kept chewing. I started filming during this part, to show how the hacking becomes problematic, but you can see that at the end of this video, he barfs the whole thing up.          I think that in theory, enzyme assisted dental care is great, but probably should stick with the tooth ushes toothpaste so that it is controlled and doesnt become a choking hazard.     I think I will stick with tooth  ushing followed by a small mint flavored treat to reward the tooth ushing.          I wanted to agree with the reviewer who wrote that this should seem as much a hazard as any other rawhide toy, however here is why I think that is wrong: This big flat rectangle shape seems to add problems to  eaking down into smaller pieces, whereas the twisted rawhides allow for holding between their paws while gnawing down to a small piece. I will stick with the latter shape in the future.
