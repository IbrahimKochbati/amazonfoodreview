A while back I was looking for more natural sweeteners so I decided to give agave a try on the recommendation of others.  I had success with another maple flavored agave for pancake topping, but this version left an unpleasant plastic y taste in my mouth.          Since learning that agave is very similar to high fructose corn syrup, I've switched to more natural sweeteners: maple syrup, honey and rapadura.
