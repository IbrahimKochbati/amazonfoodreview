Nong Shim's Spicy Chicken Noodle Bowl offers up a quick, Ramen style noodle dish that comes in a one serving bowl.  Like Cup A Noodle and other Ramen type meals, this is basically a fast, reasonably tasty meal for people who are working at the office or just want something really quick at home.  Just open the lid halfway, fill with water to the internal line, throw in the seasonings from the enclosed packet, nuke it for few minutes and enjoy.          As far as taste is concerned, Nong Shim has done nothing to separate itself from the noodle pack.  If you've had spicy chicken flavored noodles from other companies, you've pretty much had Nong Shim's version of the dish.          I like eating noodles in this fashion whenever I'm by myself at home and can't decide what to eat for lunch.  They are quick, taste good enough, and basically prevent me from eating a bunch of junk food.          I recommend Nong Shim's Spicy Chicken Noodle Bowl to anyone who's tied down at work or just hungry for something fast.
