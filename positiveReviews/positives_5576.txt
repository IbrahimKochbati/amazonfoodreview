I am not a coffee purist...but I am addicted.  I've dabbled in the flavorings & coffee wannabe's, and this is by far my favorite.  I usually put 1 teaspoonful of instant coffee with three regular spoonfuls of Vanilla Caramel Latte, just so I have an extra afternoon shot of energy.  Extra bonus   when you pour the hot water over the mixture, it hisses & purrs :)
