I have a German Shepard Dog, who is trained as a service dog.  While out in public, he receives lots of stimulation, and if I'm asked first, he receives a lot of attention too.          As a service dog, he's with me 24 seven.  Everywhere, everyday, all the time. He's a high energy dog, loves playing fetch with balls, but doesn't much like my tv, computer, or napping time. I love him dearly but everyone needs a little away time.          I've purchased a number of Busy Buddy toys for him.  The number of Squirrels at two different sizes, and cut the bottom fingers different lengths so some drop out treats easier, some harder.  He enjoys them, they bounce funny, but he can empty them pretty quickly.  Which leads to them being dropped on my lap repeatedly, and not always in the best place.          I found the tug a Jug which I didn't expect to last a long time because of the hard plastic jug. I also figured he'd pull the rubber tug out by now time.  Much to my surprise, he's been playing with it for almost a year with none of the problems I'd expected, other than having it dropped on my foot or lap.          I've been able to use his normal  and of Kirkland Chicken & Rice kibbles dog food, mixed in with some Beniful for a change of pace. By using his normal kibble, it keeps the cost down, and allows me to adjust his meal portion size accordingly.          It's also about the only toy he doesn't  ing out to the back yard to hide and then can't find it again.  Which sends me a clear message he is very focused on this toy.          Even though he's a large size dog, I didn't buy him the large size, in part because I prefer the rubber tug, in part it keeps the amount of treats down.          I highly recommend this toy (and toy line) for their design and not making it impossible to use normal kibble instead of expense treat products designed only for their toys.          I'd have given this 5 stars if they'd made the outside of the bottle with a rubber coating, or rubber bumpers so it isn't so noisy on non carpeted flooring.
