I got these for my kitten and he loves them.          The comment made about the bag being hard to open isn't really that big of a deal, I haven't had any problems closing or opening properly. Though, I would much prefer a container type packaging since those are easier to get into especially if you're training a cat you don't want to hold a bunch of cat treats in your hand because the bag keeps closing on you. But the bag closes opens like any other zip lock.          I feed my kitten chicken flavored cat food, so I try and offset the treats with a different meat and Wellness salmon treats work great and it's healthy without all those fillers.          This review is for the treat NOT the bag, so I highly recommended this. 5 stars.
