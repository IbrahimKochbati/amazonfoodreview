My school age GF son loves these crackers. He says they taste the closest to the old crackers he used to be able to eat. We started making "lunchables" for him one day by adding a slice of lunch meat and cheese and he loved it. He now takes "lunchables" to school once or twice a week using these crackers.          On their own these crackers aren't bad, but they tend to be better with a topping of some sort (as with most GF  eads and crackers).          My only complaint is the packaging. The crackers come in two foil pouches. Often times many of the crackers are  oken. I'd love to see Glutino package the crackers in rolls like Ritz does.          Overall, these are a staple in our pantry.
