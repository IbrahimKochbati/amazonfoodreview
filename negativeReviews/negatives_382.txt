I love Amazon and I love the reviews from people, I've been introduced to alot of great products b c of the reviews, but this time? Total, complete LET DOWN! Popchips having 4.5 stars is just down right perplexing!?! The should not get more than a 3, but generally 1 2. I sorta want to give it a 1, but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so I through in the extra point.          I ordered these thinking that'd they'd be maybe a slightly better version of Baked Lays. Man was I wrong... I've tried most of the Baked Lays flavors, my go to's at first were 1.) original baked lays and 2.) sour cream baked lays (since those are my favorite regular lays). But then  I discovered BBQ Baked Lays. And seriously, those are FANTASTICALLY great. BBQ Baked Lays are packed with SO much flavor.          These Popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips. Literally they do. Because they aren't as good as Baked Lays I can definitely see eating much less of them (which could be a benefit), but I say just use portion control   and zip lock bag a bunch of Baked Lays.          I'm trying to think of ways to go into more detail, but there's really not much more I can say.          ****SUMMARY****          How do Popchips taste? Like slightly burnt air chips. (it's sort of a weird taste, takes ALOT of getting used to)          Would I suggest buying them? No. If you're eager to try them, I say buy a bag from your local grocery store. A week or so after I ordered these on here I saw them at m local Krogers, so they're definitely expanding.          Nutrition Information: 1 bag (.8 oz  23g)   100 calories, Total Fat   3g (5%), Sodium   210 mg (9%), Total Carbohydrate   16g (5%), Dietary Fiber   1 g (4%), Sugar   2g, Protein 1 g, Vitamin A , Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron   2 %.          If you buy a big bag of BBQ Popchips and big bag of BBQ Baked Lays, here are the nutrition information side by side:          **POP CHIPS:**     Serving Size: 1oz 28g about 19 chips, Calories  120, Total Fat   4.5g (6%), Sodium 280mg (11%), Total Carbohydrate 20g (6%),     Dietary Fiber 1g (4%), Sugars 2g, Protein 1g          **BAKED LAYS:**     Serving Size  1oz 28g about 19 chips, Calories   120, Total Fat 3g (5%),  Sodium 210mg (9%), Potassium 230mg, Total Carbohydrate 22g (7%), Dietary Fiber 2g 8%, Sugars 3g, Protein 2g, Vitamin C 4%, Calcium 2%          So these two are very close, but Baked Lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the Sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of Potassium. Plus there's more Fiber and more Vitamin C. And most importantly they taste better.          I for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that Baked Lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit.          At the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but I'd strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. Maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both Baked Lays and Popchips... I can almost guarantee you that Baked Lays will win hands down.          (Hopefully Amazon starts selling well priced variety single serve bags of Baked Lays soon. For now I found one from a seller, but the price seems a little high (but there are 40 bags instead of 20):    "
