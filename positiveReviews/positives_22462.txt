If you've ever made popcorn in a machine you know what a pain it can be to get the right seasoning, the right oil taste and order decent popcorn that pops the way it should.  Once we started ordering the Great Northern Popcorn packets we didn't have to worry about it anymore.  It is so easy to make popcorn now because we don't have to measure anything or worry about the mess.  One easy step and we have perfect popcorn.  The kids can even do it!  I would definitely recommend giving this a try.
