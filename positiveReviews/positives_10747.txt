As the name indicates these treats are organic which is a positive, especially as many treats have unnamed chemicals in them.  As a rule I only buy organic treats or treats with single ingredients (freeze dried beef lung) etc.  In addition both of my dogs seem to throughly enjoy these treats, which is a positive.          However, the problem with these treats is that they are not for small dogs, which is a problem for me, as I have two small dogs.  Even though the treats can be easily  oken in half they are still about 3x the usual treats for small toy dogs (I have one ~20 lb and one ~10).  Not truly a problem with the quality of the treat, but it should be in the title.
