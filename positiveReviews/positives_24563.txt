While these cans aren't flying out of the pantry like other bulk cans I've purchased from Amazon, it's not a problem because they don't expire for more than a year. I find this pumpkin  and delicious and nutritious. Also, the Amazon price is way cheaper than the Whole Foods price for this same  and.          None of my cans arrived dented.
