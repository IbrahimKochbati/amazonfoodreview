I have a three year old lab chessie mix. She's a fast eater and a strong chewer so I bought her the Tug A Jug to slow down her eating (and give her something to chew on).          It does slow her down. It can take her up to a half hour to eat a meal instead of two minutes.          I've given her food a couple of times without the bottle, but she prefers the bottle now.          Updated section!          As she become a strong chewer, it's fairly easy for my dog to chew off the bottom part that's screwed on. This leads to the possibility of her swallowing a sharp piece of plastic.          It's a great toy, but only for dogs that aren't extremely strong chewers. My dog loved this, but it's too much of a safety hazard for her to have again.
