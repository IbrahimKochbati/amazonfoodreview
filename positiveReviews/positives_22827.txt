I have been drinking this tea for about 6 years. I drink nothing else but an occasional water. I have suggested this tea for several people try. Nine out of ten people agreed with me. I drink it hot or cold. The aroma it gives off smells delicious. If you drink tea a little or a lot you will love this one.
