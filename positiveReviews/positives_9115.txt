So versatile! White pearl can be used to decorate almost anything! Dust or paint it onto chocolate decorations (see Whimsical Bakehouse book), directly onto icing and cookies!          Highly recommend you check your local Michaels or Joann's. Amazon usually has competitive prices but these are $3 4 at your local craft store   $8 is WAYY overprice on amazon.com.
