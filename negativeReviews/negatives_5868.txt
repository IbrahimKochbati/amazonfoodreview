A while back, I ordered this product, and when it arrived I found that the coffee was a "Light" blend. The coffee was good, however, I prefer a medium blend coffee. This time when I ordered, I checked the listings closely, and noted that this coffee was listed as  "Medium". To make a long story shorter, the coffee arived, and it is a "Light" blend again. Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice and shame on you. I will not reorder it again.
