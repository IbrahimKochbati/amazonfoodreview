Medglia D'Oro instant espresso works great in recipes.  I'm not crazy about the stand alone taste, but didn't buy it for that purpose anyway. As some have suggested I might have found it at a lower price in a store, but looked everywhere and couldn't find instant espresso in any  and, so this order was easy and reasonable.
