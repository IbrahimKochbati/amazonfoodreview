I paid $7.99 for the colossal sized one I got my Great Pyrenees puppy.  In less than 7 minutes she had eaten the entire thing.  I cannot afford to entertain my dog for more than $1 a minute.  She loved it, but I will not purchase this product again.  My girl is actually very gentle with her toys too.  At 11 months old, she has yet to destroy a single one of her stuffed toys.  If it's an edible chew toy though, I've found nothing that can stand up to her jaws.
