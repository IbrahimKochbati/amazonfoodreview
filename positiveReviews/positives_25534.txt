I just wanted to say I was very pleasantly surprised to receive this tea in such a huge bag!  The tea is so yummy.  I just pour boiling water over a few petals from the kettle and let steep 5 mins.  Sometimes I add a spoon of sugar but most of the time just drink it without.  When the tea is ready to drink, all the petals sink to the bottom and I don't bother removing them till after I've drank the tea.  I am hooked!  Love it!
