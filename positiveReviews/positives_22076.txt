I've never typed a review before, but here goes:          These peas are great.  I've had other wasabi peas and non compare to the taste from JRs.  Yesterday, my latest 5 lb bag arrived, and to my dismay it was covered in ants.  My wife emailed them and they offered to send another bag free of charge.  No hassle, and a quick response time.  Exactly what I want in a company I do business with.  Will order again!
