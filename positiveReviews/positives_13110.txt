After reading the book "The food pets die for" and finding out that Science Diet & Iams actually use road kill and cancerous animals in their dog food, which turns around and adds the risk of your dog getting cancer or other horrible diseases I started him on an all organic diet, including his treats. After a lot of research this is the food I decided to feed my 10 lb toy poodle and he loves it!!
