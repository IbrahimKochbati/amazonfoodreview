Tinkyada pasta is really good.  If you need gluten free pasta, this is the way to go.  The fusilli is my favorite because it has bulk to it and doesn't easily slip off of a fork (the way penne can), but even their spaghetti is tasty and tender.  Follow the directions on the package and you can't go wrong.
