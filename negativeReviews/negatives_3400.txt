Amazon outside packaging arrived in great shape!  Unfortunately downhill from there.  Carton containing creamers was damaged; original box seal was taped over (re sealed previously opened?); use by date on outside of box indicated 4 months (typically these have at least 12 months, usually 18). Sent feedback to Amazon several days ago.  Apparently fell on deaf ears (i.e., no response from Amazon).
