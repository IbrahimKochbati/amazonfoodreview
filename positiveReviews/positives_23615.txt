I just ate a bag, so I thought this would be a good time to review it.  The bags are small, but a great size if you want to limit your snacking without having to engage your willpower.  The apple pieces (from California organic apples) are pretty small, and they're light (dehydrated) and crispy.  They are not extremely sweet, but I prefer their moderate sweetness to supersweet dried fruit pieces.  These make a great quick snack anytime, and they are especially nice as a healthy kids' lunch item when you realize you just ran out of fresh fruit.
