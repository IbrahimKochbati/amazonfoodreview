Hickory Smoked Primal Jerky is awesome! Jerky is one of the few things I have really missed since becoming a vegetarian, this stuff is a fantastic replacement though. The flavor is great, not exactly the same as meat but still sweet and tangy like hickory smoked jerky should be. The texture is also excellent; not quite as tough as the real thing but close. Its fairly healthy too so I keep a few in my backpack as a quick awesome snack.
