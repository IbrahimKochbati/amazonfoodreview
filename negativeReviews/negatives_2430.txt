I have fond memories as a kid of going to the swap meet with my parents getting the biggest bag of pork rinds they had and pouring as much hot sauce on them as you could handle. Now that pork rinds can be considered a health snack I bought this box thinking I could have a decent snack every day. Well they pop up great in a large enough microwave. The issue is the seasoning. There is way way way too much salt in the seasoning and adding additional hot sauce makes the experience that much more unenjoyable.          I now have these when I am pretty hungry and want to  ing compact snack to a place where I know there will be a microwave but I will not be ordering these again once the box is finished.          Oh and they aren't hot nor spicy. Just salty.
