Addictive and totally unexpected. I first tasted these at the Fancy Food Show in New York a couple of years ago. Was amazed to find them on Amazon   and bought immediately for our lunch clients. What you want in a potato chip: the crunch is fantastic and the flavor gives off both rosemary and olive oil, ending in a surprisingly smoky note.
