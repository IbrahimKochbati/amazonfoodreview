Oh I mean, I love my dog.  A lot.  But he is FAR too dumb to figure this out.  He instead just whacks me in the knee with it until I pull the rope out and  ing some treats out.          Hmm...maybe he's not the dumb one.          It's definitely challenging.  Frustrates my dog more than entertains him and is pretty formidable when connecting with sensitive kneecap tissue.
