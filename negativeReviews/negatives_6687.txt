We tried a box of these K Cups in our office, and 5 out of 5 people, myself included, couldn't get past the after taste.  It was so bad that we even turned down our supplier's offer to give us a 2nd free sample box of k cups.          We all agreed that the idea of super coffee sounded great, but we couldn't get past the after taste.  The first sip was good, and I would probably have given it 3 or 4 stars... but then the after taste kicked in.  Maybe it's the Ginseng or maybe it's the Guarana, but whatever it is...it's bitter and kind of chemically tasting.          One co worker added flavored creamer, and it was tolerable, but not good enough to accept a 2nd box free.          Our box did not include any over packed or poorly sealed cups, as the other reviewer experienced, although we have experienced that from time to fime with other manufacturers.
