My husband and I have been drinking Destiny Deep Sea water for about six months now.  We are finding that we are not craving sugar, sweets and pastries like we were before.  I have even found that I no longer crave diet soda pop and feel better about drinking this water instead.  We are feeling better and seem to have more energy, enough so that we even started exercising.  Our bodies seem happy with this water.  We are so glad that we found it.
