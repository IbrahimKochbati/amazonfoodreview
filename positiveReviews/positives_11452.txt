Something different that the adults and children alike can enjoy.  Better than chips, pretzels and candy   health wise.  Had never heard of this product sold in a "ready to eat" form and to find one so tasteful thrilled us all.  Chestnuts were always a winter treat for us but they are difficult to peel   not these, they are roasted and peeled for us.  Grab a few, settle in for an evening of TV watching.  BTW, they are great in a stuffing recipe for that seasonal turkey dinner   the Big One.  I am on a "purchase" a box bi monthly and had to step it up to once a  month.  You will never be sorry purchasing these.
