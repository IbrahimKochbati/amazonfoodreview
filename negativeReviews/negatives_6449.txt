We looked forward to receiving this product because it was no longer carried in our local store, however, when we received it, the name was the same, "Gold Kili Ginger Drink," but the ingredients were completely different.  I still have a couple packets of the Ginger Drink we used to buy and the ingredients are, "Ginger and Honey."  When we received this product, the ingredients were high fructose corn syrup, among other additives.  Upon seeing this, we promptly returned the item.
