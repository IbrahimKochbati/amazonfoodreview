I've been acquainted with Black Jewell popcorn since 1984. It is superior in a variety of ways. The "crunch factor" makes it preferable to "airy" popcorn. The absence of most of the hulls after popping also makes it a pleasure to eat.          Most all the kernels pop thus adding both value and eliminating waste.          But the MAIN reason I buy Black Jewell popcorn is that it just has that GREAT taste! Don't wait to enjoy Black Jewell, life is short!          Hey! It even makes bad movies better!
