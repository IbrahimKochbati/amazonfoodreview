We have a trolley style popcorn maker and used popcorn oil and popcorn bought at the grocery store at first. We had many unpopped kernels and the taste was only okay.          Then I ordered a case of Great Northern Popcorn 8 Ounce Portion Packs. This popcorn is great! We love the taste even three days after popping on the occasion when it lasts that long. We just followed the instructions on the package and all is well.          I was a little concerned when I first noticed the oil was in a soft, but solid state. It melts quickly though. The only complaint I have is that it is a little difficult to pour it all in at once, but this is due to the layout of my popcorn popper.          We have had friends over for football parties and they have requested more popcorn.
