First of all  I am not a sophisticated coffee connoisseur.          I actually think that McDonald's coffee is far more drinkable than Starbuck's burnt rubbish.          Anyway, as far as K Cups, I used to buy "Timothys" and it met my needs.          But when I tried Tully's Italian blend for first time today, wow!!  this is very appealing and is so easy to drink. Just the right strength and kick.          I noticed that the lids on the k cups I received today (May 7th) from Tully bulged out quite a bit   clearly they have packed a lot of N2 in these cups. Expiry date is Dec 2010.          I recall Timothy's cups do not bulge out as much   but I did not check how far those were from expiry dates.          I do not know if the "bulge" out factor impacts coffee taste or freshness but perhaps it helps if you plan to store the K cups for a long time.
