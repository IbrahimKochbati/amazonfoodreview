Not to long I receive my tree. I was surprise the tree I received is beautiful and strong. It arrived very well pack and in good health.  Lousbonsai even send me his business card and letter about taking care of your bonsai and if you have any question about the your tree.  I call him he's very helpful and  he also tell you what recommend for your tree.  I would recommend him for the next purchased in the  near future. Keep it up and very helpful.
