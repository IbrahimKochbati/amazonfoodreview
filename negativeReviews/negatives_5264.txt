I've had the other Annie's shells and cheddar and they're usually very good. I wanted to try whole wheat to be healthier, but it's really not worth it. It has a different texture that I didn't like. The flavor was okay but a little bland. If you want a good mac and cheese, stick with the original version from Annie's!
