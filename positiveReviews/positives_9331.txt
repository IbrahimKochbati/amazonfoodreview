I am always feeding my dogs chicken jerky, I love how this product has Glucosamine and Chondroitin in it. I am not sure how many I would have to feed though to get the true effects, I only feed 1 a day to each of my 4 dogs.          They love these, as they love all the Dogswell products. For smaller dogs, make sure you  eak up into smaller pieces as I had a pug almost choke on chicken jerkey ( not this  and )
