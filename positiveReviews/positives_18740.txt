This is the first time I have ever received anything related towards food via Amazon, and it came in a box, with the pack of 12 inside a plastic bag all together. It has been 104 degrees in New York City recently, so the box was at room temperature but the pack of 12 inside the plastic bag was very warm to the touch.          I put it in the fridge just to be sure until I google to see that you can leave it outside, thus I'm an idiot but that is another story  )          Its pretty easy to make, just place the chicken inside a large ziplock bag, puts the crumbs of package inside, and shakes like no tomorrow, then places it in a pan, and put it in the oven.          Very convenient for those of us who have no time on our hands, are extremely busy or lazy, or when we want to give our wives a  eak from cooking on sundays :)
