I've ordered these Emerald Dry Roasted Walnuts (6 pack of 9 oz. canisters) twice and they've been great.  Excellent flavor and both shipments were fresh.  I've read that walnuts have a short shelf life and was concerned the first time I ordered that I'd get old or rancid walnuts. I was very pleased with this product and will order more.
