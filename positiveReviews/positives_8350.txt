Title says it all. I took a dollop of this on a cracker. There is an odd mild and nondescript flavor that I doubt would taint anything. Then the burn begins to build. It just continues to build up until ridiculous levels. The mouth is the easy part, anyone can conquer that and sit mildly while waiting for the 30 minutes to go by. Its the other 3 hours of intense gut pain that makes a man out of you (you don't see that in the videos). Its worse if you eat it later after a previously eaten meal because it just sits in your stomach burning the hell out of you until all that food goes down the tubes. Sucked both times I did it. Used properly, it puts a mean heat in anything you eat.          Don't bother trying to be an hero and eating a spoonful, you can't handle it.
