This is a great GF blend to use for those times you don't want to measure out a bunch of different flours on your own. It makes great cookies and other sweet baked goods you start to miss when going GF. I noticed a lot of the negative reviews were complaining about it not being plain coconut flour or having more carbs than they wanted. The beauty of this flour is it's made by a mom with a celiac daughter. A lot of us are just looking for a way to make our kids (or ourselves) the baked goods everyone else enjoys and this blend is an amazing substitute!
