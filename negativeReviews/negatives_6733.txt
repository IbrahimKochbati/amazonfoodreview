They were once produced in York, PA, but that was a long time ago.  Now they're from Monterrey Mexico.  Same great taste?  Who knows.  I hadn't had any for years until I wolfed my way through one of these boxes.  They taste good enough, but I'll never know if they were like the originals from York.  Why does something like this need to be imported?
