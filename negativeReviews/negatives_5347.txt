I'm more of a tea drinker, but enjoy an occasional cuppa joe. But the acid never bothered me. I won't say I missed it here, but the flavor didn't wow me, and lactose, alcohol, and smoking all seem to give me the "fiery urp," the acid in coffee not so much. It wasn't bad tasting, mind you, and if you love coffee but get heartburn from high acidity, it's probably worth a shot. Not my cup of tea though!
