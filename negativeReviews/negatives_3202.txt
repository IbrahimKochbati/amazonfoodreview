I had originally bought these in medium for my golden retriever puppy. When she finished that box she had outgrown them so I bought the large.  While she loves these, she devours them in no time and her  eath is no better. I do not think she fully digested them either. While she was a puppy they helped with puppy  eath a lot because she ate them slowly, however I would not recommend these if you have a large dog that eats things quickly.
