I had never heard of this coffee before but I got a bag and really liked it.  This Melitta Cafe Riviera Sunset Decaf is a very good decaf with a good taste and body.  This stuff is perfect for a late night cup of coffee or for a cup with some dessert.  Its decently priced and I will definitely buy this again.
