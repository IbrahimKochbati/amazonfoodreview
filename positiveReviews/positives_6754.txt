This is the best of the ready made kinds.  In my experience, the powdered kinds are truly awful.  The other ready made  ands taste like pure yellow mustard. This one is made with horseradish and no real wasabi, but it works well with sushi.          It also makes a great cocktail sauce for shrimp when mixed with plain old Ketchup and a pinch of Old Bay Seafood Seasoning.
