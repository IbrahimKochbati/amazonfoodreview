We were very pleased with our 5lb bag of french roast. My boyfriend is a coffee snob, but we're on a tight budget these days and even he had to concede we were spending an awful lot on coffee. Buying one bag of this saved us $15.          This french roast is not quite as good as my boyfriend's local house roasted preferred blend, and it is a wee bit more acid than the Whole Food's "Early Morning Buzz" that I drink, but after a few days we stopped noticing. Next time I'll buy two bags and freeze one   the last bag we got was fresh enough to make that an option. I'd like to try some of the other blends from Coffee Bean Direct, too.          The bag is laughably large, by the way. You'll open the box and say "Whoa   now that's A LOT of coffee!"
