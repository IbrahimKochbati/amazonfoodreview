I love the coconut water   light and refreshing, packed with potassium. I was guzzling it down like, well, water, daily. I don't really enjoy plain water a lot of the time, but this provided refreshment, hydration, and flavor without a lot of the junk and or calories that other drinks come with. 5 stars.          I was looking forward to continuing buying it and consuming it regularly with subscribe and save. However....          Price, specifically change in price, is terrible. 1 star. I cannot say more.
