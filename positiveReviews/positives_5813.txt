I have a great dane   she is very food intolerant; she cannot tolerate  own rice, beef, lamb, sweet potato nor large amounts of  occoli, spinach, peas, and not too much fiber.  I chose this dog food because it has 3 meat proteins  chicken, turkey & fish, no rice, and small amounts of vegetables and is low in fiber.  This dog food has worked extremely well for her.  She no longer has soft stools, her coat is much better, she doesn't have itching problems and she likes it.  It is high calorie   so she only gets 4 1 2 cups per day for her 140 lbs.
