First of all the food does not have a fishy smell when opened and served. That is a great plus,because these flavors in other  ands usually do.     There are 4 kinds in this pack. You get 6 cans of each. Red snapper, yellowfin tuna, cod and sole and chuncky tuna.          My cats liked the yellowfin tuna best, but they ate all of it. The food is pricey, but worth it if you love to spoil the fur babies.
