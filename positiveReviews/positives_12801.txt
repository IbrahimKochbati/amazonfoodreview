The Switch Kiwi Berry was a good drink. I thought it was a little too sweet for my taste, but not by much. One serving size was 8.3 fluid ounces. It contains 33 grams of sugar and 34 grams of carbs per serving, and each serving was 135 calories. According to the label, it contains 100% of the recommended daily allowance of Vitamin C. The drink has a slight carbonation to it that was a lot less than soda. The small and skinny can makes it good for inclusion in a lunch box.          Although I liked it, I don't think it's worth the price of nearly $1 a can. But for the convenience of size, it might be worth the trade off on occasion.
