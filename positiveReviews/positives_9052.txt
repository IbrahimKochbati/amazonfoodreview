When I first purchased my Keurig coffee maker I couldn't decide how to store the K cups. I didn't want to give     up my counter space for the carousel. I settled for a flat holder that with open compartments and could be     put in a drawer or attached to the wall. I didn't want to spend the extra few dollars for this drawer type.     After shifting that one around from drawer to balanced against the wall I finally gave in and went for this great holder that allows the Keurig to sit on top and now I have my counter space back and a nice neat area for my     Keurig. I hope that I can save someone some time and money by letting you know about my experience.
