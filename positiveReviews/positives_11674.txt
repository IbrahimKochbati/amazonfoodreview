My package arrived today and being a chocolate coconut fanatic and hungry at the time, I immediately ate one and shared one with my husband as well for his viewpoint.          Pros: Pretty yummy, especially for a health food product. Rich in coconut and oat. It feels as though you are eating more than you are, has a satisfying effect.          Cons: The wrapper is much bigger than the product, causing my first reaction to be, "this is it???" But like I said, it was filling.. but it needs a bit more chocolate. However, my husband argues that it would no longer be health food then.          NOTE: There seems to be a misadvertisement here. It's a pack of 5, not 6.
