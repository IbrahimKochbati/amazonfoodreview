The plant come early then expected and was in perfect condition. So far the plant is doing okay, just can't understand why the traps are turning black after every feeding. I try contacting the company, but no one was there to answer the phone. Either way they delivered the plant to my house without it being damaged or smashed. I would recommend buying from this company again.
