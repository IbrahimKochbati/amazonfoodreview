I contacted Happy Bellies after purchasing what appeared to be a bad can at my local target. They responded within one business day. Below is an excerpt of their response to me. I thought other parents would appreciate this information.          "I can tell you that this is a wholly organic, minimally processed product, and as such, it's subject to slight changes in the organic crop year, season, etc.  Also, since this is drum dried (thin film on a hot steel rolling dryer), changes in drum temp can occasionally cause more  owning than normal.  Also, this product (BELLIES cereal) is on what's called a "positive release" program, which means that product cannot be released for sale until the required testing comes back acceptable.  The fact that it was for sale tells me it passed those tests...     Right now, I feel as though rough handling (trucks, forklifts, shelf stockers, etc.) has caused damage, most likely leading to a seam leak.  Since we flush the can with nitrogen, a seam leak allows air (oxygen) into the can, which can cause a set of oxidation reactions.  These are responsible for off flavours colours odours, but other than that, are harmless, and do not pose a food safety threat to your son."          I believe in this product and their commitment to customers. Hopefully they will resolve these issues soon, but knowing that the product is safe is most important to me  even if the color is off.
