I bought my wife a new popcorn popper for her birthday and was looking for some high quality popcorn to go with it. She loves movie theater popcorn, and others said they thought this popcorn had similar taste. Well, they're RIGHT! This is fantastic tasting popcorn. It pops up fluffy and tastey, with very few unpopped kernals. I was very pleased with the pre measured packaging making it super easy to dump in the machine and let it do all the work. We've already re ordered a box since our first batch, and I am anxiously waiting for it to come back in stock so we can order even more!
