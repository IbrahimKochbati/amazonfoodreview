I had high expectations based on some reviews, but aside from the apple, these were mostly blech and my baby did not like them.  The consistency of the squashes was very pasty, and the peas tasted like powder.  I ended up just using them to sneak extra nutrition in other dishes (the squash wasn't bad mixed with mashed potatoes, but I couldn't put in too much or the little guy was on to me!).  The apple was actually a really nice consistency, a little bit of texture and tasted quite delicious.  I definitely recommend getting the variety pack before launching into a big box of one kind.  It's a great idea, but won't work for everyone.
