I purchased these vanilla beans to make homemade vanilla.  This is my first vanilla bean purchase ever.  I was very pleased with the quality of these beans.  There were approximately 50 beans, and they were large, very fragrant, and contained lots of "caviar".  I could see the extraction starting to take place shortly after I split and immersed these in my vodka.  I should have some wonderful vanilla extract in 6 months.  Thanks!
