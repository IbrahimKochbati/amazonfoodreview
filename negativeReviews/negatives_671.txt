I emailed customer service and asked if the treats were filled with sweet potato, and they assured me that they'd checked with the manufacturer and confirmed that they did in fact have a sweet potato center.  However, the ones I received did not and I feel like I was lied to by customer service because they didn't want to take the time to actually check into it.
