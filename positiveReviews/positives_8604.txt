These are a tasty alternative to carb heavy regular pretzels. I rely on Kay's Naturals to help me in my high protein diet. I would have these for  eakfast every day if I could. I'm sad that I have to order them online, however. They should be available everywhere. Kids should be getting these in school vending machines, instead of the evil crap that is now available. THESE ROCK!
