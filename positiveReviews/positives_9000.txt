I was introduced to this tea at a local restaurant and went absolutely crazy about it. Its unique flavor and healthifying blend of green and black teas and yerba mate, along with a light touch of ginger, is a wonderful thirst quencher.  As a tonic for health and energy, I now find myself drinking it daily instead of my usual afternoon coffee. It perks up the body and  ain without the jittery effects of caffeine. I find I get a delightful pick me up later in the day  when I need it  without the negative affects of keeping me up at night.  While a tad expensive, I will continue to buy SPORtea and enjoy its delicious  ew.  It is now a part of my every day routine.
