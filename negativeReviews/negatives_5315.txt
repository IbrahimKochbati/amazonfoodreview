I thought I was ordering unsweetened, since I typed "Almond Milk Unsweetened" in the search bar. This product came up as the #2 selection, and the price was good, so I bought it. After it arrived, I noticed that it had cane sugar in the ingredients. You would think with unsweetened in the search engine, Amazon would do a better sorting job than to have a sweetened version as the #2 choice. My fault for not looking more closely. Live and learn, the Amazon search engine isn't perfect.     Since I cannot have sugar, I cannot rate the product.
