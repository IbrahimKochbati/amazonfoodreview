This product was so easy to work with.  On 6 23 12 I made a little over 100 flowers for wedding cupcakes, the following day I did the same using a different color of Satin Ice. The flowers of both fondants were firm, I stored them in an air tight container. On 7 2 12 I opened the container of flower made with the Fondarific and they were soft.  The flowers made from Satin Ice were perfect. I left the container of Fondarific flowers open over night to see if they would harden up again, they turned out "gummy", you know, like chewed gum, which is probably less sticky than this mess.  I am so dissappointed in this product.  Fortunately I made my flowers early, I have time to purchase Satin Ice and make 100 more flowers.  I do not recommend this product.
