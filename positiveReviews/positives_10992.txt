I've tried many gluten free crackers and the ones by Glutino are without a doubt the best ones.  They are tasty, crisp and thick enough to hold up under cheese and fruit. They are a bit pricey for the small amount of product, but well worth it.  I love the two bag packaging, keeping them fresh longer.
