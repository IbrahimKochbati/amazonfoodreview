This orange tangerine juice bills itself as having "100% of what you want" and "0% of what you don't want." It is pure orange and tangerine juice with a bit of carbonation, but no added sugar, preservatives and carbonation.          Of course, that's all great, but the big question is how it tastes. I'm pleased to be able to say it tastes pretty good. It has a bit less zip than I usually prefer in my orange soda, but a nice orange   tangerine flavor and no noticeable aftertaste. I would definitely try this again if I had the chance.
