I've been looking for this toy forever.  Last I heard, it was only available online and it was rather expensive    good to see that the price has come down.  The local PetSmart finally picked it up in their merchandise, so I had to grab one.          The dogs can't get enough of it!  They're Australian Shepherds, so they combine high intelligence, high drive and EXTREMELY high energy, and it's hard to find a toy that will stand up to that.  They get bored so quickly once they figure something out, and then their new goal becomes "how can we destroy this previously entertaining item?"  This toy is one of the few that has actually worked well for them.  It took them around an hour to figure it out, but they've been merrily tugging away ever since.  It seems really durable, and it's certainly keeping their attention.  (Maybe they'll stop unscrewing the plug to the bathtub drain now...)          If you crate train your dogs, and they have to stay in their kennel when you're away, I HIGHLY recommend this item.  Haven is our little deaf girl, and she has some anxiety problems because of it.  Any time my boyfriend and I leave the house, she freaks out.  This toy keeps her occupied when she's in her kennel, and rewards her for being in there.          The only problem I've had with it so far is that the dogs both want to play with it solo    may have to get a second so they'll both get a turn.
