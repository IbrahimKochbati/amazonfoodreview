Switch tastes more like chemicals than juice. I was expecting something along the lines of Orangina, instead it's closer to orange soda but without the carbonation level that makes orange soda enjoyable. For a small drink (8.3 oz), it's pretty high in calories (140). Frankly, I don't think the flavor is good enough to justify the caloric level.          Bottom line: If you're die hard soda drinker, this might be a better option for you. If you're a die hard juice drinker, stick to juice. If you want fizzy juice, add a little seltzer to your fruit juice.
