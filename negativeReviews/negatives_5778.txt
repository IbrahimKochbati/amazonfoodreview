I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious  and of dog food. My dogs did eat this food at first, but didn't seem to enjoy it as much as their previous  and. After reading the ingredients of Beneful, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. I try to avoid corn in all pet foods, and as a main ingredients is just ridiculous. Dogs are meant to eat real meat, they are carnivores. Basically dogs cannot fully digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by product, its not even a real meat! By products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging when they are not present in the food; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.          I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.
