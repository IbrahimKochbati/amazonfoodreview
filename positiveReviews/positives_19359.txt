This coffee is bold enough and quite tasty in DeCaf.  I have GERD so the low acid helps a lot without robbing any flavor, in my opinion.  It costs a lot more than the 100% Columbian Decaf I was using (otherwise, 5 stars) but the lower acid is worth something.  I must like it because I reordered it from Amzaon after the trial from the maker.
