Yes, people will tease you when you talk about loving microwave pork rind, but they're tasty enough to endure it. The directions on the bag are fine, but not the way I do it. Put a heaping 1 3 of a cup of the greasy pellets in a  own paper lunch bag. Lay the bag on its side in the microwave. Now, it's time to get to know your microwave. For mine, it takes 2 and a half minutes for all of the pellets to "pop" perfectly. If you still have unpopped pellets, try a little longer. Too long and they'll taste a little burnt. Amazon is wonderful, as always, to offer them cheaper and faster than anywhere else! Enjoy!
