We have a new Celiac diagnosis in our home.  We tried Ener G and one other  and premade  ead that, even though they cost $6 each for a tiny loaf, neither were edible.  We had just about given up on baked goods in general when we were lucky enough to stumble across some promising reviews on Amazon.          Tonight I made Tastefully Simple beer  ead (a family favorite) and Pamela's Gluten Free Rolls, so the gluten intolerant child wouldn't feel left out, to go with our beef stew.  Well, 5 people were "supposed" to eat the beer  ead and only 1 was "supposed" to eat the rolls, however the rolls were a hit with all of us.          My gluten free daughter was in heaven, not having a decent  ead product since she was diagnosed about 6 weeks ago.  The rest of us knew the rolls weren't exactly like our usual wheat based ones, but they didn't have a weird texture or after taste and were quite yummy anyway.          We mixed the eggs, oil, water, yeast, and packaged mix in the mixer for 3 minutes.  I used an ice cream scoop to fill 15 muffin cups.  Let them rest rise for an hour and baked for 23 25 minutes.  They rose beautifully and got a delicious looking color.          Next time, I am going to underbake most of the rolls so they can be frozen to be thawed and reheated at a later time.          Wow...I am so excited she doesn't have to live the rest of her life without delicious  ead :)
