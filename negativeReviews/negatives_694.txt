I received this box with great anticipation since they don't sell these on the west coast. I got the package, opened the box and was EXTREMELY disappointed. The cookies looked like a gorilla shook the box to death and left most of the box filled with crumbs. AND THERE WAS A RODENT SIZED HOLE ON THE SIDE OF THE BOX!!!!!!!! So, needless to say I will not NOT be reordering these again.
