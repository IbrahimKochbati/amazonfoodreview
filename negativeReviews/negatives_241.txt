This is not jerky, this is processed, hard like a rock, very greasy and stale smelling stripe of something that you can't  eak into anything smaller than 2 inches long and that certainly is not the size of a training treat! The dogs  45lb dogs that will eat anything  were not impressed, it was hard to chew, and it sounded like they were crunching rocks, most of them spat it out after a few chews, left it there, this would be the first time they would not eat something in their entire lives, these dogs will work for lettuce. Where is a zero star button?
