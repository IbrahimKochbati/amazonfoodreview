I love coffee, but prefer mild blends.  My husband on the other hand, loves 'smack you in the face" bold coffee. I thought I'd give this a try to see if the low acid version would make my stomach feel better.          It has a very strong, deep aroma. Very much like being in a Turkish coffee house. I found the taste too strong, even when diluted in half with mild. It's pretty potent!  My husband however, thought it was fantastic. So if you love a bold, deep coffee but can't deal with the stomach pains it can create give this a try.          I'd be interested to try some 'lighter' blends if Puroast creates any.  I do appreciat the low acid aspect, and I think they could reach a wider audience with different blends and perhaps even flavored options.
