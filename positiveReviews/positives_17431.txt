If you're buying this to  eak your coffee habit   this is a great way to start. Just mix some into your coffee to get started until your drinking just teeccino.The stuff tastes great   similar to but better than coffee. They say that it's actually good for you. I think it probably is. It has potassium and some other nutrients. The only downside is that I think that it probably still stains your teeth like coffee. And that it tastes so good (without the guilt) that you may even drink it more than coffee.
