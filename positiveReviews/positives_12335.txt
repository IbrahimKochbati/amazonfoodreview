Don't know if there is anything I can really say in terms of a review about dog food, but I do know that my dog loves this food!  My in law did a bunch of research on dog food for their own dogs and found that this  and was very good in terms of not using filler products to make their food so I tried it out.  In any case, this seems to be working out really well for my dog!!!
