I really enjoy this tea.  I still don't understand their spicy version though as I think the original is richer and just as spicy. This is a dehydrated form which you only need add hot water.            There is also concentrate that comes in a 1 2 gal jug which you can add to steamed milk.  That is much more cost effective for home use.
