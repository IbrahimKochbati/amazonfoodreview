I've fgound the cure for drinking too much coffee inthe morning. Get this one. I thought, when I first had this, that I had accidently wiped the sugar spoon with a Mr Clean cloth, but the next day, I had one cup of Tully's and made the second cup, the Green Mountain Breakfast blend. The disinfectant taste was back. I would not buy this one again.
