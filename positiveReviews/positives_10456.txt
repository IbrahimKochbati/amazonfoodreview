This is an extremely high quality cat food that tastes (according to the cats) as good as it looks. I have seven (yes, seven) cats, all rescues who have become spoiled  ats and who enjoy being difficult to please. They didn't care for all of the Fussie Cat flavors, but the tuna with shrimp and the tuna with salmon were both big hits and we stocked up.          I'm thrilled to have a food of this quality to feed them!
