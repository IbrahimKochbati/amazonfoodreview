I thought that I would give this a try as a way to keep my 2 Year old English Mastiff's teeth in good condition. I treat my dogs (the other is a rescue hound) homepathically (no chemical vaccinations, etc) and this I thought, would fall in line with not having to give him anesthesia for routine teeth cleaning.          I found others who mentioned choking incidents to be right. My Mastiff can plow through a huge rawhide bone in no time and with this chip, he literally just sucked it in and kept regurgitating it to soften it. Not good...too scary for me. The large size is even too small for a Mastiff's huge mouth and I will not buy these again. I will just continue with teeth  ushing  wlthough I hate doing it more than I think they do : )          I don't feel right giving it a 3 star rating, for me, I really need a not applicable rating. I don't think they are bad, they are just not good for my large  eed dog. For others, these chips may be OK to use but I would still suggest being in the same room with them if you choose to use these.
