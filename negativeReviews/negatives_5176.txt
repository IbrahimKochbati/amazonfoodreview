We ordered the medium large tug jug.  It smelled like plastic so strongly my dog would not go near it no matter what food we put in it.  I tried it with a friends dog four times and the dog could not connect that kibble came out when he let go.  All he wanted to do was tug.  The rope was so stiff he couldn't really get a grip on it and the rope also smelled of chemicals.  Between the BPA in the bottle and cap and the inflexible rope, we found it was unusable and sent it back.
