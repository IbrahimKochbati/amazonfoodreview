I remember the Space Craze of the late 60s early 70s, and Mom buying Space Food Sticks. Originally they were long round tuby looking things. The box rarely made it home before being completely consumed. I like the Astronaut ice creams too. My only wish is that it had the Astronaut pizza. They used to sell the pizza at the Air Force Museum in Ohio where I worked. Anyway, the box of goodies is a bit small but enjoyable.
