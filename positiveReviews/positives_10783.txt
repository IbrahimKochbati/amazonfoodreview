The Newman's Own Organics Ranch Style Dog Treats are pretty plain   a  own rectangle (the kids call them ugly), compared to the other dog treats we've purchased at the supermarket.  But the real consumer of this product are the dogs and they love them.  We have two large mixed  eeds and one is more finicky than the other (think of them as the Oscar and Felix of the dog world) and they both enjoy these treats (though the treats are small for 60+ pound dogs).  The treats are sized for medium sized dogs (you can always give bigger dogs two) and the nice feature that I like is they come in a rectangle that has a line division down the middle that can be used to  eak the treat in half if you have a smaller dog.  So while, they won't be winning any awards for attractiveness, they are organic without unneeded additives and the dogs appreciate them as a reward for a job well done or just a treat for being the wonderful pets that they are.
