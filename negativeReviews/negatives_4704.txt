This variety pack came to us as an Amazon Vine program sample.  Our two cats have been living on various "high end" dry cat foods for some time now (e.g., the "Before Grain" foods in chicken, tuna and salmon versions, and some fancy pantsy "Duck a l'orange" stuff from our local pet shop).  They have not been partial to canned foods, nor have I often gone the canned food route because it is less than convenient and didn't seem worth the candle since they seem to favor dry food (and mice and birds and whatever else they can glean from our little acre in the woods).  They typically start out loving canned food, but after a few bites, the rest sits in the bowl and dries out before we toss it and go back to the dry food they've grown to love.          However, both of our cats are smitten by this stuff.  It looks like real food out of the can, with large chunks of fish and seafood in a thickened  oth.  It doesn't have the strong fishy smell of most canned foods and looks like something I could almost be tempted to eat my self in a pinch.  The 3 ounce size makes it perfect for a "treat" for the cats between feedings of dry food and they leave nothing behind when we dump a can in their dish (with some added hot water as they really love the  oth).          But I'm not sure I want my cats eating this stuff for the same reason I don't want my eight year old eating at fast food franchises, much as she might love the food and snarf it up in a flash    I'm concerned this food may not be a healthy thing for the animal eating it or for the planet. Seeing "Made in Thailand" emblazoned on the box made me immediately wonder whether this stuff might include ingredients banned in the US or could otherwise be manufactured without adequate regulation of methods and materials.  The Chinese pet food fiasco certainly came to mind.          The discussions of other reviewers about the menadione used in this product confirms my concern.  I'm also left to wonder about the source of the fish and seafood in these cans    is it farm raised in Thailand and if so under what conditions; is it wild fish that may be subject to overfishing and at the very least ought to be feeding hungry humanity rather than going down my cats' gullets; what about mercury and other contaminants in the food?          Bottom line: my cats seem to love the stuff, but I'm not sure that will be sufficient to convince me to buy it again.
