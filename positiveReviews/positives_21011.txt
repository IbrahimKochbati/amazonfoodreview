I'm now on a low sodium diet, and trying to find foods I can still eat.  I love sardines with crackers and cheese, so thought I'd give these Brunswick Lemon & Cracked Pepper Seafood Snacks a try.  At 220 mg of sodium per serving, it's pretty low compared to fish in mustard or hot sauce.  Pretty much what I expected from this...a nice lemon pepper fishy flavor.  Made a nice sandwich, would be great with crackers too.  I'm pretty much a cheapskate, so I don't spend more than $1 $2 a can for sardines or fish steaks.  The price was right for these as well!
