I prefer the two textured gummi's over the regular gummi's. Haribo's are among the best and the frogs are addictive. The current price, combined with the free shipping and no tax make these a nice buy. The only drawback of buying in bulk is that I tend to eat more of them. These are aslo a big favorite of my kids who would also give them 5 stars.
