These are the same box mixes that I've been buying locally for a while.  That's a good thing!  We like the flavor, and usually add an extra can of black beans.  This works well with some salsa and cheese as a simple but hearty chip dip, and also as a good base for vegetarian tacos fajitas.  If you haven't tried these before, you should be able to try a single box from your local supermarket, so you don't have to risk wasting most of a case if you don't like them.     It's very convenient (and very economical) to buy these by the case from Amazon   quick delivery with Subscribe & Save, no problems at all.          Recommended!
