I've been using palm coconut sugar on and off for a while and recently bought this  and. After reading about it on the company website, I was satisfied that it's the real deal and am happy with it. I've put it in the coffee grinder to make it powdered for making frosting and it worked well. I love the flavor of this sugar too.
