I live in an area with lots of health food stores, and I couldn't find whole wheat orzo.  Since I switched over to whole wheat pasta and had so many recipes that called for orzo, this was a problem.  Yes, you buy a few jars at a time, but they keep forever, and the jars are small, so I am not worried about the product being on my shelf past the expiration date.  Very tasty, too!
