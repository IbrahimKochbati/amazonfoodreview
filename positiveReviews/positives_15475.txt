Don Pepino pizza sauce is the best canned pizza sauce bar none!  DO NOT LET THE GIMMICKY LABEL DETER YOUR CONFIDENCE IN THIS PRODUCT!  I was turned on to this sauce by a dear friend of mine who pointed it out to me in Swiacki's Store in Philly:     Swiacki Meats     3623 Salmon Sreet     Philadelphia, PA 19134     This is the BEST place to buy kielbas or any type of sausage in any form by the way, and they always stock amazing goods and groceries there as well.  My very first can was purchased there.  Buy local if you can!          Back to the sauce!  They only use vine ripened Jersey tomatoes and I do not know what else they put in their sauce, but it is amazing!  I bake my own pizza now and their sauce is the sole reason!  The flavor and texture combination will literally produce "WOW!" results from guests at your dinner table.  Beleive me, you would never guess the quality of the contents of this CAN!!! (not a glass jar) by the label.  This stuff is amazing and you really need to try it for yourself.  I will step off the soapbox now!  Try it and you'll never look at another jar of pizza sauce the same way.  It's just that good!
