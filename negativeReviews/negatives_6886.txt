The first time I had this tea, I couldn't stand it.  Had one or two teabags, mourned my purchase, and left the other 18 tea bags there.  I've just tried it again and I found it all right, so I think I can get through the rest, but it will definitely take time.          The flavoring added to this tea is clumsy and heavy.  The tea bags themselves say "natural & artificially flavored" and say it has a "rich, robust flavor".  That's for sure.  Dunk a tea bag in a glass of unheated tap water (I drink all mine steeped in room temperature water, never boiled) and you will watch the water immediately turn  own, whereas a higher grade tea would need much more time to get anywhere near that coloring.  The aroma also is very artificial smelling and way too strong compared to what naturally flavored teas smell like.          Is this a problem?  Not necessarily.  You might be looking for a "heavy" tea that you can use as a step to wean your kids off of colas.  With some sugar, possibly some cream, this might be exactly what you are looking for.  In the same way this might also be a way to wean yourself off of coffee if, as a coffee drinker, you feel that teas are too "light".  Or you might just like your tea this way, period.  Just be aware of this when you buy it.          I recommend the Dilmah  and, Caramel flavor, as being similar to this one but not as fakey smelling.  (Dilmah also makes a Vanilla, which I think is OK but not stunning.)
