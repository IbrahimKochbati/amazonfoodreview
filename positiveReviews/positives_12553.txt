I received some Green Moutain Coffee K Cups as a sample test through Buzzagent and I was quite pleased with this.  It's not too strong of a coffee, but not too weak of a coffee either, it has a great blend of flavor.  It has a smooth taste and is not to bitter like some coffees tend to be.  Good price on this  and as well.  Overall I would have to say this a keeper for my morning ritual.
