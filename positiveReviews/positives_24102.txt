This product is great for those of us who have allergies!  I am allergic to wheat, dairy, egg and many others.  This is great because it is so great tasting and versatile.  All you add is water!!  The best part is that I can pour out just what I need to make a few pancakes for myself   then I put the bag in a ziploc container for later.  Since all you have to add is water, it is easy to make just a little.
