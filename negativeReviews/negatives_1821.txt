I purchased this product in the hope of utilizing it to produce yogurt. The yogurt produced by this product was very thin and could not be thickened using only culture.          From the producers website          "Note:  Goat milk yogurt is very thin, almost like kefir. For a thicker consistency, add 1 packet of unflavored gelatin dissolved in some of the scalded goat milk...."          The product has a distinct aroma. Not terrible, but was stronger than comparable fresh goat milk. The flavor of the milk was only acceptable.          In a pinch this product will suffice, however; I would not personally recommend it for regular consumption.
