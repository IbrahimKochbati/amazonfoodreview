My friend and I had a flavor tripping party for two.  We each dissolved one tablet on our tongues and then dug in to a plate full of lemons, limes and other sour items.  The effect was immediate and amazing.  We were laughing hysterically throughout the whole ordeal.  We also tried shots of vinegar, mustard by the spoonful (really yummy) and several other types of fruit.  We had a blast finding new things to try.  I think next we're going to have a big group over to play around.  As other reviewers have mentioned, you can split the tablets in half to lessen the effect.  Remember   if you're going to have a flavor tripping party of your own, pack some antacid.  After all we ate, we really needed it.          Updates 12 20   I gave mberry pills to friends for the holidays.  The pills didn't work for all of them.  Judging by some of the reviews the pills either don't work for everyone or not every pill is the same potency.  I contacted the seller who put me in touch with the manufacturer and they are sending me out a replacement batch to give the people who had a bad experience.  Excellent customer service all around.  I still wholeheartedly recommend giving the tablets a try.  If it works for you, it is really amazing.
