If this was called "Medium Roast", I would give it 4 stars. It's a good coffee.          But this is called French Vanilla Caramel, and this review is based on the product's name.          Let me say that vanilla and caramel are perhaps my favorite flavors... coffee, ice cream, candy, you name it... if it's vanilla or caramel, I love it.          With the exception of this.          Where's the vanilla? Where's the caramel? And don't get me wrong: I'm not trying to say that the flavors are too mild. I'm saying that they are NON EXISTENT. And therefore, based on the name, this coffee gets 1 star.
