What more needs be said??  I purchased this cautiously because I was tentative about it being TOO salty but then I thought about the corporation that makes it, Maruchan® and bought it since Maruchan® completely ROCKs when it comes to udon meals.          Oh my gracious sakes alive is it good.  It helps to immerse the vegetables in the water   but that's MY fault.          Yay!  I'm not sure YOUR taste but I LOVE my boxes of Maruchan®!!
