You know I love my English Breakfast (see my earlier 5 star review of Twinings English Breakfast)    but my greatest delight is Earl Grey tea    with its deep, smokey, heavy (but not burdensome) mysterious wonderful flavors that linger hauntingly on the tongue and  ing sublime moments of joy into a grey day (no pun intended). Steep it long enough so that all the flavor intensity is in your cup (or tea pot) Drink it straight, with no sugar    OR   sweeten it to  ing out even more of its wonderful flavor    AND for a special treat, add cream or milk or soy milk   your Earl Grey will take on a "Chai presence"!!! Either way, Twinings Earl Grey is a tea to look forward to time and time again.          Lady Grey was new to me, and yes it is a bit lighter and not as intense as the Earl himself, but Lady Grey is still very very good    notably so.          Irish Breakfast is a tea that may make you  eak out in song    it is robust and delightful, clearing up "morning fog" in a hearty way.          This is a very good variety pack, IMHO, to keep on hand at the office when having panel meetings or board meetings    or just in the " eak kitchen" for folks to enjoy when they are want a tea  eak!! Wonderful flavors and aromas like these can't but help to make people sit up and notice, and make a sometimes dull work day (or...ahem...meeting) more enjoyable.
