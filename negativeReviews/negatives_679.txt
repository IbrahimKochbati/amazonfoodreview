To be honest with you, I got these at a store. You think wow chocolate chips, and Oreos. Think again.For those that think these are so good, I would recommend the Hershey's or Reese's crisp wafer bars. My honest view on these "thin crisps" cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer, or milk bones.
