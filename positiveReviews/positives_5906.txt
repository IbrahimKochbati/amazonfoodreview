Our QH mare gave birth to a beautiful Clydesdale Quarter Horse cross colt 3 weeks ago. It was her first baby and not only did she reject him, but she attacked him. Then he was attacked by a dog because his mother was not protecting him. He spent the first 7 days of his life in an equine neonatal intensive care unit. Regular mare's milk replacer gave him diarrhea, so they added goats milk, which stopped the diarrhea. When we  ought him home, we looked for a constant source of goat milk to add to his formula. The Meyenberg powdered goat milk works great! We add it to his formula and he loves it. Even better, he is able to digest his milk better and is thriving. Thank you Amazon and Meyenberg for a product that helped to save our foal's life.
