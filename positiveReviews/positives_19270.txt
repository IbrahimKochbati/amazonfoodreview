My toy poodle is 4 years old and he is pretty smart. He loves learning new tricks and seems to enjoy being challenged mentally. This product is great for him because he loves playing with tennis balls. Basically, this "toy" is really a puzzle for him to try to get the tennis ball out. It helps that my dog has small paws which can easily get inside the toy. Another benefit is the rubber is soft and is easily washable. It is particularly challenging for him to get the tennis ball
