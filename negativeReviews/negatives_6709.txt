I agree with the review about the strange taste.  I LOVE LOVE Black Jewell NATURAL flavor popcorn so I decided to try the Butter one. It popped up fine but it just has a weird taste!  Even my popcorn loving 12yr old said something was wrong with the flavor.  I ordered 6 boxes...don't know what I am going to do with the 5 boxes left...maybe donate? : ( I will continue to buy the Natural by the case and butter it myself.
