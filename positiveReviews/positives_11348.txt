This dog food was recommended by our standard poodle's  eeder.  She feeds it to both her  eeding dogs and her show dogs.  Our dog loves it, and eats every bit of his  eakfast, lunch and dinner right down.          The  eeder said for us to mix the food with a little warm water and a tablespoon of plain, unflavored, nonfat yogurt.  My vet agreed, and said that the yogurt was an excellent addition.  He also has standard poodles as his personal pets.          As poodle owners know, the  eed can be susceptible to a horrible stomach condition called "bloat."  Feeding your poodle a top grade dog food on a regular schedule is very important for these lovely animals.  This dog food fits the bill perfectly.          It is interesting that this is an adult dog food, but the kibble is smallish, and if mixed with the warm water while the dog is a puppy, it can be used throughout the dog's life, once he she is weaned.  You do not need a puppy chow when the dog is young.          This seller provides this food at a fair price, and ships promptly.          Recommended.
