No more heavy grocery bags for me    I've just ordered my first bag of Harmony Farms dog food    and it was delivered to my door by UPS.  The food is excellent quality    I bought this product based on its healthy ingredients; the dogs love it and I love Amazon for making it so easy to buy!          July 2010   one of my dogs has had bouts of inflammatory bowel disease:  previously she had to have special food from my vet (Royal Canaan Duck & Potato for the past 4+years)    She has tolerated, even thrived on, the Harmony Farms food w o any problems. Each bag of Harmony Farms is about $20 cheaper than the Royal Canaan.  Hard to fight.  I am a believer.          The canned food is great, too.          September 2011    my dog who has had inflammatory bowel disease in the past (verified by surgery) has never felt better    she is a wire and has the energy of a 2 yr old dog (she is 7); she is not on any daily medication.  This HEALTHY WEIGHT FORMULA has helped her to thrive.  Enough protein, not too much fat seem to do the trick. I highly recommend it.
