I really like the size of the pieces and the tenderness of the jerky I've had so far. I've only had one of the 4 packages that come in an order. I am not thrilled with the Teriyaki flavor but it's ok, not too salty. The sweet hot is really hot so beware. This  and is the first jerky I am willing to re order, which says a lot. Usually I get grossed out by the amount of sinew in packaged jerky but I have not found much in this  and yet.          Updating after opening all 4 bags that came in an order: 3 bags were good but the 4th bag was all gristle and fat. There was not one piece that was edible in it. So they definitely have a quality control problem. Pity, because the good pieces are quite good, though the teriyaki flavor is a bit chemical for me. Still better than most other jerky  ands
