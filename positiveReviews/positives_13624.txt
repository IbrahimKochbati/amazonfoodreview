Received item very quickly. I didn't try it until just lately for grilling season. Mixed it with a few other spices to make a rub for steaks ... oh so good. I have used other cheaper smoked hickory salts ... this has much more flavor. I just used it on Steel Head trout with some butter and garlic and dash of lemon ... mmmm good.
