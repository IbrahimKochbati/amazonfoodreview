I'm jealous of whoever thought of this, but the actual product turns out to be pretty unimpressive. It turns out, if you eat half a fruit roll up, then eat asparagus, the aspragus tastes differently than you might expect.  There. That's all you need to know.  DON'T buy this product, just buy some Gushers next time you're at Wal Mart.  2 star review because I like Gushers.
