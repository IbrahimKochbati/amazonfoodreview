The popcorn arrived the same day as our new Great Northern Foundation 8 oz popcorn machine. While using these packets couldn't be simpler, they are just a smidge too wide for easy access to the preheated popping bucket. You're having to dump the whole package, oil, salt and popcorn, into the bucket from the side, and if the oil, salt and popcorn were all in one compartment, it might be narrower and easier. That said, we found the popcorn that came out of these prepackaged packets just a little salty for our taste. In future, we'll probably make it without using the whole packet of salt. The butter flavored salt is a great idea, just maybe a little less of it.
