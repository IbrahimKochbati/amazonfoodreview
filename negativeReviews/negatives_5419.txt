I love Folgers "Smooth" coffee because of its low acidity and ease on the stomach, so I was anxious to try Puroast Low Acid Coffee for a different flavor and to mix it up a bit in the morning.  Sadly, I was not impressed.          While the coffee does have a robust flavor that definitely taps the tongue right at the first sip, I can't say it's a really good strong coffee flavor that I'd enjoy sipping.  It actually tasted weak by the second sip and after a while it just tasted old and bitter.          I tried fixing it up with things like sugar or Splenda but got the same outcome.  By the second cup, I tried a shot of Baileys and it still just had a bland flavor after the first sip.          I'll stick to my Folgers "Smooth" blend for now.  It's cheaper, not bitter, and keeps a constant flavor throughout that is quite pleasing.
