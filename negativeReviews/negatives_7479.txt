STOP USING THIS PRICEY JUNK NOW!! search "chicken jerky treats china" on google for more info and SPREAD THE WORD (some media coverage but way too little...) I am "fortunate"... my dog only suffered small amount of kidney damage   others are not so lucky. Remember the Chinese pet food scandal of 2007 that killed 1000's of our four legged friends...TELL AMAZON  NOT TO SELL CHINESE CHICKEN JERKY.  I read that Dogswell was going to stop manufacturing in China tho dont know current status.
