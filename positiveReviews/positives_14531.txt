I was worried because some of the reviews stated that the cans came dented. Since I was using this for soap making I wasn't so worried about the look of the cans. Still, I didn't want cans so badly dented that it leched metal into the oil. So I took a little gamble and ordered them. The cans arrived two days earlier than Amazon estimated they would. I opened the box only to find a second box inside. I remembered some of the reviews said that it had been well packaged, so I didn't get my hopes up. I opened this box to reveal mounds of bubble wrap. Finally I got to the cans. Both were pristine! I haven't made the soap yet, but the oil appears to be very nice. It has a light fruity smell and deep green color that I hope translates into the soap!
