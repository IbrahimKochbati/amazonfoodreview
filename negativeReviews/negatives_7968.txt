I ordered this tea based on the glowing reviews, however in my opinion, the quality just is not there.  I usually drink Japanese  and green teas like Yama Moto Yama and Ito En, and sometimes the Chinese American  and Triple Leaf.  This Stash organic decaf green tea is the worst green tea I have ever had.  It is a very bitter green tea compared to the  ands I am used to drinking.  The color of the tea is not as green as the other  ands I usually drink, but rather has more of a yellowish tone.  I had wanted to switch to an organic  and of green tea to avoid pesticides, etc. which may be found on the tea leaves of other  ands, but this tea was a major disappointment.
