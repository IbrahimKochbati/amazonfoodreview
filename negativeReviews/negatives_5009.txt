This is a great toy that my dog loved, but it didn't last very long. She likes to whip her toys around, and knocked this on something, and the container cracked. Also, the new style of toy has a nylon "flossy" style rope that is difficult to clean  man, that thing got smelly fast from kibble & doggy drool!          Overall, great concept, but I wouldn't recommend if your dog is rough with their toys...
