This is such a terrific product.  It's so easy. Pop it in the microwave and since we live on the run it is a great  eakfast.  The maple  own sugar flavor is really tasty.  My son likes the apples and cinnamon too, but I prefer this one the best.  Just what you need on a cold day.  Of course hearty eaters will use two packets at a time, but even that won't be a disaster if you are worried about calories.  My father in law eats oatmeal to lower cholesterol, but this tastes so good you would never know it is so healthy.
