The crunch is out of this world. I always have to pre apologize to my office mates when I have these for lunch.  They don't mind, but I do when they smack crunch too loud   I digress.          These are one of my favorite items my Kay's.  They don't have an aftertaste, maintain there crunch factor and are just plain good. The sweetness is not overpowering and the protein content helps to fill me up.          They are a main staple as a treat and or lunch addition.
