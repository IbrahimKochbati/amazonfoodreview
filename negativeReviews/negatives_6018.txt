I am a vegetarian, and I wanted so badly to like this vegan jerky. As soon as I opened the package, the first thing I noticed was that the jerky is very moist, not like real beef jerky at all (which I understand to be dry and chewy). Also, it smelled like pure dog food. I decided to take a bite anyway, and found that it tastes exactly like it smells. All I could think about was that I was eating dog food. I gave it 2 5 stars because one of my friends actually liked it, and apparently so do a lot of Amazon users since it comes highly recommended. Hopefully you like it better than I did, but beware if you are easily put off by unpleasant smells!
