BEWARE! This is not the "flavor" displayed on the label of the pictured can of cat food in the photo.  This is a photo of the original formula's label.  I ordered 5 cases because the label indeed showed a photo of the label on the "Classic Chicken ENTREE with Brown Rice"..this was the ORIGINAL formula.  Friskies phased out the original formula and REPLACED it with "Classic Chicken PATE with Brown Rice" (PATE IS ON THE LABEL OF THE NEW FORMULA).     My cat LOVED the ORIGINAL formula.  Friskies "replacement" formula is different (texture is nearly the same, so it has to be in the ingredients) MY CAT DOES NOT LIKE THE NEW FORMULA.  I believe this is an outrage.  Displaying one picture and then sending an entirely different labeled can?  I am disappointed in Amazon.  NOW, imagine the shipping expense to return 5 cases of canned cat food???? I had to separate the cases from the huge box in order to even lift them into the house!......$73+ down the drain.  To add insult to injury...I can get this replacement "PATE formula" at my local Petco store (on sale) for the SAME PRICE per case.  So much for trusting the photos of products displayed for sale on Amazon.
