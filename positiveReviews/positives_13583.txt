We purchased a pack with all the flavors and my daughter cannot devour them quick enough.  She has enjoyed all the flavors, but really seems to enjoy the apple blueberry the most.  She can easily grab the fruit and, even though she doesn't have teeth, it goes down smoothly.  I feel better as I am feeding her organic fruit that is safe!  It's a win win situation!
