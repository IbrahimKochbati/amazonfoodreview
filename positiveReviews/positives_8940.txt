This is a high quality Ghee , superior tasting and above all made from grass fed cows' milk and certified organic by the USDA.       We use it over lentils ,  eggs , sauteed veggies , quinoa , rice , you name it and we use it.  Tried it on whole grain toast too...YUMMY !! Being from grass fed cows' milk , it is rich in CLAs and boosts immunity and energy and is known to fight and obesity , especially trimming the waistline. This is my second time buying this and I am a consumer for life. I also introduced it to my friends and they are digging the taste.       I really hope AMAZON continues to sell this product  ( prime delivery really makes it all the more special ).      Please try it for getting healthier and also the incredible taste.  Highly recommended.
