I was disappointed to discover that once mixed, the tablespoon value of end product required 3 times the quantity to make a sandwich, meaning those label values are multiplied times 3.  I might as well just eat regular peanut butter when I figured up the caloric difference and carbs and sugar.  The taste was good on toast, so I've gone back and given product an extra star for that.
