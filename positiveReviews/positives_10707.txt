These snacks treats have excellent ingredients and are suitable for dogs who can chew them up. The one problem is that they are VERY hard and thus not great for small dogs or dogs who have trouble with hard treats. The biscuits are not large enough to be  oken up by hand. If you want to  eak them up, you basically need to use a hammer.          Bottom line   good for medium large dogs or those who can deal with very hard snacks.
