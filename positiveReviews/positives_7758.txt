Wow! These are great! I had them for the Super Bowl Party and everyone just went nuts over this product. Great taste and just the right snacking size. One word of caution, FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! Even though every bag I cooked was absolutely perfect, it was evident if you get distracted, they will burn real quick. Remember, this product IS NOT POPCORN. So there is no sound to help let you know its done. Again, FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! They are fabulous!
