I tried this cereal the other day and really liked it.  I paid $3.19 for a box at my local Target store.          I came onto Amazon to see if they sold it since they seem to carry alot of the same items that Target does.          Well, I come across this and am a little confused.  $14.99 for one box of cereal?  Is this right?
