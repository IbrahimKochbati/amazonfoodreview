This is a resubmittal of a previous review.  Originally, when I received my cheesecake I was very disappointed with the careless way it had been packaged and delivered   and I said so in my review.  I NOW say that if anybody ever says that Omaha Steakes doesn't care about their product feedback, do NOT believe it.  After submitting my original review, I was contacted by Mr. Sendgraff of Omaha Steaks who apologized for their poor packaging and inormed me that Omaha Steaks has a 100% satisfaction guarantee on all their products and, that he was refunding my entire purchase price, including shipping.  Even after I told him we had eaten the cheesecake, and it was really quite good, he insisted that my experience had not met their 100% satisfaction guarantee standards and my refund would stand.  I say, THANK YOU, Mr. Sendgraff, you are a credit to Omaha Steaks Customer Service and have restored my confidence completely.  I'm looking forward to my next purchase of an Omaha Steaks product.
