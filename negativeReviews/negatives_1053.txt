Some reviewers say the coffee is bitter  I like bitter but I didn't like this. It wasn't a good bitter taste, it was a "cringe" kind of taste.          I drink one of the strongest coffee's out there and this was too much for me. The strange taste of it turned me off...     I once owned a coffee pot by Melitta too, and it took a cone shaped special filter. I wasn't impressed with that either.          Maybe i'm just not big on Arabica coffee or whatever it is but the taste was unpleasant to me. Not smooth. Bitter yes, but not smooth.          It smells ok. I agree with Charlie ( another Amazon Reviewer) who said the package was difficult to open. It was sealed extremely tight and when you did eventually get it open, the bag tore apart.          No way would I spend 20 bucks for this. If i was addicted to it, possibly, but even then that's steep. And I surely won't buy this in the future.          You can go down to the local "name of popular coffee shop here" and get 2 bags for this price of FRESHLY ground coffee.          Melitta makes it sound like it's the greatest thing since sliced  ead on their package. Gourmet, Swiss water process, from Europe's charming sidewalk cafe's, top quality hand  picked beans..          If you want to pay this kind of money and like Melitta coffee, then get it, but I don't think it's anything special.
