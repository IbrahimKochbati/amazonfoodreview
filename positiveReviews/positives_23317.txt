This was my first attempt with gluten free  ead.  I have made 'regular'  ead for years.  This was so much easier   and just as good.  I did go to the website for Pamela's products and read her tips on  ead   and added an extra egg as suggested for extra softness.  This will be my 'basic'  ead recipe from which to  anch out and try different flavors.          Try this  ead mix   you will not be disappointed.
