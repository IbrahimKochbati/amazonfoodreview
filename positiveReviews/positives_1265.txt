I really enjoy these low calorie chips.  They have a good flavor with a good crunch and are crisp.          I was wondering if when ordering a case of these chips one could order their favorites and not the whole 6 flavors?  Say just 2 flavors if desired??          Its a great product. don't stop manufacturing them.
