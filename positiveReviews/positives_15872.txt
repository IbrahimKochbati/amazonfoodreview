High Quality ingredients. Excellent deal I got on the price.My dog seems to LOVE it, which is extremely important to me because I love my dog!!!I probably would have given it 5 stars but it is rather pricey on a normal basis but kind of understandable with the great ingredients just hard for those on a budget to afford sometimes!Overall great deal.
