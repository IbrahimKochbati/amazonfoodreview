I like sticky rice and couldn't find it in local stores. This rice is nothing like the sticky rice in the restaurants. It's very small rice that is so sticky it clumps together in blobs.  It literally bonds to the utensils and dinnerware and is difficult to wash off.  Big Disappointment, will not buy it again.
