While I love Bit a Honey and don't regret my purchase, I did not find them as "fresh and soft" as the other reviewers. They arrived hard and  ittle but still taste wonderful if you can eat them without  eaking your teeth. Maybe it's because I bought the bags of individually wrapped Bit a Honey's as opposed to the actual candy bars. Next time it's the bars!
