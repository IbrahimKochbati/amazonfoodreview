We've tried so many gluten free products and this one was by far the best. I've made pancakes, waffles, biscuits and the chicken recipe for the whole family with this and they can not tell the difference. Pamela's is a good mix too but this one is much better. It is expensive but when you've got a loved one who is gluten intolerant you're just thankful to have options for them. I can find it at some of my grocery stores but not all. You just have to check and see who carries it and then try a box. It's worth it!
