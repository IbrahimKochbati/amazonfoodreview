In an era where companies are increasingly using every trick in the books to cut costs of their products, Zatarain's Black Beans and Rice surprised me by being an incredibly tasty dish with ALL RICE that could still be microwaved pretty easily.  I haven't yet tried to cook this rice dish on the stove, but although the microwave instructions require a bit of babysitting, stirring every few minutes, the end result is a slightly creamy rice and beans dish with a really great kick and aroma of cajun spices.  Unlike most of the rice (with pasta usually cut in) dishes on the market, you can really smell it cooking from a room away, and when you first open the foil package the mix is kept in to stay fresh, you get a blast of the spices as well.  You can tell at every stage that it's a high quality product, and it comes through in the end.  I highly recommend it for anyone looking for either a great meal or a rice side dish for dinner.
