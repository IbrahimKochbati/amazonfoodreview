I stumbled upon this product while looking for Organic Butter made from non UHT milk. This is by far the BEST ghee I have tasted in a long long time. This ghee reminded me of my childhood days. The 'milk man' would  ing the cow to our door, hand express milk. This milk would then be boiled, the cream saved for buttermilk culture  then churned to extract butter and eventually boiled to make ghee! That is the only way I know authentic ghee can be made and that is exactly how this product tastes!     I will come back for more.... and more often!
