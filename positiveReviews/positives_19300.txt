I have a disabled son who is a very  ittle insulin dependent diabetic, who loves food.  Now I can give him his pasta dishes and in a regular sized portion, not some dinky serving. Also one of the great things about the Carba Nada Egg Fettuccine is that it's also high in protien.  This is one of the most perfect pastas ever.  I have even started eating it.  I can cook a whole bag, sprinkle it with olive or grape seed oil and refrigerate it and just add sauce or whatever I want to it.  It's good for a few days like this. I am very pleased with the Carba Nada Egg Fettuccine.
