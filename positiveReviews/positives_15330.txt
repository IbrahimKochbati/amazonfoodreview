I have a different Keurig model at home and I absolutely love it. I would always make myself a cup of coffee first thing in in the morning and  ing it with me to work.          When I saw this model in a store, on sale for $80 I could not resist the temptation to buy one. I have kept this model at my desk for about a year and have zero regrets. Makes the perfect cup of coffee every time, and I get it fresh no matter when I want it.
