This is the softest  ead I have found. It makes sandwiches that do NOT crumble apart the way most GF  eads do. It is the easiest mix I have made in my  ead machine. I highly recommend this  ead. We made pizza dough out of this mix (thin Crust) and it was great even other members of the family who do not have to eat GF enjoyed it.
