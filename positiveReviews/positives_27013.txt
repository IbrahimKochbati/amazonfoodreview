This decaf espresso bean produces some of the finest quality crema in my Rancilio Silvia. I dial my Rocky grinder in between 10 11 to produce a rich, oily, and dark crema, in a non bitter espresso. I have never gotten as nice a quality crema or espresso, even with Lavazza Qualita' oro (gold quality). When you want to impress your friends, use these beans!
