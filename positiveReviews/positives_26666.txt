I am a hot food junkie and found these chips at a local grocery store.  I got addicted and kept searching for them again and again, but they must have been on a trial run, never to return.  Amazon fortunately had them, but in palette sized orders rather than a couple bags.  Oh well.  This is simply the most nuclear, face napalm, gastro grenading potato chip I have ever had.  If you're a sadistic snack aficionado like me, try these.  A half bag into it, you will be paying the price.
