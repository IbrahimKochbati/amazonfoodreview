I have been looking for a great baby  toddler snack that is simple, healthy, and GOOD!  These are it!!  I found them through a mommy blog and have been ordering then every month now!  My daughter started on them at about 8 months.  They soften and dissolve quickly in her mouth so no choking or much chewing.  She loves every flavor and they are GREAT for on the go.  100% Organic fruit without the mess involved with  inging along fresh fruit.  I don't have to worry about added chemicals, too much sugar, or other things found in baby  toddler snacks.  Even I love them!!  Just make sure to close the bag because any moisture softens them up (still good, but they get sticky!)
