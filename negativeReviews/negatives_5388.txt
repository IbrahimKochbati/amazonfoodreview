I have struggled with a love hate relationship with coffee for years.  I love coffee, however, it hates me.  In recent years, I've learned that coffee will give me terrible stomach aches accompanied by unpleasant headaches.  I've since learned to take coffee in very small doses and then only on rare occasions.  But because I truly love a coffee indulgence, I had sincerely hoped this low acid coffee would be the answer to my problems.          Sadly though, I have to say, this coffee is BITTER!    I for one, am a fan of a smooth roast.  Now if you're a Starbucks fan, you may disagree with me.  I, in particular, am not at all fond of Starbucks and their coffee, and the best I can say to describe this coffee, would be to compare it to Starbucks' most bitter blend... and then some.          If you were to ask only my taste buds, they'd say "no thank you"  ...but as far as acidity is concerned, this coffee is spot on.
