I love this stuff! When I ordered I didn't read the description, so when it arrived I was pretty surprised to see a jar of powder! After reading the instructions I mixed some up and tried it out... AMAZING. so good. As other reviews have said, mix it with jelly! It taste just like a regular ole peanut butter & jelly sandwich, for under 200 calories. Try the chocolate one too! Mix it with marshmallow fluff!
