Anyone that R E A L L Y likes SARDINES prefers the little bitty ones.     I used to buy a  and that sold "three layer" sardines.     Only seen the SINGLE or DOUBLE  layer variety, lately... and, of course,     the single layer ones don't actually ADVERTISE the fact as they are just     big chunks of chum like [bait] fish.     I understand that the reason I CANNOT find three layer sardines is be      cause they are now known as either "tiny" or "cross packed" sardines.     .................................................................................................     Sardines are healthy because of the oil; and the bones supply calcium         I suppose     hell, I just like them... The little ones, I mean.     I'll just have to remember that the SMALL [good!] ones are now called     "cross pack".     .................................................................................................
