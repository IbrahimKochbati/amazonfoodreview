this is going to be short and sweet, but this extract is wonderful! It smells delicious and has no bitterness to it.  I got it to make fudge...which in turn, got rave reviews. It is also great in pumpkin  ead and pie.     I noticed the seller has other extracts as well. I look forward to trying some of their others soon.
