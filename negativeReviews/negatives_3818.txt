"Switch" advertises itself as "100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't."  While the ingredient list certainly does confirm the particularly natural recipe required to create this beverage, I'm afraid I cannot endorse it very highly.  I have long been perturbed by drinks of this nature.  Someone aspiring to consume a more natural beverage with no preservatives or other unpronounceable additives should probably altogether avoid the canned, carbonated beverage front.  Anyone genuinely interested in eating healthy, regardless of the contents of "Switch," probably wouldn't think twice about purchasing a drink such as this.  Instead, a can of this sort advertises to the hypocritical health nut, who has espoused notions of eating organically as a trend rather than as a genuine lifestyle change.          The taste of the beverage itself is par for the course.  There is no added sugar, but it's still too sweet.  It's also more than a little too sour, and the fruity nature of it tastes a bit too much like cheap bubble gum.  I also cannot abide the half hearted attempt at "carbonation" that this beverage and others like it undertake; it's carbonation that is a little too subtle to taste like anything more than the undercurrent of sour flavors.  Beverages that advertise themselves as "carbonated" should commit to the practice as well as the soda pop industry has or else avoid the practice altogether; anyone truly interested in drinking healthy probably wouldn't be interested in a carbonated beverage anyway.          In short, I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase "Switch."  I would drink it at need, when nothing else is available, but I find it to be a contradiction in form and marketing that clearly demonstrates the disingenuous motives of the company that produces it.
