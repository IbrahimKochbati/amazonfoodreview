I have been using this product for the last 6 months with my 20 month old toddler.  We do not use it in her milk or water because she likes drinking them but we do use this product with her plain yogurt and with her 8 grain hot cereal.  She loves it!  Chocolate yogurt and oatmeal, sweet!!  I like the added vitamins from veggies that it offers, and low sugar content! I found that if I can find this with free shipping it is about 3 dollars cheaper then what I can buy it for in the store.
