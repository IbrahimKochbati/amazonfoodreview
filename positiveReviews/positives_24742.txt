I JUST bought this tea today after reading all about it. It started with reading about Jillian Michaels water mixture that had dandelion root tea in it and I came across the yogi tea. I figured I'd give it a go from the good reviews. Although I can't say anything about the detoxing effects as I haven't used it long enough...I can say the taste is just fine. I am not typically a herbal or licorice liking person. I usually hate the taste. This tea isn't bad at all. I  ewed it in a small amount of hot water then made it into iced tea (it's still hot out!) Didn't add sugar or anything which I typically do and I think it's bearable for sure. I'll come back when I've drank it a few weeks and with hope I feel as fabulous as the other commenter's here :)
