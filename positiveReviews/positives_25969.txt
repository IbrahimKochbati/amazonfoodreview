Pirate's Booty has been my 16 month old daughter's favorite snack since she was 6 months old. Great for babies who are just starting on solids because it dissolves easily in their mouth, it's gluten free, low in sodium (has less sodium than cheerios) and it just plain tastes good. I usually throw some Pirate's Booty in a snack saver cup and carry it in my diaper bag when I'm out running errands. Whenever my daughter starts to lose her patience, I pull it out and Viola!! I've got a happy baby again. I swear, this stuff is magic!! Don't know how I would have gotten through this past year (or gotten anything done) without it!! : )          At our local grocery store, a 4 oz bag usually sells for $2.99. Buying it by the case using Amazon's Subscribe and Save program, it comes out to $1.78 bag. That's a pretty good deal in my book, especially considering how much of this stuff my daughter can go through.
