Probably the next best thing to fresh organic peaches are these canned ones.  They're not overly sweet but have a nice natural fruit sweetness.  We try to go organic as much as possible for our kids and they really enjoy these peaches.  Plus since they're not overly sweet, we don't worry as much about them being overloaded with sugar.  Very good quality and we will keep buying these for our family.
