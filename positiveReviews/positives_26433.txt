I don't buy anything that isn't in a sealed bag for my dog, and I won't give her raw hide that is bleached white and hard as a rock.  This stuff comes in wide, but thin pieces that she can easily grasp with her paws and eat in one sitting.  I like the fact that there isn't a lot of bulk, so that it works more for her teeth than as a snack.  She will generally reject other raw hide, but likes these quite well.  They are worth the extra money.
