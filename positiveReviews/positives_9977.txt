**First time review in Amazon**     I thought the space food was great...     The freeze dried apples were DELICIOUS!!!  They were extremely good   Crunchy, tasty, sweet apples with a little bit of cinnamon.  I would buy a box of just that.          The Ice cream were really good too and really cool weird interesting to eat.  They are nearly weightless and rectangular freeze dried ice cream cubes that melt in your mouth and really taste like ice cream when they melt in you mouth.  Pretty cool.          The bananas I didn't like that much    others may like them.  They were too sweet for me.          The protein sticks are like little bigger tootsie rolls kind of but a little less sweet and more proteins and vitamins.  But that in no way shape or form did it stop my hunger at anytime...  they are little snacks kind of.  They were good also tasted like chocolate.          So if you want to tried Freeze Dried Astronaut food well here is your chance finally  :P  I think you will like the ice creams and LOVE the APPLES.
