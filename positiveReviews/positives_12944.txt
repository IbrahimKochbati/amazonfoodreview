Though it is a bit expensive, this juice with carbonation has a very sweet, somewhat tangy taste. It is a little too sweet for me.          This is my favorite fruit juice combination. This is the only flavor of this "soda" I've tried as well.          Because of the price I'm not sure if I'd buy this or just continue using my juicer.          Another issue is that it is very high in calories.          I believe this is a high quality drink and would recommend it highly.
