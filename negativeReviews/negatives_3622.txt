This jar of light coral goo is filed in the back of the fridge with "one recipe" stuff and other exotica.  It is waiting there for me to admit that my curiosity and desire for novelty beat back my better judgement. In a blind tasting, "bacon" would not be my first reaction and the texture is slimy and unappealing (room temp or cold).
