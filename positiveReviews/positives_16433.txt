A friends told me how much her dogs love Greenies. I was skeptical, a dog loves Any treat but i decided to buy some to give my dogs and I am sold, they just LOVE Greenies even my little picky boy who is very choosy, soon as he sees the Greenies box he runs to get his share. from now on they will get a Greenies everyday for a treat.
