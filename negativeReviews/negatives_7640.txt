I usually love Quaker products, but lately the two items I've tried have disappointed me.  These cookies are SO dry, the nuts and chocolate are so tiny, you can't even see them, and the texture is simply dreadful.  I doubt I'll get anyone in my family to finish this box, I'll probably  ing them to my  other, he'll eat anything!          As far as packaging goes, I love the individual wrapped style.  They would certainly keep them fresher than other sorts of packaging I've seen with cookies, but again, these just aren't worth the trouble.  Get yourself some Chunky Chips Ahoy if you are looking for a cookie.  If you want health food, buy some apples!  I hate when companies try to make a healthier cookie.  If people wanted health food, they wouldn't buy a cookie!
