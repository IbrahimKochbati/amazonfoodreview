This product is wonderful! My kids love it because it tastes like a chocolate drink and it is loaded with healthy vegetables and nutrients.     I was so glad to find a way to get some extra vegetables in their daily diet and mine as well. It is also easy to fix just add water and stir for a few seconds and there you are!
