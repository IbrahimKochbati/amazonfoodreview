I really liked these chips.          They came recommended from my friend and I really like them. The variety pack is great to try all of the flavors   although there were some I wasn't so fond of.          The cheddar, bbq, and salt pepper chips are great. The traditional ones are get this.... traditional. No excitement there.          The chips are great   my  other still asks if I have any around the house but I haven't yet purchased them again.          Hint: the have the texture of the snack Munchos.
