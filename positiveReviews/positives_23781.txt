Put simply, these chips are full of flavor, texture and lower in calories than your average potato chip. They have a slightly salty but still sweet flavor. There's great "crunch" due to the fact that they have rice flour in them. They are not greasy since they are NOT fried. The only criticism is that they do not offer any significant fiber, being that the sweet potato is mixed with rice flour. I will absolutely purchase these as an alternative to a potato chip or a tortilla chip, for snacking.
