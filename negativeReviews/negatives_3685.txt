I purchased this product and tried it for a few days to see if I could get use to the taste.  I've used a lot of Splenda and like it.  I've started low carbing and wanted to cut the carbs out that are included in Splenda.  I've used this in ice tea and it tastes bitter .  I've tried it for 3 days now, and I still get the bitter taste after drinking it.  I did a little research online and have heard the same complaints from some other users.  The problem is believed to be all the preservatives that are added.  I thought I was getting pure sucralose and didnt realize there are added preservatives to this product.  I have since found that there is one website that sells pure liquid sucralose with no added preservatives.  Some people buy powdered sucralose and make their own liquid using only purified water.  I hope this helps.
