This tea works just as it should.  Taste is a bit strong but a little honey goes a long way.  I use this to help with chest congestion due to allergies and use to use it when I had asthma for bad days.  You'll need 2 3 cups a day when your chest is very tight.  Otherwise 1 to 2 works great.  This is also a great buy as they tend to be $6.00 a box in the store.
