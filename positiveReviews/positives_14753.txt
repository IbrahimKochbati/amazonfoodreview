This olive oil is absolutely the only oil to use when making spaghetti sauce!  My Italian Mom and I have both tried nearly all the other popular  ands of olive oil for making spaghetti sauce, but this one gives the sauce the best flavor.  Pompeian has a strong flavor and yet it is milder than many of the  locally produced olive oils that I have tried.  Pomeian is best for cooking.  I feel so sad that I can't get it in my local grocery store.
