This flavor of Fancy Feast is decidedly the favorite of our waif of a cat.  She is usually a very picky eater, but this trout flavor really gets her excited.          The local store ran out of this flavor and may not restock it, so I ordered online.  We got a good price and the case of food arrived in good condition.          I was a little confused by the old label image that was on the web site that is just different enough from the new label that I had to double check that I was getting the item that I was expecting.          It turned out to be the correct item, so all was well.
