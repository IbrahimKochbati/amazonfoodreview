This product has 24g of protein per serving and is ideal for getting lean because it has only about 110 calories and practically no fat. The taste is fairly forgettable but not regrettable. If you need a pure bulk, as fast as you can, I recommend cyto gainer but we all know whey is tough on the stomach of many people, including myself.          There's been a lot of controversy regarding the high protein for muscle gain weight loss and the jury seems to still be out. However, what I can say for sure (because Doctors and nutritionists have told me) is that more than 1g of protein per body weight is going to cause health issues over the long term. Also, the ideal ratio for carbos fat protein varies by body type and desired goal, the best way to learn is through trial and error. Personally, a diet relatively high in fat and protein works well for me, but that's only ideal for the short term.          I definitely recommend this product for either people who can't take whey or for those wanting to get lean. Pure egg is a purely  illiant idea...
