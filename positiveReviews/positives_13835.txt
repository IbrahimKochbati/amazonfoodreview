The price stinks horribly especially if you have to pay for shipping but thankfully we've got prime so it makes it a little easier to swallow the price. I use PB2 for my protein shakes and oh man does it kick up the taste and makes it even sweeter knowing Im not getting all the fat and calories as you do in regular premade peanut butter. It's always a wonderful alternative to use in peanut butter cookies. The kids NEVER know the difference either.
