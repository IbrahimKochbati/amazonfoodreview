I bought this potting mix a few months ago and about a month ago I started seeing the gnats, which have been increasing daily. My plants are indoors so I was wondering where they came from.  Yesterday I opened up the potting soil bag to repot a plant and found the inside of the bag crawling with the bugs. Maybe it was just a bad batch but I would suggest trying a different  and of potting mix to be sure.
