These are very handy when fresh fruit isn't available.  I bought them for my 16 month old and I to enjoy, however they are a little too crunchy and sour for her to eat straight from the bag, maybe some of other the other dried "just fruit" varieties are less tart. Overall they are nice to have on hand, they lose some of their tartness when stirred in cereal or yogurt.  Also good for baking.
