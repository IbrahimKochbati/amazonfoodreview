After a lot of research, i decided to switch my 3 yr old Doberman from Iams to Canidae and have been very impressed with the product. Samson LOVES this stuff too, with the Iams I had to entice him to eat by mixing it with canned food tablefood, but with the Canidae, he eagerly wolfs it down by itself. And why not? The first 4 ingredients are all meats  human grade at that! Besides having less "filler", Canidae uses no corn products, which is good for dogs with allergies (corn is a common allergen in dogs). Some may balk at the price, but you are going to use less food per day then with the junk  ands due to the high quality of indredients in this stuff. Besides, Canidae is considerably cheaper then most of the other top shelf  ands like Eagle Pack or Flint River. I'm just happy to be able to feed my dog a "super premium" grade food knowing how much healthier this is for him, for just a few bucks more per bag then a mid grade food like Iams or Pro Plan. When you look at it like that, I believe it's one of the best values in pet nutrition on the market today.
