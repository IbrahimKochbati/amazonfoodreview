As a child Maple  own sugar Quaker Instant Oatmeal was my favorite flavor. In fact it was the only flavor I would eat. So after many years of not eating it I tried it again. I was shocked to discover that it doesn't taste anything like it did when I was a kid. And turns out I am not the only person that noticed this. My girlfriend noticed rigjt away after one bite. So if you are new to this oatmeal, give it a sjot but if you are like me and want to relive childhood memories.....don't!
