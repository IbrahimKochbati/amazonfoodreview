I love Bakery on Main products. They are just sweet enough, very hearty, and really satisfying for someone on a gluten free diet. My son is also gluten free but allergic to nuts so I wish more of their products were nut free, but you can't have everything... Love all the berries in this product to add a little chewiness.
