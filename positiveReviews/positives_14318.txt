I love this pasta. We are not gluten free, but I like to change up our grains. This pasta does not congeal like the rice pasta will. It maintains a firm shape and a good texture through the boiling process. I really like to eat the pasta the SAME DAY, because the leftover pasta seems a little dry when reheated.
