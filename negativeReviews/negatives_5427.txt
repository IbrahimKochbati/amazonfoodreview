Do you get heartburn with coffee?  Before I started my little purple pills I did, and now I get to enjoy all the drinks and foods that used to burn my chest and torment my sleep.          I was intrigued when I saw this product with the description: "Puroast Low Acid Coffee introduces our great taste, low acid coffee in a single pot, 3 oz. size which is great for the office, home, or travel. Puroast Low Acid Coffee offers consumers who a great tasting, smooth coffee that is proven to give symtpom (sic) relief to consumers who suffer from heartburn, reflux, and other related conditions."          I got a pack, and it wasn't bad coffee, and I didn't get heartburn, but I haven't had it in years since I started the medicine.          Alas   I also had a medical school education which allowed me to know that "stomach acid" is not only a real thing, but its hydrochloric acid, literally about the strongest acid possible.  One of the amazing things about human physiology is that our stomachs are designed to successfully hold that caustic solution.  Our esophagus is not, and when the sphincter between the stomach and throat is weak   even momentarily   the stomach acid splashes up into our esophagus and causes the familiar "heartburn."     Methylxanthines are common substances that will relax the sphincters in our body, and they're found in high quantities in caffeine and chocolates, for example.  So   how useful is a "low acid coffee" in preventing the actual cause of heartburn if it has the desirable caffeine?          I wrote the Puroast people and pointed out these things and they wrote me back with links to research done by biochemists on coffees.  I was still scratching my head over what to write in my review when I got an email from the CEO of Puroast! Yeah, I was surprised!  Anyway, he wrote:           "Puroast does not make a claim as to the correlation between the pH     of its coffee and the causes of heartburn reflux, only that the coffee has     significantly lower acid content (up to 80% lower) than leading commercial      ands."          So   "Puroast Low Acid Coffee offers consumers who a great tasting, smooth coffee that is proven to give symtpom (sic) relief to consumers who suffer from heartburn, reflux, and other related conditions."   isn't a claim that there is a correlation between the ph of its coffee and the causes of heartburn?  Am I being trivial to point out that their product description misspells "symptom" and that the package I received misspelled "gourmet?")          So   is it good coffee?  It ain't bad.  It's absolutely worth drinking on the basis of its flavor alone.  But is it worth  15 bucks for 10 one pot bags?  I'd try the larger bags first.  Or I'd keep taking my purple pills and keep drinking the coffee that tastes best to me.
