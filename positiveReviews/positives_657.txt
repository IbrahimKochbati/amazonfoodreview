I grew up on Yunnan tea as a child   it was always my mother's favorite   so I was happy to find an economical source of it of a quality that was great for a "large volume" habitual tea drinker like me. This tea is my daily regular tea. Yunnan is nice in that it will  ew dark so you do not need much at a time. It's aromatic and flavorful without any additives. If you want something that is flowery yet more subtle than Earl Grey this Yunnan or a Keemun may be a nice option to explore.
