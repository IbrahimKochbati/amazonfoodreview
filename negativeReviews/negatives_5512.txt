This product is terrible.....REALLLY!!!  It taste like dog food.  I fixed one and could not eat it.     I threw it in the garbage. (it was that bad) I wasted 28 bucks.     I did not want to spend another dollar on this product, so I decided not to send it back.     They all went in the trash.....REALLY!!!
