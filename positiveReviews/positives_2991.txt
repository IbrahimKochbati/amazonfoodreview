The 500 Mile Chai is just wonderful   the right balance of mellowness and spiciness.  I've tried some chai's that are a bit too spicy, but this one is very well balanced.  Great with almond milk and bonus points for it being organic (in as much as one can trust the "organic" label...).          Compare to Peet's chai, I like the 500 mile better, as IMO Peet's is a little too much on the spicy side (although I do still like Peet's and some may prefer that flavor profile).
