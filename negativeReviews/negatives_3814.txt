The Switch Kiwi Berry drink is good tasting and all natural.  It should be emphasized that it is full strength juice, not a "flavored water" type product.  For that reason, I found it a bit strong because I am not accustomed to drinking much juice.  The carbonation does add a bit of lightness to it though.  I like that it didn't taste too artificial.
