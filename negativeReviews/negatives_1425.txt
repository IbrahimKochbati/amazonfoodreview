I buy jerky all the time, always willing to try something new. I've even made my own at home. I agree with the review that called these salt sticks, they are way too salty for my taste. Also, being a jerky eater for 40+ years, I eat it because i like the toughness and chewiness of jerk. But the tube I got was nearly un chewable. I have bit into some hard jerky in my time, but jeez louise, these were literally like chewing leather, many of the strips would not yield to my super powered bite.
