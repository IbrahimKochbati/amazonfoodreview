Please be aware that these bars have ALFALFA that has a proven Toxin (L canavanine: this is an analog of an amino acid that 'tricks' your body into forming dysfunctional DNA!). When studied in monkeys (they will not dare study this in people, even though there have been many case reports), ALFALFA is a toxin that INDUCES LUPUS!!! Beware! Why do these natural companies put bad ingredients in their products!?  Dr. CK
