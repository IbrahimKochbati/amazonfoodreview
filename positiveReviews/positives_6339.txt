I have 5 cats on this food as well as the seafood. This is their favorite, but they will eat the seafood as well. My old gentleman, 16 this year, loves it, and is doing very well on it. Quality ingredients for a fair price. I do agree with the one reviewer who said the cans were all dented and hard to open. Mine have been the same with every shipment. Don't know if that's why the price is so good or not.
