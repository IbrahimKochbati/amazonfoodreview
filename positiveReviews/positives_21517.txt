well, first thing's for everything, right? This is my first review, and also my first time purchasing food items online. at first I didn't even think about the possibility up until now. i've always bought electronics and such on amazon. but I definitely made the right choice buying oatmeal from amazon directly. my family is almost done with all four boxes, so I may definitely come back and purchase more from amazon. they also had it at $12 at the time! that beats alot of competitors on this site straight up who is also selling oatmeal. you won't be disappointed with this purchase. now that just leaves me with the next choice: Brown sugar dinosaur oatmeal, or apple struedel flavored pop tarts? decisions, decisions...
