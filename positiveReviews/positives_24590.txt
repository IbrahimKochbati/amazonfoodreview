I was very happy to find this item available for purchase. My husband has diabetes and I use this pumpkin to make custand for him using Splenda as the sweetner. I could not find any solid pack pumpkin in any supermarkets. Publix had this item for a short time, but then it was unavailable. When I found it at Amazon.Com I immediately bought a case. It works fine and makes delicious custard. When the 12 cans are gone, I will order it again.
