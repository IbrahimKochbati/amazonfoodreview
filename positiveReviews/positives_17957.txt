Gotta love Shake N Bake, not only is it consistently simple and delicious but it has been with me since childhood.          The pork flavor is definitely my favorite, I love the way it keeps porkchops from drying out and gives an even crunchy crust. I also prefer to use it for chicken as well. It might just be me but the pork has more flavorful spices than the chicken Shake N Bake. Dunno why, just love it.          This is also one item that my celiac father really misses. It would be really neat if they could come up with a decent gluten free option.
