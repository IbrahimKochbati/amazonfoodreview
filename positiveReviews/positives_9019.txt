The garden greens added to this product was the reason I bought it because my cat was trying to eat any twigs she found in my yard in addition to the twigs in trees she climbs.  My cat was a stray cat who obviously had not been getting a balanced diet.  I believe the Fancy Feast florentine style is changing her eating habits because she chews fewer twigs and has begun nibbling on any available green plants.
