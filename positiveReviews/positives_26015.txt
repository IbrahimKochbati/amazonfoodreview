We have been using these for over a year. Noodles are packed in liquid and must be rinsed well with hot water, then add to a pot of boiling water with a teaspoon of sea salt, boil for 5 min then strain. Noodles will be squeaky clean and will not have an oder. I use this in all pasta recipes. My husband and kids love them. My spouse and I have lost over 100 pounds each just by replacing these for reg pasta in our recipes.
