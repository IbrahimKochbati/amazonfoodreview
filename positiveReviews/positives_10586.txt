I have had the pre packaged type of microwavable pork rinds before and thought they were pretty good. I logged on and when I saw these I thought I would give them a try. I like these even better because I can control my portion size. Everyone that I have offered them to has been impressed. They are really good when you add the hot sauce or salsa of your choice after they cook. Excellent!
