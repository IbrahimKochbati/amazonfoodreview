This is going to sound like a  oken record but this stuff is great.  My German Shepard, like the others, has horrible food allergies.  I tried the Royal Canine Venison which was OK but when I tried this, my dog, who is never that excited about food, went crazy.  He loves the taste, his stool is finally solid and his coat has become shinier.  Yes it is expensive, but worth it!
