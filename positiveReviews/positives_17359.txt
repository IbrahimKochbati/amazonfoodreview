This is among the best sencha I have had. Many online retailers in Japan and other parts of the world have sencha for sale, but very few come close to the quality  of this tea. The tea is very easy to prepare. As the canister notes, 3 4 mins steep time at about 180 degrees. Is this the best green tea out there? No, but it could very well be the best on Amazon. Furthermore, Amazon priced this very well and would recommend you purchase it here.          If you only drink bagged green tea, you are missing out on this quality sencha tea.
