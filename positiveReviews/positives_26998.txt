I LOVE this beef jerky!  I am the Excutive Director for an organization called The Women's Wilderness Institute, Boulder, Colorado   we now have Wild Ride beef jerky on all our courses!     Our participants love the taste, texture...and it the perfect protein snack.  I like offering girls and women a low carb, healthy option.     I recommend this to anyone with an active life style and who likes to have a healthy snack and correct fueling for any outdoor activity.
