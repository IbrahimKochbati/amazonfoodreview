I've eaten Claxton Farms fruit cakes for over 40 years and love them.  I thought I'd be smart and order 5 one pound cakes at once as I know I'd use them.  This time the quality control went out of town.  Lousy.  Absolutely disappointing.  Of the 5 loaves, one was good,  Two were so dry they crumbled rather than be cut and I ended up adding them to cake batter in cupcakes or put on ice cream as topping,  totally unable to slice.          the last two loaves just the opposite, they were runny.  When taken out of the wrapper they just flopped over, again, had to use as ice cream topping or put into cake batter for cupcakes.          Claxton Farm might have sold out or fired the Quality Controller.  Awful quality after all these years.  Do NOT order from Claxton as you don't know what you'll get.  They lost a long time customer with me.
