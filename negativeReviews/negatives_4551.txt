Unfortunately they changed the recipe up on our baby....he looooooved this, it was a great trainer food as it was thicker now it's just runy like the chick chick one which we stopped buying.  One taste of the new formula and baby turned up his nose and didn't want anymore....I was presistant and eventually the only way he'll eat it is with  ead dipped in it or his veggie stix dipped in it and I have to sneak in spoonfulls here and there.  It's just too runny for our baby boy now, he's older now but we still want to make sure he's getting salmon atleast once a week.  This is the most convenient for us so we still give it to him at 20 months.  I'm going to hunt down the original forumla's and stock up whenever I see them!  Other than that, we are a 100% HappyBaby family and love all the wonderful products they continue to make!
