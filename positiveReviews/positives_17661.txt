I let my mom taste this coffee because she has problems with acid reflex. She said the taste was fantastic  and she knows a lot about coffee  but we only got one trial serving. One cup isn't enough to see if the low acid made a difference. five or eight days would, but one cup? Sorry, can't tell you much about it with that.
