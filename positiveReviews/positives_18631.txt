Our two kids tried various formula  ands (at different times): Enfamil, Similac, Up & Up (Target), Parent's Choice (Wal Mart), Kirkland (Costco). With exception of Similac, which one of the kids did not seem to like, they can take any  and, so we mostly use Kirkland. I buy Bright Beginnings when it's available, and on sale (I bought it for $7, $5, but current $10 seems to be a decent price, too). The kids don't have a problem with it. I'm not sure if it's any better or worse than other  ands, but since all manufacturers are supposed to follow the same FDA standards, I see no reason to overpay for a more recognized and overpriced  and.
