If this is supposed to be a top notch dog food, my dogs sure don't think so. There is a very odd smell to this food, it almost smells as if it is bad. Same smell came from the Bison flavor as well.  My dogs won't eat it.  Obviously other dogs like it otherwise they'd be out of business. Sorry I wasted money on 2 cases of this stuff.
