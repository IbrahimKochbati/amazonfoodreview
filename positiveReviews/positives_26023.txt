This is the best valued Orbit chewing gum package.  You will not get tired of the flavor since you get to sample a number of them :          3 wintermints     3 peppermints     3 cinnamints     3 spearmints     3 bubblemints          Like other chewing gums, I have to open two everytime. One seems like too small that I almost don't feel it in my mouth. Orbit is a premium gum at a premium price. Generally I find it more expensive that the others at the aisle. But the flavor and taste lasts for a long time before it is time to throw it out. What more, it cleans your teeth. No calorie and no sugar.          Believe it or not, Orbit gum was launched in 1944 during the war and it was really intended for our soldiers.          Orbit is the first sugar free chewing gum by Wrigley, the maker of "Juicy Fruit". It was granted by the American Dental Association of a seal of approval to help improve dental health. It is 1 of the top 5  ands of gum in the United States.
