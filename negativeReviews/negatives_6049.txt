I'm not a vegetarian, but I have trouble finding decent jerky and decided to try the Texas BBQ flavor. I did like the fact that it has a meaty texture, but not a hard leather texture that I tend to avoid in jerky. It was hard enough so that I had to floss my teeth to avoid irritation to my gums, but that's true with all meat. Besides texture, it also tasted like meat. However, it also tasted like someone was trying to make a BBQ flavored candy bar. Way too sweet, and just an overall bad taste. My dog goes nuts for them though, so they're not completely wasted.
