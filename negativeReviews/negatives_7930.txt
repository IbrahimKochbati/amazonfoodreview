I purchased this coffee because of the claims on the packaging that the beans were picked with integrity and with fair practices. I always look for these traits in my coffee, as well as look for organically grown beans. I also always purchase decaf and love strong, dark roasted coffees. So, I  ewed this coffee in the same manner as I usually do, with a high end coffee maker, and it was not good. It had a very, very bitter taste. Like I said, I  ewed it the same as I always  ew my coffee, added the same creamer, and it was horrible. I tried it again and again, over the course of a week, trying to get better results but it just never got better. This coffee tasted like cheap diner coffee and I was unhappy with it. I emailed Cafe Altura to let them know that I was unhappy with the coffee and would like a refund, and received the most rude email back from the president of the company. I mean, I was shocked! The president basically told me that my experience with Cafe Altura was not his problem and that he would not offer me a refund. I kindly explained my whole  ewing experience, and that I was not happy with the coffee, and that I simply wanted to  ing this to his attention. I was very polite in my emails with him and received snarky marks, uncaring and condescending put downs and an ego trip. I was truly shocked by the level of customer service from the president of the company. After explaining my experience, and receiving a few rude emails, my email responses went unanswered. I again, politely, asked for a refund and to date my emails are now being ignored. I will never buy this coffee again and want to spread the word to my family and friends to stay away from this coffee as well based on my experience.
