We have tried just about every k cup of regular coffee out there.  We don't do the flavor kind.  My husband loves the GM  and most of the coffees are mild (even when they say medium roast)...I go for a little more on the medium roast like the some of the Tully's and Caribou  ands.  It used to be that we were always ordering the same  ands, once we liked a certain one.  But I ventured to try the Wolfgang Puck line.  While this flavor is touted as a medium roast, it seems to be more on the bold side with a little bitterness.  It is still not a bad coffee, just not as good as the "Rodeo Drive" or "Breakfast in Bed" k cups which has no bitterness.  I must say though, we have now added the latter 2 flavors of Wolfgang to our buying ritual.
