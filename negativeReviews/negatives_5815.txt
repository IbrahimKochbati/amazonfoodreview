Starbucks Caramel Brulee Latte (that's available around Christmas) is my favorite coffee ever.  I wasn't expecting this to be the same, but I hoped I could "doctor" it up.  It is actually very weak and with adding anything I just made it weaker.  I still have a whole box so I'll continue to try to tweek it, but unless a miracle happens, I wont' buy it again.
