Best toffee you will ever have in your entire life: creamy, buttery, rich, smooth, just a touch of saltiness to balance it all out...  I do wish this assortment included the  azil nut toffee, but hey, that's a minor nitpick.  Especially good are the chocolate filled selections, Eclair and Banana (yes, banana!)
