I can't believe the excitement that these  ing to my two dogs day, My  other's dog and a friend's dog. Every one of them goes nuts. I did find a white powder like substance on a lot of them in one bag, so I discarded it in case it was a mold problem. I intend to contact the manufacturer to see about a replacement. I didn't want to risk feeding those. Overall, a great product.
