Let me start by saying that I love Skittles and Starburst. I love to sprinkle Skittles in my pop corn to get that sweet salty fruity crunchy combination. And Starburst? Well, who needs to do anything but eat them! That being said, I think this particular assortment is a waste of my money because half the box is SOUR editions of both these candies. I do NOT enjoy sour ANYTHING and especially NOT my candy! Candies should be SWEET. Hence the saying; sweet as candy... I WON'T buy this again! I guess I should have read the description better, if it even says so...          Okay, so went I back to check, and it DOES NOT state that this variety box contains half the contents in "SOUR". So I came back to edit my review and let others know that fact.
