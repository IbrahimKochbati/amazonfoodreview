These small, individually wrapped candies travel well and pass for the real (delicious!) thing.  They give a lot of pleasure and are easy to fit into many food plans. I think they taste better without that side of guilt I know so well.          And, unlike the sugar free chocolates, I don't seem to be so inclined to abuse them, maybe because, as a hard candy, they last well in the mouth.          All in all, it's a nice indulgence.
