A lot of people complain about Mio Green Thunder's flavor. I happen to like it. I can't stand drinking plain water so I few squirts of this stuff make it taste pretty good. See, I work full time and go to college full time... So a normal day for me is 2 3 cups of coffee then about half way through the day I drink a Rockstar or Monster. Over time I've become somewhat immune to caffeine so even after drinking all this I never feel jittery.          Anyway, I'll give a quick run down of Mio Energy. It taste like Green Monster without the carbonation and has a slight syrupy texture found in shaved ice. The good thing about Mio is that you can mix it light or strong depending on preference. Sometimes I squirt some in my mouth because I don't mind the taste and it reminds me of warhead candies when it is concentrated. I think from reading the other reviews that the user put too much or expected this to taste like koolaid or something. If you read the contents you will know that it will have a slight flinstone vitamin ish flavor to it. Mio doesn't give me a huge boost like a good cup of coffee might. But add this to a bottle of water and it's enough to keep you steady throughout your day.
