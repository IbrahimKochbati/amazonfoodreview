I got these for the dogs next door, who would bark like crazy every time I opened my back door! Not the peaceful idyllic life I had imagined. So my idea was to get them behave with treats. Clearly I'm not a dog trainer, because it didn't work, but they did woof up these treats like crazy and beg for more!
