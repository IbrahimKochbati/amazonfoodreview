WASA Crisp'n Light inside packaging cannot be recycled.  The cracker ead is excellent, but its inside packaging is a cellophane or type of plastic that cannot be recycled anywhere in the six states I have contacted.  Todate WASA has not revealed what the inside packaging is made of, nor where I can recycle it.
