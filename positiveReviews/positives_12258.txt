I first got this at a co op I worked at a few years ago. Honestly it sat on my shelf for about a year before I got around to using it in some homemade chili. I put the same amount of the Hungarian Paprika the chili as I had with regular generic paprika in the past. Whoa Nelly! That stuff turned my mild chili into crazy hot! Everyone loved it. Since then I've repeatedly been asked to  ing my chili to gatherings. When they ask what's in it I just say paprika. ; )          If you get this to replace regular paprika start with a smaller amount than the recipe calls for, say 1 4. Then work from there.          Not only is it hot but it does have a wonderful aroma and flavor.
