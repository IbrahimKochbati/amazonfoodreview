Due to husband's blood pressure, I eliminated salt from my cooking and searched for ways to add flavor without much fuss.  This original seasoning has a nice blend of pepper with other seasonings and is a quick fix for boring rice, bland vegetables, etc.  I use it a lot when I don't have time to make a more complicated dish.
