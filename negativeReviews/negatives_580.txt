I have bought ground flax in the store, there was always a rancid aftertaste.  This is the best tasting flax I have ever had.  BUT, I have to throw it in the coffee grinder, and then pick out little rocks that are barely bigger than the seeds.  I found this out the hard way after using the seeds whole.  Nothing like working a bite trying to find where the rock you just bit is.          After you grind, sift the powder and black stones will be evident.  I have about 1 2 per quarter cup of ground mixture.  Perhaps this is something you organic foodies are used to, I am not.          I have only used 1 bag so far, so I cannot comment on whether or not the stones are in the others, but I highly doubt it was a fluke bag.
