I ran out of Pamela's mix and bought this in a regular grocery store because it was all they had.  I followed the pancake recipe on the back.  As a person with celiac who has tried many things, I knew when I saw the fine, crystalline mix it wasn't going to be good.  The batter is pasty looking.  The pancakes were too dense and slightly off.  The end product was pretty bland.  You will be much better off with Pamela's mix.  Pamela's can be served to a gluten eater; I cannot say the same for this product.
