I drink plenty of water when I'm active but I don't like any type of sports drinks due to them causing me heartburn. I picked up a couple packs of these at REI ($2 ea.) the other day since I was already considering a case purchase from Amazon. I enjoyed them on my last bike ride and I feel like they helped replace valuable electrolytes that plain water just won't deliver.          The beans themselves: Delicious. I doubt I could tell the difference in taste OR texture between these and regular candy jelly beans. I recommend drinking water while consuming these beans. If you eat two or three without water you may notice (like I did) the beans settle a bit heavy. The water really facilitates the electrolyte carbo distribution throughout the bloodstream.          Bottom line: If you have an aversion to sports drinks for any reason, these sport beans offer an excellent source of electrolytes and some carbs. I feel like they help make the most of my water and my water helps make the most of them. Like another reviewer, I did NOT find any measurable or significant gain in energy but feel like they help balance valuable electrolytes. The Jelly Belly Sport Beans will be with me from now on when I'm working out but if you are looking for an energy boost along the lines of "5 hour energy" you may want to try something else. Jelly Belly does have a caffeinated version of this product but I have not tried it yet. Thanks for reading.
