I only rated this item as a 4 star because it is not Dark Chocolate as the label says. It's more like a darker Milk Chocolate. I happen to love "Dark" Chocolate.          This bar gets the 4 because since I am a recovering sugar addict it is just right for me today because I am being good. I don't think I will purchase this item again because it is not Dark Chocolate, which is what I love.  I will go back to the SunSpire Dark Chocolate Coconut bars because I don't want to feel deprived and their bars are truly Dark Chocolate and Coconut!!!!  I have cut out over 90% of sugar in my diet and I these bars will be my reward.        "
