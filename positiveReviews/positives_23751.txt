SWEET POTATO     Pros:       Amazing Taste       Good packaging, almost no chips ever  oken, all full shape.       Great nutrition for such a tasty chip (hardly any salt)       Perfect serving in the bag          Cons:       Hard to open the bag          These chips are now my favorite  and, especially these sweet potato ones.  Since the order comes in a big "retail box" that comes with a count of 24, i gave them to out to friends and coworkers.  EVERY SINGLE PERSON was blown away by the taste.  Ironically, every person also commented on how hard it was to open the actual package. :)  Now the next dilemma is trying to decide... should i buy the sweet potato ones since they were so good, or try another flavor.          For the current asking price, it is actually cheaper than buying other  anded chips at the store.  Once again, these things blew my mind in that chips could be so good.
