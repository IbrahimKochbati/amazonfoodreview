Out of curiosity I compared with side by side with Tully's French Roast k cups.  These Green Mountain k cups do not have quite the full bodied flavor of Tully's.  Both k cups are good, but if you're going after a French Roast with the most full spectrum and thickness of flavor then I'd recommend Tully's French Roast k cups.
