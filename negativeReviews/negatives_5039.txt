My dog just got mad they couldn't get the treats out and ripped the rope right out.     He's a pretty strong chewer but not extraordinary. He's only a 70 lb coonhound.     Just an FYI to ya'll. I thought it was a little difficult for them to get treats but maybe my dogs aren't the smartest.     Anyway, the search continues for the perfect dog toy.
