I would take a tablespoon of the tincture and 1 Galantamind 8mg pill after about 4 or 5 hours of sleep and I started having extremely vivid and bizarre dreams with fantastic dream recall. I believe this would have induced lucid dreams for me if I was better at realizing I was in a dream. But the dreams were so "real" and vivid that it was tough for me to tell the difference. Definitely not complaining! This is an awesome product. Yes it is bitter, but, it's really not that bad if you just gulp a spoon full and then drink something right after. It also increased the hypnagogic imagery I experienced in the transition from wakefulness to sleep. Will recommend and buy again!
