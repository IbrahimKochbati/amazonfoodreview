I had to give up real coffee a few years ago because I have had GERD for the past 10 years that definitely flared up whenever I drank a cup of coffee.  I had to stay away from Dark Roast, Gourmet and even Decaf because of the acidity level in regular coffee.  I missed coffee!  Missed the smell of it, missed the warmth of it and quite frankly nothing else really perked me up better than a cup of old fashioned Joe.  So, when I saw the chance to review Puroast's low acid coffee (French Roast) I was intriqued.  I opened the bag and immediately the yummy french roast aroma wafted up into my nose and filled the room!  Ok...so you had me at first sniff.  Let's see what it takes like before I get excited further.  As I was scooping it into the coffee filter I noticed that the grind is pretty fine.  Almost powdery like.  I found that interesting.  I also was wondering why THEIR coffee was low acid...what was the difference in the overall process?  So, I went to their website and found this:          Brew coffee's acid content and bitterness is greatly dependent upon the roast degree, type of roaster, and  ewing method. As shown in the table below Puroast® coffee chemistry is unique and different from all of its competitors because Puroast® has a patented slow roasting method known as conduction roasting; which uses renewable fuel and exposes the coffee beans to a lower temperature for a longer period of time. This process is significantly different from the convection roasting method used by other coffee companies that employs a natural gas heated process. This roasting process is also called flash roasting because the coffee beans are exposed to high temperatures for a short time period.          These people have done their research!  Check out their website: [...] and see for yourselves.  I was glad to see the process did not include any funky chemicals (like in the decaf process of other coffee manufacturers).          I decided to forego my antacid the morning I tried this coffee to see if my GERD would act up.  I even had the nerve to try the coffee black which I never dared before.  It was delicious and I had no symptoms of heartburn or reflux all day.  I tried it the next morning and again drank it black (without any antacid prevention) and I noticed a little bit of heartburn but thought maybe it was because I was trying too much too consistently for my delicate system.  So, I skipped a couple of days and tried again, this time with some skim milk added.  I was fine.  I think the low acid really is helpful but I don't know if people who have really severe heartburn or GERD can drink it daily but it is nice to know that I can keep it in the house and enjoy a cup of coffee with company now and then.
