I picked this off the shelf without any research, and my husband, who's pretty particular about his vodka (and tequila, and rum, but that's another story) loved this. I'm not a vodka drinker, but even I had to admit the first smell and taste were extremely pleasant and he said it tasted wonderful straight and excellent in mixed drink. Made by two guys from Pennsylvania using a copper still   definitely worth the price.
