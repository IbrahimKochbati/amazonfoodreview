I told my husband I was reviweing this, and he said, "Give it 5 stars!" Lol!! We've only had ours for 2 weeks, but we absolutely love it! For the holidays, it was so perfect   my daughter's made espresso for their lattes, my husband his Breakfast Brew, my teens made hot chocolate, and I had several cups of decaf hazelnut. It's so quick and easy, the whole family loves it!  It's great for making tea too!  Two small cups make a full mug, and one large cup leaves just enough room to add Bailey's. :)
