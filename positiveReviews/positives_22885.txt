This tea is really quite good. It is a quality black tea with a subtle cinnamon flavoring. Definitely one of my favorites!          As with many food items sold on Amazon, I would recommend trying a single box from your local retailer (if you can find it) before committing to a whole six pack. Once you know you like it, however, the value of this offering really can't be beat anywhere!
