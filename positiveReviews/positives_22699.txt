The great Northern popcorn popper we use these in seems to be used almost daily, since we have 8 and 10 year old girls, and their friends, who are always wanting a snack (specially after school). Although we also use the separate corn and oil also, the packs are just as good tasting, and sometimes a little handier when in a hurry, or out of the separate ingredients. The popcorn is very good either way.
