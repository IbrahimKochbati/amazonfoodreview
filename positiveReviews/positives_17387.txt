The first time I ate these chips was in Aruba in 2007.  I couldn't find them in our area (CT) so you can imagine my joy when I found them on Amazon.  I love these and hope you continue to carry them.  Your prices are terrific too.  I pay $2.99 in Aruba and they run about $2.46 a bag when I buy the case of 12 through Amazon.  Good job!!!!  Only problem is, now everybody wants them here and they steal my bags when the case comes in, but that's ok...sharing is good.
