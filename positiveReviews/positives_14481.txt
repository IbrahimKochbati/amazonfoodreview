I do my workouts in the morning and this celsius flavor is definitely my "workout partner". It tastes more like ginger ale then an orange drink. I have tried a bunch of flavors but this one is my favorite and it's easy to find elsewhere like publix, vitamin shoppe, and costco... however amazon.com has the best prices! I have tried to workout in the morning without having one and my performance energy is literally nonexistent. For beachbody workouts like Insanity, Chalean Extreme and now I'm doing TurboFire this is a great energy drink to have that only has 10 calories and no sugar aspartame. I also like to have one in the afternoon if I need a pick me up. I keep wondering if it is too good to be true  I highly recommend!
