I love these things, but they're no longer sold in grocery stores.  (Believe me, I've searched.)  It was great to find them (and for a reasonable price) at Amazon.          I know, I know... they're junk food.  However, compared to the pork rinds you'd buy in a bag, the microwave version is considerably lower in fat.  As far as flavors go, I prefer the "Hot & Spicy"; it's a lot more interesting than "Regular".          Suggestion:  Eat them while they're still warm, they're much better that way!
