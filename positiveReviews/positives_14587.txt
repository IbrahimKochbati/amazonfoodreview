Bought this flavor and  and for the first time. I have powered Stevia that I have been using to add sweetness to certain things and was surprised and my liking Stevia. I love ginger and love strong flavors. This ginger drink made me cough because the fumes got in my nose and throat my first sip but I did not have ice to make it less strong. If you love strong ginger flavor like I do this is a good sign and if its natural then the flavor is fine. I liked it and will buy it again and want to try the other flavors.
