I ordered this product and was thrilled it arrived on Valentines day. DO NOT BUY CHOCOLATE FROM AMAZON! It arrived on time, as a gift, but it arrived MELTED. And, Amazon does not allow you to contact them online about non returnable items, like chocolate, to express your displeasure over the state it arrives in. I've never had a problem with Amazon before and am VERY VERY Disappointed!
