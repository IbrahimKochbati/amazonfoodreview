As a family living with Celiac Disease (Gluten Intolerance) as well as Dairy Lactose Intolerance, finding tasty hot chocolate mix that doesn't taste like tree bark and dirt (my children's descriptions for other  ands we've tried)  is a challenge, until now. THIS chocolate is amazing  we mix this with hot Silk (tm) Brand Almond Milk and WOW! Even our non Celiac friends and family love it  it is smooth, creamy, rich and delicately spiced. Just amazing and well worth the price! We LOVE it! ADDICTIVE!
