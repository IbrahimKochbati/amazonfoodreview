I have been making my son's baby food but needed a  eak since he's starting to eat more.  I only buy organic food for him and Chick Chick is one of his favorites.  I tasted it and it's a little bland for me but I'm also not a baby.  He loves it and as long as he does, I'll keep it stocked for him.  I love the Happy Baby Happy Tot  and and the variety they offer.  I prefer jars for convenience but I just empty this into a jar to heat.  I did find that one of the pouches had a leak at a seam.  I'm glad that I saw it before I gave it to him.  Now I check them each thoroughly before I open them.  If I can squeeze food out of a seam, it gets pitched.
