While the container is smaller and the tree is younger, this plant came happy, healthy and blindingly simple to take care of.  Mine has already provided a healthy cutting, is growing like gangbusters, and is tastefully done with a companion stone, fine  ick chip gravel and a healthy plant definitely older than a mere seedling, but young enough and with enough character to become what I request of it.  Excellent, healthy plant.
