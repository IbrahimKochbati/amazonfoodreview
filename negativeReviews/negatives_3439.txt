Buy these k cups only if you don't mind drinking your coffee through a slick of coffee grounds.  The taste is fine (though not fantastic), but I don't enjoy the surface slick or the sludge left over at the bottom of the cup...and I'm not happy that I'm stuck either drinking this stuff or wasting my money by throwing the cups away.
