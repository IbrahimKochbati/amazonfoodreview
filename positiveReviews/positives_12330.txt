Corn is BAD for dogs!  When I learned that, I switched immediately to food that doesn't have any in it (and most well known, readily available  ands do).          Our dog is very sensitive, and while she seemed to be doing well with BB's Wilderness Chicken, her poo smelled to the high heavens.  I read that it's often due to their not digesting chicken well; I guess she doesn't.  So, I switched her to the Lamb Brown Rice formula.  She likes it, and, happily for everyone in the neighborhood, can digest it MUCH better (if you go by the stink factor).          The only way she'll really go for it with enthusiasm (or any dry food) is to add some hot water to moisten it and release some aroma.  Otherwise, she holds out 'til right before she goes to bed 'cause she's starving.          So, if your dog doesn't seem to like it, try adding a little hot water.  Our dog trainer (20 years experience) insists it's NOT bad for their teeth to do that (which I was concerned about initially).
