My husband and I are big fans of Lavazza's Super Crema coffee, but got a bag of the Tierra blend recently while the Super Crema was out of stock. While the smell and color are wonderful, we found the Tierra 100% arabica blend to be much more bitter than our regular blend, and even after we added cream or milk to our coffee we felt unable to continue to drink it, so we gave it away after only a few  ews (we are straight espresso drinkers otherwise). We have now received our regular Super Crema again and couldn't be happier.
