I generally buy the Blue Dog bakery dog treats, but I thought I'd try these out. Overall, I like them, and so do my canine family members.          Pro:       The dogs really like them.       They are thick and crunchy   the dogs chewed on them for a while, unlike most treats where they were consumed more quickly. I think this is better for their teeth.       Resealable pouch is a nice touch.       Treats have no odor to them, even after handling them to  eak apart.          Con:       The package was a bit difficult to open   it has an indentation to tear, but the first side I tore did not open the bag. I was more careful on the other side, and tore it towards the zipper opening.       The treat come in bunches of two, and since they are pretty thick (over 1 4 inch or so) I found it difficult to split them into individual services. Two would be too much for small dogs. However, if you have a larger animal they might be more appropriate.          Summary: A good choice for dog treats. Recommended.
