I'm totally hooked on Annie Chun's Soup Bowls.  Far and away the best "instant" soup on the market, I find myself frequently craving the soft noodles and intense flavors found only in Annie Chun's soups.  I have tried all of the varieties, and the new Vietnamese Pho soup has shot to the top of my favorites list.  Very savory  oth, you will definitely recognize the flavor if you've enjoyed real pho in a Vietnamese noodle house.  This is not a spicy soup  if you prefer it with a kick, I'd suggest investing in a bottle of Sriracha sauce.  Obviously, one of the major selling points of Annie Chun's soup bowls is the convenience factor.  Nevertheless, this soup makes me want to grab some fresh cilantro and bean sprouts and have an authentic pho experience at home!          Since everyone's tastes differ, as a matter of reference, my other favorite Annie Chun's Soup flavors are the Tom Yum, the Kimchi (although it's in the upper range of spicy that I can handle), and the Miso.
