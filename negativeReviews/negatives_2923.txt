I have been receiving Peanut Shoppe of Williamsburg peanuts through the Subscribe and Save plan.  When I first ordered them, each can contained 12 ounces of product, but the most current shipment reduced the size of the product to 10.5 ounce cans and kept the price the same.  I think that is a bit misleading. If there is less product, why isn't it less expensive?
