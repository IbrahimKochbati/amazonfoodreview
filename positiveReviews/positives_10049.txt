In deciding to review this coffee, I knew my opinion alone wasn't enough. While I found it to be a very smooth and non bitter treat for my mornings, I decided to take the biggest risk of all and serve it to my coworkers.          Cubicle inhabitants have been known to maim anyone responsible for a bad batch of coffee, and I was prepared to either smile pleasantly or use my chair as a battering ram while I ran for the exit.          The first person who tried it had this to say;          "...It has a smooth taste which allows the drinker to savor the flavor without the bitterness or unpleasant aftertaste found in higher priced coffees such as those offered by Starbucks.  The overall taste is reminiscent of a light to medium roast    "
