I love all of the cocoa in the Stephen's Gourmet line, but I think this one is my favorite. The other people in my family have different favorites (we all love Stephen's), but we all agree the Belgian Dark ranks at the top for the best all purpose drinking cocoa.          I like my cocoa with a little added milk in it, and starting out with a good DARK cocoa allows me to achieve that milky texture without sacrificing that rich chocolate flavor.          As an added bonus, Stephen's cocoa is labeled "Gluten Free"    taking the guesswork out of choosing a cocoa for those of us who must avoid gluten containing additives such as barley malt (a common ingredient in chocolate).
