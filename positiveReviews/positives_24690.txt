I expect more when I decided to buy this cereal for my baby girl.The first time I feed her,She dislike it.The texture may too thick for her.After I tried a few time she can eat like yesterday she can finish all I mixed for her.I give this product 4 stars because sugar added in this product.Anyhow this cereal is good option for Mom who want baby trys many kind of cereal.And we are lucky that our baby eats very good.
