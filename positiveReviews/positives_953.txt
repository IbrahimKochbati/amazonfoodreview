I love the taste of real garlic   not the granulated or  ined stuff. These are great flavoring agents, especially for popcorn as a liquid in glazes and rubs. Love the choice between roasted and raw, and a little goes a long way. I first bought this product 2 years ago. Despite using one or the other at least once a week, I am only now needing to replace them.     Yum!
