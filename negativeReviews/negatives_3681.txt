I just checked with the Post Office here where I am stationed.  People can mail dried fruits and vegitables through the US Postal System.  I tried to order these walnuts to be delivered while I am overseas and can not get them.  My order was refused because according to Amazon "they can't ship food" overseas.  From doing some research I found that the reson they can't ship to an APO address is the vender uses either FedEx or UPS and they can't ship to an APO address.  It doesn't bother me that the vender can't ship, or for that mater won't take the initiative to sell to US Service People overseas, it is they Lied about it.
