I received a couple of samples of these at a food service show recently and was pretty impressed. Kiwi berry was my favorite, sweet but not too sweet and the sparkling water kicks it up. The orange tangerine was very tasty as well, I am a fan of delicious flavor. They have no added sugar, but still plenty (29 grams) of sugar that naturally occurs in the fruit concentrate the juice is made from...versus 39 grams in a can of regular Coke. My go to juice drink is still Fruit 66, but the Switch is a very close second!
