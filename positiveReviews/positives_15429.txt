We lived in South Carolina many years ago and enjoyed their pork BBQ.  Being from Texas, it took us some time to try this type of BBQ.  The sause used on these sandwiches was similar to Carolina Gold, or possibly the same.  We loved it.  A friend  ought me back a bottle and we went ape over it. I tried the internet and there it was.  We are enjoying this tangy and different BBQ sauce with pork and chicken.  We find it of high quality and a wondeful reminder of our days in South Carolina.  Since it is not sold here, I am sure I will be a returning customer.  I highly recommend anyone try this product.
