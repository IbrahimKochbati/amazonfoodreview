WE ORDERED THESE BECAUSE WE LOVE OUR NEW KEURIG COFFEE MAKER,,,,BUT AS WE DRINK ALOT OF COFFEE FOUND THAT BUYING THE KCUPS ARE WAY TOO EXPENSIVE,,,,WITH THESE WE CAN USE OUR REGULAR COFFEE IN THESE DISPOSABLE CUPS....THEY ARE STILL NOT FUN TO FILL,,,,(NOT AS EASY AS JUST REACHING FOR A PRE MADE ONE) BUT ARE FAR MORE ECONOMICAL THAN THE PRE MADE ONES....THEY DELIVERY WAS ON TIME AND AS PROMISED...
