When I first encountered these Cowboy Strips I as a bit confused. Were they in fact made of beef or cowboy? Since cannibalism hasn't generally been in practice for quite some time (and even when it was, only by savages of the worst sort), I felt it was quite likely that the 'beef' mentioned in the title was the meat source, but it wasn't out of the realm of possibility to believe these to be beef flavored COWBOY strips made from real life cowboys. That thought caused my stomach to turn, and because I take great pride in leading a cannibalism free lifestyle, I decided it might be wise to contact the manufacturers of WILD RIDE just to double check  similarly I once contacted the makers of the very confusingly named 'chicken of the sea'  and tuna fish to see if it was chicken or fish; quite an important distinction! Better safe than sorry over having  oken my nearly 30 year streak of cannibalism avoidance in one fell swoop, I gave WILD RIDE a call!          Thankfully, WILD RIDE confirmed that this was in fact BEEF jerky, and that the Cowboy reference in the title was just an adjective explaining the sort of jerky it is: long, thin strips that are chewable, soft, and very, very tasty. I suggested that they rename it "Wild Ride Beef Jerky Cowboy Strips (NOT MADE FROM COWBOYS. NO COWBOYS INJURED IN THE MAKING OF THIS JERKY)" and they agreed such a change could potentially be useful. Much obliged for their assistance in understanding their product and their intentions (after all if they WERE selling COWBOY jerky, it might call into question what sort of operation they run, and if they are in fact a Zombie enterprise!) I was able to enjoy all four bags of this jerky in about 30 minutes. Wishing I had more, I took a stroll to the outhouse because I suddenly wasn't feeling that well, and the next thirty minutes I spent thinking about what a great movie you could make about a Zombie owned corporation selling COWBOY JERKY to the unknowing public. I couldn't decide if I'd prefer to have Chuck Norris or Steven Seagal play the protagonist (or possibly pair them up!) or if the ending would involve a nuclear warhead wiping out the zombies or just let Chuck and Stev o whack them apart with machetes, but at least these unanswered questions successfully distracted me from the 3.1 magnitude earthquake that was shaking the entire outhouse.          So put your mind at ease: these are BEEF strips made in the cowboy fashion, and they're very, very tasty!
