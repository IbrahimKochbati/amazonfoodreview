I have eaten waffles made from this mix for over a year now and I still love them.  I am a gluten intolerant, dairy intolerant type II diabetic so my options for waffle mixes are limited.  I was so glad to find Craving Place pancake and waffle mix although I was skeptical at first about anything tasting good that was "gluten free, wheat free, nut free, egg free, dairy free and bean free."  My thought was, "What's left to give it flavor?"  I was won over by my first bite of crispy fluffy goodness. I've experimented with added ingredients over the course of the year.  My favorites are adding about 1 1 2 tablespoons of cinnamon along with 1 2 teaspoon of ginger to a batch of waffle mix (since cinnamon is good for diabetics).  I just top the waffle with margarine and thus avoid having to use sugary toppings like syrup.  I can only eat 1 2 a waffle at a time bcause it does affect my blood sugar level too much if I have a full one.  I find the extra waffles last all week without refrigeration.
