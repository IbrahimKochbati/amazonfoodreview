Just bought a bag of Canidae with the new formula.  I had some of the old Canidae formula and am mixing in with some of the new formula.  The new formula has more meat in it and my puppy loves the new formula!  He jumped on it!  It's unfortunate that Canidae didn't announce that they were going to change the formula because it's making a lot of dogs sick due to the sudden change in food.
