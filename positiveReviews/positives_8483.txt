I have been using canola, sunflower and peanut oil my entire life. But after reading about the health benefits of Extra virgin olive oil or EVOO (anti cancer, anti inflammatory,good for digestive system, bones etc ) I decided to change to EVOO. And according to the UC davis study, this  and was one of the 5 imported oils that was actually 100% EVOO and not a mixture of different kinds of olive oil. and unbelievably, this is even better than whole foods  and EVOO. And the best part is this is the cheapest of the 5 that passed this test. And I would recommend you to buy this at costco, where you can buy 1.5L for $8.99. And I have been told that if you do not have a membership, you can buy a costco gift card and use it to shop for things like this.          [The below information is taken from: [...]]          The other approved  ands are:     Corto Olive     California Olive Ranch     McEvoy Ranch Organic          And the  ands found to have be fraudulently labeled as Extra Virgin:     Whole Foods     Rachel Ray     Safeway     Newman's Own     Colavita     Bertolli     Filippo Berio     Pompeian     Star     Carapelli     Mezzetta     Mazzola          This is the best EVOO out there and I would recommend this to my friends.
