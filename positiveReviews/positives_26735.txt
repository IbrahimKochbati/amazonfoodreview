Iw as skeptical about a sugar free chai, having been a BIG fan of regular chai, David Rio did NOT disappoint!! I've made with both milk and water and a combination of both and anyway it's wonderful  creamy, sweet and a perfect mix of flavor  no caffiene, no sugar, literally a guilt free treat. I'm so happy to have discovered this!!
