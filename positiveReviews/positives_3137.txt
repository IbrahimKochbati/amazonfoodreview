Read a few reviews, some good and some bad, and i finally decided to take the risk since the icicle was on sale.          Works great and is perfect for a home room studio.           I love everything Blue: Though the icicle is a little light and delicate, i treat it as careful as i do my microphone.          I would highly recommend this product.
