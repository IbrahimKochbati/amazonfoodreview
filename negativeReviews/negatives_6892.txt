I am not sure if I received a bad batch, if every other reviewer is either trying to punish everyone else for their bad decision to buy the product or if the other reviewers are paid to lie about it but this tea is awful.  I purchased this because I really enjoy cinnamon tea, all of the reviews raved about this product and its great cinnamon taste so I took their advice and purchased 6 boxes.  I received the tea yesterday (good ol' Amazon), quickly made myself a cup only to find out it has zero, nodda, zilch cinnamon taste.  I mean they mine as well just label this black tea and call it a day, there is not even a hint of cinnamon flavor or any flavor for that matter in the tea aside from black tea.  While I do enjoy flavored tea, I am not a fan of plain tea and I can't tell you how disappointed I am in this product.  If you are looking for plain black tea go ahead and give this a shot you will be happy with what you get, but if you want cinnamon tea don't waste your money or time on this.  AWFUL!!!
