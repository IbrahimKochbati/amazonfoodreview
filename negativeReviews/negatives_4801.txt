Check out the following site for great deals on all things Japanese Food Basesd. "Asian Food Grocer".xom I used an "X" on purpose to prevent the filter.          This particular item is listed for 1.72 & shipping is usualy $5 on orders over 25, or free on black friday, standard shipping is ~7 8 I think.          Anyways I would order by phone their web forum sometimes doesn't take the order.          Long story short. Better prices, same service, worse interface.
