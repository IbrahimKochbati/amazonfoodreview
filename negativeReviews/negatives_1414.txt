I was drawn to this product because it's called a "feast", but I was somewhat put off by it being a "Fancy Feast". My cat certainly deserves a feast! I mean, he runs himself ragged from morning till night going after mice and by the end of the day he's bushed. And frustrated too, since I had him declawed and all. But he don't need anything fancy, that's for sure. I just want him to enjoy a cat feast and leave it at that. He's not one of them cat's that prances around with his bushy tail waving around like some lady feline. I know my Tubby Toughie would be in cat heaven if they changed the name to "Fighter Feast" or "Beastly Feast". So, I'm giving this product 3 stars: five stars because it's a pretty great feast, minus three stars because the name offends Tubby Toughie, and plus one star because I like to lick the can.
