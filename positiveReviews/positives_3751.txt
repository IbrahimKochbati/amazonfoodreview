This coffee was good but it had a distinctive aroma and taste like buttered movie theater popcorn. I am a huge hazelnut flavored coffee fan and this was good, It just doesn't typically taste like hazelnut. You may like it but I will search for a more true hazelnut flavor. Do a test, make popcorn in the microwave and then later make the coffee and you will see the similarities.
