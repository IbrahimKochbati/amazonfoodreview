I have a 4 year old mastiff who, despite his tough appearance, has a bit of a delicate belly :) He has been eating this since he was a puppy after a bad experience with a nasty corn based product. My other dog is a 9+ yr old shelter rescue mixed  eed and she eats this as well. Both are happy and healthy. I'd recommend this food. It's totally worth the extra you spend.
