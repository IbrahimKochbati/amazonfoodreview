We drink a lot of tea... from all over the world! By far this is the worst tasting tea we have had... I purchased this based on reviews and because this is organic. When compared to st dalfour organic tea... this tastes like Lipton caffeine free tea from Costco! I HAVE always gone with reviews before buying anything online, but this particular tea is no good, At ALL. And Costco returns is better than amazon for so much of something so bad!
