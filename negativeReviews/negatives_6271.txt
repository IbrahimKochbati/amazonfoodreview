My son (now 9 months old) has been eating HAPPYBELLIES organic oatmeal cereal twice a day since he was 6 months old, and loves it. So I love it too   until recently. The last container I bought had a different color and smell. All our cereal until now had been a cream ish color, soft and flaky in texture and smelled like, well, oats. Not anymore. The recent batch had cereal that had black gray ish flakes mixed with the regular looking oat flakes, and it smelled horrible, almost like mold or really, really rancid oil. I had bought that batch from [...] and they promptly issued a refund. Now I'm a fix as to what to feed my baby! I don't want to experiment with an unfamiliar  and given how much he loves this one, but again I don't want him to eat what clearly doesn't look or smell like food.          Can someone, from either Amazon or HAPPYBELLIES, please repond to this and other similar concerns and put them to rest?
