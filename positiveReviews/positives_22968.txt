These are absolutely without a doubt DELICIOUS!  I used to purchase them at COSTCO, but don't really feel like driving 45 minutes when I can let my fingers do the shopping walking right at AMAZON.COM.  I was delighted that Amazon had these.  Brought two bags last week and hubby has almost eaten one bag already LOL so I'm gonna purchase some more and hide them.
