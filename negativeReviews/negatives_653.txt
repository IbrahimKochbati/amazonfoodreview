I just finished my first bowl of this clam chowder, and was disappointed to find, or rather, not find, clams. Don't get me wrong    the soup was good, with a very nice texture and taste, but the clams were AWOL. Several times I bit into something that provided a small burst of clam flavor, but only once did I find a clam fragment big enough to look at. I'm going to buy some chopped clams to kind of "chum" a bit. This, of course increases the cost of the meal. I'm going to try some other  ands as well.          I do hope that Bar Harbor does some testing. The label shows clams as the most prevalent ingredient, but I don't see how that can be    my money is on the potatos.
