This  ead is very tasty.  I like it because it's so moist and maintains its texture instead of becoming crumbly the second day after being baked.  It is so easy to make sandwiches, spread margarine or peanut butter and in general, do whatever we would normally do with  ead.  We are able to fully enjoy  ead now instead of eating the cardboard textured  ead we were buying.  I love this  ead and highly recommend all Pamela's Products.          Also, the subscribe and save plan has been a great deal for my family.  We save money and I don't have to remember to go online to order.  I simply get an email telling me my order is about to be shipped and I get at least a day or two in which to go online to make any changes to the order   with a click of a button I can skip any order.  I just love it!
