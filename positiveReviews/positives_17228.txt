I have found the Stevita  and to be the best with the least after taste because they use a natural process of amino acids to strip the Stevia leaves.  I especially like the toffee flavor which I put in my fake coffee.  It is evidently a popular flavor because it is often out of stock on the various website that sell it.  I don't use caffiene and real coffee has a wickedly bitter after taste.  Stevia has completely replaced sugar in my kitchen.  I use it in everything from cereal to baking.  This is a good price.  I like the Sweet Leaf cream soda, but it is expensive. Their toffee flavor is too strong.          I am surprised by the number of reviewers who use artificial sweetners, such as the exotoxic aspartame  NutraSweet (the most poisonous), Sweet N Low (at least the body recognizes it as a chemical so it doesn't pass through the blood  ain barrier), Splendia, Sucralose, etc. Now there is a new toxin spewing from the malevolent (yes, what would you call a company who has developed anti nature terminator seeds?!) Monsanto called Neotame, which is unbelievably being labeled as "organic". Stevia is actually good for you. I try to avoid any product, especially food, that is made in China, although it is nearly impossible to do these days, particularily if you shop at Wal mart (the great Wal of China).  By the way, aspartame is a terrific ant killer and Sweet n low is rat poison.  I am surprised that they aren't used in chemotherapy.  I reckon these chemicals aren't expensive enough to use in "medicine."
