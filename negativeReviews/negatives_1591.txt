I liked the level of carbonation.  It was actually more highly carbonated than I was expecting, but didn't taste dry the way I would expect an artificial sugar free drink to taste with carbonation added.  I was hoping it would taste more "orangey," but the tangerine is the more dominant flavor (along with apple, a common juice "filler").  Despite having "no added sugar," however, there is still 34 grams worth of it in the small 8.3oz can.  Basically, other than having 100% of the daily value of Vitamin C, this drink could easily be replaced with a better tasting orange soda that is in a 12oz can and costs far less.  Unless you really like the taste, or you want to ensure your Vitamin C beverage stays fresh longer, I'd give this one a pass.
