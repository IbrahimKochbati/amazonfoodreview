Our golden retriever LOVES these!!  We've tried other dental treats chews in the past without luck.  I took our dog to the vet to have her check out his teeth, and she gave us a sample of these to try.  Our dog practically ripped it out of my hands when I held it out for him to smell.  We give him one of these every other day, and his gums and teeth look AMAZING!  I'm really excited that he has a treat he loves that's also good for his dental hygiene.  I recommend this product to everyone with a dog!!
