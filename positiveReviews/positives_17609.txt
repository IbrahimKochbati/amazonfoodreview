This coffee has quite a bit of flavor and punch to it, I love that its strong and flavorful (basically tastes just like the other coffee I drink). But finally I can have my cup of coffee without needing to remember to take a pill or suffering afterwards because of my heartburn. Highly recommended for those of you who get acid reflux and still want to enjoy your daily cup of coffee.
