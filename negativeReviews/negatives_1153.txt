I was not impressed with these cookies when I tried them, when they first came out and the company had only one flavor. I did not care for them but I knew that something more satisfying could be had because I'd tried others.          I have found many great paleo cookie recipes on web sites and in paleo cookbooks that I love and they my friends, cooking students, and neighbors have really enjoyed. If you're looking for rock your taste buds paleo cookies, I suggest you check out the recipes for chocolate chip cookies and other flavors of cookies made from blanched almond flour found in The Gluten Free Almond Flour Cookbook, Make It Paleo, and on Elana Amsterdam's web site.
