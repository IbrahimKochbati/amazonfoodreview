My dogs love this treat   it is their absolute favorite.  My rough collie did have poopies from the sweet potato (he has very sensitive diet needs), but the other two found them easy to digest, and they think they are delicious!  Also, they really ARE all natural   nothing gross on the ingredient labels.
