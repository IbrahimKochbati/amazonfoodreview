It was quite a commitment for me to buy this quantity of pork rinds from Amazon but I decided that I would "give it a go" since I like the pork rinds that are sold in grocery stores and I figured that these could only be better since they'd be fresher when microwaved.  They taste great and I think that they have the perfect amout of spice.  HOWEVER, two things....the smell is "funky" when they come out of the microwave.  Regardless of the taste, I can't seem to get used to the smell.  Secondly, when it comes to popcorn, I have to pop popcorn less than the directions on the package in my microwave or it will burn.  I found it to be the opposite with these pork rinds.  I had to cook the port rinds LONGER than the directions say on the package, otherwise they wouldn't be popped nicely and were a bit chewy.  So if you find that you cook these and they don't seem crispy enough, cook them in your microwave longer than the directions say to do so.
