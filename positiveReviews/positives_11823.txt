This is good stuff...just like you would get in a restaurant.     Coat the steak (preferably ribeye) with melted butter...then press the steak into a pile of the seasoning, until every speck is coated heavily. Cook the steak in a white hot cast iron pan, until it's rare in the middle, and almost burned on the outside. There you go...wonderful product.
