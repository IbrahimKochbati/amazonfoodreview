It's not real crispy, sticks to your teeth and lots of hulls.          I know homemade popcorn has a few more kernel hulls than your store bought microwave, but it's a little too much for me. I was really hopeful for this  and. But, it just didn't work out. I tried a couple of different methods; popped using different temperatures, and also tried different oils. It was the same both times with no improvement. It doesn't get better after it cools either..nothing worked to improve it.          It doesn't taste old, so I know it's not that. I seal my popcorn kernels when I'm not using them as well. The flavor is really mild and it's definitely a good tasting popcorn. It just doesn't turn out the way it should.
