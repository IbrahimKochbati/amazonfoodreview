ok   i was buying smaller bottles at wal mart for $18.. when i found out i can buy the bigger bottles on a subscription deal for cheaper? i of course signed right up.          bertolli is the standard in olive oil.. i use it on everything   it tastes better than the other oils and is so much healthier.          i heard a chef on tv one time state he hated using that because his belief was that once heated, any health benefits were eliminated.. NOT TRUE.     after i switched to olive oil, within 5 months my good cholesterol rose SIGNIFICANTLY to the point my doctor asked what i did..     but the funny thing is   i didnt change my diet AT ALL.. and i mean they said it was raised ALOT which is great news! i told them about the Olive oil change and the dr. accredited my change to that.          trust me   taste and health u just cant beat it.
