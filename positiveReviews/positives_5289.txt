I tried Switch Orange Tangerine drink.  Excellent flavor and not so sweet as to make you feel you are getting a ton of sugar.  It has no added sugar and no corn sweetners, so, it is more natural than any other orange soda type drink.  More like a sparkling juice drink.  I have been a fan of orange juice and soda type drinks when as a kid I would mix OJ and Orange Soda.  Yet the natural taste of this drink is refreshing.  I tried it both with and without ice and although the iced version is more refreshing, if you get a very cold can of this drink it tasted very satisfying and did not leave you with an after taste or with the sugar blues.          Caution, it has 34 grams of sugar, and although natural, you should check with a doc if you have sugar problems.  34 grams is equivalent to 5 or more teaspoons of sugar.  At least, if you like sparkling fruit drinks, check this one out.  I will next try it with added sparkling water to it.  Enjoy.
