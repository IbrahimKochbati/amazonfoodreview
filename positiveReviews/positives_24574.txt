I saw all the problems people were having with damaged cans but the sale price was too good to pass up.  I ordered two cases.  First case, not even a little dent.  Second case, bashed to heck.  Obviously not Amazon's fault since the boxes they arrived in were fine.  Farmer's Market really needs to figure out what is going on in their packing department!
