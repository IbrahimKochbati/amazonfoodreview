When I originally started looking to buy a Keurig, it was a deal that came with this drawer.  I thought it seemed like a great idea immediately.  I ended up waiting a couple more months before I bought my Keurig and it no longer came with the drawer.  I looked everywhere for the drawer because I liked how it kept the cups hidden from view, but still handy like one of the carousels.  I couldn't find the drawer   it was sold out everywhere I looked for a month.  I finally found it on Amazon, and at a good price.  The drawer has lived up to my expectations.  I keep my Keurig in an area where there are no upper cabinets, so I don't have trouble with it being higher now.  I also alternate K cups facing up and down so I can get more in the drawer.  I highly recommend this product if you're looking for a way to keep K cups within easy reach, organized, and hidden.
