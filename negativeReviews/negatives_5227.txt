I'll begin by saying I wish the description stated clearly that these clams come from China.  Secondly, every can in the pack of three has dents in it.  Since when is it acceptable to sell dented canned goods?  There was not a scratch on the outer box, so I know that those dented cans were intentionally boxed and shipped.  I'm going to cancel my subscribe and save for this product.
