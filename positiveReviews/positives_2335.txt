I bought these for my girlfriend who just happens to live in California, and she loved them. The chocolates came fresh and the packaging was just beautiful.          Hand written card, her name was hand written on the front of the card, and extra care was taken in the whole process. I will definitely buy again from Choclatique.          If I could rate higher, I would. I was sent a $15 refund for the shipping because my girlfriend lived nearby. I've never had such an honest company before, that was pretty cool!
