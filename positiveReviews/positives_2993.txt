I bought this gift pack and really enjoyed it. The hottest hot sauce in the pack is so darn hot it had me burning for about 30 minutes and washing my mouth out with water for 10. Other than that one, all the others were really good. The wooden case doesn't hold the bottles well but the sauces were good. I would buy it again.
