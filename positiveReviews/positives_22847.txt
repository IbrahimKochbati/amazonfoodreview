Bigelow's Vanilla Caramel tea is not only delicious is smells heavenly.  Whenever i drink it at work people stop by to see where the wonderful aroma is coming from. The flavor is pleasant and delicate.  I find it relaxing.  I also drink it when I am hungry and on a diet as it makes me feel satisfied as if I had a treat.          Ali Julia review
