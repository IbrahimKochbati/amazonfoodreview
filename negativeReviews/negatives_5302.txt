My oldest cat has become very finicky about his food, and I need him to gain some weight, so I decided to try a new food.  Fussie Cat gave him diarrhea, which I attributed to switching to a new food, but it lasted for the three weeks I fed it to him, and his fur became duller.  Every time my other two cats got into this food, they vomited, which they generally do not do.  My oldest cat just got a checkup.  He now has renal failure.  His numbers were 100% fine just a few months ago.  I can only attribute it to this food.  I believe he has acute renal failure due to some toxin from Fussie Cat.  Fussie Cat is from Thailand   there are ZERO regulations for pet food there, and can write whatever they feel like on the can.  My vet, when he saw the food, told me to get my cat off of it, and said other clients of his had had bad reactions to this food.          If you value your pet's health, stay far, far away from Fussie Cat.  I have my cat on Merrick now, and he is doing better.  I can only hope I can reverse the damage this food has done.
