Okay, I jumped the gun, because they were sending me the review information, before I received my chips, so I thought I would be honest, and indicate that I have not received them, and I wasn't happy about not receiving them. However overall, the service is not bad, and my chips are on the way.Sorry guys, they really are not bad people, I am just an impatient buyer... there, is that better?
