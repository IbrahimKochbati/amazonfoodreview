We have a JRT Mix and he is too smart for his own good.  The first time we used this 'puzzle' toy it took him about 45 mins to get to the end.  By the third time he had figured the most efficient way to get food to fall out and he now employs that same technique to finish off a scoop of kibble in about 10 mins.  He really enjoys focusing on this task for the 10 mins, as the JRT is an obsessive  eed anyhow.  It gives him a good job to work on.  I recommend this simple toy as we have seen good results and it performs exactly as advertised.  Durability is good, our guy is tough on toys, but if you give it to him with food in it and then remove it from him when complete, there are no issues.
