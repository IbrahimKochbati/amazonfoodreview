This lemon curd was just okay; I've had better. I was a bit disappointed when the jar arrived and I read the ingredients  just too many of them for my taste. I wouldn't have bought this if they had listed the ingredients. I will list them here so you can know what you are buying.          "cane sugar, lemon juice 13% water, concentrated butter, pasteurized yolk in powder, pasteurized liquid egg white, jelling agents: fruit pectin, agar agar, emulsifier: soya lecithin, essential lemon oil 0.2%."          the product page claims: "Made according to tradition"          I'm pretty sure that traditional lemon curd from any country won't have an ingredient list like that!! It's not terrible, just not what I wanted.
