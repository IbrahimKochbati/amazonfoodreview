I love this pumpkin. I have always looked for organic pumpkin but it is not sold locally. My shipment arrived in excellent condition and the product tastes great. I have begun to eat it regularly as part of my diet, pumpkin has alot of fiber and vitamins that will be worth eating yer round. The discounts and free shipping are awesome, well done Amazon!
