I relied on the ingredients listed on Amazon's site.          Ingredients     Peanuts, Dry Roast Seasoning, Tapioca Dextrin, Natural Flavoring, Salt.          Guess what? When the product arrived I read the laundry list of about 20 other ingredients.     According to the actual label the Dry Roast "seasoning" contains MSG.     Now I'm not that paranoid about MSG but if the product has it as an ingredient it should have been listed on Amazon.     I wish they had shown the nutrition label. It also contains added sugar.     What's wrong with plain dry roasted peanuts?     The taste is about what you would expect. Peanuts with a flavor coating.     I will not buy them again.     Also it is a 12 pack.
