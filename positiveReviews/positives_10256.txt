I have the Beaba baby food maker and two of the trays.  I also use my food processor to make food.  I have twins and make a lot of organic food to freeze.  I freeze the food in the trays and then transfer then to FoodSaver bags so they never get freezer burned.  The one thing I HATE about the trays is that they have a weird, unpleasant odor to them.  The odor does not smell like the foods I stored in them.  For the most part, I wash them by hand. I tried soaking them in vinegar and figured the steam from the dishwasher might help, but nothing gets rid of the odor.  When I first got the trays, I had to run hot water over them to pop the food out.          Now that I've been using them for a while, I can easily pop the food out without water.  I do try to transfer the food as soon as possible b c the seal on the trays is not perfect and freezer burn can happen if you let them sit for too long.  I do feel the trays are overpriced.  I have 2 trays and could easily use 2 4 more to freeze the batches I make.  It's annoying to have to keep rotating the food to try to freeze it before it goes bad.
