These french twists are delicious.  I am on Weight Watchers and 2 of these twists have a ONE Points Plus value.  All the flavors of these are fantastic.  You can eat cookies and still be healthy.  Please Barry's Bakery, never stop making these!!  The price on these through Amazon cannot be beat.  I have paid from $3 to $4 per box in the supermarkets.  I will be ordering another case soon.
