Like others I ordered this on a lightning deal and it's great value.     I gave four stars for flavor and freshness, it IS some of the best jerky I've tasted.     I was a little disappointed however, the first bag and first few pieces were moist, soft and really good, then the next couple of pieces were like rawhide, with some obvious jerked gristle, which took some serious chewing, and detracted from the quality of the rest in the bag.     I thought this was a one off, but the second and third bag have been the same, mostly soft and satisfying, but about 25% smokey boot leather.     I don't know whether it's quality control, but it seems like "pot luck" with what's in the bag.     All that said, I haven't had the jaw ache I get from the popular  ands so it's still good..........just not perfect.
