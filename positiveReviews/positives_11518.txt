What other spice would you buy in a 24 oz container?  If we were more ambitious, we would create a video montage of us pouring this all over every food we eat.  Even pancakes.  Ok, not really.  But  occoli, asparagus, pizza, chicken, toast and eggs.  Even better, when you mix veggie magic w  olive oil, you are an instant gourmand.          Guests always ask why our food is so delicious (no matter what we serve) and the answer is always "chef prudhomme's veggie magic".
