Altho you can't give too many of these to your dog on any given day (not suggested by the manufacturer), I have never found a treat that my German Shorthair Pointer really loved, until we discovered these. Buzzy just loves them more than anything....even more than the meatballs I through in his food to entice him to chow down (he's very finicky)!!! Get em for your best friend!!!
