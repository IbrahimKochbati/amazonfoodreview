Finally, an affordable flavored coffee worth drinking.     Coffee Bean Direct Hazelnut is a really smooth, medium roast coffee with a definite hazelnut flavor.     The flavoring is not sweetened, which is a real plus, especially if you don't like sweeteners in your coffee. (If you do, you have complete control yourself.)     The flavor is not overpowering, but is enough to let you know you are drinking a hazelnut coffee.     Those who have complained may have received a bad batch. Usually the blend is good and roasting consistant, but, as with any other food product, variations and accidents do happen.     I have been using Coffee Bean Direct coffee for about five years and have not yet received a bad batch.     This one is a winner.
