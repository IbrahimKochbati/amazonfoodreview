I have had my stand up popcorn machine for years and I have been using the Great Northern pre measured packs. They are easy to use and the popcorn tastes great! My son loves to make the popcorn and with the simple easy to use pre measured packs, making popcorn for our movies are a  eeze! When we have people over our popcorn maker is the center of attention and with the simple portion packs, everyone is happy!
