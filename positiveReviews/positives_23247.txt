I love this mix because it is so simple to make and my kids love the taste.     We buy it by the case. We make two packages at a time and freeze one loaf (cut in two) while enjoying the other loaf. This cuts down on clean up and time in the kitchen.          One tip... I cut preparation time in half by doing the following: I mix the yeast into the flour first, then I heat the liquids to 110 degrees before adding them. Once the mixing is complete, I place the loaf pans in a warm toaster oven. Rising is complete in about 30 minutes. Bake time only takes about 30 minutes this way. Delicious  ead!
