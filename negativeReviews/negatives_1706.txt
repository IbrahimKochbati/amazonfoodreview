My sister bought a Keurig. We all started using it. But mom still had her cans of coffee. I didn't want them to go to waste, so I bought this figuring I could make her k cups with her own coffee. The cups are flimsy, first of all (most of them buckle too easily while getting the top on). It *looks* like a good seal (and yes, I made sure there were no coffee grounds on the edge, which I know can screw up the seal), but they still leak. Get one of the reusable cups. It'll be better for you and your Keurig.
