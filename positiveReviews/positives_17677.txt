I love dark roast coffee, but my husband hates the bitterness. Due to our differences in taste, I have two coffee makers in my kitchen, one for his light medium roasts and one for my favorite espresso or French roast. Puroast Low Acid French Roast Coffee makes it easy for us to both to share a pot of coffee.          Depending on how strong you like your coffee, the three ounce pack is very finely ground making it suitable for both drip coffee makers or French presses (Bodums). I own both and made the pot of coffee in our drip coffee maker. Because my husband dislikes strong coffee, I used half the pack and it was more than enough for the 12 cup pot. The strength was perfect in my opinion.          The flavor of the dark roast comes through clear. I loved the smokiness left on my tongue after the cup, but there is no bitterness. It's smooth and satisfying. My husband, the dark roast skeptic, said there was no way he would like French roast. After one sip, he said it was very smooth and lacked the bitter aftertaste that he dislikes with dark roasts. Overall, I'd say that's a win!
