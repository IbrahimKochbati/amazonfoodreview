I'm on my second box of Newman's Own Organic Special Blend (Extra Bold)and I love it as much now as I did the first cup.     It has a smooth, rich, dare I say, bold taste. It is not very acidic and has just the right strength for me. I have tried     other coffees like Donut Shop, Green Mountain blends, etc., but this is far and away my favorite. I'm getting ready to order another case.     I highly recommend this coffee.
