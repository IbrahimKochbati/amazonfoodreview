After several less successful stews with curry powder, I turned to this curry sauce mix.     It is incredibly easy to get delicious curry stew with simple food stuffs, only with my basic cooking skills while imitating the way of cooking curry in animes.     Though it is my philosophy that good cuisine should be made from scratch, but his time I just surrendered to its convenience to get exactly the taste I want with such a simple process.     One small problem is that it is too mild for me though it is labeled medium hot.
