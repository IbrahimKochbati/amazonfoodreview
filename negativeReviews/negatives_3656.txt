Got a sample of this today and was excited to try it.  FAIL. When  ewing it smelled great.  It came out dark at first then quickly changed to a light watery colour. Very boring taste. I like dark coffee,  my daily drink is Timothy's Midnight Magic Extra Bold.  My wife likes Timothy's Morning Blend and prefers a light roast.  Even she didn't like this coffee and said "it tastes like warm milk".
