I originally ordered this product as an allergy free alternative to peanut butter.  I have many serious food allergies (peanut, walnut, almond, dairy, gluten, corn, soy), and another popular  and of sunflower seed butter (sunbutter) is manufactured on equipment that also processes soy (not just in a shared facility, but on shared equipment)!  I am thrilled to say that this sunflower butter is not only smooth and creamy with a delicious taste, but it's organic, has no added salt or sugar, and is free of other allergens.  Give it a try, I bet you will love it!
