I use this in both my coffee and my tea now in place of refined sugar after seeing it on the Dr Oz show. It tastes great and doesn't mess with my blood sugar. I plan to try the cookie recipe posted here on Amazon at Christmas time. It is pricier than sugar but it's money well spent to me. I've tried every kind of sugar substitute out there on the market and I found they all left an aftertaste I didn't like. Not so with the coconut sugar. Delicious!
