My Akita mix pup then, and even now as an adult does not like this toy.  There are much better treat dispensers on the market, like "Bob a lot."     The purple dispenser is a large neoprene container similar to a water bottle for hiking.  My dog was afraid of the toy until I helped him get some of the treats out with the rubber attachment that slides in and out of the bottle.  He had no interest in trying to get them out on his own and still doesn't.     I have a 4 month old lab pup and she has no interest either.     I think it's a poor design.
