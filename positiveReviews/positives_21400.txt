Generally I hate sugarless gum because they always leave that terrible "sugary" aftertaste in your mouth but I buy them because I want to preserve my teeth and save calories at the same time. So I tried Orbit's Mint Mojito and wow I love this gum.  The taste is very clean, with a great lime minty flavor without any aftertaste. The irony is that I was told by the manufacturer that they have discontinued this particular flavor making it very difficult to find in my neighborhood supermarket. Thank God for Amazon! I plan to buy again soon while supplies last.
