My dog started developing signs of an allergy last year   nothing overt   just noticable skin twitches when I touched her in certain areas on her back.  Unsure if her reactions were due to environment or food, but they didn't seem to be seasonal grass allergies, so I chose to test the easiest source first.  I chose a food with a completely different meat source, switching from chicken to fish.  It's only been a week and I'm already seeing improvement.  She's still showing signs of itchiness, but her reaction is much less when I pet her back.  And on top of that, her fur is softer too!  It's early yet, and there can still be some progress made, but I have no doubt that the change in food is helping.  I sat and read review after review on dog foods with in depth ingredient analysis before settling on Pinnacle Trout & Sweet Potato.  If after 6 weeks, she still shows some signs of being itchy, I'll happily try the Salmon and Potato Grain Free variety to see if grains are a factor in her allergies as well.          Have seen some reviews mentioning  eath after eating the fish based foods.  I have to say, I haven't experienced this with my dogs.  There might be a slightly different odor to their  eath, but it isn't by any means too "fishy" smelling.  Just different.  And neither dog has experienced any gasiness or changes in stool since the switch was done gradually.
