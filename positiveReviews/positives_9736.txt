Toffee Lovers of the World should rejoice.  Treacle toffee is outrageously delicious and Walker's is the best I've found.  So far, I've addicted four other people to the stuff and I expect that number to grow.  These individually wrapped ones are softer than the toffee  icks that you  eak with a little metal hammer, so it is much friendlier to your dental work.
