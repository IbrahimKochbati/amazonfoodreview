The shake is packed with goodness when it comes to fiber and it is only 80 calories per serving.The shake is filling. Plus the ingredients are certified as organic,which is a good thing. The only bad part is the taste. If you're looking for the smooth taste of milk chocolate or the sweet bitter taste of dark chocolate you won't find it in this shake. The best way I can describe the taste is "earthy".
