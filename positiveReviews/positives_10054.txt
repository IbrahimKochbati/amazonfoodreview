I drink coffee quite often but I'm not really a connoisseur. I did, however, invite family and friends over (some of whom are avid coffee drinkers), and we devoured the 11oz bag of Melitta Cafe Collection coffee in about a week. I had a bit of trepidation over trying this coffee, since I had never purchased pre ground coffee before, but after the first cup, my reservations vanished.          Like other reviewers, we were dazzled by the rich scents that were released when we opened the bag for the first time. It was surprising then, that the resulting coffee didn't have that much aroma. Don't get me wrong   the coffee tasted great, but I wanted a richer experience.          Overall, we concurred that it's better than most store  ands like Costco's Kirkland Signature or lower priced  ands like San Francisco Bay, but Starbucks own beans or some of the beans available from Peets produced better coffee. In the end, Melitta provides a good value proposition that I can certainly live with.
