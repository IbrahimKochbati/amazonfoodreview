I bought this because it was a very good price.  It was really good though.  I love mixing a peppermint with a dark chocolate and having a double sized up of hot cocoa.          Will keep buying this until they don't sell it anymore. It is really creamy.  I like it best with 6 ounces of water, gives it a thicker feel.
