Good product, but too expensive on here.  I can get Lars Pearl Sugar in a grocery store near my house for $4.50 for 10oz.  It's a bigger store, and they have an aisle where they carry a lot of foreign foods, which is where it's at, not in the regular sugar aisle, but I imagine most bigger grocery stores would carry it.
