The qualities and benefits of Gatorade are well established. For the past almost two years, it has been my choice of electrolyte carb post workout drink. During long runs, I prefer electrolyte only tabs such as Nuun or GU so I can separately control electrolyte intake from carb intake. Also, it is easier to clean up the Camelback without the sugars in the fluids. But for cool down and recovery, this is what I turn to.          The focus of my review here is to highlight that this is four packets of mix and each packet makes 2.5 gallons of drink. That's 10 gallons total. Fine for a sports team. A lifetime supply for one person at liter and half liter quantities.          I ordered this several months ago. The product description as I write this today indicates the quantity. I am not sure whether it did when I ordered, or how I missed it if it did. In any event, I have a lot of my favorite drink.
