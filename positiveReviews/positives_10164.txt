These are basically moldable bits of chicken putty, and my liver spotted dalmatian Jack loves them. Every morning he takes a big fish oil capsule that he thinks is weird on its own and two pills. I tear one of these pill pockets in half, then mush one half of the half around the fish oil and mush the other pills into the other half of the half, and he gobbles it all up without complaint. I'm stingy with these, because they get a little expensive when you have to use them every day, but they really are just the thing for getting a dog to take medicine. I'd use as many of them as necesary to get Jack to take his meds, but so far the economy approach is working. Great product!
