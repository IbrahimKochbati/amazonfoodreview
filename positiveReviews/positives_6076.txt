This stuff is the bomb.     There is no pepper that has a tastier fruity flavor than the Habanero.  The fact that is fiery hot is both a bonus, (for us heat lovers) and a curse(for the wussies).     I use this stuff all the time.  Sprinkle it on a sandwich over the tomato, sprinkle it over some Mexican sour cream for a dip.  Sprinkle on pizza or a cucumber and tomato salad.  The uses are near endless.          Also if you wanted to use it in lieu of mace or pepper spray, a little bit of this stuff blown onto any skin location rapidly induces excitement.     Be careful in the sprinkling of this stuff, if you get a smal puff of it into your nose, you will most definately know about it.  ; P
