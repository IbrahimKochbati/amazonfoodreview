After reading reviews I purchased the 2.5 oz. pkgs. of Great Northern Popcorn. It popped up nicely.  Very few "old maids". I did notice that a lot of moisture gathered on the sides of our popper (the Waring WPM25 model) during the popping process so I pulled the tray of popcorn out promptly. I could see if you left it in the machine, even for a few minutes, that the popcorn could absorb the moisture and lose its crunchy texture.     I will definitely buy this product again.
