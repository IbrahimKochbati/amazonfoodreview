I bought this product by accident one morning at a local deli, and I was very surprised when I first ate it.  Granted, you can easily tell (and I was scared because I was expecting beef jerky when I first bit it) that it is not meat.  But, as an alternative, it is very tasty, and I did end up buying it again.
