These wonderful fruits are of a consistency somewhere between apple sauce and baby food. I found this particular flavor to be exactly like the little cinnamon and applesauce cups that I often have at home.          While these are more expensive (even in the store) than the little fruit cups, they have a perfect use ... Traveling!  As any parent with a child knows, kids, spoons, and  liquids are not a good mix. Spills happen!  Since these include only fruit, juice, and natural flavorings, they make a nice snack without added sugar.          However, having recently made an extended trip by myself, I discovered they are wonderful in a different way. They make a great boost for the driver as well. And they aren't half bad, even when warm! I am a diabetic, so the 15 grams of carb are a perfect complement to my needs for a snack. I kept a couple next to me, and they were perfect when my blood sugar was dropping and the next rest stop was far away. My only problem using them this way involved getting the lids off!
