My nine year old yellow lab had bad  eath and needed her teeth cleaned. My vet suggested using an enzyme product. I did a search and found this one. It's a two fer... she loves the chew and in just one week her  eath is great and her teeth are SO CLEAN. I am really impressed with this product. I wish it were a little less expensive, though.
