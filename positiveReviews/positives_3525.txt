This coffee had two strikes against it: it was decaf, and it was already ground. I do use decaf, generally in a 50 50 mix with full strength caffeinated coffee, but I always like to grind my own beans to assure freshness. Still, I thought I'd give this Melitta coffee a shot (it was free from Vines, after all). I'm happy to say it surpassed expectations. I made a pot without mixing it with anything and drank it black, as I always do. It's surprisingly drinkable, if a little on the light side. Still, the taste is fairly rich and appealingly winey, though I do like a little more smoky aftertaste than this provides. (There's really not much aftertaste at all, truth be told.) It's as good if not better than nearly all the straight decaf coffee I've ever had, and having it ground as opposed to beans really doesn't seem to be an issue here. Ground coffee does tend to go stale more quickly than bean, so I'd suggest using it fairly quickly, but that's easy to do with a 10 ounce bag.
