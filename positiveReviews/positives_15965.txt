Lavazza offer several variations on their espresso beans. Of those that I have tried   I don't recall Pienaroma as being great; Top Class is good; Super Crema is tasty (and produces good crema) but not high on aroma; Crema E Aroma retains its aroma very well but is the most acidic of the Lavazzas; Tierra appears to be the hardest to find in the US but   in my opinion   combines the good aspects of all. So far, I've found it only on Amazon. Amazon also has the best prices on Crema E Aroma.
