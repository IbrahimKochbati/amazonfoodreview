My dog is a finicky eater when it comes to canned food.  After trying MANY varieties from both the pet store and the grocery store, the Alpo Chicken in Gravy is all he will eat (I can sometimes feed him the T Bone steak flavor).  I guess it looks and tastes more like "people food" than the other varieties.  My only complaint is that when I received the shipment (pack of 24), almost all of the cans were dented, and a couple had dried gravy on the outside of the can.  One can leaked out   the dent was at the seal on the top.  Normally, I'm not someone who is picky about dented cans, but this was a little much.  A couple of the cans actually had a funny smell when I opened them.  So, I guess I'll go back to buying at the grocery store.  Just thought having them shipped to the house would be easier than lugging them home from the store.  Oh well.....
