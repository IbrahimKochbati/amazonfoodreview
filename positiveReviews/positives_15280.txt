My mom bought me this coffee maker for my birthday and I am in love with it.  Granted, this the first and only Keurig coffee maker I have had, it does everything it should.  And it makes excellent coffee.  I can have a warm cup of fantastic quality coffee in about a minute, start to finish. I have had it for about 3 months now and haven't had any problems at all.  I am planning on buying one for my mom for Christmas.
