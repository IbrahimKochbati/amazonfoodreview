I bought a blue foundation 8oz popcorn machine from Discount Tommy along with a case of this popcorn.  The smell alone   oh my!  Makes my entire basement smell like a movie theater!  The popcorn, after the 2nd time when I actually followed the directions and gave it some time for the bottom heating element to "dry" the popcorn, is fantastic!  I've seem some negative reviews regarding it being mushy   obviously they either do not have an adequate popcorn make that heats well enough to dry it after all the steam moisture the machine creates popping it in the first place or they did like me my first time through and couldn't wait to eat it immediately!  This popcorn is even good 2 days later if you turn your upper light bottom heat on for an hour or so first to freshen it up   still tastes like it did the 1st day!  Leave out the "powder" bit and go to food.com and search for "Best Seller Caramel Corn" for a real treat!!!
