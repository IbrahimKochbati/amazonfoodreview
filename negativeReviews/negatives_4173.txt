Came packed in mylar bag that is typical of the frontier products I buy. But upon opening the bag it reeked of a very strong chemical smell that completley overpowered any of the sweet smell of nutmeg, I thought it smelled just like insecticide. Was immediately turned off.          I went ahead and grated some up. It still smelled awful to me, so I compared it to some preground nutmeg I have in my cupboard for probably at least 8 to 10 years. The preground still smelled great, especially when compared to what I had just grated.          So I took about 15 of the nuts and scrubbed them with scru ush in hot soapy water, rinsed, dried, and then stored in new fresh storage container. They definitely smell some better now, but I am so turned off, I don't know if I can even try to actually use them. Yuck.          I'm sorry I wasted my money.
