Caribou makes a series of coffees; my current favorite is Mahogany. However, this, too is nice on the palate. The package describes the taste thus: "Caribou blend begins with a delightful heaviness on your palate and finishes with a relaxing balance of bittersweet chocolate and fruity flavors."          For tree huggers and environmentalists, Caribou  as a company  is a member of the Rainforest Alliance, designed to "protect ecosystems and the people and wildlife that depend on them. . . ."          The coffee? I like it. It is not my favorite K cup product, but it is tasty. I would have preferred a bit more boldness to the taste, but it is smooth and has a nice aftertaste.          If you've entered the Keurig world, this might well be worth trying out. . . .
