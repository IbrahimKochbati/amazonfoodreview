Yum,Yum!  Tried this product based upon the many positive reviews here; it creates a wonderful, delicious, moist, somewhat dense chewy loaf of  ead in my machine.  Much, much better than store bought GF loaves that we've tried.  Satified even kids with sensory issues!  Am purchasing another case today!  Pancake mix wonderful, too!
