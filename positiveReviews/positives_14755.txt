I use this more for herbal uses than cooking.  I take it daily as an herbal supplement (plain) by the spoonful (wonderful taste).  And I use it to make infused oils to make herbal healing salves once the herbs have soaked in it (infused) for a week or more, then strained and low heat melted to combine it with a little bit of bees wax (1:16). Oh, and if you want an awesome infused oil for light low heat cooking, infuse fresh crushed garlic in it for a few days   yummy! You can use that with or without the garlic left in it.  I add that to my mashed potatoes instead of butter or cream at the very end while they are cooling   soooo good!
