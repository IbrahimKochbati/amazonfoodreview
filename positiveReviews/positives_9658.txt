I've been feeding my dog Merrick canned food mixed with some Halo dry food for four months now.  He loves it (he's a picky eater) and he's super healthy!  I've heard some reviews that say this food leads to gassiness and diarrhea... I imagine that could be true if someone was switching their dog from a very low quality dry or canned food because this is a wholesome, stew like food.  It takes some adjustment to get used to but once your dog has adjusted, I don't think you'll find a better quality canned dog food.
