This is the best vanilla chai you will ever have. we mix it up with milk and pour it over ice in the summer and have it warm like hot chocolate in the winter. absolutely perfect. the coffee shop down the street charges $4.50 for an iced vanilla chai made with this same mix. i'm saving a ton of money making it myself.
