Gave this to my mother for her Doberman,  and Akkita Shepard mix.  That said,  she has two large dogs.     So, they didn't like it at all,  and wouldn't touch it unless there wasn't  anything left in the house for them to eat,  Then they ate it.          I'm not sure if they don't like this type,  flavor,  or  and,  or just aren't very fond of biscuits.  They don't seem to have too much of a problem with the milk bone  and biscuits.  Dogs are fussy,  it's really hard to find treats for dogs.          Mine like chicken strips... And sweat potato sticks.  Greenies,  haven't really found much else.  Chicken flavor pup er ronie. Don't like beggan strips, love anything duck....  Does this give you a better idea of what my dogs taste buds are like?  Your dog may be different,  I dont know if you can really judge by what our dogs like.          I'll rate it 3 stars since they ate it,  just not as a first option.
