Both of my larg German shepherds have sensitive stomachs and skin. I have not been able to find another dry food that does not have the ingredients they are reactive to. These include: Chicken, Beef, Fish and corn to name a few. They love the food and there have been no allergic reactions for either of them. Awesome!
