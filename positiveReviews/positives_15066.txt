I recently (December '10) reordered these mints (I can't find them where I live, so I order them on a fairly regular basis) & it seems that something was missing in this batch.....the cinnamon flavor! So far, every roll has been nothing but sugar.....has anyone else had this 'problem'????            I first tried these a couple of months ago when I saw them at a Whole Foods store. I was instantly hooked! They are so good, I had to find a steady supply of them (I don't have a Whole Foods where I live) & was so glad Amazon.com had them. I have ordered them twice & they never last long everyone that tries them loves them. I've tried the other mints that Newman's Own makes, but the Cinnamon mints are by far my favorite. I love the texture, the 'just right' cinnamon flavor & the fact that I'm supporting a company that does so many good things.
