Yes....Gracie really rushes into the living room to enjoy one of these treats in peace.  Any time she thinks something is really special...off she gos.  The treats are big enough that I  eak one into two pieces for a mini dachshund.  She thinks she's eating candy and I know she's eating a treat that is full of healthy, organic ingredients.  So she's happy and so am I.  Highly recommended.
