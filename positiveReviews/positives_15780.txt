I've never bought flavored syrups before but wanted to try them. These six flavors are each 25.4 ounces, are sweetened with Splenda and come in plastic bottles.  There is no pump on the bottles, although you can buy one.          I think it's generous to call these "syrup" as they are the consistency of water.  But the flavors are bold, and if you're careful pouring they will last a long time.  We've experimented with the vanilla, hazelnut classic, caramel, chocolate and raspberry flavors so far.          I've used the vanilla, hazelnut, caramel and chocolate in my morning coffee, and they add a nice flavor without overpowering the coffee.  I'm guessing I added about a tablespoon per cup of coffee.          My kids liked the chocolate flavor mixed into hot cocoa.  We mixed some of the raspberry flavor into homemade yogurt, and that was pretty tasty too.  We haven't tried the Irish cream flavor yet, but I've used it in coffee before and I'm sure it will be the same.          Overall, this is an expensive indulgence (for me) but one I'm glad I tried.
