These do work nicely, but some of them for some reason seem to "stick" on the upper "needle".  I have yet to figure out why they stick on that needle, but when they do it is a real "pain" to remove it!  This is a minor, and only a sometimes glitch, so that is why 4 stars in stead of 5.     My machine in a  and new one, so the needle being "dirty" isn't the problem.  When these don't stick, they work very nicely and as stated.     I wish the little cups that hold the filters were biodegradable as that would be a real plus..., but these do save money since the k cups are so expensive.  I will continue to use these, and spend the savings on really great coffee!!  LOL!
