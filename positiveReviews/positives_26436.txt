My 2 year old Chow Newfoundland mix loves these dental chews. I give him one each night after I  ush his teeth. (His teeth are still sparkly white and people comment all the time on how white his teeth are.) And more importantly, even though it's a type of rawhide, it doesn't upset his stomach like normal rawhide chews AND he chews these. I tried other dental chews such as Greenies, but he just pretty much swallowed the Greenies whole which defeats the purpose of a dental chew. These also cost half as much as the Greenies. I have done price comparisons the last 4 times I have ordered these and each time Amazon had the best price. Note: I also use the CET toothpaste,which I have found to be the best after trying 6 different  ands, but don't buy it via Amazon or you will pay a higher price and have to pay for shipping.
