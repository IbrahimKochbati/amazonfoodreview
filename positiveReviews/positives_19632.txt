Really didnt want such a huge volume of jelly beans. But the price at the time couldnt be beat...so  what the heck...I bought the 10 lb. package for approx. half price. Good service from Amazon as usual TY Amazon! Received in a quik & timely matter. Very tasty..but not sure if I will finish them in this life..
