My pediatrician suggested increasing my 3 year old's protein, and try upping the fish. I saw these online and saw they have a ton of protien, and were salmon.     They arrived in the mail right away, and my 3 year old is not a big fan. She loves the Plumb  and fruit and veggie pouches and likes to suck them straight from the pouch. It is not very easy to suck it straight out of these pouches. I have been able to cut a small spot on the corner to make it work, but putting it in a bowl and using a spoon made it loose much of the thrill.     My 18 month old likes them, but I'm not sure I'll get my older one on the band wagon.
