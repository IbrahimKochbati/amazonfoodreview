It is so wonderful to use my  ead machine again and have the smell the aroma of fresh baked  ead.  The taste far exceeded my expectations.  I woofed it down so fast that I don't recall tasting any difference from any of the non gf  eads I used to make before diagnosis. I did not even care that it fell during the baking process (supposed to create a 2 lb. loaf and I made it in my 1 1 2 lb. machine and it was less than that after falling). I read somewhere that someone else had this problem and added a little extra yeast and it had worked.
