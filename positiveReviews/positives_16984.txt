I have a 6 month lab  husky mix that no joke   INHALED his food in ten seconds.. Today when I put his food in the tug a jug... it took him a whole 30 minutes to get a cup and a half of food out! Mornings are usually rough for us   dog wants to eat, is bored, full of energy. Then we are trying to get ourselves  kids fed, cleaned up etc. The fact it gave him something to do.. kept us from getting frustrated trying to manage all our morning responsibilities. I am sure over time he will better figure it out... but they have ways to make it more tricky.. ex: bigger treats.. etc.          I have spent so much money on this dog.. on toys.. treats etc.. everything to try to make our lives eaiser. This is my fave so far!
