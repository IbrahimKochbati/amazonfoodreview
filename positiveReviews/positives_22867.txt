My elderly Pomeranian LOVES these Senior Greenies (even more than regular greenies) and absolutely never lets us forget this 4 o'clock daily treat (I never have been able to fully understand how dogs tell time, but we all know they are VERY good at it  and surprisingly accurate).          These are a little bit softer than regular greenies & they contain both chondroitin (sp?) and glucosamine for joint support.          Highly recommended!
