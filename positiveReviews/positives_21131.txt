This item is wonderful for growing smaller crops of several varieties for consumption. I love the white as well so I can SEE it is clean.          I enjoy sprouts over lettuce on sandwiches and in salads, and even to top soups and decorate plates. This makes it much easier and takes up little space.          Thanks !!
