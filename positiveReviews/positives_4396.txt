HAVE TO SAY I USED TO EAT THE NATURE VALLEY PEANUT SWEET AND SALTY BARS,THEN WHEN THESE GRANOLA THINS CAME OUT AND I TRIED THEM,I JUST CAN'T STOP EATING THEM. THE PEANUT BUTTER FAVOR IS MY FAV.TRIED THE DARK CHOCOLATE AND WASN'T TOO IMPRESSED BUT I SWEAR I COULD EAT A WHOLE BOX IN ONE DAY OF THE PEANUT BUTTER FLAVOR IF I LET MYSELF.I HAVE READ OTHER REVIEWS ABOUT THEM BEING MESSY AND THEY ARE A LITTLE BUT THAT DOESN'T STOP ME FROM ENJOYING THEM.THEY ARE A LITTLE CRUMBLY AND THE PEANUT BUTTER STICKS TO YOUR FINGERS A LITTLE BUT WHO CARES.THE PEOPLE WHO SAID THE PEANUT BUTTER STUCK TO THE WRAPPER MUST BE STORING THEM IN VERY HOT ENVIRONMENTS.I HAVE NOT HAD THIS PROBLEM AT ALL! LOVE,LOVE,LOVE THEM!!!  TRY THEM YOU WON'T REGRET IT.
