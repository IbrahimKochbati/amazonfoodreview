I am not a great milk producer and ha e had to supplement my last 4 children, with two I made my own, with the next I used the powder, not that I have my sixth baby I wanted something quick and easy but also organic.  I have been happy with this so far.  I don't like using formula but I decided it was better than killing myself with constant pumping and stressing that I did not have enough!     Price was better than the store, I would love to see it on subscribe and save though.
