I bought a bottle of Blackberry Balsamic Vinegar last fall at a county fair, and since it is now running low, I attempted to find the  and that I had purchased at the fair, but to no avail.  When I found the Blackberry Ginger Balsamic Vinegar at Amazon, I decided to give it a try.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is as good as, if not better than, the old stuff.  I will definitely reorder!
