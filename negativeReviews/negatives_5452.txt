I have tried many coffees, but never a low acid one.  Wasn't sure what to expect.  The aroma of the coffee after  ewing was fine, but I felt that it tasted strong like a certain  and from Seattle.  And I don't like their coffee. For a dark French roast it tasted burnt to me.  On the other hand, my wife enjoyed it (and she is big fan of DD coffee).  I guess it goes to what each individual's taste is but to me this wasn't my cup of tea (pun intended).
