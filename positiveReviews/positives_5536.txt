I ordered this popping corn after being disappointed with the local big box store selection two  ands.  One of them tasted chalky like styrofoam and its claim was larger popped kernels.  No taste.          I mainly use this popcorn with one of those plastic microwave popping bowls.  I noticed that 1 3 cup yields more cooked popcorn than two other  ands I have tried.  It kept on popping after my usual 2 minute and 20 second routine.  When using microwave poppers, you tend to get some burnt kernels if you extend the cooking time for maximum popped corn.  The snappy burnt kernels didn't taste as bad as other  ands.          This white popcorn tasted great with canola oil and even better when popped with coconut oil.
