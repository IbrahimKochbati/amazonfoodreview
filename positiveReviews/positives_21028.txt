To be honest, I expected this to taste terrible, so I was pleasantly surprised when I cracked open the can after leaving it in my fridge overnight and shaking it well before opening it, that it did indeed taste like a slightly melted vanilla shake.          I work out 3 4 times a week and find on those days after working out that I will be hungry quite quickly as my metabolism is set on high for hours afterwards, but I don't want to over eat. I could see this shake as a great option for those times. While I was only given one sample can to try, so can't attest to long term effectiveness, I can say that it is a tasty, filling shake, (it should be for 370 Calories) that would be a good option for someone to consume after working out or playing a fast paced sport.
