Excellent pasta for a gluten free product!  Cooks nicely, tastes good   my kids love it!  It does not keep well after it is cooked  it gets hard.  It would not work well for a pasta salad.  I have used this pasta for mac & cheese and it was only slightly firmer the next day.  I have put the day old pasta in boiling water for a minute to soften it up and it works, only problem is that it makes the pasta fall apart easier.  Anyhow, if you're willing to put up with a few differences from standard wheat pasta, it is really an excellent product.
