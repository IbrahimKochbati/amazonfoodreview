I gave this item a three because it only lasted a couple of hours before my 2 year old Wheaten Terrier chewed the rubber cord apart. It's a good thing I was watching hime or he would have swallowed it. That being said my girlfriends 3 year old 90 pound chow mix loves it. He chews on other things but loves this toy!
