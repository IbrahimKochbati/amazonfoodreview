This is a product that I first sampled in Louisiana while serving with the American Red Cross after hurricane Katrina.  I just recently found them in Jamaica and would like to purchase the in my home town.          Brunswick Sardines with Hot Peppers are excellent!!!!!!!          I would like to purchase a case and find out if they can be distributed in the Oregon Washington area.
