Our local grocery stores no longer carry Tobasco Ketchup, so went out to the internet and found it on Amazon.  I don't use ketchup all the time for everything, but when I do, I like it spicy.  Good stuff.  I don't know why our local grocers do not carry it any more.  This seller delivered the product in a timely manner as well.
