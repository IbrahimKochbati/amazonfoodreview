These chews work great for my dog.  I think the value and quality is a great deal on Amazon.          Now on to the scary reviews about them being a choking hazard.  I was worried myself as my dog is an aggressive eater.  She inhales her dog food in less than a minute at her feedings and I was worried she would do the same with this item.  She does not, she chews it completely and really takes her time.  I can see how it works as a teeth cleaning agent as she can get about 5 10 minutes of chewing on it until she is finished.          Because I never want to see it become a choking hazard I do only let her eat these in my presence and do not leave them as a treat when I leave in her crate.  Each dog will be different, so maybe buy a tester chew at a local store before investing in a bag of 30.
