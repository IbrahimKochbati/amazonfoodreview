It has the perfect maple taste, a really good consistancy, beautiful color and a great quanitity for the price. It works good as a person would normally use it (on pancakes and such), I also use it in place of sugar in recipes and to sweeten my smoothies, teas, and coffee. I love it and will definitely be ordering this same  and and grade again when my bottle runs out.
