Tried several different flavors at this point...this is flat out the best.  It just has a good coffee taste, not too strong or too mild.  I can get away with two little french vanilla creamers and no sugar (even considering I tend to like the sweeter side of the coffee spectrum).  Everyone in my office likes too.  I picked up at Sam's Club one time for $33 for the 108 count that I think they are offering here currently for $59.
