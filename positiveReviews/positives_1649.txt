I purchased these for our 10 month old twins a while back and they absolutely loved them. They are now 13 months and still love them. They prefer them over the HappyMelts, even though they like those as well. Below is my pro cons list:          Pros:     Both babies love them     They are overall healthy, have less sodium, etc than other products of the same type of snack     A lot of munchies in each container     Great price on Amazon with Subscribe & Save          Cons:     They are messy as they easily crumble and there are a lot of tiny crumbles in the bottom of the container     This particular flavor is sort of flavorless to me, however, my twins seem to disagree with my taste buds
