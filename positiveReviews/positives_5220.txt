I enjoyed this drink. It has good fizz and flavor. Ingredients include apple grade juices as the main fruit elements. Tangerine, orange and acerola (type of wild cherry) round out the other fruit juices. For my taste, this is not citrusy enough. I find an Orangina to have better flavor, but it is loaded with added sugars (high fructose corn syrup is the second ingredient in Orangina)! I also compare this to the Izze version and the Izze wins for flavor. I think the health benefits of The Switch or Izze drinks outweigh the flavor differences though, and if I was but one of these types of drinks, I would not look at Orangina again.
