This is the best product out there.  It even cleans up my 11 year old Labs teeth.  My vet recommended it and since I have been using it, I have not had to have her teeth cleaned which is a big relief to me because of her age.  I have 2 new labs and I have started them on it as well.  Amazon did an amazing job shipping it quickly which I am grateful because I had run out!
