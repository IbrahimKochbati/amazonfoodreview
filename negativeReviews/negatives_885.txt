Just got a new keurig and immediately went on a search for     the best dark rich bold coffee (Caribou Mahogany) and other  ands     with rich taste (Wolfgang is winning so far) but really wanted to find     the best hot cocoas and got these first...now trying to give them away.     The are even worse than the packaged kind you get in the stores. Actually,     I think I've found better instant ones. I hate to write a bad review but..if     you want to find a DELICIOUS cocoa mix in the K cups...get the Grove (Station)  and     here on Amazon.  They are always sold out (which DUH I know why now as they are a far better     tasting  and) but if     you put your email on a wait list, they'll let you know when they come in and     you dont have to wait very long.  I'd stock up though, as you'll find you want a cup     or two every night! (and the dark, milk and peppermint combined box is the bomb!!)I just     sent a couple boxes out to a friend of mine who was complaining about how bad the k cup hot     chocolates were....she'll be thrilled to get my care package!!
