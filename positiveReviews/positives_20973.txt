My dog is doing very well on this food (better than she did on many others including Merrick's other  ands, Foster and Smith, and Brothers Complete) but the recent price increase means I will be shopping elsewhere for this product.  Not to mention that I almost always had at least one bag in my order come unsealed during shipment due to poor packaging.  More than enough reasons to shop elsewhere.
