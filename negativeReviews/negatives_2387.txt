My child was exclusively  eastfed for 4 1 2 months and I gradually introduced Similac Organic formula to supplement (my  eastmilk started to dry up).  She found this was so much easier to eat she gave up on me by 5 1 2 months.  By the time I completely stopped nursing she was so constipated from the formula that I switched.  She winced and cried and worked so long to just produced a hard ball the size of ping pong ball.  It was horrible!  I realized I was the one helping her poo with nursing and then she lost all ability when she went full formula.  I say switch....
