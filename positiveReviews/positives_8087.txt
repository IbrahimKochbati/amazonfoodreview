These were the first hemp seeds I've ever ordered. I got them to add to my kale shakes. So far I've been through four  bags and not found one shell. The taste is like that of an unsalted sunflower seed. These include all 21 essential amino acids and are one of many super foods I've added to my afternoon shake. Amazing product.
