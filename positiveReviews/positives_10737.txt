The Wife and kids say it's mean, but I generally use the dog's daily food for his treats.  After all, just being fed is treat enough, no?          But I do have to concede that he's quite a bit more excited when we open this bag of Newman's treats tthan when I reach in my pocket for some of his usual kibble.
