You will not find a better loose green tea for the price.  I was able to get free shipping as well since I bought it with something else that totaled over $25.  This is the tea used by many Japanese people.  Do not fall for those high priced "organic" green teas produced by American companies.  They are good...but you are not getting anything better than Hime Ban Cha Tea.
