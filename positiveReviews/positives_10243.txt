This is a great product that delivers a unique taste of white truffle flavor for all types of meals from eggs, pasta, and is very unique on steak as well.  I would recommend this product to all who are trying to get the truffle taste without the high cost.  The oil is very strong so not much is needed to add the taste and aroma to the meal or dish.          Glad to see Amazon carrying this it can't be found in my local store.
