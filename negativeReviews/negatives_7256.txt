this i believe is a great dog treat the only problem is i have yet to find a toy that will outlast the treat the toys designed to use with these treats seem to be made of a soft rubber that my dog chews into pieces the treats seem to keep him busy better then the toys themselves I gave this 3 stars because it is a good treat just has no use if the toys designed for them cant keep up I would suggest a ever locking treat for a good chew treat for your pooch
