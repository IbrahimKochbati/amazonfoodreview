Anyone that likes Salt and Peppercorn Kettle Chips will like this snack.          Salt and Pepper Popchips are one of the best munchie snacks that has come out in a long time.  No saturated fat, and no trans fat...Great taste with no guilt.          Granted they are not quite as addicting as the Kettle Chips,  but they have a lot less fat.          i am concerned that safeway and nobb hill grocery stores are not carrying this product anymore.  i am thinking about ordering a dozen cases and stockpile them up so that i am INSURED of my supply.
