Have been using this litter for years.  Used to be able to find it in stores, becoming more and more difficult tho.  It's better than Worlds Best because it never becomes "gluey" when wet.  Clumps beautifully, easy to scoop, and in my opinion, probably the healthiest litter out there.  Cats love it, grains are not sharp at all.
