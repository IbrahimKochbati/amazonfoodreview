Instead of a black graduation cap, a top hat was sent instead.  Not great for a graduation gift!  Also, I think any buyer should be aware that by "Godiva 4 Pack", they mean "4 pieces of candy"!  Very confusing description especially when you consider that the picture shows at least 5 pieces of candy! Definitely not worth the price!!
