I bought this tea because I absolutely love tangy lemons, and wanted a tasty tea that wouldn't keep me up all night.  Based on other reviews, I knew it would have a strong lemony flavor, but the tea is lacking some tanginess that would probably make it perfect.  Still, it is probably the best lemon tea I have had from a K cup or tea bag.  Next time I will add some fresh drops of fresh lemon juice.  With the bit of honey I already added, it will be perfect.
