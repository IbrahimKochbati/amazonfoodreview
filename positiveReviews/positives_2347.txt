My synagogue's Passover Care Package had some of these candies in it, and WOW are they good!  Americans have little exposure to sesame seeds except atop a burger bun.  Time to taste these nutty little wonders!  Individually wrapped to keep them fresh and slow you down (grins).  Better than peanut  ittle any day!  And these are kosher for passover!
