My hubby wanted a Keurig because they had the nice big industrial ones in Iraq, I asked him who bought it, he told me that Keurig sent them a ton of free Keurigs, and they sent them a bunch of boxes of coffee, enough to cover hundreds of soldiers at a fob for 2 rotations, to many fobs. With so many crap companies, with crap customer support, most of them don't stand behind their own products, and this company does more than that, just thought this might make a difference to some people debating buying one of these.
