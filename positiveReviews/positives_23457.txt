I absolutely LOVE Bigelow's spiced chai tea.  It's the best  and on the market, and along with their vanilla chai, form 2 of the 3  ands of chai I keep on hand (or will even TRY these days.)  Too many times, I've tried other  ands, only to end up throwing them out because of dreadful medicinal tastes.  I also love the foil packet packaging inside the box  it makes Bigelow tea bags much more portable!  This is a tea that I hate running out of.          I'm a camper, and frequently participate in outdoor activities.  I'm also usually the camp cook.  Bigelow teas are my favorite to keep in my drink box to offer everyone a selection of tea  the foil packages prevent taste transfer, help keep the bags clean and dry, and are clearly labeled as to the variety.  I feel comfortable adding Bigelow teas to our backpacks too  the teas will be usable whether they are used this trip...or six trips from now.  Convenient, fantastic flavor, high quality, and Amazon offers a much better price than our local stores.  I love the convenience of "subscribe & save" too!
