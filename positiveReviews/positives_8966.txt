OK I have to admit I was very skeptical on how good this chocolate was.  My wife had served a mission in Canada and she said this was the best chocolate so I had to try it.  Well, she was right again.  Not only was the chocolate good but the deliver was great also.  We received ours before they said they would get it to us.  Great service!  You have to just try these!
