I want to start by saying I am not a professional, just an average cat owner. I realize this isn't the highest quality cat food out there. However, in my opinion, this is a great middle of the road more natural cat food. Our cats love it and haven't had any problems digesting it.          We have 2 cats that are a year old. We adopted them from a shelter 4 months ago. When they were babies they got a virus and as a result have sensitive stomachs. I had to find a food for them with not a lot of fillers and dyes. Particularly the red dye found in most cat foods. The foster home gave them Purina Naturals which was more expensive then Goodlife so I am very happy I found this  and of food. I am a realistic common sense cat owner on a budget so price had to be a factor especially with 2 cats. I admit I didn't know anything about corn and other stuff in cat food. The ingredients in this cat food hasn't had any negative affects on our cats. In fact they have a soft shiny coat, very seldom get hair balls, and are full of energy.          I always had cats growing up that ate just regular cat food and they lived to be old. In fact my one cat is 13 years old now. I don't understand why all of a sudden people are so critical of cat food. There are certainly worse cat foods out there with a lot of fillers and dyes that in some cases can be more expensive. I recommend giving this food a try and let your cat decide if he she likes it.
