Before I tried a 'Juicy Pear Jelly Belly' jelly bean, I'd never tasted anything like it, except real fruit. The flavor that explodes in your mouth right away is of a juicy pear; I kid you not. Buying a pound of them finally gave me a chance to keep them around for awhile, because I've always had a hard time not eating them all. I love the licorice beans too, and I really love all the fruit flavors: green apple, peach, cherry, lime, grapefruit, lime, grapefruit, lemon and tangerine, but nothing wows my taste buds like the "juicy pear". I would order more if the shipping cost weren't so high.
