After reading about the benefits of coconut water, I decided to give this  and a try.  I have tried a few other  ands with a juice added, but they all have lot of extra sodium.  Be sure to read the labels.  Some have less potassium in them than the Via Coco  and.  I felt like this was better for my husband to drink than Gatorade. He works on a c during the summer and is out in the heat all day long.
