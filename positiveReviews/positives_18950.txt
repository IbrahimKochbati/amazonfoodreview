So I am always looking for healthy snacks for my dogs, and my dogs go nuts for these. The only issue is they eat them extremely fast even though they are hard, its a little worrisome versus the chicken jerky products I usually give. Regardless I love mixing it up for my 4 legged friends and feel good about feeding these to my dogs!
