These are fantastic, if you're looking for a flat  ead style cracker that won't overpower whatever dips, compotes, and cheeses you're serving alongside them. I stumbled across these as I was searching for something comparable to the tuscan crackers from whole foods. These are flatter, but gave me the exact same flavor profile. I really like them, and they remind me of naan in a cracker or perhaps a flour tortilla cracker. A small package retails for $4.99 at my local grocery, so I was happy to find them here for much less. Perfect for large parties!          They aren't covered in SALT and BUTTER, so if you're looking for a salty, buttery cracker   stick with Ritz or Club crackers.
