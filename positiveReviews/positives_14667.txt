Twinings developed this tea last year (2006) for their 300th anniversary   a counterpart to their famous "Earl Grey" product.  "Lady Grey" has the distinctive Earl Grey flavor but with just a hint of floral.  It has become my family's favorite tea.  We can no longer get it in our stores but is easily available on line from Twinings.  Buy it   maybe we'll get it back in our stores!  A wonderful product!
