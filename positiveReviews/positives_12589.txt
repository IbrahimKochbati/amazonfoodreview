I love this coffee.  I like light roast, but many of them have little flavor.  Green Mountain Breakfast Blend has a nice smooth, full taste without being harsh.  The flavor of some dark roasts leave me with the impression I could get the same effect by just licking the bottom of a dirty ashtray.  (Sorry, dark roast lovers   I tend to be overly sensitive to bitterness.)
