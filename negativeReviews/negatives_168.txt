I am a preschool teacher and do a G is for Ginger ead unit every January. I was on vacation during Christmas and when I got back not a ginger ead kit was to be found. Which is odd. I needed one for my preschool class and needed it in less then a week. I looked everywhere and could not find ont. So I had one overnighted from Amazon on NYE and it came yesterday. I pick this one because of the Rudolph theme. The ginger ead itself came  oken. Like unable to use would need a glue gun to get it to work  oken. It's non returnable. I called Amazon, they were nice enough to order me a second one since I spend a ton of money each year with them. This one also came  oken. I order A LOT from Amazon and things do not come  oken. I think only one time have I had returned something because it was  oken in 100's of orders. But two of the same thing in a row?! I think it's the kit itself and nothing to do with how it was shipped. I will say most come UPS and overnight comes Fed Ed. But it's bubble wrapped very well. I think the ginger ead isn't good and cracks in shipping and  eaks off. The rest of the kit is very cute. The first kit the candies had spilled out and where a mess in the box. But the second kit while the ginger ead was all  oken up again the candies were all in their bags. Too bad. But I would try something else, stay away from this one.
