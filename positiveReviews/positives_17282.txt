We go through a lot of syrup in our house and I was concerned about the corn syrup.  When I searched the local stores for maple extract, all I could find was imitation.  We are now on our second bottle of Cook's and it works perfectly for what I wanted.  The only complaint I have is the price and shipping are a bit expensive.  Other than that, the product is great.
