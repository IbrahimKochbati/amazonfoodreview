This wine actually turned out really well.  I made some modifications to the kit however.  If you figure out the potential alcohol content, this kit would probably get around 7%, but by adding additional sugar at the primary fermentation, I ended up with 13%.  I also didn't use the whole f pack.  It would have been WAY to sweet.  Instead, I topped the carboy off with an unoaked Chardonnay that I like.
