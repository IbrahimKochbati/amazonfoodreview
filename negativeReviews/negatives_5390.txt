I liked the strong aroma of this french roast coffee, both from the pouch and when it was  ewing.  But the flavor was off, and it left a strong aftertaste.  I do get heartburn on occasion, and can say I did not have any after drinking this.  However, the price is so very high, and the flavor is only mediocre, so it is hard to recommend this product, unless you absolutely cannot drink regular coffee without distress.
