I thought this dog toy would perfectly fit my 11 month Samoyed and provide the durable playful time. Unfortunately, my Samoyed was not just rolling the bottle, her chewing on the knots caused the bottle to fly around and when it hits my fragile ceramic floor, it  oke (both the lid cover and my newly set floor).. *sigh*     Maybe this product should be used in a carpeted environment only.
