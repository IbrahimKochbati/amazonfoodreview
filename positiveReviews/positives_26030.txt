I'm tired of products that promise more than they can deliver. Advertising should tell me what to expect in the real world, not in some happytime fantasy land where money grows on chia pets and all my pants fit and supermodels frolic on the shores of the lazy Guinness river. I bought this product specifically to test the claims made in their marketing.          Orbit commercials say that no matter how dirty you get, their gum will give you a 'clean mouth'. I couldn't think of anything dirtier than the cold slushy flowerbed outside my building. So I went outside, waggled my face around in it for a while, and popped a piece of spearmint to test it out.          On the good side, the flavor of the gum lasted quite a long time. On the bad, so did the taste of crabgrass, wet dirt and Miracle Gro. Also, I was pulling chunks of fertilizer out of my teeth for the rest of the day. Not exactly the 'winter green' I was hoping for.          In short, Orbit gum did nothing to provide me a 'clean mouth'. As far as I'm concerned, whoever made those commercials are a bunch of bubble thumping smock tucking picklejacks.          Whoa. Maybe that gum *does* work. Fabulous.
