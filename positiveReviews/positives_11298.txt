Granted, we haven't tried all of the other  ands of organic baby foods, but this is certainly a GREAT product, especially for baby's first intro to solids. Each one smells & tastes amazingly fresh & good. Packets can be packed in the diaper bag & reconstituted with water or  east milk formula to the desired consistency. My grandaughter looks like a baby bird with her mouth open waiting for the next bite. That wasn't the case with Earth's ____  and that she rejected! She loves all of these, especially the squash.  That being said  this isn't inexpensive, so this subscribe & save plan for the variety pack is appreciated. Without that option, we might be searching for another  and  though I'm doubting we would find a better product. Waiting for the expanded 6 pack to be offerred that adds carrots & bananas.
