I bought this toy for my dog to keep him busy while I run out the door to work.  He used to get upset when I left, but now he knows he will get this to play with.  He figured out really quickly how to use it and it keeps him entertained for at least 10 15 minutes while I escape.  It is very easy to clean.  One thing I wanted to point out is that the small is rather large.  My collie is huge and he uses the small.  I think the large would be too big for him.  I just put about a quarter of a cup in it although the small holds about 2 cups.  I guess if you wanted to feed a very large dog an huge meal you might need a large, but then it might be too heavey for the dog to play with.
