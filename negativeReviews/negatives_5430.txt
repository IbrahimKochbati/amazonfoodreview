I do not suffer from heart burn or other stomach ills that are related to acidity of my food. I am an average coffee drinker.  I don't have to drink decaffinated coffee, and I don't make a point of drinking only gourmet coffee either.          This coffee claims to be the answer for the needs of those who are acid sensitive.  I can see why, because I can taste the low acidity.  It adds a certain degree of smoothness and drinkability.  The aroma is good, it is inviting, and the after taste is quite pleasent.  Even though I don't have to drink low acid coffee, I could drink this coffee daily, and I could be content.          Then, there is the other side of the coin.  If you are a true gourmet coffee drinker, you probably will be very disappointed with this one.  If you are happy with the "house blend" at "Starbucks", you will likely be happy with this one too.  If you only drink some of the specialty  ands of coffee from "Peets", then you should not even consider buying this one.          Finally there is the price.  I am accustomed to pay this kind of price for top of the line gourmet coffee, but I consider it on the high side for this kind of product.
