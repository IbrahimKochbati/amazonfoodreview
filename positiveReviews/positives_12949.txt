This carbonated blend of juices is a refreshing drink.  The kiwi and strawberry flavors come through more distinctly, and when drinking while eating, it is the strawberry flavor that dominates.  Because Switch is not as carbonated as soda, it does not need to have added sugar, a definite plus.  The lower carbonation also makes it easier to drink.  I am now intrigued to try the other flavors that Switch makes.
