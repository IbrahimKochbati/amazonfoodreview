THESE CRACKERS ARE A GREAT SNACK! NO CHOLESTORAL, AND THEY USE SEA SALT. VERY CRUNCHY, SO ITS LIKE EATING POTATO CHIPS, BUT BETTER FOR YOU. COMES IN DIFFERENT FLAVORS, BUT I PREFER THE PLAIN. I HAVE FOUND THAT THE SALT CONTENT IS DIFFERENT ON SOME PURCHASES, SOMETIMES VERY SALTY AND SOMETIMES HARDLY ANY SALT, MUST BE A PROBLEM ON THE PRODUCTION LINE. THESE CRACKERS BECOME ADDICTING, BUT ITS OK CAUSE RICE IS GOOD FOR US!
