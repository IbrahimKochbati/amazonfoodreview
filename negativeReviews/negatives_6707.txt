This popcorn does pop up well with very few hulls.  However, it has little to no butter flavor and has a strange taste that I couldn't grow accustomed to.  I ate three boxes, trying to convince myself that the flavor would grow on me, before deciding that I was never going to get used to it and the calories weren't worth it.  I added butter, flavorings, parmesan cheese, but no luck. Too bad you can't return unused boxes!          I ended up giving the rest of it away.  A very expensive taste test!
