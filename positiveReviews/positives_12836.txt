I could definitely taste the berries, harder to find the kiwi though.     I like that there's no heavily processed sweeteners (no HFCS) but still the funny thing about all these fruit juices in a can is that they almost always contain apple and grape juices and then the rest. I wonder actually how much kiwi juice is in there.     It's sparkly and I tried it when it was not cold enough so it was a bit too sweet for me.
