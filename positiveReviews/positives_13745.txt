I ordered these from amazon after being without them for years. Our local health food store stopped carrying them. I am so glad that the company has not changed the product at all in that time. Same wonderful flavor I recall. My husband, who is no fan of "health food", loves them too. I have been  inging them to gatherings and everyone asks me "Where did you find these?" In a very short period of time I am down from 12 bags to 2!     Although these carrot chips are a much healthier option than regular mainstream potato chips, be forewarned   they are every bit as addictive.
