This is my first time trying Wabash Valley Farms Amish Country Baby White.          Pros: It's okay with a nice mild nutty flavor. The hulls are more pronounced than with some other Amish "Baby White."          Cons: It tends not to  iskly pop up. In fact, we've burned several pans because popping it is tricky. We found that the microwave often works better than pan popping. And as mentioned above, the hulls are much more noticeable than with other Amish "Baby White"  ands.          We purchased these 6 bags and we'll use them up but won't be ordering any more. Next time we'll drive the long distance to our nearest Amish store.
