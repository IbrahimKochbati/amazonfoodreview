My order was carried out in a fast and effective manner. I received my shipment of chips within two days and had no problems with the retailer.          The chips (Sweet Onion variety) are flavorful and particularly crunchy. The only negative  a subjective one  is that the chips may be too salty. Other than that, I would recommend buying these chips again.
