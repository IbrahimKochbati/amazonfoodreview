My dog (cocker  iel) has separation anxiety and one of the tactics i use to distract him from my leaving the house is his busy buddy tug a jug toys.  His first one lasted about a year, and we used it every day, sometimes two to three times.  The threads on the bottom of the screw off bottle eventually all  oke off (i believe there is a picture of what it did on the item description already) and we needed another one.  So i bought 2.  It is a good toy that i will continue to give my dog, as it effectively keeps him busy and engaged.
