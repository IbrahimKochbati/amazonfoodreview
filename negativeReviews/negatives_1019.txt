I have bought Duncan Hines Yellow cake mix in the past and have made a favorite recipe with it.  In the past, it had 18.25 ounces.  Pillsbury and Betty Crocker have the required ounces 18+.  I bought Duncan Hines at Safeway because it was less expensive than the other  ands and after I got home, I discovered why.  I will not buy Duncan Hines again unless they go back to the 18+ ounces or go to 9 ounces for $.54.  Consumer beware and read the number of ounces in the product.
