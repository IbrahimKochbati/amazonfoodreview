For some reason my husband ordered a TON of this stuff for me for Christmas.  We live in Chicago & it's cold so I didn't try it right away.  I was craving something sweet so I finally made some tonight.  It tastes like icy chocolate, & it's a bit chalky.  To be honest it reminds me of the old powdered slimfast.  I've got a whole canister and 5 packets of this stuff & I don't know what I'm going to do with it.
