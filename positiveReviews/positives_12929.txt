I don't often drink soda for a couple reasons...  it's all high fructose corn syrup and various artificial flavors (and the diet stuff has even worse stuff.)  With that said:  this stuff is good.          It doesn't leave that weird aftertaste in your mouth, or that sticky slime in the back of the throat (or is that just me?), or BURN going down.  It tastes "fresh," for lack of a better term.  Containing 100% fruit juice is a huge step forward for a soft drink   not really because it's going to supply you with a serving of fruit or anything, but because it's actually FOOD.  (Corn syrup + some contrived chemical flavoring of other soft drinks, in my book, is not food.)          All in all, this is good, has a great flavor, and just has a "cleaner" flavor that the sugary corn syrupy stuff.  (I didn't really notice it being too sweet.  To comment on other reviews saying it's mostly other fruit juices...it's because apple and grape juice are incredibly sweet.  Other fruits are usually used as flavoring, not as sweeteners.  A strawberry (or kiwi) may taste sweet when eaten whole, but the juice by itself really isn't sweet enough to be passed off as "juice," except by fanatics.)          Overall, I would recommend to anyone who wants a good tasting natural soda.  I liked it enough to want to try out the other flavors...
