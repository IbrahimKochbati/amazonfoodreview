I bought this item for my dog to play with. She was smart and can get out all the food in it. Initially I like it since it was entertaining for my dog. However, my dog quickly chewed open the rope   only the 3 time I used it.          I think there is a problem with the design   it will be great if the rope can be replaced with some better material so it does not get chewed immediately.          I asked some dog friends and they pointed out the same problemm. I would not recommend this item for dogs who chew. Well, most dogs chew, so...There are many other interactive toys that you can try.
