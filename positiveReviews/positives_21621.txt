The Hazelnut Eight O'Clock Coffee was roasted properly and was very fresh.  It produced a delicious cup.  I've been spoiling myself with Kona recently, and in my humble opinion, that's a hard coffee to beat.  However,this cup was rather satisfying and better than the other Hazelnut  ands that I've tasted.
