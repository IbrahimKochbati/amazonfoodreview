I baught this kind of cereal from Wholefood. Since this was the first time I tried this  and, I picked 3 kinds: multi grain, oatmeal and  own rice. Oatmeal was all right, but the other two smelled like they were already stale(the expiration day is May 2013), and they tasted bad too and sticked on my throat when I tried them. My baby cried and refused to eat them. The customer service of Wholefood was very nice and refunded me. I don't think I will buy this  and of cereal again.
