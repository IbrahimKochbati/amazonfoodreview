I ordered $35+ of product to qualify for the free gift. I added the promotion code during checkout. Needless to say, I was confused when everything BUT the free gift arrived. I contacted them asking if they would track where it was, and was told:          "Thank you for your email. I apologize, but the cookies are not on your order from Amazon.  As per the instructions on Amazon,  you would have needed to put them in your cart and use the promotion code.  Promotions are not automatically applied. I apologize for any confusion."          So there you have it. Unless you clicked on the box that says "here's how", you would never know you needed more than just the promotion code to get the free gift. You do, indeed have to add the free gift to your cart AND use the code. Wish they said that on the main page of the product. Maybe they'll update the product page now that there is a complaint.          How do they taste? I have no idea. I'll come back and edit this after my husband opens them on Christmas morning.
