I love buying these in bulk because it's much cheaper in the long run. I got tired of buying the smaller boxes for $10 when I could buy 50 for $29. And having it delivered was even better!          Taste wise   this coffee is bold, strong and isn't bitter. Tully's Italian Roast never disappoints and is my favorite.
