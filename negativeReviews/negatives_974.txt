Overall, this mix is okay, but, the sugar content is very, very high. You can actually see the sugar in the mix if you look closely. For pancakes or waffles, this is fine, but for savory concoctions, this is not acceptable. Sausage balls, casseroles, and biscuits all come out almost inedible.This mix is also oddly gritty. The grit is very fine, but still makes my teeth want to curl.  I recommend Pamela's baking and pancake mix, as it is smoother, and much more versatile, because it's not as sweet. A good cook knows you can always add more of something, but you can't take it out if you've added too much.          That being said, if you're traveling and this is the only mix they have, it's better than nothing.
