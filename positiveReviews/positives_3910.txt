This sauce has just the right combination of sweet, spicy and mild heat that is perfect for using with a family.  The spicy isn't overpowered with allspice, the way some other  ands are.  Baste this on grilled pineapple for Jerk Turkey Burgers and you'll be in love too!  My only trouble is finding it in our small town stores... have had to go to the internet, but it's worth it.
