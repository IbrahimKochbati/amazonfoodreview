This thing makes a great present for any chocolate lover, I ordered all three, milk, dark, and white... and have had no complaints from serious connoisseurs. The price is only contestable when Lindt holds its 2 for 19oz bags @ 20 deal, but still, you are cutting it really close, and when you factor in shipping, forget it. Walmart at best can only match this price through an online offer, however, with additional charges this substantially  ings up the total cost.          Word of caution, this deal may not work for those requiring shipping in hot weather or steamy climates.
