What's in this stuff?  Where's the list of ingredients?          I don't eat anything unless I know and approve of what's in it.          For example, although this product's description says it contains no sugar, it does not say if it contains any artificial sweeteners, which are also bad for you.          For one thing, aside from tasting awful, artificial sweeteners often cause horrendous intestinal cramps and diarrhea.          In addition to having long ago given up the eating of sugar and sugar in all its guises (e.g: "natural" cane juice, fruit juices, "raw" sugar, "organic" sugar, etc.), I also stopped ingesting artificial sweeteners of any kind.          So, what's in this stuff?
