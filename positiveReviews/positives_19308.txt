Loving panko crumbs I purchased these in the container.  I believe they were a case of 12.  These were the best crumbs ever.  Nice and crunching when baking chicken and wonderful in the fry pan as well.     Sadly the panko crumbs in the plastic container were "unavailable at this time" when I last checked.     These were really the ones ones I can comment on to be excellent.
