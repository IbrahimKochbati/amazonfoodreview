Bread was the hardest gluten free item for me to make. Even with the best recipe, while the taste was good, the texture was still crumbly. This is the closest to real  ead since it has a chew to it and the dough is actually elastic instead of sticky and  eaking apart. It also bakes up a nice golden color instead of the pale  ead I usually get. Each bag doesn't make a lot of dough though. I get 5 smallish sandwich rolls which I make by flattening rounds of dough. I find I have to bake it longer than stated or it is a bit tacky. I hope there are more recipes coming.
