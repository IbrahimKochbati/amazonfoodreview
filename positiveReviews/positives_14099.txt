I found Davidson's Banaspaty Estate Assam tea to be a very good Assam at a very reasonable price. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I've had better but at more than twice the price. Davidson's is the hands down winner on value. This is the second time I've purchased it and I intend to buy more in the future.
