I was a little disappointed with this soda.  True, it's all natural and only fruit juice sweetened, but it's too sweet for my taste.  I diluted it with cold water, and enjoyed it.  I don't drink fruit "drinks" that are not 100% juice, so I thought this would be good.  I prefer the fresh, clean taste of the Knudsen spritzers.          So if you're looking for a more natural fruit soda, this might be what you're looking for.  If you want a refreshing juice with some fizz, try the Knudsen spritzers.
