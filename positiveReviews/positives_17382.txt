I bought these chips, and wanted to try if they were tasty. It sure is!  Unique and different flavor and the right thickness.          It remains crunchy, spicy and flavorful with a hint of tabasco and paprika sauce for heat. There are some rice granules embedded with the tortilla chips. However, some of the spices are lacking from this chip. But I liked this very much.          I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try a red beans and rice tortilla chips. Go ahead   you can put other ingredients as nachos except the cheese.  Maybe some el pastor, shredded meat, tomatoes, etcetera.
