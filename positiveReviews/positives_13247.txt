I purchased this tub as a way to try out some new Crystal Light flavors.  I was told I had to cut back on caffeine, and I don't need the calories associated with sugared soft drinks.  These work well, for the most part.          My favorite flavor is the raspberry lemonade.  I like the hint of raspberry flavor, and find that I can drink quite a lot of it during the day without getting bored.  I mix up a 32 oz water bottle of the stuff, using 2 packets of mix.  This seems to work well, especially when i down 2 3 bottles of the stuff per day.          I also like the lemonade flavor, and the cherry pomegranate.  The strawberry   not so much.  It's their "energy" formulation, so it contains some "extras" that I think add to a slightly bitter "sharp" flavor   and it contains caffeine, which sort of defeats the purpose of my drinking Crystal Light in the first place.          I've managed to lose 23 pounds in a little over 3 months using this along with cooking everything from "scratch"   no processed foods, lots of fruits and veggies, fresh meats and fish.  I do understand the controversy about aspartame, but given the choice between carrying WAY too much weight and consuming something that may or may not kill me eventually, I'll choose the latter.  Plain water just doesn't do it for me, and this stuff IS tasty.
