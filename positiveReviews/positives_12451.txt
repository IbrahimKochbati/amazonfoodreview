This oatmeal tastes great, and it has nice texture because it's steel cut. It's healthier and contains more fiber then regular mushy oatmeal. It's extremely good for you and the texture is amazing but still   it has no taste. Some people say that it has a"nutty taste" but to me  it has no taste at all. However I cut a banana, and put a little sweetener and voila!   delish! I am now addicted to this oatmeal!
