A friend recently mailed us some of these USDA certified organic fruit strips. My wife and my six year old are not fans of this Archer Farms pomegranate product, but my nine year old and I gobbled them up. My wife prefers salty snacks, and I think my youngest child just doesn't like pomegranates. Each 14 gram strip contains only 45 calories and has 0 grams of fat, saturated fat, and trans fat. No artificial flavors, synthetic colors, or chemical fertilizers are part of this healthy snack. My only knock against this food product is that they are a bit pricey for such a small item.
