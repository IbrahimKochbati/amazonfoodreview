Due to the rain we had ants coming into our kitchen like crazy!  At about 8pm we put this down across where the ants were coming in and by 6am the next morning they were gone and we have not seen them since!  It worked great.  The only negative is that the syringe is a little tough to push at first and I shot out too much.  But just be aware of that and you should be good.
