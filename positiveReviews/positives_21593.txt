Last year I bought a popcorn machine for my son's carnival birthday party and needed some popcorn kits to go along with it.  After reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided to go with Great Northern popcorn because it had a lot more review. WRONG CHOICE!  It was terrible! It's had a chemical like smell and was EXTREMELY salty    and I am a person that salts everything and it was way too salty for me to even eat. It was just all around nasty popcorn.          This year I decided I'm going to  eak out the popcorn machine and use it again, but I needed to get different popcorn.  I wanted to allow myself enough time this year that if I didn't like the popcorn I ordered, I would have time to order replacements before the party.  Last week I ordered the Real Theater popcorn kits and OMG! I LOVE it!  It tastes really good like movie theater popcorn or the popcorn you get at the popcorn carts at the zoo or amusement parks.  My house smelled really good like popcorn you just had to have.  I even stepped outside for a little bit and walked back in to see how the smell would hit you if you were just walking in the house.  It was fabulous!
