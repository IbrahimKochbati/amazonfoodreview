I had hoped that this would taste like Pina Coladas but it doesn't.  It is rather nasty and left a film on my tongue.  I wanted something to drink after a work out or to give to my kids when we are traveling but it is to hard for me to swallow.  The reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is good in mixed drinks.  I have been able to add it to smoothies and drinks with alcohol.  If you are going to drink this straight, it helps if it is really cold....almost frozen.  If you really like the taste of coconut milk you might like this because that is the only thing I can taste in it,
