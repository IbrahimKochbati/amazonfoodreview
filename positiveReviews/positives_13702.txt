I first heard of jaffa cakes while reading the Gold Box forum. I was pleasantly surprised when we opened one box, they are wonderful! These are angelfood type cookies with a thin layer of a tasty marmalade, all covered with a delicious dark chocolate coating. You taste each distinctive flavor all at once. We bought 2 boxes and managed to make them last 4 days (not easy considering how light they are) and tried them with coffee, hot tea and milk. All good but my preference is the hot tea. A great afternoon treat.     The only drawback is that you pay shipping per box and the shipping is higher than the cookies, but still worth it.
