I read about this on a diabetes forum and decided to try it out.  I have a history of gestational diabetes, so when I found out I was pregnant again, I became very interested in lo carb options to control my diabetes through diet.  These are great!  I was warned about the smell, so a quick blanch took care of it.  I did a peanut chili sauce and I loved it.  Am going to buy loads more.          Pros: lo carb, easy to prepare     Cons: texture is definitely more rubbery, not exactly like regular wheat pasta
