Cats are such finicky eaters some times.  My old lady kitty does not like the canned cat foods, but she always went nuts whenever I'd open a can of tuna for myself.  So I gave her some one time.  These Tuna Cups are a great way to keep the tuna fresh enough over a few days, and good for travel.          Same items can be purchased at grocery store, but buying in quantity through Amazon saves some $$.  Thank you
