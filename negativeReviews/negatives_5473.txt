I like the aroma and flavor of coffee but many  ands, particularly the big "S"  and, do a job on my stomach.  I was anxious to try Puroast low acid coffee.  I prepared it in a drip coffeemaker.  I was highly disappointed with the  ewed coffee.  I don't use sugar in my coffee but this definitely needed it.  The taste and aroma were awful.  It has a burnt flavor, even for a French roast and extremely bitter aftertaste.  The aroma was not particularly inviting either.          I wish I still had my PH meter because I would have loved to test the acidity of this coffee vs. regular coffee.  Based on the bitter aftertaste and how it reacted on my stomach, I'd guess it is anything but low acid but I have no scientific means to validate my subjective opinion.  Frankly, even if it is low acid, I can't "stomach" the taste.
