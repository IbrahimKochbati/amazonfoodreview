The names of these juice drinks rarely really reflect the majority of what is actually in them.          Ingredients: 100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry and strawberry juice concentrates), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin c).          I've never heard of acerola and I want to know what the "natural flavors" are.  Anyway, its really mostly apple and grape. Of course, you probably don't want to drink pure kiwi and berry juice, they are just the "flavor".  So, this is a lighter flavored alternative.  I like that the carbonation isn't overdone.  There's just a bit of fizz.  Its sweet, but not horribly.  Its definitely better than soda and I like it better than the other carbonated juice drink that I have tried (other one had too much carbonation).          I get irritated that the nutrition facts are so  ief.  Surely this stuff provides more vitamins and minerals than vitamin C.  Did they kill the vitamins in the manufacturing process or are they just not telling us what is there.  If its there, you'd think the company would want to advertise it.  If it isn't, where did it go?  (BTW I have this gripe about most nutrition labels).          So, its a good drink, probably good for you and definitely better than soda.
