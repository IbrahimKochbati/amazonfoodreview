I ordered this product for my wife who remembered these things from childhood. Originally she wanted some Circus Peanuts, but upon seeing this product, she remembered the enjoyment she had as a child. At any rate, the Brach's Chicks & Rabbits was $9.99 for a 10.5 ounce package. I thought this was a little pricy, and could not easily determine how big of a package this actually was, but bought it anyway.          We got the candy after a few days with Amazon Prime, but when it came, I was thoroughly disappointed. The package (not shipping material, but actual bag of candy) was in battered condition, but not being punctured, we kept it. The candy itself was very stale   and exactly like Circus Peanuts candy (just a different shape color).          In short, go for the $1.00 package of circus peanuts before spending $10 on this. My recommendation is to buy this product for nostalgia, not enjoyment.
