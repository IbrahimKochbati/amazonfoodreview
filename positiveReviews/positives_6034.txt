These English tea biscuits are baked by hand in Ashbourne, Derbyshire by Artisan Biscuits. The cookies are essentially flavored short ead with a very distinct taste of butter, honey, and almonds and an excellent texture at once crumbly and crispy with a nice buttery mouthfeel.          I was fortunate enough to run across them at Jack's $0.99 Store (2 packages for $0.99!) in three flavors:  Honey & Almond, Ginger & Lemon, and Rosehip & Blackcurrant.  They were quite the hit and immediately became the subject of conversation.          The Honey & Almond was universally loved.  A few people thought that the ginger was a bit too strong or else didn't like the floral taste of the rosehips but those were just personal preferences of people generally not fond of those flavors.  In each instance, I thought the flavor combinations  were both well chosen and perfectly balanced.          Overall, you couldn't ask for better quality in a packaged cookie.  I only regret that the Chocolate & Raspberry, Coconut & Lime, and Vanilla & Cream varieties weren't available to try as well.  Very highly recommended.
