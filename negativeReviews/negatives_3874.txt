I really enjoyed the taste of this product. It neither seemed too "berry" or too "kiwi"    it was a nice balance. I would compare this to a strongly flavored carbonated water product. The flavor is clean and crisp, and not overpowering.          The product provides 100% of vitamin C    a definite plus. However, the product has 34g of carbs, 33g of which are sugars. Granted, these are not processed sugars and are only natural sugars from the fruit juices the product contains. However, this results in a product that has 135 calories in an 8.3 ounce can. This results in a poor substitute for soda.          It's an all natural product, and tastes great, but has entirely too many calories for such a small serving.
