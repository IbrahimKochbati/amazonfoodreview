This is a starchy soup rather than the meal portrayed on the outside.  There is very little taste and very little chicken.  It is mostly rice in a weak chicken stock thickened with potato and corn starch.          It is not repulsively bad, if you want a light, convenient snack.          The Chef Boyardee microwavable meals are tastier and more substantial, and also more convenient because you just have to pull off the lid, which comes away easily.  With these Hormel Compleats, you have to pierce the top first, and then peel it off afterwards, which is not so easy, especially as it is hot.
