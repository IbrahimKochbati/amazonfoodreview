I was pretty skeptical that this tea could actually do anything for my "winter stuffies" but I really don't like the idea of over medicating myself with prescriptions and otc drugs either, so I figured I'd give it a shot. Imagine my pleased surprise to find out this tea is both a soothing drinking experience and also...actually works! It has a nice, herby taste and not over licoricey at all (which I feared, not being a fan.) Really nice with a drop of honey. And then, amazingly enough, my nose and lungs feel open and clear for hours after drinking this tea. One cup, and I ran back to my computer to order a subscription!
