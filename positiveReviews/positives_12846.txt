I gave this product the ultimate test, I gave half to my son, who loves sodas and sweet stuff. We both found this a satisfying drink, and one with just the right amount of berry flavor. It is not oversweet, nor does it have that funky aftertaste many "non soda" soda type drinks do. My son gave it his thumbs up and said he would drink it. I liked the flavor combination as well, kiwi and berry, and would buy this product.
