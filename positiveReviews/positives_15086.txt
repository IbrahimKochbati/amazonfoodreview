I have such a love hate relationship with licorice, and I had to try this one, I just had to. Licorice in tea is one of my favorite things of all time, and the Licorice Mint tea from Red Leaf Tea is a must for me when I'm sick. And while I love allsorts, any other licorice candy is not for me. I just think it's vile. Every Easter my mother would gleefully sit by as I sorted out all of the black jelly beans from my basket. She was the only one in the family who liked them. Is there anything more gross than popping what you think is a purple jellybean into your mouth, only to discover it was a horrible, horrible, licorice one? Blegh! But allsorts....mmm. They've become a bit of tradition in our family. They're impossible to find in Tennessee, so when I'm sending a package to my folks I always include Coffee Crisp for my mom and allsorts for my dad. That is, if I can keep myself from eating them all before the package goes out! Trust me, it happens more often than I care to admit.          I kept eyeing this tea, adding it to my shopping cart and then removing it in favor of another flavor of matcha, adding it back to my wishlist. I finally bit the bullet and I'm here to find out if this is an allsort or a black jellybean.          It's not a black jellybean at all! It is a lovely sweet licorice that soothes the throat and makes me unbelievably happy. I was very scared of this blend, but those fears were unfounded. It is delicious and definitely one I need to keep around for when I'm sick but I have to deal with work anyway. Completely lovely. It's not really an allsort either, it's the licorice I've come to know and love in teas. I should have expected that, but I was scared by the picture on the website.          Licorice tends to polarize people. You either love it or you hate it. I'm one of those who loves it, but my wife is one who hates it. If it's in a tea, she can taste it, and it bothers her. But for me...oh, I love it and this matcha is beautiful in the balance of flavor to matcha. I want to make a large mug of this, but I have other matchas to taste and review!
