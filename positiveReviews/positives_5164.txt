My impression of the Switch beverage was good overall.          I was curious to see how good it would be.  After all, its not difficult to add some club soda to your own orange juice for an identical benefit at a lower price.          The taste is fairly good.  It is heavy on the "tangerine" flavor.  Its a bit syrupy, with a high carbonation typical of many European drinks I've had.          The juices that comprise this beverage, in order of quantity, are:     Apple     Grape     Tangerine     Orange     Acerola Cherry          Needless to say, I think it would be difficult to mimic the exact flavor at home, due to the mix of the 5 juices they have.  Overall, you probably will be pleased with the drink.  Certainly, the canned beverage is more convenient than mixing your own, which is impossible if you are on the go.          I will probably be buying more of this product, however, I did not find the flavor to be so compelling that I would recommend it heartily to a friend.
