I hate to just echo everyone else, but these things     really ARE that good. Like a lot of folks, I hadn't     heard of these before Backpacker Magazine     raved about them in April of '09.     I gave 'em a try and was blown away.          Over the years I've found that I find food       on long hikes  less and less appetizing...     especially when the temperature is over 90.     The thought of chewing and swallowing is     not appealing.          Obviously SOME nourishment is still necessary,     but I came to dread PowerBars, and then next, the     tastier bars they spawned. So I switched to gels,     but after awhile, I came to dread those, as well.     But these little chews are delicious  I'll eat them     even when nothing else sounds good.     Between hikes, I keep them out of sight, because     otherwise I'd snack on them at home.     I'm on here now ordering another dozen for a big hike.
