Just purchased this at Safeway for $15.99 per 8.8 oz. can which of course is $31.98 for the two that Amazon is offering here for more than $35.00(too expensive) however for ready ground coffee it is AMAZING.  It actually smells and tastes as if one had just put it through the grinder seconds before it went into the machine.
