I have a tried a few of these Wasa crisp  eads.  This one was by far the worst.  It was in essence entirely flavorless.  It tasted to me the way that I expect that those little packing Styrofoam peanuts would taste.          Don't get me wrong it didn't taste bad, hence the 2 stars, it just didn't taste like anything.  Looking for a low cal snack type cracker?  Try the Wasa Sourdough Rye crackers.  Now those are heavenly!
