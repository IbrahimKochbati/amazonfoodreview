In an effort to save money, I bought this coffee on sale for $3.99 at the grocery store when I was unemployed. I grabbed the container as I drooled over the bags of Starbucks and gourmet varieties also present on the self. Once home I  ewed a pot and to my surprise the aroma was incredible. Finally, I partook of a cup, and was surprised by how delicious it was! It is dark but not bitter. When I was a regular Starbuck's customer, I'd sometimes get a bad cup, with a bitter after taste. Not the case with this stuff. It's smooth. Keep in mind that you do have to add a little more coffee per each cup of water. For example if you usually put one heaping scoop per cup, put one and half per cup, or to suit your taste. Experiment with the measurements, but the coffee itself is quite good.
