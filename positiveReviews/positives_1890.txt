This is my favorite K cup coffee (I've tried about twenty different types) and, so far, everyone I've served it to really likes it a lot. Even the pickiest coffee connoisseur I know thought this k cup made an excellent cup of coffee. Two non coffee drinking friends wish they liked coffee because they love the sound of Caribou Mahogany.
