If you like the taste of water with a hint of coffee, buy this. Otherwise stick with Starbucks VIA.     I use the instant coffee mid way through my day at work. The Taster's Choice requires 3 packs to make a decent 16oz cup of coffee. The Starbucks VIA only needs 1. Spend the extra couple of dollars on the Starbucks if you want good instant coffee.
