I have had the regular Donut House coffee before and enjoyed it, but I had never had the flavored kind.  I was looking for a sampler pack to so my roommate and I could try the flavors as well as get some of the regular stuff.  I don't drink decaf, so I knew that some of this pack would not be used.  I figured that the rest of the cups would make up for the loss on the decaf.  I was wrong.  This "Sampler" pack was a joke.  18 of the cups were decaf, and 15 of them were the standard house  ew.  I got 1 cup of Chocolate Glazed Donut and 1 cup of Cinnamon Roll.  Now, I will not be using most of the K cups in this package because it was, again, MOSTLY DECAF!!!!!  This is what they consider a sample pack:          8 Donut House Regular     9 Donut House Decaf     7 Donut Shop Regular     9 Donut Shop Decaf     1 Donut House Chocolate Glazed Donut     1 Donut House Cinnamon Roll          Some sample.....
