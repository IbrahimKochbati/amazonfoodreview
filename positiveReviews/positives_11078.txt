This is one of the most amazing things in the world for people who suffer from stomach problems.  The name Stomach Ease is really right on the money because it quickly eases stomach discomfort.          The ingredients are a little intimadating for sure!  I'm not a fan of black licorice at all, and that nearly stopped me from buying this.  The taste is interestingly strong, it's not something I had ever tasted before.  The flavor of the tea is like notes in a harmony because you are noticing many different flavors that make a wonderful combined taste.  To say that it quickly grows on you wouldn't be far off from the mark.          It's a wonderful product   that I recommend to anyone with issues with their stomach.  Give it a chance you will not be disappointed!
