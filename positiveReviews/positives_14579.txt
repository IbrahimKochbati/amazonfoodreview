My family loves these chips.  The company seems to care about offering healthy, all natural offerings that use green energy and get the "we support American Rivers" stamp.  These chips are all natural, no trans fat, gluten free, no cholesterol, no msg, chips.  You can eat 15 for 120 calories and they provide 12% of daily fiber.  Sodium is low  only 5% of daily values.  Total fat is 11% of daily values.  There are healthier chips on the market with more fiber or vegetable nutrition, but this one is pretty good.          These are light and crispy and have a cheddary spicy salty taste. Their shape is hexagonal  6 sided.  They're cute chips. They are a good basic chip that is fairly healthy made by a company who appears to care about health and the environment in manufacturing.          This company offers an array of chips  would like to sample some of the other flavors as I'd like this texture in other flavors.  This is a tasty chip to serve at a party or family picnic.
