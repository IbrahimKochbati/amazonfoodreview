I used to think it was the best. Bought it when Amazon was having a one day sale, which made its price pretty much the same as Coffee People Donut Shop (our regular  ew). If we could get this Newman coffee at a matching price always, we would switch to it. It's dark and strong, without being bitter. Love it. (Edit 5 5 2011: I have now decided the Van Houtte Eclipse blend is my #1 favorite.)
