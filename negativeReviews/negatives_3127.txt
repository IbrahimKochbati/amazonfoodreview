We enjoy our morning coffee and, years ago, bought an espresso machine to stop paying so much money over to Starbucks.  Not only do we like coffee, but we know what we like and this isn't it.          Flat bottom drip coffee makers use a medium grind to  ew a perfect cup; while cone filtered drip pots can use a fine grind.  However this coffee is ground, according to the package, extra fine.  This type of grind is typically used in espresso machines, not drip coffee makers.  I have to wonder how much the grind affects the flavor of this coffee.          The flavor is smooth, and non acidic, while at the same time bland and forgetful.  We usually use a tablespoon of grounds per cup.  We tried the two teaspoons, as recommended on the package, which resulted in a weak cup of coffee.  Using our norm, the coffee had more flavor, but wasn't good.          The only good thing about this coffee is using the used grounds in the garden.  I'm seriously thinking of soaking the remaining grounds so I can toss them in the garden.  If you are looking for a true European coffee, try Lavazza or Illy.          PROS:     Used grounds can be used in the garden     Not bitter or acidic          CONS:     Bland & forgetful flavor
