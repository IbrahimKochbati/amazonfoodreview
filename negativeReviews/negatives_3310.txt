My dog seemed to really like these treats, but he's nearly 12 years old (he's a German Shepherd mix), and they were SO hard on his teeth. We usually buy him softer, easier to chew cookies because he's teeth are old. He liked these, but they were hard as rocks so after a while he started turning them down, and I'm pretty sure it was because of the hardness. I could see that he actually had trouble biting down on them.          However, I think if you have a younger dog who can handle the hard as rocks issue, then these would be great. They are definitely all natural, and the ingredients list is very short. They use all natural, organic ingredients, no chemicals, nothing nasty or artificial. They even smell pretty decent. They smell like barley to me, which of course is one of the ingredients.          We are big into feeding our dog natural treats and food with no added preservatives, so we were pleased with that aspect of these treats.
