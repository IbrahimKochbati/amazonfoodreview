I purchased this product from Otto's because the offering via Amazon Prime was out of stock.  Otto's shipped me four plain tubs without Terrafina labels and sealed with a vertical X of clear packing tape rather than Terrafina's vacuum seal where the tub and the cover meet.  I called Otto's within a few days of receipt and they said they buy in bulk from Terrafina and package it themselves.  They said they were out of Terrafina labels!  Two of the tubs developed mold within a few days of my call to Otto's and I had to throw all of them out.  I am now seeking a refund from Amazon.
