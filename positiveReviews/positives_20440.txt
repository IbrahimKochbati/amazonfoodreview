My secret weapon to perform hard work with a great attitude.  Guanine (a caffeine analog) gives a long lasting stimulant boost while theo omine provides the attitude adujstment of chocolate.  A wonderful delight that got me to quit coffee which is jittery, short acting and just pale in comparison.          Guanine is oil based so it's hard to dissolve in water but that allows for slow release in your body.  Be  ave, depending on your body size use a teaspoon to a tablespoon.  If you can consume a tablespoon of coffee you can certainly consume a tbsp of this.          Instead of trying to dissolve into liquid put it in Yogurt or Apple Sauce.  Makes a great low calorie  eakfast that stays with you and reduces hunger.          Truly an amazing product that leaves a six hour silly grin on my face with motivation to clean the garage !
