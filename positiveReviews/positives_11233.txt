I've had some gluten free foods that were terrible, but this is not one of them! These are amazing. My 8 y o daughter has recently been put on a gluten free diet by her doctor for gluten intolerance (testing for Celiac also) and she was upset that she couldn't have "anything worth eating" anymore. I made her these  ownies, and she said they were better than my recipe (which was a wheat based  ownie)! Along with food intolerances she has high functioning autism so she is very picky about textures, gritty food bothers her. I noticed a tiny texture difference from the wheat  ownies but she gobbled them up anyway, they were THAT good. I made the "original" style, and it came out moist, soft, and just gooey enough but not undercooked. I like them better than wheat  ownies, because you can cut these while they're still somewhat hot and they don't crumble! Getting them out of the pan hot is a trick but I only  oke one  ownie doing it. Even my husband, who can have all the gluten he likes, loved them.
