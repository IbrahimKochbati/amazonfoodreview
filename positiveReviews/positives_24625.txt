....and it is not related to the product, so the product itself gets 5 stars. I ordered this because the price was comparable to non organic  ands in my local supermarket. Thrilled, I did 'Subscribe and Save'. I fully expected the expiry to be soon, as is often the case with Amazon, but the stamped date was a flmost 3 years from now, yaayyyyy! It is wonderful pumpkin, and a safer can than most  ands, double yaayyyy! Not one dented can, another surprise. However, now that I set up auto ship, the price zoomed up. That seems to happen a lot. I'll probably cancel if it doesn't go back down a bit when I need more.
