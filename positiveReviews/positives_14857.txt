Reading the label was an experience in its self.  Great information about the location of the tea trees and the culture around their 1600 year existence.  The tea leaves are appealing to the eye and the hand.  The aroma of the bergamot is strong yet light with a apple, citrus blend that feels like it would be good in any season of the year.  The Earl Grey tea when  ewed is quite nice with good strong flavor and the aroma of the bergamot remains for us to enjoy a little longer.  Since bergamot oils have been used to help with stuffy noses and other medicinal purposes, this will work well in Southern California in the Spring and Fall with the Santa Ana Winds that cause so much havoc with our sinuses.  Then, again, in the Winter with flu and colds.     The tin has two lids to help keep the freshness in.  The inner lid seems to have more that one job; first is to help you not spill the loose tea everywhere when opening the outside lid.  Then it looks like it might be a measuring cup for use of a 11 ounce mug.  So I tried it and it seemed just right or slightly stronger than I'd like but drank it anyway and felt rejuvenated each afternoon.     I have thoroughly enjoyed the bold and smooth flavor of this tea and will look forward to trying other blends in the Rishi Tea line of products.
