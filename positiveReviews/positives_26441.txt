My Chesapeake Bay retriever was only 18 months old but had very bad tarter build up. We tried everything   chew toys, greenies, cow hooves, denti sticks. Nothing worked or was so expensive I wouldn't buy enough to see if they were effective. One of the vet techs at my vet's office suggested these. We give Curly one each night. It doesn't take him long to chew them enough to swallow it. Three months of eating them have made a huge difference in his teeth. I am not big on  ushing dog teeth so I'm glad these work.
