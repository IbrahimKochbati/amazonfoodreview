I love Chia Seeds. I got the info from watching Dr. Oz, and thought I would try them in an attempt to eat healthier. I love them in just about everything. I use them in my oatmeal, and my fruit salad at lunch time. I'm much fuller after using Chia Seeds and also have more energy. Bottom line is I remain feeling full much longer. I also have better bowel movements..important with the medications I've been on for 15yrs. It could be "all in my mind," but I feel better since starting the Chia Seeds...I'd be a great commercial for these folks! Now I just need to get them in a bigger size! : )
