I ordered these last month. Of the first six I've tried, five have blown open and spewed coffee grounds all over our machine (as well as in the cup). I'm getting rather tired of cleaning the Keurig. Normally, I buy our K cups at local department store but buying in bulk here at Amazon was less expensive. Amazon has graciously replaced the first lot and I was told if this second lot has the same problems, to call them back and they will need to look at pulling the lot. After looking back at the reviews for this product, I think that would be a wise move considering many of us are having the same problem. Thankfully, Amazon's customer service is 5 star so I haven't lost my money.
