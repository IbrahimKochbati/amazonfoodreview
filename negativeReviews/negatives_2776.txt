Ordered this on the advice of the Single Serve Coffee forum.          CONS:          Drawer is metal mesh on metal mesh, so it doesn't slide smoothly.  It's pretty clunky to pull open and even harder to close.     It doesn't pull out far enough to reach the back of the drawer, so you have to tip the final K Cup out, which is hard if you have an entire coffee maker on top.     Again, all mesh, so the cups don't sit smoothly in the tray, and the sections are a hair too narrow so the cups  ush one another awkwardly.     My upper cabinets are raised higher than average because we are both tall, and this still didn't leave us enough room to open the maker while on the drawer.          PROS:          For our modern kitchen, it's nice to look at.     It comfortable fits my Capresso FrothPro on one side and two 64oz Ghirardelli bottles (front to back) on the other so it still saves us counter space.     When I tried my Keurig on it, I expected some buckling but it seemed to stand firm even with a full water tank.          All in all, for $25 it's a lot nicer to look at than the spinning barrel style holders, and I don't need my coffee to be on display.  Plus it looks easy to clean which for me is a plus.
