The Best On The Market          I was looking for a several good Ice cube Tray ,  in order to freeze what i need for making Excellent Iced Coffee In Granita Style !          I have search and search on amazon and there are so many...          AND THIS ONE'S ARE THE BEST          And why ?          Because it made from Silicone , it very easy to pull out the cubes , it does not receive odor as it has cover , it will never  ake and it will lass for many years of use , it is much more comfortable then any other ice cube tray , and it is EXCELLENT for freeze stuff for Blender use .          So for example:     You purchase a special powder coffee which the coffee company's sale for Iced Coffee (it comes in a pack of 1 Kg) , and if you want to make it in a blander carafe of 1.5 Liter  , then you take 250 grams of this special coffee powder and you mix it with around 50 ml of worm water.     You freeze apart 1.4  Liter of milk in this Trays , and you also freeze around 50 ml fresh espresso , and then you put all in the blender and blend it.     Viola   you have Iced Coffee same as in the restaurant without the need to use granita machine which cost $2000.00 USD     You can add Kalua Liqueur or Irish Cream Liqueur to the blender mix if you like.          AS for the Coffee Powder:     You have to contact one of the Coffee Company's like Segafredo Coffee , Or Lavazza Coffee Or illy Coffee , and all of them sale's powder coffee for Iced Coffee for Granita Machine.     So you purchase it from them , and you use it in your blender in the way i described here above.          Thanks
