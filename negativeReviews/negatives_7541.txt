I ordered a bag of these chews for Extra Large dogs, I kid you not!!! The first chew I take out is about 3 inches long 1 2 inch wide and paper thin. It looked like a piece of bacon that had been dried up. Less than 1 2 of the bag were actually large chews and only 29 were inside. This company obviously thinks of their customers as idiots!!!FALSE advertisement lawsuit cerntainly is warranted in this case. They are getting rich and ripping YOU ALL OFF at the same time. DO NOT PUT UP WITH THIS BS, SEND BACK THE BAG LIKE I DID. Every one of your dollars is good so why should all their product not be good as well? Again, do not let them rip you off! I hope the lawyer that sued Innova dog food gets a wind of this!!!!
