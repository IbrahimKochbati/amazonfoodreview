I LOVE this tea. It is, hands down, my favorite.  And the ingredients are very "clean" and it's low calorie  especially compared to other teas out there.  This is the real deal.  It's basically like making it at home.          It's SO yummy!  Light, refreshing.  I could drink it all day, by the gallon.  :)
