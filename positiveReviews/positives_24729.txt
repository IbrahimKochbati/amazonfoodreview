I wanted this tea for the detoxification properties but was wary of what the taste would be like. I really despise licorice and was concerned that this may be overly strong due to all the herbs. This is a very sweet, very balanced and smooth tea. I'm not crazy about the taste but I can drink it every day with ease. The licorice is more of a sweetness than it is a flavor. It starts out a little peppery and is backed by strong sweetness and light floral notes. It tastes better warm than cold.
