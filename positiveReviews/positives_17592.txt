The reason I'm not sure of the other reported benefits claims is that I do not suffer from gastro issues related to coffee   other than the first cup assisting in getting things moving in the AM.  I happen to like bold, bitter, and even light coffees   all depending on my mood.          Having siad that, this coffee is delicious even for those who don't need the claimed beenfits.  I am drinking it as I type this, and my wife is about to try her first cup.  She's more sensitive to because she has reflux and heartburn.  According to her, she couldn't notice the differences yet.  But she also reported that it was smooth and mellow, and went down very easily.
