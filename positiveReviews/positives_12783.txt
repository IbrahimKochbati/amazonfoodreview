These do not last long at all around here!! The kids and I absolutely love these and the price is unbeatable from what I've seen! The local store charges about $3 for the smaller bags, and that's EACH! So glad I was able to find the 12 pack here on Amazon!     I don't feel near as guilty snacking on these compared to Dorito's or any other 'chip' and even feel less guilty about the kids eating them too! Absolutely YUM!
