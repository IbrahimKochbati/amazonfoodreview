These are a little treat from heaven. I discovered these Pocket Coffees while traveling Italy last year and cannot say enough about how good they are. A nice liquid coffee center, surrounded by wonderful dark chocolate. I haven't been without these in my pantry since. I give them as gifts to anyone I know that loves good chocolate and good coffee. Ciao!
