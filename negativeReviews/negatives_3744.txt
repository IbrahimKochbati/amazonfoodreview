Seems like the Keurig systems lend themselves to dark roasts   however, the near burnt flavor element never worked for me. I was excited to try out this light roast (enough for 48 packs of 'trial')   and indeed I loved the flavor if you stick to the small 6 oz cup size. The coffee gets too weak and watery at any of my regular sizes (middle or right but one button on the B70)   this is a coffee that could do with an 'extra bold' rating to up the quantity of coffee in the cup.     My current alternative for this is Green Mountain's 'Our Blend'   which does seem to have got it right!
