I'm a self proclaimed connoisseur of beef jerky, I have probably eaten a wheelbarrow full of different  ands. This "Wild Ride" is the toughest cut I have ever come across. You have to chew, chew, chew, and chew! Couple pieces and your jaw is too sore to complain much. No date on the bag, contacted manufacturer by email, thought maybe I got some old stock...no reply. Great taste, but too tough!
