The first test for a new canned cat food is the ingredient list.  The ingredients in Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (chicken flavors) passed this test with flying colors: Chicken, Chicken Broth, Carrots are listed first and there is no wheat gluten. Unfortntately, the 2nd test is whether my cat will eat the food and this ended up with a big thumbs down. Not sure if it was the significant amount of  oth in a serving or the fact that it is chicken (he usually has fish based canned food), but after a 1st bite, he just walked away.          If a cat is accustomed to eating chicken canned food, I would still recommend giving this a try because of the quality ingredients.
