My 10 year old cocker  iel has been treated for chronic ear and paw yeast infections for the past 9 years.  He's had chronic, stinky black gunk in his ears and a black waxy substance covering his toes.  I would guess that I've spent thousands of dollars on vet visits, tests, shampoos, ear medications, wipes, antibiotics   you name it   none of which worked for more than a week.  My vet even tried a "new" process where the dog's ears were filled with some type of medication every week (at the vets   $50 a week) for a couple of months   but there was no improvement.  My poor dog has scratched himself raw and spent much of his day licking and digging at his yeast encrusted paws or scratching his sore, smelly ears.  Recently, I've been bathing him every 2 days with Malaseb Shampoo (which did seem to help), but he had to stand for 15 minutes with the shampoo covering him, before the medication could be rinsed from his skin.  Poor little dog.          While on a trip to Florida, I took my  iel to a new vet who prescribed more ear drops, wipes, and shampoo in an attempt to help my dog.  The vet  asked me if I'd ever tried changing his food from Eukanuba, which he's been on since he was a puppy.  No vet had ever mentioned that my dog could be allergic to his food and it seemed so simple.  I found Natural Balance Sweet Potato & Venison at Petco and thought I'd try a food trial.  What a difference!  In the two weeks since he's been on this dog food his yeast infection appears to be gone.  His ears are clear, with no discharge or irritation and the skin on his paws is starting to look pink and healthy.  I can't believe the difference in such a short time!  He's not scratching, either.  The Florida vet had said that a food trial would require at least 2 months, but I'm seeing such an improvement in only 2 weeks.  Pretty amazing!
