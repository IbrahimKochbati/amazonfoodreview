this is perfect for babies and toddlers on the go! we started using the baby version when my daughter was an infant  it is so easy to throw a pouch and a baby spoon into the diaper bag. now that my daughter is older, she is able to feed herself with the pouch. just give your toddler the pouch and they will squeeze suck the fruit out of it. not only is the packaging great, but the fruit tastes good as well (and yes, I have tasted everything that I feed my daughter). my daughter loves this  her whole face lights up when I hand her a pouch.
