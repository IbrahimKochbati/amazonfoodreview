Linguine style white rice noodles are hard to find. You usually get those skinny angel hair type noodles. Thai Kitchen linguine style noodles is the only product I have found that gives you the satisfying mouth feel of linguine with the lightness and gluten free pleasure of a rice pasta. Using the easy box directions for cooking (soaking, really) the noodles, you can make any number of great cold or warm salads with these noodles. I like adding chopped green onions, sesame and peanut oil, hot chili oil, sesame seeds, cilantro, lime juice and anything else you like such as water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, chopped nuts, whatever. I love these noodles and wish they were more available in smaller quantities in more places.
