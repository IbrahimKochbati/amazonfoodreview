I tried these along with my girlfriend and 2 kids. No one was that excited about them. They're kind of bland, dry and really were just a bunch of pieces in a bag. You can pick up the pieces with your fingers, use a spoon or just poor the contents of the bag directly into your mouth. Not really my idea of a "cookie experience", AND they didn't even taste like oatmeal. I'll pass on these. If I'm going to get fat(er) I'm going to have fun doing it and these are not fun.
