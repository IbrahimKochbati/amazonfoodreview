I don't recommend drinking this tea quickly, or while on medication. I was on antibiotics and a decongestant and was starting to feel better.  Then, when I drank this tea (one cup in 30 minutes), I felt worse and nauseated.  I don't know if it's the tea itself, or a reaction with the other things in my body, but I'm going to steer clear of this tea.
