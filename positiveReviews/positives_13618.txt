If you're accustomed to a typical American diet of sugar and salt and grease, you're first impression might be that these rice cakes taste like packing peanuts. And that might be your second impression, too.          However, once you put a few miles between yourself and the typical "goo and glue" diet, you may grow to like these rice cakes. The caramel flavor is my favorite, but the apple cinnamon isn't too bad either. They're good snacks and they're fairly healthy and they're good for your body and digestive system.          To my horror, I see that they're sweetened with high fructose corn syrup which is mighty disappointing. I'd think that the demographic type that's interested in eating rice cakes is also going to be the demographic type that's sophisticated enough to read labels and sophisticated enough to know that HFCS is a dirty word and an unhealthy sweetener.          I wish these mega monster corporations would go back to SUGAR and just add the 1 10th of a penny cost to the retail price. It'd be worth it to me and others, who struggle to keep their weight "normal."
