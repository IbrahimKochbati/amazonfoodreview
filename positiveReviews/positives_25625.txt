I get a bag of the tea sent to me monthly by Amazon.  It is high quality tea, very easy to cut using a food processor, and easy to  ew using a coffee maker.  I started using hibiscus tea due to its properties of lowering blood pressure.  I drink it with honey and a little lemon juice.  The taste is wonderful.
