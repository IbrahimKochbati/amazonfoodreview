Sara has been a user for most of her adult life(seven years). Her meals are not complete until she has her chewie. We have been happy with her contentment until recently when the quality of the product deteriorated. The length of each item seems smaller than before and many in each bag are sorry looking pieces that, as a QC inspector, I would have rejected. We buy by pieces so it is also a matter of getting what we pay for.          Hope this reaches the manufacturer and it makes changes. It is unfortunate that a good product is allowed to go downhill.          Good news is that Sara has NEVER had cause for any dental treatment.

There are others     out there selling for less but how does the price rise that much in a few weeks?
