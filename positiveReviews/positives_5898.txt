I have been drinking this powdered goat milk for years! It is the best no after taste with all the immune boosting benefits! I have an 8mos. Old and plan to feed him this starting on his first birthday, I cannot wait! My husband grew up on goat milk and has the best immunity! This is so easy to digest within 20 minutes vs. cow milk which takes more than 24 hrs.!          Above all it tastes so DELISH!!!!! YUMMMY!          amazon truly has unbelievable price! luv my Amazon:)
