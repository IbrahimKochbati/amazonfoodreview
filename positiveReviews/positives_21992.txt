Need a LOT of chive rings? This is your ticket.  Good quality, good taste, good color, good price.          Keep in mind that this is a LOT of chive rings. You might be thinking "oh two ounces? that's not that much..." but it is. We've been using out of this jar for a couple months and it barely looks like we've touched it.
