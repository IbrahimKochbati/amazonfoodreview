I do love PopChips. They work well with weight watchers, taste great and the crunch can't be beat. This pack has many flavors, with the salt and vinegar being my favorite, my husband loves the salt and pepper and my kids like original and cheddar.          The one I miss is Sweet Potato. It is by far my favorite of the whole lot of flavors, but aren't included in this variety pack.
