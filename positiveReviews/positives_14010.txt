This product is awesome if you love the taste of peanut butter but don't love the fat and calories.  I put a tablespoon of the powder into my chocolate or vanilla protein shake sometimes for a nice, peanut buttery twist. The only drawback is the expense.  You can actually purchase this item from LINDA'S DIET DELITES website directly (along with other low carb and low cal foods).
