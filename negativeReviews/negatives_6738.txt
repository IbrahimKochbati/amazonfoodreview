I bought these at a specialty store before ordering them from amazon.  They did not contain milk at that time.  I loved them, and decided to order a case.  Milk, as of the writing of this review, is still not listed as an ingredient on this website.  There are stickers over the ingredients, which include milk powder.  I called the company and was told the recipe had changed.  They were very nice and offered a refund.  Unfortunately, we opened one and ate some before I noticed the sticker.          Even if you don't mind the milk, please be aware that they will arrive in crushed bits, not in wafer rolls.
