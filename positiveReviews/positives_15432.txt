For those of you who read Barbery's beautiful short novel, Gourmet Rhapsody, this is the special ingredient to making Chouquette, the McGuffin to the book.  When you bake with it, it mobilizes in the oven to create wondrous pockets of sweet perfection.          Do not be fooled by the stuff in the stores, those shiny waxy balls of carnuba called sugar pearls.  OK for decoration, they will not work for baking.  If you do a lot of baking, the 4 pack is a better buy because of the shipping cost.
