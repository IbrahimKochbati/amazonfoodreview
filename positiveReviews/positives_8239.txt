So, somehow Diamond captured the perfect flavor of french toast without all the calories. Such a great flavor, after tasting only a few for the first time I immediately orderd three more. These don't even have that "Almond" aftertaste, it finishes very nice with a hint of a butter maple flavor...wow.          Now: To Diamond please rename to "Buttery French Toast", as this would be much better fitting.
