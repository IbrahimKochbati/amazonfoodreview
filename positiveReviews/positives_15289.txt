I ordered this lovely machine for myself for Christmas after getting very tired of endless teabags sitting in cups all over my house. I thought, wow, wouldn't it be great to have a wonderful, strong cup of tea without fishing out tea bags all the time, and getting some strong, some weak cups of tea? With the Keurig, I have perfect hot tea, herbal and black and green, on demand and at a perfect, strong strength.          I have to admit, I knew Keurig did great coffee, but tea? I thought that, normally having to  ew longer, tea might not be all that great in this kind of machine. I was happily proven wrong.          One trick to getting the most out of your tea K cup? It won't tell you this in the directions, but each cup fill up is triggered by lifting the handle up and then down. So, I pop my tea cup in there, get the first large, strong cup, then I lift the handle (same cup in there) and lower it, then press the smaller cup and fill up my mug more. And I even tried getting another cup out of the same K cup! Tea seems to go really far.          For coffee, I tried one large then one small out of the same K cup. Works great and I get a larger amount for my giant latte sized mugs.          I can also make a great, fast cup of low cal hot chocolate by popping my powdered mix into the mug, leaving out a K cup, and just using the machine to put out hot water on demand. Sure beats having to mess with a microwave or traditional teapot.          I also got the EKO ew manually refillable K cup, so I can use loose tea and coffee when I want.          The machine itself it quick to warm up, heat the water, and stay in the ready mode. I know people who leave their "power" button on 24 7, but I think this might wear the machine out faster, plus waste electricity. I turn mine off when I'm done because it really doesn't take but a few seconds to get the water hot and ready to go again.          This particular model is fairly large on the counter due to the generous water reservoir, so allow some room for its depth. Fits great under the standard height cupboard space due to the smart handle design not needing much vertical room to open up.          Noise includes normal water heating and filling sounds, so nothing surprising there.          All in all, a great, convenient, time saving machine.
