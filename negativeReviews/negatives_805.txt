I read all the reviews on every hot chocolate k cup on the market and decided to try this one first. Its not good. Even on the smallest cup setting it tastes watered down and there is a distinct "plasticy" taste. I think that this an inherent problem with all the k cup hot chocolates. You just can't fit enough chocolate in the cup so that it doesn't taste watered down. I'm going to stick with making hot chocolate the old way.
