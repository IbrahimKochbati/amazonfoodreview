I love this product as a way to get protein into vegans.  But...is the plastic that holds the product BPA free?  I called the manufacturer, and he said that he thought that it was.  I asked him for verification of this fact, because I give it to my kids.  He also mentioned that it is put in the plastic while hot, which is of concern to me, because bpa leaches into food when it is hot.  Love love love this product with this one caveat.  Please verify, Primal Spirit!
