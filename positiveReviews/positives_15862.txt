We recently started eating more healthy in our household. We switched to pasture raised chickens and eggs with no antibiotics, no corn feed, no hormones. We also switched to pasture raised beef and hogs. Once again, no hormones, no antibiotics, and no corn feed. What a difference in ease of weight control. Not to mention a lot healthier all the way around. So, it did not take us long to decide to provide a better dog food for our two blue ticked beagles. Since we can not insure that the beef or chickens used in dog food are of the same quality as what we eat, salmon and potatoes are a better choice. Our female has lost 5 pounds from a hefty 40 lbs to 35lbs and has leveled out beautifully. The male has lost 8 pounds and has also leveled out to the vets praise. She was impressed with their progress at 9 years old. My geriatric children love the taste and no longer hesitate around the food bowl. The internet is a wonderful thing and I am so glad we found Premium Edge. It is a high quality dry dog food that is reasonably priced. You can pay more, but you return on investment will be marginal. We have started topping it off with Dogswell canned dog food just to add an extra bit of flavor and our dogs have never been happier.
