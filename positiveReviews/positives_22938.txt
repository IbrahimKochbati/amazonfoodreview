Our local supermarket stopped carrying this variety of cereal. Glad Amazon has them on the subscribe program. They're not only available when I need them, but they are significantly less costly than when purchased at the store.          I always wait too long to reorder   I use them up before the next shipment is due   but Amazon respoonds quickly and within a week my stock is replenished. I have become a big fan of subscribe and save!
