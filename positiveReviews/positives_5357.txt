The DisposaKups work as advertised.  They are easy to use, just put your favorite coffee in the cup, pop the cap on and  ew.  This allows me to save quite a bit of money while using my favorite coffee.  I filled about 25 of them at one time so there is always one standing by when I am desperate for a cup.  There is no need to wash out a filter, just toss it in the trash like the store bought K cups.  They also make a good backup system if you run out of the store bought k kups.     I would be interested to know if the company uses, or plans to use, recycled plastic or plastic alternatives in the manufacturing of these.
