My husband has a hiatus hernia and must be very careful about drinking coffee and eating other acidic foods.  I was delighted to find out about this product.  We have a Keurig coffee maker and the replaceable reusable inserts.  I  ewed us each a cup of this coffee and thoroughly enjoyed both the aroma and taste.  We both drink our coffee black, no sugar, so we really can appreciate the full flavor of the beverage.  Puroast is French Roast, which is a very dark deep roasted coffee bean, without bitterness or a funky aftertaste.
