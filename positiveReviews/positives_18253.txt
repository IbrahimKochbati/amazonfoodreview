Believe it or not, I don't really like chips, I don't dislike them, but if I see them at a party, I usually won't have any, I prefer pretzels.  I thought that I would give these a try anyways.  They are really good.  Very light, not greasy at all.  I don't like sweet potatoes, but I like the flavor in these chips.  I would encourage all of you and my friends to give them a try.  You'll like em.
