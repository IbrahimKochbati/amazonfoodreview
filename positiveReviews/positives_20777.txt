I LOVE this seasoning mix!  I use it for a marinade for flanken ribs; or kal bi  korean short ribs.  I also use it for a marinade on He ew National hot dogs (sliced on two sides), and carne asada meat (teriaki style).  Everybody loves the hot doga with steamed rice.  Being from Hawaii, we barbecue a lot!  You just mix this according to instructions in a plastic ziplock bag, place your meat inside, seal and let sit for about 24 hrs (just do it the night before).  I promise...you won't be dissappointed!
