This is my favorite waffle mix (it can be used to make pancakes too, but you have to add milk, and we don't usually have milk in the house).  You have to add water, 1 egg, and melted butter for the waffle recipe.  We eat waffles about once a week.          Apart from the fact that it tastes great (it has a little vanilla and malt mixed in), it has NO trans fat.  Some pancake waffle mixes, such as Krustead's which also tastes really good, say they have no trans fat PER SERVING, but if it has partially hydrogenated vegetable oil in the ingredients, there is still some (less than than 1 percent) trans fat per serving.  Stonewall has none.          We used to have a store that sold it locally, but now we don't so I am glad we can get it online.          The can comes with a recipe that is perfect for making two belgian waffles with no leftover batter.          We just bought the regular mix but we are going to try the other flavors next.
