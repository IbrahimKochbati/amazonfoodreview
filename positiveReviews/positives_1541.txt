I bought this as my first pack of K cups, its definitely a good buy! Assortments are always a little more expensive, this one is very well priced. you get 6 of each and one of them only has 5, thank god they picked decaf for the small one! Great coffee, if I hadn't discovered club keurig I would still be buying these!
