Small little bonsai. Arrived tightly package, but foliage was a little dry. Nothing a good misting couldnt fix. Only 3 or 4 inches tall but nicely shaped   looks as though it was trained with wire. I understand why some people have described it as a "twig" but Im not sure what they expected for $9??? This is my first bonsai, and I can already tell you it isnt a houseplant or even an outdoor plant. Its a lot close to a pet. You need to check in on it at least once a day. Other things Ive learned: To water it, use a mister bottle and saturate the foliage until it "rains" on the soil enough to water it. DO NOT put in direct sunlight when the foliage is wet. Also, it likes direct sunlight in the morning hours, but not during midday. I keep mine where it receives direct sunlight until about 1130am. I also move it when I come home from work to get the late afternoon sun. Probably in the winter it can handle longer exposure to the direct sunlight.
