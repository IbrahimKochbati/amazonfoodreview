I don't understand why Pamela's has to over compensate by using so much sweetener in their  ead mix.  If I wanted a sweet  ead I would add my own sugar!  This is not a  ead to have eggs and ham with.  It taste more like a dessert.  There are better  ands of gluten free  ead mix out there. Don't waste your money on this one.
