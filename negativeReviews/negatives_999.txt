...this mix does have that grainy texture found with a lot of rice based gluten free mixes. The mix works well when the directions are followed and it is fairly versatile.          I will use the mix I have, but I'm not sure if this will be a staple in my pantry. I'm not finding myself reaching for it on a regular basis, which is usually a sign that this isn't a hit in my household.
