We have been looking for a good chocolate sandwich cookie since Hydrox are no longer being made or sold, and Famous Amos fits the bill.  Much better than Oreos or other types, it is sweet, the chocolate is distinct and the filling is not too sweet as if it is made of only sugar.  The Amazon price is the best, subscribe and save is new and  ings the price down to an irresistible buy, which is even more special since these cookies are not always at the grocery
