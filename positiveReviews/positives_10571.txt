Being a long time fan of the piggy skins, and having tried a "microwave bag" version of u cook em rinds, I wanted to try something that wasn't drowning in packaging. And I'm happy with these tasty nuggets. I find in my fairly powerful microwave that i have to run a small plate of the condensed pieces (as they're shipped) for at least 1:45 (package says try 90 seconds to start) and I don't think it's my imagination that after these are taken out of the nuke chamber, they start to contract a bit.     But, when you consider that you can get a fresh, hot plate of puffy rinds in very short order, these are well worth the price. Of course you can get a trash bag full of rinds at warehouse stores and other venues for a couple few bucks but for fresh eating at home, the only thing I'd compare these to is fryin' up a batch and these are hugely more convenient.     On a 10 point scale, I'd give these a 7 but on the Zon's 5 star system, I have to go with 4.
