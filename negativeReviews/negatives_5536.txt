I received a pack of this mix to try.  While I found the cooking time accurate, there was a flavor disappointment.  The chops came out very juicy, which was great.  I guess my biggest gripe is that the flavoring seemed so subtle because there wasn't enough on each chop.  I think the package amount should either increase, or the number of pork chops should be reduced to about four per package.  It seemed to me that the flavor was good when I scraped it together, but it definitely was too thin on each piece when the directions were followed.
