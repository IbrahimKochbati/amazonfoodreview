I purchased this pumpkin flax granola from amazon and could not be happier.  I actually take it dry everywhere i go.     It makes an excellent snack,  i am anxious to try all the granola's now.  The omega's are high,  what better way to get them and it doesn't take much to satisfy a sweet tooth either.  The granola has just enough sweetness to satisfy any cravings, and is healthy too,  a win win.
