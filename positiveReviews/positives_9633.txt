Our 2 year old son is affected by Celiac disease and since his diagnosis we have had a difficult time finding snacks that are easy to take out on a play date or to a park.  The "Glutino Apple Cinnamon Rings" serve that purpose very well for us and he LOVES them.  They don't taste like your typical cereal that contains flour   of course they don't.  But for someone who is on a gluten free diet and is accustomed to way the way that processed gluten free food tastes, these are a great, quick snack.
