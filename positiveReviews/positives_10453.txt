The  eeder started our puppy on a mix of this canned Natural Balance Duck and Potato Formula with the "small bites" kibble of the same  and, and he (and the whole litter) really loves it. Ultimately he transitioned to just the kibble with this canned food as a treat. His digestion seems to be very regular and healthy on this food. I highly recommend it.
