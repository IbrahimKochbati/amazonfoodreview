I've been giving my dogs Greenies for years now.  Their excitement at receiving this treat never abates.  As expensive as they are, I feel my animals are well worth it.  This is doggie health food at its finest.  And the price here on Amazon is the best I've found to date.  However, I am completely disgusted with the packaging of this product.  The huge box is wasteful and not at all environmentally sound.  Come on Greenies people   put the product in a pouch and call it a day.
