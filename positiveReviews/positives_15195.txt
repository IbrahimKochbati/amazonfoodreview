I love the happy baby and similar  ands of organic baby food in pouches, but they have one MAJOR downfall in my eyes  most of the blends are SUPER SWEET. It's difficult to find many pouches with just vegetables, and no super sweet fruits mixed in. I hate the idea of teaching my child that everything MUST taste sweet (spinach,  occoli, peas, etc  they're always mixed with mango, pear, apple, etc  they always just taste like fruit.) I LOVE that he Amaranth Ratatouilli is not sweet at all  it actually tastes like vegetables!! My child loves it. We frequently mix it into other things  pasta, rice, etc. It's great topped with cheese. One bit of warning though  this blend seems pretty acidic, so babies with sensative tummies might have trouble  I would just mix it in smaller portions with pasta or something else.
