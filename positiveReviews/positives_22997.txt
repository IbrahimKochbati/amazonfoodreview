I have to admit, I am an Olive Oil snob. I cook alot and extra virgin is most generally my choice. Now most of you know, that oils and vinegers run the gamit as far as price is concerned. The better the quality....the more you pay. For a passionate cook who also watches the budget, this olive oil fits the bill. Great quality at a good price. Nothing beats the smoking point like olive oil as far as my cooking goes. I keep several kinds of oil in my pantry and they all do different things, so do not assume that all oils are the same or deliver the same performance. Read up on their "specialties" for good quality results. I have this oil on auto delivery and it is just about gone when I receive my next order!
