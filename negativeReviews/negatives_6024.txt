I was looking for alternative healthy protein snack with less fat than slim  jims. Texas BBQ sounded like an awesome flavor   so I bought them. For those of you who have never tried them....pick up a rubber band, baste it in bbq sauce and then eat. That is what this soy protein jerky taste like...a bbq flavored rubber band. The only way I will ever eat these again is if the world no longer has any other protein choice available.
