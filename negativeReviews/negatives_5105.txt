Despite several washings, I can not get rid of the industrial plastic smell on the soft rubber parts of this toy, and our dog (lab mix) has absolutley no interest in it, despite favorite treats inside. I can only assume she finds the smell offensive repellant.          If she does ever take an interest in it (I keep trying), I will keep a close eye on the rubber "rope"  seems like something she may chew through fairly quickly.
