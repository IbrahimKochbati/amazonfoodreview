We have three 100lb chocolate labs. They range in age from 2 years to 10 years. Although we give them rawhide regularly, their teeth are still funky. We just went through our first bag of these chews, and the teeth on all three dogs have improved. We like them so much that I just ordered another three bags.          Regarding the choking hazard, all dogs need to chew, so you need to give them things so they can. Some dogs attempt to swallow pieces that are too large, and so they gag. As a dog owner, you MUST monitor your dog while it's chewing. Even dogs that gag usually learn after the first couple of times, so they don't gag again. But you still need to monitor your dog while they're chewing. This goes for anything they chew, not just these.
