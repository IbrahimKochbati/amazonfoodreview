This product (I think) is better than the "fake" maple syrups (check their labels  most contain NO MAPLE SYRUP AT ALL!) The difference in calories is absolutely amazing (the  and with the rustic wintery retreat pictured on the label has 200 calories per serving and the agave 60!) I can pronounce and spell both ingredients in the agave    can't do that for the "fake" stuff!! The first time I tried it I just served it heated in a pitcher  the way I usually serve syrup  the kids & grandson loved it & thought I had found the "Perfect Brand!!" I think I have!  I couldn't remember where I bought it  spent weeks looking then found it at Amazon.com!!  No  ainer  ordered a case & shared!     "
