This is a true convenience food   all you need to add is water and wait a few minutes.  There are a couple of options: add cold water and microwave for three minutes, or boil water, and then wait 3 minutes.  I chose the latter because I didn't like the idea of putting the plastic bowl in the microwave.  After three minutes it was ready   very easy.          The flavor is "spicy chicken".  Be aware that this is "spicy" in the sense that if all you are used to is ketchup, you might notice a tiny bite to this.  If you are used to truly spicy food.....this isn't spicy at all.  I could barely tell there was anything at all that is spicy to the flavoring.          One thing I did add to round it out is an egg   it made it sort of like egg drop soup and added a little nutrition to the meal.  It would be fine without this addition but was extra delicious with it.
