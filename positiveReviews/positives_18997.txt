I bought these on an impulse, then ignored them in my kitchen cupboard for over a month.  When I got around to eating one, I found it difficult to stop.  They are really that good.  Just a little bit tart and not too sweet... with a rich pomegranate flavor.  I carry them in my purse and car, and when I get an urge for something sweet, I pop one in my mouth.  Okay, they're not as satisfying as a Dove bar, but an entire package contains fewer calories.
