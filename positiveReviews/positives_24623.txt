I LOVE Amazon.com for many items, but if you aren't happy with the delivery or damaged items as I am reading here, go to your local health food store. This or similar is likely available. Many will order it you by the case if you ask them. Good luck. My dogs always have a tablespoon of pumpkin with their meals too :)
