This Switch Kiwi Berry ought to be on the DEA's list of banned substances it is so good.  Every one of the 8.3 ounces had me smacking my lips trying to make it last longer.  A natural sweetness and ice cold out of my refrigerator was the way I tasted it the first (and sadly only) time.          I just wish a grocer in West Virginia would start carrying it. C'mon Wal Mart and or Food Lion.  Get some of this stuff!
