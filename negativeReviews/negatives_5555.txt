I found the tea to be too spicy for me; I was also confused that the label said "contains caffeine". I actually emailed Davidson's tea which said I would get a reply in 24 hours. I never heard back from them as to whether the tea had caffeine or not.  So beware if you want Decaf as this is confusing.  I had hoped for a peach tea with a hint of spice, while this is so spicy, you can smell the spice thru the plastic bag in the closed box.  I did use one bag with several regular decaf bags for iced tea and liked that.
