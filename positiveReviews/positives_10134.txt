I first discovered these while searching through some Hungry Girl recipes. I simply dump the bag into a colander and rinse well, removing all of the water that the noodles were packed in. Then I blot them dry and throw them on a microwaveable plate and microwave for 1 minute. I again blot all the excess water and microwave for one more minute. That way the noodles are cooked, the "weird odor" is completely gone, and the noodles are similar to al dente. I just dump whatever my sauce concoction I made for the noodles over it and toss! If it seems time consuming with the microwave  think about waiting 12 14 minutes for pasta to boil  not to mention time for the water to come to a boil ;).          I would buy these noodles in a HEARTBEAT on here, but that's just highway robbery to pay 10$ in shipping!! I'm going to give Miracle Noodles a try because I can't afford to pay 28$ for a few bags of noodles and they have free shipping. C'mon House Foods!! 10$?
