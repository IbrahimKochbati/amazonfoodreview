Have always enjoyed Balsen products. Found  the nuss dessert cookies while on vacation at Sanibel Island Florida. We were really excited to find them on Amazon, we had searched through out the Chicago area since last April.     They are the best. Taste like fresh hazelnuts and are great with either coffee or tea. (or later with wine).     So good that I bought a case, but they are reserved for special moments(like now).
