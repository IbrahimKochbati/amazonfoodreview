Vegan. Natural. Spicy snack mix also with sweet flavor notes. Americans might find it spicy, but for Indians it is quite mild and more towards the sweet side. If you like Indian flavors and spicy snacks along with some sweetness, you might really enjoy this one! Haldiram is a top snack  and in India. Khatta Meeta is my top favorite Indian snack mix. Made with gram flour, peanut oil, corn oil, peanuts, rice flakes, sago [palm stem starch], sugar, green peas, gram pulse, lentil, salt, mango powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder, ginger powder, black pepper powder, & citric acid powder. Was very happy to be able to order from Amazon rather than to wait until I find myself back in India or in a large metro with an Asian market. Walking on the streets in India, you can find the small and big packets of Haldiram snacks nearly everywhere. Halidram's also has one of my favorite sweet shops in Kolkata [Calcutta] near to one of my friend's house and office.  Great for vegan traveling. Approx 1120 calories, 20g protein per bag. Product of India. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews and the vegancompassion Profile for more great choices.
