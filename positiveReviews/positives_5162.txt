I have always been a fan of premium beverages and sodas. I will never buy Pepsi or Coke products. At a minimum I will by Jones because they use pure cane sugar. I really enjoyed getting to try this product, and I am actually going on now to start ordering it on a regular basis.          You can really tell the difference between "pop" and juice with sparkling water. It is a bit on the sweet side, and I did not think they needed to add the extra juice flavors to make it just right. However this is a great product, good size for individual servings, and it arrived in good packaging by amazon.
