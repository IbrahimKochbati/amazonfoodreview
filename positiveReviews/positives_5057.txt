This tea makes extremely dark and strong tea on the 11oz setting which is my largest water capacity setting. I use the Keurig Iced Beverage Tumblers filled with ice and can't drink it straight.  My solution is to fill a gallon pitcher with ice, add some water, make two iced  ew K cups and pour it over the ice water for what I consider perfect iced tea.  You can forego the water for stronger tea, or add more water to dilute the tea depending on your mood or tastes.  This tea has excellent flavor, it's just too strong right out of the Keurig for my tastes and in my opinion requires diluting.  Excellent for making a pitcher of tea!
