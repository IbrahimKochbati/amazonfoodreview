I can't believe I actually bought a 6 pack of these, but in a delirious Amazon buying frenzy, I did. These are the best cheese crackers and here's why: they're never burnt! The quality of every box is consistent and they aren't dry either. They are hard to find in stores though, which is why I bought them on here.          If I had a nickle for every time in my life that I ate a burnt Cheese It I'd have enough money to buy 50, six packs of these Cheese Nips through Amazon. These are a great snack cracker but six boxes is just too much unless you have a huge family of munchy kids.
