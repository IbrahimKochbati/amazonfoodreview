So after reading a blog from sunfoods i decided that i was going to try himalayan pink salt.  my husband's blood pressure has been a little high in the past few years, so i've had to cook with as little traditional salt as possible.  The good thing about this salt is 1.) it's not toxic to your body like regular tablesalt, and 2.) it has a much bolder flavor, so you end up using way less than your used to, but still achieving a great flavor in each dish.  I cook meals from scratch every day and i know this salt is going to last me a while, so i believe it's a great deal.
