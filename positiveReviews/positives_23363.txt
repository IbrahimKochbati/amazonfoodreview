I like the Think Thin bars for their nutritional profile, not so much for their taste.  I've tried the  ownie and the dark chocolate and sometimes have to swallow hard to get them down, along with some kind of beverage.  When these arrived the first thing I noticed was how soft and chewy and "fresh" they tasted  in comparison to the others which are very firm, if not hard, bars.  Wow.  That makes all the difference.  These went down like a dream, and while I'm not going to say you will love them like a Snickers, I will say that they don't taste bad at all and chew like a warm oatmeal cookie.  I am beginning to wonder if it is just this flavor which is so soft and tasty, or if my other bars are just old and hard.  All bought on Amazon, though.  In any case, they were MUCH better than expected!
