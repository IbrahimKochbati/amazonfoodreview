I keep a tube in my fridge at all times to use as a quick seasoning for everything from scrambled eggs to salad dressing to something to smear on chicken  easts before sauteing   add some white wine to the pan and a bit of shallot or garlic and it's a lovely short cut to a low cal but tasty "gourmet ish" entree.  I've never used it on pasta because I don't care for pasta.  But I use it as a seasoning. It's less heavy than the pestos that come in jars (that often have cheese already in them   thus not the high quality cheese I'd prefer). If I want this pesto spiked up with parmesan, I'll use a very good cheese  and it then makes a very good pesto!
