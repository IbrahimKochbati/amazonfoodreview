We've been "hooked" on Spike seasnoning for salads and fried or scrambled eggs for years. When I could no longer find it, I "Googled" it, and immediately found it at Amazon.com. I've bought several things from Amazon, and their speed, service, and security has been outstanding.  Highly recommend them .
