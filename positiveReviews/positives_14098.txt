But, I have tried some other teas to find something to replace that awful Lipton junk that I have been using for my iced tea for years. What I do know is that it has great flavor in iced tea, better than anything else I have tried (although I haven't tried any of the other Davidson teas). Tastes like dirt? That reviewer needs a taste bud tune up.
