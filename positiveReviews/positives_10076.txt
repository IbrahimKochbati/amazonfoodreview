I'd say that naming this coffee blend "Classique" is appropriate. I found it a good, solid, "classic" coffee; neither too dark nor too light, bold without being bitter, and without any excessive non coffee notes to the flavor. You know, the sort of "notes" or "tones" that often get  agged about in descriptions of coffees, such as "floral", "citrus", "nutty", "winy", etc. Perhaps more delicate palates than mine will detect some of those notes, but my point is that they don't stand out excessively. This is a nice, unpretentious coffee that tastes like coffee.
