These are great!  I first used them when my Japanese Chin needed meds as a puppy.  Now I give them to her everyday at dinner time, picking off little pieces and rolling them into balls.  She thinks she's eating the same thing I am!  She is super fussy where treats are concerned and I have spent waaaay to much money to find snacks she will eat.  But, she loves the pocket pills for "dinner".  No, they're not really her dinner as she always has her food in her bowl.  I never give them to her just for a treat.  I'm so glad she loves them!!
