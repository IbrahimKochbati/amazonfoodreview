Please don't tell me this is going to be a "seasonal" find only!!!  I made the pink lemonade cake with the pink lemonade frosting for July 4th and it was such a big hit!!!  The blend of lemon, sweet, and pink are just right!!!  When I went back to get more mixes they had been relegated to the "Seasonal Clearance" section    and I could only find 2 cake mixes and no more frosting.    (  It's definitely a year round keeper    I'm thinking granddaughter birthday parties, ballet recital parties, pinkalicious parties!!!
