Bertolli Extra Virgin Olive Oil is a fixture on my kitchen counter. I use it in preparing meats, sauces, veggies, pasta dishes, salads and more. The health benefits of the Mediterranean diet should be known to everyone by now. But, if you haven't yet discovered the difference in taste between Bertolli and other  ands, you are in for a great surprise. Once you try Bertolli, I'm sure you'll stick with it!          The price is good, and the free shipping is great!
