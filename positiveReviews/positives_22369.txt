My mom is a diabetic and she has a few of these a week. I am reviewing the Nut Delights ones without the fruit. They're all natural, gluten free, wheat free, dairy free, low GI value. They do have 12 carbs, 3 grams of fiber and 8 grams of sugar. We used to make a recipe similar to these, but these come out cheaper and better tasting.
