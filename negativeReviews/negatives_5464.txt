I don't know what it is about anything w  caffeine in it that gives me such bad indigestion the past few years, but this stuff actually DIDN'T give me hot pipes!  I'm pretty much a plain black Dunkin Donuts snob and this flavor didn't didn't do anything for me.  It was drinkable, but wouldn't be my first choice again.  Decently strong, not the watered down swill I was expecting.  If you really need some relief from the gastric distress coffee can sometimes put you through, you wouldn't be wasting your money trying this out.
