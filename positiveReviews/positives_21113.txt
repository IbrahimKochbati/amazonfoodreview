I credit my 11 1 2 year old golden retriever's continued good health to Dr. Harvey's Canine Health.  I have been feeding Cleo this food for 11 years after searching for something to relieve her puppy allergies.  If I run out and feed her something else, her personality changes and she gets "ouchy".     I can't recommend this product enough!
