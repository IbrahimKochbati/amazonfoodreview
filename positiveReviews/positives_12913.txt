I've tried three flavors of this product so far:  Black Cherry, Watermelon Strawberry, and Kiwi Berry.  My favorite so far is Kiwi Berry that I thought was very good.  Watermelon Strawberry was second, and Black Cherry was a distant third.          This product has a lot going for it, in my opinion.  100% fruit juice, so healthier than soda, but with added carbonation to make it different than just plain juice.  To me, the amount of carbonation was just right   I was able to drink it quickly and found it very refreshing.  The serving size is good, too.          I do wish that it was available in larger sizes, even if someone didn't want to drink it all at once.          My rating for the flavors, based solely on my personal opinion, is:     Kiwi Berry:  5 stars   would buy again     Watermelon Strawberry:  4 stars   would drink again, but probably won't buy again     Black Cherry:  3 stars   would drink again if very thirsty, but wouldn't go out of my way to get it
