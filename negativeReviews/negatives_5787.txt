My 5 lb. Pomeranian was able to chew off the large knobby end of the bone, and then managed to chew off a a smaller 1" knuckle shaped piece from somewhere (by this time I had already taken the larger knob end away from him), getting it stuck in his throat.  Luckily, he threw it up while we were rushing to the vet.  Even small toy dogs who are big chewers should not be given this product.
