I am not a huge fan of instant potatoes but these are better than many others on the market. They are quick and easy to fix when your running late and everyone seems to like them. Amazon makes it even easier by selling at a comparable price to the stores and shipping. It's nice to have them on hand when I'm rushed or unexpected guests show up and I need more in a hurry.
