Wow, good tasting and creamy just like the 'real' thing.          The pistachio and other flavors as cheesecake and banana cream and butterscotch are surprisingly satisfying while being sugar free fat free. The chocolate flavors are good, too, but don't dissolve set as well as this does. Very easy to prepare    and ready to eat in minutes.
