This is a fragrant treat that is great for an in between meal snack for my little puffball, a 6 year old lovable Bichon Frise.  He deserves to be pampered.  He's sensitive to treats that have a harder consistency.  However, cognizant of treats like these, I hand feed him.  It gives us some time to bond.  I held the treat for him, as he licked the cracker, and bit with his molars.  No difficulty for him, at all.          Lamb treats are usually foul in smell and they're just as worse on the way out, too.  I acquired these with a little hesitation.          I prefer natural snacks for my dog since he truly deserves the best.  Organic treats and organic diets are what I feed him.          Overall, it is a great reward but not ideal for training purposes given the 5 cm size.  From the other end (please do mind the pun), it did not constipate him or give him runny stool   he has a sensitive GI tract.          My dog loves it.
