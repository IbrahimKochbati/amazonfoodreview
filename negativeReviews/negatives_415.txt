I got one of these for XMAS...and to be honest it does work well and does extend the life of your fresh herbs while providing an attractive container.          The main problem is the container is difficult to open. It does get easier over time but whoever designed this thing should not have made it so hard from the get go.          The thing is its very easy to open when there is nothing inside it as you can you use as much force as needed open it (you don't need to open the bottom....just squeeze the sides and pull the plastic cover up and out FIRMLY). Don't worry...you won't  eak it. It is pretty sturdy plastic.          The real issue is when it is filled or has water in it...its difficult to use that much force and popping it open without spilling.          I've just resorted to emptying the water reservoir through its fill port....then popping it.          PREPARA...please read these reviews and improve on the next design!!!
