We received a sampler package from Amazon that had several flavors....cheddar, bbq, sour cream onion, plain, salt and pepper, and also the salt and vinegar.          I've already received our first shipment of just the vinegar version.  These are a good salty fix without the calories...and each proportioned pouch is satisfying in one sitting.  I would've liked to try the garlic parm but it wasn't included.          Our #1 is salt and vinegar and #2 would probably be the salt and pepper.
