We purchased these to have on hand for our 7 yr old son and he loves them. As an adult I really like them when I am craving some sort of candy. If I grab one of these... I know it is only 100 calories... and it does have chocolate and candy :) so it is good for those kinds of fixes. I wouldn't say these are healthy by any means, but in moderation, they are better than other things.
