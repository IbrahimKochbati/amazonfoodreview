My dog has been eating these after his dinner for years. They keep his  eath clean and limit the build up of plac. He waits with anticipation his greenie after his meal, running to get one out of my hand. Digestion has been no problem at all and the formula is soft enough to prevent any form of choking. I would highly recommend this product.
