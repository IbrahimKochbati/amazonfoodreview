After my doctor said no more coffee, not even decaf, I gave this a try.  We have a home espresso machine and a daily latte is part of my morning routine.  While this doesn't taste just like coffee, it is really good in its own way.  It has a deep, rich flavor like coffee, that tea just doesn't have.  I tried making tea lattes as a substitute at first, and they just didn't cut it.  Honestly, I would sometimes pick this over coffee.  It is really good.  The chocolate flavor is delicious.          I put two Tbsp of this in my portafilter and pull a shot as normal.  You do need to scrub out your filter a bit afterwards and your portafilter needs to be completely dry before putting the teeccino in or it will stick together in a clump and the shot will not pull right.  It is stickier than coffee.  I also enjoy this as an iced latte.  For an extra treat, put a Tbsp or two of cocoa powder into the bottom of your glass, mix with the shot, then add milk and sweetener of choice, make a great iced mocha.  I use coconut palm sugar, which when mixed with steamed milk creates a kind of marshmallowy taste.  Combined with the teeccino, yum!
