Fell in love with this dressing after trying and buying it at Costco.  They don't carry it anymore, so I am glad to find it here.  So much fuller tasting than average grocery store salad dressing  ands.  Yes, it is sweet and a little tangy, kind of thick.  (We like it because it has no egg.)  We just don't seem to get tired of it.  Have not tried it as a marinade.  Thought I better add our review, since we appreciate the comments of others.
