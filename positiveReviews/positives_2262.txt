I was looking for a wheel. You know, like the one sitting at the bar at a restaurant. I wanted to offer some  oken pieces along with olives, pepperoni, and some prosciutto.  All for a New Years eve party. Well it was not a wheel   thank goodness because it was half a wheel and at 20 pounds for the half wheel, 40 pounds would have been way too much. The flavor was excellent, just enough of bite.  The creaminess of the cheese really came through and was a perfect balance. I  oke up the half wheel into thirds and decorated a tray with a cascading effect of  oken pieces. It was all well received with the choices of red wine. There was more than enough, which has allowed me to enjoy the flavors for other favorite dishes for a couple of more weeks. I am looking forward to ordering this again   Super Bowl is right around the corner. It is big, so make sure you can carry and store this quantity. As far as cost, I thought it was a great deal since it seemed to have much less rind than what we purchase elsewhere. The cost per pound may be average, but the amount of actual usable cheese is there with the great flavor.
