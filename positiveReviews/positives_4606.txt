This jar of baby food has 7 GRAMS of FAT and 110 calories   thats triple the fat and double the calories of most baby food!  I highly recommend for babies needing to put on some lbs   as well as picky eaters.  I have to offer my son a variety of 7 8 foods each meal (cheese, avacado, chunks of meat...etc) b c he turns up his nose at so much (and I can't just say 'well too bad' b c he desperately needs the calories!) But this is one of the foods he rarely turns down.  I highly recommend.
