My father lives 3,000 miles from me, and I used to order a pecan pie from Swiss Colony and have it shipped to him for Christmas each year. But when the item was discontinued a few years ago, I had trouble finding another company that could deliver a delicious, homemade pie that was guaranteed to be fresh when it arrived.  I gave Nell Davis a shot last Christmas, and could not have been more pleased.  I missed the deadline to guarantee the order would arrive by Christmas, but sure enough, my father was quite surprised when he got not one, but six mini pies on Christmas Eve morning. He said they were wonderful and he gobbled down all six in one sitting! I've definitely found my new holiday pie company, thank you Nell Davis!
