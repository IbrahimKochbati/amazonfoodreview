I wanted to make authentic italian margherita pizza at home so I ordered this and Caputo "00" flour.  These tomatoes are amazing,  and taste just liek the tomatoes at our favorite Italian pizza restaurant.  The label says there is basil in it but i did not detect visually or in taste any basil.  This stuff is jsut awesome.  I ordered another 8 cans.  Shipping kills though.
