Wow, I wasn't sure what to expect given the mixed reviews.  So, I took other readers suggestions and spiced it up a little.  I added some rice, a half can of tomato paste to sweeten it. I also added 6 slices of jalepano with a tablespoon of the juice.  This is really good, and stays true to its intent.  Very healthy choice.          For those of you who don't like the salt, just take a half of a small potato. Let it simmer and that will take care of the salt.
