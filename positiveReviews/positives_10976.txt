Glutino gluten free crackers are probably the closest thing you can get to Ritz or club like crackers. These crackers are crisp without feeling stale and have a nice crunch that I miss with regular crackers. The flavor is decent, I never ate crackers alone and I still don't, I judge the taste more on how well it pairs with dips, spreads and cheese. The flavor it subtle enough that you can put virtually anything on top. Be warned they get stale very quickly so keep them in a zip lock bag even if they are in the box. The price of course is another downside but just like all other gluten free foods, I have developed an aversion to over priced gluten free products.
