I love Pirate's Booty!  Soft and yummy with just enough cheddar flavor and doesn't make my fingers orange! It's healthier than eating that stuff on the chip aisle at the grocery store. Everyone at work that has tried it wants to buy some, so it's gotta be great. Next time I think I will order the smaller serving bags to help with the temptation to eat it all at one sitting!
