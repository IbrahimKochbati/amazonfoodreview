Since there was only one review I was hesitant on buying them, but went ahead and I am glad I did. I bought these for my wife for our wedding anniversary and she loved the truffles (so much so that she won't share them with me).  They arrived inside a nice sturdy box surrounded by lots of bubble wrap.  I would definitely recommend these to buy, especially for special occasions.
