I think the medium roast is the best tasting espresso I've ever had.  However it gives me acid reflux about half an hour after I drink it.  I've only had this happen once before, with another  and of lightly roasted espresso.  I tried the espresso a couple of times, hoping that something else was causing the reflux, but alas it was this yummy espresso.  I really prefer the medium roast to the dark roast, but I had to go back to my organic beans (and my reflux went away).  But if reflux is not a problem for you, this stuff is really great.  Although it didn't taste as good the second day as it did the first day.  I guess that happens with all coffee though, which is why many people grind their own.
