I finally gave in and bought these expensive chews because the others we have used only last a few minutes. The package claims to provide "hours of entertainment" for your pet. What a ripoff! They didn't mention you would have to buy a case of these things and feed your dog a big meal of bull hide for it to last hours. I have a seventy pound mixed  eed dog, Roscoe, who is four years old. He doesn't chew for entertainment like a puppy would, but when it comes to eating, he is a real chewer. The kibble he eats is the size of puppy kibble and he thoroughly chews every bite. Well, I just gave Roscoe a bully spring and it was thoroughly chewed and eaten in under ten minutes. My seven month old puppy isn't quite as fast as him, but she too can put one away in minutes. The pig skin rolls at the supermarket last longer, and they aren't advertised and priced in a way that victimizes customers.
