In the past I've bought these from a local grocery store and they were soft, chewy, moist, and delicious. unfortunately the batch I just received from Amazon were dried out, crunchy, and stale.  wondering if the boxes sold here are expired overstock.  buyer beware   food items can not be returned.  am hesitant to try again...
