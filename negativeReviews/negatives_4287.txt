I started drinking one 12 ounce can of Celsius 15 minutes prior to weight and cardio workouts, and have found Celsius  and to be far superior to Monster in the energy boost it gives me.  Each 12 ounce can has 200mg of caffeine (check out the Celsius website...) so I don't drink any coffee on the mornings I'm off to the gym as when I do drink both, I tend to get jittery instead of 'boosted'.

I do like two of the non sparkling Celsius drinks and would recommend you try a few flavors before buying a case of them.  My favorite so far is    "
