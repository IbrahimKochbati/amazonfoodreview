Disappointing. I went to a lot of trouble to buy these, as I thought it would be impressive and novel for guests when drinking champagne at Christmas. No one had any useful comments to make, some left half of the champagne and the flowers,  although encouraged to eat them.It was a waste of money and champagne should not be interfered with, maybe better in lemonade!
