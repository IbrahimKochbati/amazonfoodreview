This is very high quality cocoa powder, with high cocoa butter content.  It makes excellent hot chocolate,  ownies, mochas, and frosting.          It is not Dutch process, so it is suitable for most uses which do not explicitly call for Duch process cocoa.          It ships in a durable and resealable plastic bag, and stays fresh and dry for months.
