I bought this food back in Fe uary and the bag is still sitting in the pantry almost completely full. The dog simply will not eat it. I tried everything I could think of to get him to eat it: mixed in a little olive oil (which usually does the trick for him with other food; didn't work), mixed it with grated cheese (somehow the dog managed to eat just the cheese), mixed it with yogurt (he begs for anything that's dairy; no dice), mixed it turkey grease after  owning ground turkey (he ate 2 bites, and that was it). I even ate a kibble of it myself just to see, and honestly it didn't taste that bad, kind of like very bland, grainy vegetable granola. So, I figured that when he got hungry enough, he'd eat it. For 3 days he ate nothing, and finally on day 4, I  oke down and bought other food.
