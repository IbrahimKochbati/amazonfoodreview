I have been trying to find a good coffee that would not set off my ulcer and still tasted good. Puroast Low Acid Coffee French Roast is perfect for me. It tasted rich, full bodied and no harsh afterbite, AND it doesn't make my heartburn flare up. You will never miss anything this coffee has to offerr, except your heartburn!
