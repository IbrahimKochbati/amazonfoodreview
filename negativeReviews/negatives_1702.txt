First of all, I thought I could save money filling my own Keurig K Cups. By the time I bought the fillable cups, paid shipping and bought coffee to put in them, I was already in the hole.     If all you have to do is fill these little cups all day I guess it will work for you, because you can have the coffee of your choice. The other problem was is they get stuck in the  ewer when you try to take them out.     I still have about thirty left, and when they are gone I will not replace them.
