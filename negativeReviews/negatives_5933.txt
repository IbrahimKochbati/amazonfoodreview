This is one of my favorite Life Savers flavors, and like almost all flavors, it has gotten hard to find it locally.          I rarely see the roll version of anything other than Pep O Mint and Wint O Green. Remember the days when you could go into a store and find tons of Life Savers? Berry (was it called Mixed Berries or Wild Berry?), Tropical Fruits, Fancy Fruits, Wild Cherry, Butter Rum ... the original Five Flavor mix, and two of my long gone favorites: Butter Mint and Tangerine! I really miss those days!          I can still find the Butter Rum and Wild Cherry at my local pharmacy. They're both better for soothing a scratchy throat than any cough drop that they sell, so it makes sense that they'd have them there. In the supermarket I can often find them both   plus the new version of the Five Flavor mix (which isn't as good as the original), but these are individually wrapped candy in bags. They are bigger than the roll version, and I prefer the rolls.          There was a gas station in my area that sold these Spear O Mint rolls, but they stopped about a year ago. I am so happy to have found a source for them here at Amazon. YIPPEE! Now if only they'd come back with the Tangerine and Butter Mint! I can't understand how the convenience store shelves can contain 100 different types of super mints (I can't stand the overpoweringly strong mints and gums sold today), but not make room for old fashioned, traditional Life Savers!          * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *     UPDATE:     * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *          I had originally given this product 5 stars, but I have now had to lower the rating to just 3 stars. I've opened six rolls of the Life Savers and three of them have contained completely crushed candies. Each mint is  oken into 4 6 chunks and a bunch of minty powder. What a mess! Even the three that were not completely  oken, were at least partially  oken.          The package seemed to be in good shape when it arrived with no signs of damage, so one can only assume that this damage was done before the product was shipped. I don't know how the remaining 14 rolls will size up, but it's not looking hopeful.          I was so excited to receive this product, and now I am so disappointed.          # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #     FURTHER UPDATE:     # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #          I've now opened just about all of the rolls of Life Savers and every single roll (other than the first three good ones mentioned above) contained  oken candy. Most were completely shattered or contained about 80%  oken candy. Just a few rolls contained at least half un oken candy. As I've said, the packaging was not damaged at all, so these were obviously  oken before they were shipped out. Most likely, they were stored and or handled improperly.          Oh well. I guess that Life Savers are getting to be thing of the past. You can hardly find good flavors locally, and obviously mail order is not an option. This sure was a pricy lesson for me.
