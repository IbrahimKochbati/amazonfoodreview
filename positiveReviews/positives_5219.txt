I decided to try "The Switch" orange tangerine because it was promoted as a drink that is 100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, all natural and it happens to be carbonated.          The taste is like drinking orange juice at first with carbonation and I have to be truthful, at first I wondered if it was an alcoholic beverage at first.          But after tasting it, you do taste the combination of the orange tangerine and the carbonation.          The drink contains no sugar or corn syrup and no preservatives.          Overall, a tasty carbonated beverage with only 140 calories and no fat.  15mg of sodium and 36g of carbs.          If you are interested in the beverage that combines the taste of juice and carbonation, give "Switch" a try!
