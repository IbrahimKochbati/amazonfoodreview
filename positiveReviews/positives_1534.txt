The flavor of this natural sea salt is more nuanced and a bit richer than the typical table salt we're all accustomed to, although describing such subtleties is difficult.          One noteworthy fact is that this salt contains less sodium than conventional table salt   330mg per 1 4 teaspoon, versus 590mg per 1 4 teaspoon of conventional table salt.          Another thing to keep in mind is that this natural salt is NOT iodized.  As our thyroid glands require trace amounts of iodine, it may not be wise to entirely eliminate iodized salt from your diet.
