I received a box with 11 bags, not 12. I noticed that another reviewer had the same problem. Also, in some of the puffs there are some really hard bits, which is weird. I hurt my tooth. I normally love this stuff but I won't buy it from Amazon again, even though the price is much cheaper than at grocery stores.
