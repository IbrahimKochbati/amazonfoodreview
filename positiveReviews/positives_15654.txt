My cat is fussy and I wondered if she would like these incredibly ornate packaged delicasies.Well she went wild,and now holds out for this special set of flavors. I would get wordy here but the textures and smells entice my cat,and she is always tail up and eager when she sees these cans!Petite cuisine has sophisticated gormet taste(i think),and the packaging once again is unrivaled.
