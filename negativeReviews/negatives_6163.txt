I know it says they are long lasting but my two toy  eed puppies made them disappear almost immediately. I would hate to see what a larger puppy could have done with them. Not so long lasting but they LOVED them! I am looking for a longer lasting treat to keep them busy in the morning when I crate them and leave for work. Any recommendations?
