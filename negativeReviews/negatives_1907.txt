Bought this product to give to a family member who lives cross country and is going thru treatment for cancer.  Lemongrass tea is supposed to help with side effects of radiation and chemotherapy. I tried it as well.  Have had other products containing lemongrass tea that tasted better.  Still, good value for the price and could probably be mixed with other teas to improve taste.
