I've been low carb dieting and I like pork rinds so I couldn't wait to try these. They're not really "spicy", they're more like mild in my opinion. They are good, they taste just like the pork rinds that you buy at the store, not "bacon y" at all to me. The only downside is that your house will smell like hot pork rinds. It's pretty bad, I don't normally notice things like that but it's pretty smelly and hard to get rid of.
