My only complaint about these little bars are they are too small!  They are lightly sweetened, not sickening sweet like a lot of these types of snacks are. I'm not big on desserts or things that are very sweet.  I love dark chocolate and things that are lightly sweetened, closer to the way things are naturally.  There is just the right balance of oats, coconut and chocolate  but not only chocolate  dark chocolate. It was a little strange to have five bars in a pack. I thought someone had eaten my last bar when I went back for the sixth.  I love the fact that they are sweetened naturally without processed sugars or artificial sweeteners.  And, they're gluten free. But, I didn't feel like I was sacrificing anything when I ate them.
