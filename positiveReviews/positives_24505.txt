Scientific research shows that eating foods high in carotenoids like pumpkin can give one a healthy glow that rivaled a sun tan and made them more attractive in tests...     The article at healthland time dotcom "study can a veggie rich diet make you more beautiful"           I purchased several cases of "Farmers market foods organic canned pumpkin" while Amazon had it on sale. Most of the cans arrived in great condition a few had dents but nothing severe.The pumpkin itself taste yummy  so I'm hoping to improve my health, eye sight and get some color without using self tanners ^_^
