I was raised on the sugar water for $1.50 from Wal Mart. Then my wife, from New England, introduced me to real maple syrup. Now, the challenge is to figure out how to afford it.          Amazon's Prime automatic delivery option has a price cheaper than my local Wal Mart or HEB, and that's with free 2 day shipping.          I don't know which grade to order, but "A" seems like it ought to be OK!
