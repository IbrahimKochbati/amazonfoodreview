I have been buying 96 count containers of teeny greenies from Amazon for a couple of years.  They are always fresh and arrive promptly. My Yorkies look forward to one before bedtime each evening.  I don't know if they really help plaque.  They do freshen  eath and have some nutrition.  Thanks to Amazon prices, my dogs have this little luxury.
