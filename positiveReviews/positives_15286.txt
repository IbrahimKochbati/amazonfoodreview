Even though the product description states that this machine has three cup sizes, it has only two, and the largest is not as large as the mug size on the top of the line Keurig models.  This model fits right in the middle of Keurig machines:  it has the reservoir that the Mini Brewer lacks and yet is not as expensive as the top of the line machines.          Since we also have the B60 model (I bought this for my daughter to use), I can tell you that the difference between the two models is small but significant:          1. This one only  ews the smallest and the mid size cups.  If you want the large size, you can  ew a mid size cup, lift the arm, put it back down, and  ew a small size through the same pod.  (It's about the same amount of water that goes through a single pod when  ewing the largest size on the B60.)          2. The construction isn't as heavy duty as the B60's, although it's good enough, in my opinion.          3. It doesn't look quite as nice as the B60 because it lacks the stainless drip grate and the silver accents.          4. It takes a little longer to heat the water.          In general, this is just a stripped down version of the B60 which makes it more affordable.  The coffee is just as good.  Because we bought a Keurig Mini Brewer for my husband's office, I realized that the reservoir is an important feature to have because otherwise it takes a lot longer to  ew a single cup.  This machine has some of the strengths found in the best of the Keurig machines but at a more moderate price.  When comparing prices, keep in mind that some models found in stores offer extras such as a coffee sample pack or filter.  This one    at least as I bought it    contains nothing extra.
