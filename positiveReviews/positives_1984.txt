These are excellent quality flaxseeds! I just toasted them a little on a pan and even that made a great snack! I also powdered them in a coffee grinder after toasting them a little and the powder is delicious too :) Delicious + Nutritious   Awesome! :))) Planning to have it in my cereal tomorrow and maybe sprinkle some on my veggies. I think I will also try out Bob's Quinoa and Museli.
