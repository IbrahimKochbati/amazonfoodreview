I really, really do not like this gum. It might be gluten free and "natural", but it tastes disgusting. The peppermint flavor only seems to be in the outer candy shell of the gum. So you chew and  eak the shell, then swallow that part and then the taste is gone. The taste only lasts about the time it takes to chew up a Tic Tac and swallow it and doesn't leave the pleasant aftertaste a Tic Tac does. Then after that candy shell is gone, to me at least, it tastes like chewing on a wood chip and is almost as hard. I can't stand chewing it even as long as minute. I think I might get more out of chewing on ice. Sorry, I really tried to like this, but I'm taking a pass on this  and of gum.
