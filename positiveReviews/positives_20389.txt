My son loves this stuff.  He likes it by itself or when it's mixed with fruits.  We were initially drawn to it at one of the local big box stores because it is multigrain and has DHA and probiotics.  Compared to plain old rice cereal I think this has been a much better choice.  After finding out that our son loves it we started getting it from Amazon and have put it on subscribe and save.  Our little guy is 11 months now and goes through the 6 pack in about a month.  Great product and a better price then we've been able to find locally (plus the convenience of getting it delivered).
