Now let me start by saying I did not buy this tea as a diet supplement. I bought this because I tried it from a local store as I was looking for a tea that had some peppermint in it but not so much it was over powering like a full peppermint tea. This has just the right amount of peppermint combined with a green tea. Overall it is a pleasant taste that I could drink all day.
