I have a sprightly Yorkie who will eat just about anything...except these treats. But he sure loves to play with them, hiding them in blankets or tossing them around chasing it. I keep them on hand as dog toys, but will likely not buy them again. I have given away extras to other dog owners to see if their dogs would like them.
