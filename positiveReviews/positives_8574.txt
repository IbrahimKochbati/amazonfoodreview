The deal I got on these was amazing so that, combined with the fact that I love this  and of Almonds made ordering these no  ainer. I happen to love all of Blue Diamond's different flavors for their almonds. This flavor   Smokehouse is the best IMO. It's got just the right amount of smoky flavor to it without being overbearing. I believe this is Blue Diamond's best selling variety of Almonds. These come in 1.5 ounce packages and for me each package is good for 2 3 servings   about a handful each serving. Very tasty
