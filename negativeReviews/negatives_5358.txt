My husband loves French Roast and does have trouble with acid after drinking coffee. This would be a great benefit to him but the cost would prevent us from buying it.          The flavor was still too strong for me but then I like really light coffees. I tried it first without creamer and didn't like the taste. I added 1 3 cup of water as I usually do for any coffee and some sugar free French Vanilla Creamer. Then it was fine for me.          I think we would buy it if it was sold at a cheaper price. Kudos for the company for making low acid coffee though.
