I tried the Puroast low acid French Roast coffee and I really liked the taste and the smoothness of the coffee.  The fact it was low acid enabled me to have a second cup of coffee without experiencing any of the discomfort in my stomach I would have with my regular coffee, which is Starbucks House Blend.          This is really good news for me since I love coffee.  But, as someone who suffers from stomach ulcers, one cup of coffee was my limit.  I also did a side by side taste comparison with my usual Starbucks and the Puroast low acid coffee came out on top.          I finally found a coffee that satisfies my taste buds without aggravating my ulcers.  Here's to a second cup of coffee without the pain.
