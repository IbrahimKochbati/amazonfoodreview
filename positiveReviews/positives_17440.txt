Today is 12 2 11.  My order of Walkers Short ead Assorted, 8.8 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6) arrived yesterday and the BEST BEFORE date is END MAR 2013.  Perfect!  Plenty of time to share and consume these delectable treats from Scotland, the producer of my favorite whiskeys.  Although the Amazon description states that this package includes, "Short ead in five distinct shapes," the cookies are actually in three shapes.  Included in each box are 4 rounds, 6 triangles, and 8 of the traditional fingers, totaling 18 cookies.  They are fresh, golden, attractive to the eye and satisfying to the tastebuds.  It's quite interesting that the boxes list the ingredients in many languages, but English is not included.  They are made of wheat flour, butter (33%), sugar and salt.  Walkers short ead makes a gift that would likely be appreciated by any person who enjoys buttery confections that are slightly sweet who is not allergic to milk, wheat, gluten or nuts, is not vegan and has either teeth or rigid gums for chewing.  The biscuits which are about 1 2 inch thick soften when wet, so a full set of teeth is not required.          When in a crunch for entertaining purposes, I've dipped the short ead halfway into microwave melted bittersweet chocolate and then into chopped toasted pecans.  There's no need to limit yourself to a plain short ead when you can create a desert worthy of oohs and aahs in a matter of minutes.  We love Walkers short ead and are pleased to have purchased them from Amazon in a box of 6 packages.
