I have 2 children with food allergies, so I have to use egg, milk and butter substitutions for these muffins, and it works well.  I add a little more sugar to the mix and top the muffins with a  own sugar and pecan mixture before I bake them.  All my kids love them!  You can top with just  own sugar if you cannot have or do not like pecans.  I love these muffins as well!
