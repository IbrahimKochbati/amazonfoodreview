we just purchased a movie theater style popcorn maker.  We used the basic oil and popcorn but just didn't get the movie theater taste that we were looking for.  Then we purchased the Great Northern Popcorn.  Awesome taste, and just the right amount of salt.  Would recommend this popcorn to anyone.  The family loves it and all the kids friends think it's awesome.  What perfect way to spend an evening with the family, great popcorn and a movie.
