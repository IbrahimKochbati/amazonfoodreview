I bought this for my wife to take to restaurants as they almost never have a LIGHT version of dressings.  Either regular or no fat.  And we all know how no fat tastes!  She is VERY picky about her ranch dressing, trying various  ands.  This one she really likes, and we have purchased 4 boxes so far.  Never have any go bad, and we go through about a box every 6 months and store it in the refrigerator or even have stored it in the pantry with no problems.
