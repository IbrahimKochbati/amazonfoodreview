Great flavor and love the snap!  When your looking for something crunchy that isn't high in calories (a litle high in carbs though) these are amazing and you can have 17 crackers in a serving.  I was buying them at an natural health food store for $2.79 a package.  A much better deal for a case here on Amazon (about 1.00 less per package)
