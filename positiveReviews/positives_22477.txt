"Santa"  ought our family a "real" popcorn machine from Discount Tommy's a few years ago.  We have used it almost every weekend since then!  I had been concerned about the amount of microwaved popcorn my family was eating and thought this would be somewhat healthier.  We have really enjoyed the Great Northern Popcorn  all we have ever used in our machine.  The pre packaged all you need ingredients are so convenient!  If we ever wear our machine out, I know that "Santa" will  ing us another machine from Discount Tommy's and a huge box of Great Northern Popcorn again!
