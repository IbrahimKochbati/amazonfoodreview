Getting really good cocoa out of a K cup is not easy but this is much better than the others I have tried. Still a little wattery, but at 60 calories it is a nice treat.  very rich flavor   not as good as the real thing, bit I am not drinking it in a Berlin Chocolate shop either.  Put your slippers on, sit in front of the fireplace with your sweetie, and enjoy!          60 cal (20 fat)      2g fat sat      11 carb      6g sugar      &lt;1g fiber
