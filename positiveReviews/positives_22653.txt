These little packets have everything you need to make commercial quality popcorn.  Two pouches in each packet:  one with popcorn and flavored salt (flavacol, or something just like it), and one with that  ight orange oil (solid at room temperature).  The yellow color, the flavor and the salt all find their way into the popcorn.  If you like the "butter" stuff they squirt on at the theater, that's a separate purchase.  You might want to consult your doctor.          The 2.5 oz. packets are made for the baby sized commercial style machines, and they produce a smallish batch, about enough for one person.  I got one of these for Christmas, and now I wish I got a bigger model, at least a 4 oz. popper.  The little tub loses too many kernels during popping.  Plus, the small size makes it tough to clean and load the tub.  Anyway, the popcorn is great.  If you are an occasional popcorn eater, these packets are incredibly handy.  If you make a few batches a week, though, you might want to invest in a big tub of the oil and a box of flavacol, which should save money in the long run.
