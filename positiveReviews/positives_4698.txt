I use this product with my home  ewed espresso and milk to make a mocha latte.  It's terrific!  I ordered on the auto ship plan through Amazon and save about a $1.50 per can over buying it locally.  Plus I get the added benefit of having it delivered to my door instead of having to drive to a specialty shop to get it!  Great product and great service.
