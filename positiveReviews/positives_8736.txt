I love mexican food,  and taco kits.  Taco Bell  and soft tacos is one of my favorite ones if not my favorite taco kit!  You may not exactly save when subscribing.  I usually buy these when they are on sale for 1.99 but you do get them quick and easy every month.     The kit comes with soft tortilla taco shells,  the seasoning mix,  and taco sauce.     I want to buy a little container of extra seasoning because sometimes i use too much meat or my meat seems like it can use a little more flavoring.  Especially when using turkey.     Otherwise I love this kit and I'm very happy.  I subscribed!
