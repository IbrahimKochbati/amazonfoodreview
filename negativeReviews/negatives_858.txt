I bought this for fathers day. My father loves dried fruits and nuts.          It came in a somewhat cute crate box, and each compartment was in a plastic bag. That means that if you don't eat the nuts in one sitting they will go stale, as they are now sitting in the open. Same story for the fruit.          While all the bags were closed when my father opened them he found that the nuts were stale and the fruit were hard chewy.          I recommend purchasing this if you need a centerpiece, but not if you actually want to eat it.
