The ingredients note no less than three preservatives (TBHQ, BHT and citric acid) and nearly as many adjectives as nouns   Modified, Enriched, Bleached, Reduced and Artificial.          Ugh.          Instead of referencing my thesaurus for more words to express the crumbly blandness of these cookies, I decided to make a short video. I'm sure it better illustrates the appetite suppressing texture.

I need only leave a plate of food within arm's reach while they play board games, their Xbox 360 or watch a movie. Snacks like watermelon, popcorn or licorice, disappear quickly.          However, both boys passed on the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie opened for the video review. That sums it up for me.          Rating: One star.          Do you need to satisfy a sweet tooth?
