"Bottom Line Up Top":  While individual tastes may vary, this healthy and humanely produced dog food is a real treat that bot you can your dog will feel good about; you in your head and heart, the dog in a very happy tummy.          This is "one cookie" (Newman's great line in "The Young Philadelphians) that was a HUGE hit with our 14 year old Golden Retriever, "Sadie, The Wonder Dog." After some circumspect sniffing and tentative gnawing, Sadie got into these in a major way.  Yes, they're crunchy, but Sadie had no trouble chewing it up and gave us the patented "Retriever Look" signaling she wanted MORE.          Ingredients:     The treats are about 1" by 2" and are scored so that they can be  oken in half.  THe ingredient list reads like something you'd find at a California health food retreat (well, except fo rthe meat):          Organic barley, Organic lamb, Organic carrots, Organic apples, Organic palm oil, Organic molasses.          In the interest of full disclosure I should tell you that Sadie is not very particular when it comes to food. Not at all. Oranges, cherry plums, lettuce, bok choy, and tofu(!) are cherished by her; she holds the bok choy with both paws as if it were a bone. She's not totally easy (she refuses to eat spinach  probably some early puppy experience), but calling her the goat of Goldens would not be a cheap shot.          However, it's important that Sadie stay away from typical canine snacks, especially at her age. She has arthritis, and a poor diet has been linked to a number of disorders in older dogs. Fortunately, our vet has warned us about this, and it's become necessary to tell a certian neighbor to stop feeding her raw hamburger, baked potatoes with sour cream, bacon, etc.          Now, I don't want to guilt trip anyone over what they're feeding their pooches, but here's a (partial) list of culinary "BAD DOGS" that you won't find in Newman's pet foods. (The following  and MORE  can be found at [...]. WARNING: The following contains graphic descriptions of typical dog food ingredients.  HIDE YOUR CHILDREN.          NO Poultry by products   Ground, rendered, cleaned slaughtered poultry carcass parts such as necks, feet, lymph nodes, undeveloped eggs and intestines (and a small amount of feathers). The quality is very inconsistent between batches. Note: By product meals are often derived from 4 D meat sources   defined as food animals that have been rejected for human consumption because they were presented to the meat packing plant as "Dead, Dying, Disabled or Diseased".          NO Chemical fertilizers   Chemical fertilizers have been incriminated in serious health problems in animals and are not allowed in organic certified products.          NO Antibiotics or steroids   Long term daily administration may result in a compromised immune system, muscle wasting, and destruction of the friendly bacteria living in the intestines that aid the digestion of food and assimilation of nutrients.          NO Chemical additives or artificial preservatives   Chemical antioxidants, such as ethoxyquin, BHT or BHA, that were designed to extend the shelf life and reduce fat spoilage (rancidity) of pet foods may cause allergic reactions and affect liver and kidney functions.          NO Artificial Colors and Dyes   Coloring agents provide an artificial "rich and meaty" look to modify the appearance of highly processed foods and make them more appealing to pet owners.          As if this weren't enough, 100's of thousand of dollars are donated by the Newman Foundation to animal advocates (lest you think this means radical animal activists, we're talking mainstream things like animal shelters, etc. Details available at the website above).          Sadie says, "Give it a try!"
