Just bottled this wine about 2 weeks ago.  Opened the bottle yesterday, and WOW!!  I can't believe how good it is. Lots of pear flavor, and having experience with this  and, I know that when I let it sit for a couple months, it will be much better. The sweetness mellows out a little, but still is great! I have made about 6 of the Cornucopia wines, all with good results.  If you like the sweeter wines, you have to try this!
