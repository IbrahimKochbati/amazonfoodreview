I tried Bear Creek's Hot and Sour soup a few years ago and my daughter enjoyed it.  While shopping a few weeks ago, I decided to buy a bag of the Darn Good Chili because it appeared easy to prepare.  Without a doubt, it was THE.BEST.  I dropped some off at my son's house and he called to tell me how delicious it was and asked why I never prepared it while he was growing up!          I added  owned chopped meat and hot pepper.  Next time I think I'll add some frozen corn and turkey sausage and serve it stuffed pepper style!  What a great product!
