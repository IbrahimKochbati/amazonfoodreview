The taste and consistency of the Nutive Hemp Shake were great.  It's packed with fiber, protein, and nutrients and with only 80 calories per serving.  Unfortunately, the shake did not agree with me, and it gave me terrible gastrointestinal distress.  I had horrible bloating and foul gas from it, and I had to discontinue drinking it.
