These are good!  I mean they're REAL cookies!  Does NOT taste like the usual poor excuse for a cookie that we've settled for in the gluten free universe.  OK, they are pricy, so its not a daily treat.  That's pr'bly a good thing for the waistline.  But when you do need a cookie fix, these are the real deal.  Buy them, and hide them. :)
