Just got these and tried them over the weekend.  They were easy to cook and taste great.  My husband saw that I had them and tried them as well, so now I'm glad they come 15 to a box.  These will be a staple on our snack shelf.  There is a big differance between store bought and these.  These are sooo much fresher (and tastier).  They also fit very well into my high protein low carb diet.  It's wonderful to snack on something with a crunch to it!
