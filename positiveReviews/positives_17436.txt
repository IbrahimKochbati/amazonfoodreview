I was unsure about ordering this product because I didn't quite understand what it was. But, after a little nudging from a friend I bought it and I LOVED it. I personally use it as a pizza crust because it is much healthier than the ones you can buy at the store! But I also make it thicker and cube it up for a delicious protein in my salad. The Traditional is most versatile, but also be sure to try the Chili flavor if you like a little spice!
