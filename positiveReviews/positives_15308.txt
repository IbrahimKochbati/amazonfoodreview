We purchased this Keurig for our daughter in law.  We have owned our Keurig for about 4 years.  It has been great up until the past few weeks.  Our pump is acting very funny, sometimes pumping out a full cup and other times just a half cup.  We have used ours hard for about 4 years i.e. 10 cups per day average.  I guess we will have to invest in another Keurig.  I have had Mr. Coffees for years without any problem, but love the ease of  ewing one cup at a time and never wasting a whole pot.
