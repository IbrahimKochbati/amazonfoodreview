We ordered this item from DAB Nutrition.  When we received the item we opened the box and as we opened the candy each piece was damaged as you could tell it was stored improperly.  We contacted DAB Nutrition and because we opened 10, they refused to return our money.  Even though we have been a good customer.  Are you not supposed to open a candy product when you buy it?????????  You could tell the entire box was damaged.  10 pieces out of 175 were opened.          We are VERY disappointed with this seller.  Will NEVER buy again.          You have just lost 2 good customers, but I guess that doesn't matter to you.
