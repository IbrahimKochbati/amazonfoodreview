I have been a energy drink fan for a long time taking the good with the bad. That is no longer necessary with Celsius! It truly is the ultimate fitness partner. I have tried all the original flavors and plan on trying the new ones very soon. It seems to me there are flavors for everyones liking. My favorite so far are sparkling orange and peach mango green tea. Both are enjoyable and rewarding with the results I get from drinking one a day. They are the major reason i'm back in great shape and can perform at the highest ability in anything active. [...] If your looking for the edge to get you out of the fitness funk one a day is all it takes.
