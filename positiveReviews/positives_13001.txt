This is the second carnivorous plant I've ordered from Joel and I wasn't disappointed!     The first was a Red Dragon Venus Flytrap I bought a few months back which is very healthy and doing great.     I was so happy when I received my purchase.  The Sarracenia     Leucophylla was just as described and looked just like the picture! I wasn't expecting it to be so big!     If you are looking to buy a carnivorous plant I wouldn't hesitate from ordering from Joel.     His products are of high quality and he is very professional.  Thanks for my beautiful plant!
