We first had these sardines in St. Petersburg, Russia and they were the very best sardines I had ever tasted.  I returned home and lo and behold they had the same sardines at our local market.  The next time I looked the didn't carry them anymore.  So I looked online and found them through Amazon at Taylors Market (somehow they can get these sardines at the Finnish store Stockmens in St Petersburg, but we are unable to get them in the United States).  My order will expire on March 27th and I still don't have the sardines, but I reordered today through a different supplier at a much greater cost, but I hope I receive them this time.  They are YUMMY!
