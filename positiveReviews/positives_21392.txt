This is my favorite cereal.  It's quick and easy to make (just put in pan or pop it in the microwave).  For a single serving just half the recipe on the box.  Also, if you put it in the microwave make sure you put it in there on about 30% power.  Otherwise you will have it all over your microwave.  It's great tasting, healthy, and keeps me full for a longer time than other cereals.  It's part of a heart healthy diet, I got my dad eating it after his heart attack and he loves it.  If you are from Canada, it tastes just like Red River.  But if you are in the states, you don't have to pay all the shipping charges for this (like you do Red River).  It tastes great with a little  own sugar or agave and milk.
