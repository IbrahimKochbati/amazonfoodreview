It is very good popcorn.  But I used a hotair machine so may not have been as yummy as if the oily stuff had been used.  Although I did pour oil on afterwards.  Why would I do that with an airpopper you ask?  Because the airpopper was a gift.  I really can't tell a whole lot of difference in the taste from Orville R. and this, but what I have read is this is organic and much better for you.  But the price is well...pricey. No I don't intend to buy again for that reason, but should my conscience tweek me towards healthier choice popcorn again then I may change my mind.
