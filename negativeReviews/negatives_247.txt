We have ordered Uncle Rays BBQ chips many times before. Always been pleased, except this order!  Just NOT the same     Seasoning as usual. Generally lacked much for taste! Not sure if they have reduced the seasoning, in their processing? But out of case we bought, we have opened and thrown away 3 bags already, VERY disappointed with this order!
