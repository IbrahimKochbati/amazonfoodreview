I've only really used this for pancakes so far (less one attempt at making chicken fingers   it was ok).  The pancakes are really pretty good.  I've used this recipe:  1 2c. mix, 1 egg, 1 4 tspn. baking powder (keeps it light), 1 1 2 tspn Splenda and enough liquid to reach normal batter consistency (start with 1 4 c. and add more if needed   cream and a little water is ok, but unsweetened soy milk is excellent for this).  Cook in liberal amount of butter and you shouldn't be disappointed.  Makes one really big pancake or several smaller ones!
