I have to admit, this chili mix really surprised me. It's absolutely terrific and very healthy with a lot of fiber. My husband and I love the flavor and consistency, and it's actually perfect exactly as is without doctoring it up. All you need is water and a can of tomato paste! My only addition is a quick shake of cayenne pepper because I love my chili with "heat." Highly recommend. I buy this product from Amazon over and over and over.
