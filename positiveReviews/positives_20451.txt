Our Akita almost died from a congenital digestive defect.  We couldn't find any food that she could tolerate   and definitely no treats that wouldn't make her sick.  (We finally found Wellness dog food, and now she's fine.)          I purchased these originally from Petsmart (who discontinued carrying them) because they were all natural and didn't have some of the main food allergens such as corn, etc.          Our Akita can eat these treats and not get sick   and she (and my other 2 dogs) absolutely LOVE them.  In fact, to ward off begging while we're eating, we keep a bowl of them on the table.  They're very happy to get those instead of scraps!
