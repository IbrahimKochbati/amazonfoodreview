I bought this toy for my 8 month french bulldog a couple of weeks ago and he loves it. I usually set it up for him 2 3 times a week and he is so excited when he sees me getting it ready. At first I was worried that his flat face would prevent him from getting the treats but he has no problem. I would recommend this for anyone that wants to boycott boring toys.
