We are still six years away from the centennial for the Oreo cookie, which was first manufactured by Nabisco in 1912 as something more exciting for people to dip in their tea than the biscuits the English tend to use (it was copyrighted as the "Oreo Biscuit").  The sandwich cookie was quite similar to the Hydrox cookie produced by Sunshine, but Oreo dominated the market to such an extent that they stopped making Hydrox back in 1996. What would be considered the "modern" Oreo cookie was developed in 1952 (originally they were mound shaped, which is why some think the name comes from the Greek word for "hill"), with the two circular chocolate wafers with the sweet white filling commonly called the "cream" in between.          Of course today consumers do not have to restrict themselves to just the tradition Oreo cookie.  There are Oreos with chocolate flavored cream instead of the traditional white, as well as orange colored cream at Halloween and red at Christmas.  You can get Oreos with a double portion of filling, not to mention mixing and matching two flavors of filling (carmel and chocolate, coffee and cream, peanut butter and chocolate, etc.).  You want the original cookie with a coating of chocolate fudge?  They have that, or with white chocolate fudge in winter, and then there is the Uh Oh! Oreo with the flavors of the cookie reversed.          But what if you are interested in watching your weight because once you open a bag of which ever type of Oreos are your personal preference they are just sitting them beginning to be eating?  After all, once they are open they could go stale, and putting them in a cookie jar just makes them more accessible even if it allays fears about freshness.  Nabisco has taken a three prong approach for weight watching Oreo lovers.  You can go with the Reduced Fat Oreo, which is identical to the size of the original but has less fat per serving.  Then there are the Mini Oreos, bite sized versions packaged in snack packs rather than in really think wrapped trays.  Now we can add to that short list the Oreo Thin Crisps.          These are baked chocolate six sided wafer snacks, almost 20 to a pack, that are lightly sprinkled with white specks that are to take the place of the aforementioned cream.  Now, I am someone who likes the cream more than the wafer, so I was wary because I thought scarffing down a bunch of these would be like eating the chocolate wafers without the white cream, but they are lighter in taste than that, even without having the glass of milk handy that I considered essentially when eating the more traditional Oreo cookies.  Since they do have the Oreo taste I can round up on these.  These come in 100 Calorie Packs, to help you draw the line at a nice round number when it comes to caloric intake.  You can six 0.81 oz (23g) packs in a 4.86 oz box.  Each pack contains 0 grams of trans fat, 2 grams of fat, and 0 milligrams of cholesterol.  You will also find one of 100 Healthy Living Tips on the front of the pack (e.g., #56: "Make a meal out of appetizers or side dishes instead of larger main entrees").  Of course, I was thinking of putting some of these in a bowl of vanilla ice cream, but that would really mess up the whole healthy living bit.
