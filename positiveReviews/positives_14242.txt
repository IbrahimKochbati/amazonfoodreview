I read all the reviews & bought this with quite a lot of trepidation.  Gnats are some of the most bothersome bugs on the planet, and I didn't want to have the same experience so many other people have had with this potting mix.          I placed the order for this over the weekend & received it on the 25th.  I opened it today & was extremely relieved to find no gnats flying around inside the bag.  It's too early to say whether there will be, & I will update my review if I get any in my flower pots.          I cannot testify to its growing power as it's the first time I've used Miracle Gro, but I did notice an inordinate amount of settled soil in the bag.  I live with my grandma, and we both had to spend some time  eaking apart the clumps before we could transplant one of her plants.  There were some twigs inside the bag, & I discovered one small rock, but nothing like what all the other reviews mentioned.  However, the soil was slightly damp & felt cool to the touch which was nice since it had been on the porch in the sun for 24 hours before I'd opened it.
