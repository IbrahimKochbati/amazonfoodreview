One drop of this stuff will make almost anyone cry for mercy. It has 1.5 million scoville units which measure heat in food. FYI your average Jalape&ntilde;o Pepper has 2,500 8,000 s.u. A Habanero chili can have upwards of 350k s.u. A Bhut Jolokia (ghost chili) is the hottest known naturally occurring chili and that has around upwards of 1 million s.u. The Final Answer is 50% hotter than the hottest grown chili. If you want something to  eak out at parties this is it. I have yet to give it to someone who hasn't shown physical signs of pain. Even people who eat hot foods on a regular basis will still find this stuff extremely hot. I have had lots of fun with the stuff and would recommend it to anyone.
