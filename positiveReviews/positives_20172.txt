I was excited to try this white sugar alternative. At first, I was worried it would add a coconut flavor but it turns out that it doesn't add any coconut flavor at all. I used this in a classic chocolate chip recipe and our cookies turned out great! The granuals are quite a bit chunkier than a fine baking sugar, but I noticed they melted rather quickly in contact with moisture. Overall, this product is organic, sustainable, and healthier than traditional sugar   plus the price is really good. I'm glad I tried it.
