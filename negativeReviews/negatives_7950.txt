We have been buying these almond biscuits for years from our local grocer and are pretty much addicted to them.  We were delighted to find them recently on Amazon for a better price and ordered a bunch.  Well, they arrived in a smashed cardboard carton with no inside protection, many of the biscuits were crumbled and the ones that survived were stale.  Fortunately we were able to obtain a refund from Amazon but will certainly not order them again.  Bummer! Back to our local grocer!
