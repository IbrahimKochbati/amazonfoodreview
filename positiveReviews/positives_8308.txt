I grew up drinking Lipton loose leaf tea and didn't even realize there was any other for iced tea until I grew up and left home. It's still the best! I almost panicked when the stores quit carrying it and was so relieved to find it here. I hope Amazon reads these reviews and realizes that we *need* them to keep carrying it! And that Lipton keeps on making it. Everyone likes my iced tea and says so and that's because this is the only tea I use.
