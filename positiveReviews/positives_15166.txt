I see a lot of negative comments from other reviews but when I look at the ingredients, the cost, and the value, this is the best food I have found.  We have two dogs and this food does them well. I gradually switched over from Blue Buffalo who raised their prices. The Canidae is a better product in my opinion anyway.  I asked the pet supply store owner, and she said in her years despite the negative reviews, there maybe 2 3 bags have ever been returned in her store.  I'm happy with the product and price, and the dogs like it too.
