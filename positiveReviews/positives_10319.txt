I made the mistake of trying to sprout about a half cup of sprout seeds, and it made so many sprouts it lasted us two weeks!          Really needs some directions on the package in terms of quantity (I'd suggest sprouting a 1 4 cup of seeds to start!).          The sprouts are really great on salads.  Have a little bit of a hot mustard bite.          My only concern is the price.  $13 a pound for sprouts seems a little high to me, even though these are quality sprouts (and free shipping).          So I gave the sprouts four stars based on lack of directions on the package and price.
