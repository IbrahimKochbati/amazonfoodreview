Any dog, no matter their age or size, should be supervised when chewing any edible toy.  Whether it be a rawhide, cow ear, meaty femur or even a stuffed KONG toy.  Dogs that love to chew & can eat a rawhide in a matter of minutes, should not be permitted to have rawhide because they are considered "aggressive chewers".  This does not mean that they are mean or naughty dogs, but more that they are persistent.  These dogs should only be allowed to chew on KONG toys or Nylabone (non flexible) chews.  I have an aggressive chewer myself & those are the only toys he plays with for chewing purposes.          I also have a non aggressive chewer.  He will carry a stuffed toy in his mouth wherever he goes, he's not interested in ripping it to shreds.  He will only chew a rawhide or Nylabone for a few minutes before he gets bored.  Rawhides are safer for these types of dogs because they won't try to eat the piece whole, even still, supervision is a must.          Please take into consideration what kind of chewer you have prior to purchasing this product.  With that said, this is a great product in that it promotes dental health!  They're a tasty treat for our four legged family members and for those of us that don't have the time to  ush our dog's teeth, they do what we can't.
