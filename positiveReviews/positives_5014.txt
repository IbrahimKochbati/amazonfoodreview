I love these banana cookies even though I can eat any other  and ingredient.  Yes, the texture is DIFFERENT, but that's what I really like about them.  It kind of reminds me of mexican wedding cookies  dry, melt in your mouth texture.  They are really expensive compared to name store  and cookies, so I have to maintain my self control and eat only one every few days :(
