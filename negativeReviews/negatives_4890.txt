I ordered the Teenie pack of Greenies that was supposed to come with 96 teenie sized chews. I ended up receiving a pack with 52 teenie sized chews and 8 large chews. I returned the product because I did not receive what I ordered. Amazon couldn't replace my order because they couldn't guarantee I would get the right product if ordered again.
