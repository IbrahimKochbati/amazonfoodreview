I have always made my own corn chowder and have been skeptical about store bought.  BUT!! The Bar Harbor Corn Chowder is VERY TASTY!!     My husband (he likes to think of himself as a chowder connoisseur) enjoys it.     I use soy milk in it but cow's milk will make it richer.  Add a touch of butter and you're good to go!!
