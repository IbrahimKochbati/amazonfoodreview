The ingredients are  own rice syrup, water , sugar,  own sugar, natural flavor, xanthan gum, citric acid. It's called "table syrup". It's not maple syrup and does not pretend to be.     At a ticket price of under 5 bucks, it's a more affordable and MOST natural product of its kind. Not everyone can afford 15 bucks for maple syrup.     My family has been using this table syrup for as long as it's been available. It tastes GREAT...almost the flavor of pure maple syrup.     What is maple syrup anyway? Sugar!
