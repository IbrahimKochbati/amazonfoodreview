We switched to this  and because one of our dog's eyes always teared, and someone said it could be from a corn allergy.  This is one of only a few  ands that is corn free and it cured the teary eye problem quickly.  BLUE  and does not contain corn, but they include garlic in their blend which can cause kidney problems in dogs over time according the veteriniarian.  It smells more natural than Purina One which I had been feeding them and they seem to like it better.  I like that the sales from the food go to charity too.  A good product.
