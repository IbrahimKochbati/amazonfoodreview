i give this a five stars, because it shipped verry quickly , unbelievable, and its verry tasty mate , better than guayaki , and it wont clog your bombilla if you use one with a gourd.  It also came with 2 extra pounds, thats why it cost 24 plus shipping 32, verry worth it. Dont listen to the bad reviewers.
