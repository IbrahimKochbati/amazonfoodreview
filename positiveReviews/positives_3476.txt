I'm a big coffee drinker (much against my better judgement), but due to a stomach condition, I've been "forced" to drink mostly decaf for the last few years. I usually just get the cheapest coffee I can find near my office; after all, I don't make a lot of money and every penny counts. So it was nice to get this Melitta Cafe ground coffee to sample.          When I made my first cup, I was immediately attacted by the pleasant aroma. I put in a little cream and 4 Splendas as I usually do, and found the taste a little on the light side yet quite bitter. Maybe it's because this is decaf, but what I did like was its pureness, something 50 cent coffees usually lack. I have made two cups a day since my first taste and over the last couple of days I've grown to like this coffee. Granted, to me coffee is pretty much like wine in that all the different varieties taste more or less the same except for the level of bitterness, but even I can tell this is gourmet coffee, much better than the ones I get at my local coffee stands or even at McDonald's (when they give out free cups).          For a pack of 3, the price seems decent. If you drink decaf, I think this is quite worth a try.
