Fortunately, before I purchased I read through enough reviews of these k cups to discover that they add some artificial sweetener to them along with sugar.  I'm shocked that the item descriptions don't make this clear.  I consider that important information!          I decided to give them a try, anyway, considering some reviewers thought it was hard to tell.  I realize that many products do this recently, but they usually fall short of hiding that nasty aftertaste.          Sadly, this one does too.  It's close   I can almost enjoy a cup   but it's still unmistakable, especially if you don't consume much artificial sweetener.  (I chew sugar free gum, and that's it for me.)          It's a shame, too, because the chocolate flavor is nice.  In fact, I rated these a 3 simply because my son tolerates the sweetener enough to drink them.  And I was really jazzed about the caramel cappuccino before I found out about the sweetener...but now I won't be buying any.  (Side note: many cappuccino reviewers complained that they're instant coffees that taste like gas station cappuccino   that would be fine with me, if it weren't for the artificial sweetener which those gas station cappuccinos don't have.)          If they begin to offer a line without the artificial sweetener, I'd buy it, but until then I'm staying away from Grove Square products.
