Newman's Own Organic Mints in Wintergreen are my all time favorite mints EVER! I was a frequent Trident bubble gum chewer up until I found out that it contained Aspartame and was on a rabbit hole chase ever since to find a gum replacement that could hold the taste (minus Aspartame)and not harden after a minute. I still have not found one but then I tried Newman's Own several months ago and now it is my all time favorite product. It tastes refreshing, freshens  eathe, all natural ingredients and safe enough to give to my young son. This is an AWESOME little mint that is hard to find in stores, so I'm very grateful Amazon carries it.
