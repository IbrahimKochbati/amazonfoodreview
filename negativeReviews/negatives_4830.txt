I love this, i sometimes go to indian store but i dont find it at times, i wish safeway etc all keep it. These are the best biscuits but unfortunately very very bad packing. these are pretty  ittle and it  eaks easily, this time i got with about 5 of the packs almost fully crushed, 3 were total powdered. I would never take it again from amazon, i get it way cheaper in indian groceries, just that stock there keeps getting over and i have to find the right time to get it . but it is better than eating powder.  So somehow review is complicated, since the product is good and amazon has nothing to do with it, the only thing amazon has to do is handling and shipping, which is very badly done. So unfortunately my bad rating will affect the product, but please remember this is a good product, i am giving bad rating for amazon handling and shipping ONLY.
