I had been searching far and wide for canned pumpkin, but to no avail until I came across this product.  Until finding it on Amazon, I had never heard of this  and before.  After reading some of the reviews, I was hesitant, but I love pumpkin, so I placed my order.          The items came in less than a week (I ordered right before the Memorial Day holiday weekend).  Every can but one (which had the slightest dent) was in excellent condition.  The cans were packed in a cardboard tray, shrink wrapped and then bubble wrapped before being boxed for shipping.          The taste is just right to me    pumpkin, not too light or too strong.  The consistency is not too thin or too thick, but again, just right. The quality is comparable to (if not better than) its  and name competitor.  The product is organic pumpkin, period.          My compliments and gratitude to Farmer's Market Foods. This was my first experience with this product, but I assure you, it will not be my last!
