A word of caution to anyone considering buying these: Read the ingredients first! I made the mistake of thinking they would be the same as the longer (Oberto  and) ones our local Costco used to sell, so I ordered up 10 bags to get the volume discount offered at the time. I knew something wasn't right as soon as I opened up the first bag and got a whiff. Then I read the ingredients and was shocked when I saw that they actually use pork hearts as the top ingredient. To eliminate any doubt, I tasted one.. we've been using them as expensive doggy treats ever since.
