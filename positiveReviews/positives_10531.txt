I've been a McDougall customer since 2004, and I've tried almost all of the food cups.  They are excellent for those who want a vegan, mostly organic alternative, and of course one pays extra for the convenience and vegan organic ingredients.          The taste of the White Bean & Pasta soup is good, especially for a low sodium soup, and it's about as filling as a cup this size will get.  It can be eaten as is or poured over pasta, rice, a baked potato, etc.          My one complaints is that the beans don't always get completely hydrated (watered), and they can end up a bit "crisp".  Letting the product soak longer doesn't seem to help.
