I first used the Keurig machine at work and quickly became hooked.  When leaving my last job I was given a home  ewer as a parting gift by my co workers.  I was thrilled to have one at home as I usually drink coffee at home only on weekends. Before I was always  ewing a larger pot than I needed and throwing a lot out, or drinking more than I really wanted so as not to waste it.  Even though the K cups are more expensive, just knowing I can make one cup of great coffee anytime the mood strikes is great! Sometimes I want one cup after dinner and this is perfect!  I've read some of these reviews talking about the cup sizes; if I select the large cup serving, it almost runs out of a regular medium cup,especially if I pre add a little half & half.  I feel the taste is always consistent.  I like the Donut Shop for mornings and the Tully's Kona Blend for the evenings.  I just purchased the Eko ew and am anxious to try it this weekend.  I'll have to go back to the store and buy beans again!!
