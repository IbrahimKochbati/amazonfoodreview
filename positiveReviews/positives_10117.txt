This is my favorite k cup, and I've tried alot of them!  Love the smoky flavorl  I recommend you buy it straight from Keruig, as a member (which is free) you can get a box of 24 for 17.24.  I always order 3 boxes at a time and get free shipping.  Also like the Italian roast, but is a bit stronger and, I think, harsher flavor.  Where ever you end up buying Prima French Roast, you'll come back for more!
