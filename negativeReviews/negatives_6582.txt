I thought this flavor was a little bland, nothing close to my favorite of raisins, dates, and walnuts.  The oats were fine.  I like that these instant oatmeals are great for on the go and are a better fast  eakfast option than most cold, sugary cereals.  My biggest problem with this oatmeal is the sugar content.  Although one packet might be fine for a toddler, anyone over 8 years old would probably need two packets for  eakfast; however, with 12 grams of sugar in one packet, that means a two packet  eakfast gives you a whopping 24 grams of sugar!  A better option is to make a bowl of oatmeal, not instant, add less sugar or a sugar substitute, then add spices or other ingredients of your choice. It takes a little more time and effort, but the result is a better tasting, healthier oatmeal.
