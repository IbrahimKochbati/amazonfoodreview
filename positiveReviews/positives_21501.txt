I bought this for my boyfriend and it arrived on time, in great condition with nice packaging. The bamboo was not damaged and it was healthy. The container is good quality and the detail for the panda was great. The only thing that he wished for was that there be stones or some thing for the container so that the bamboo does not lean towards one side, but he had some handy regardless. Lovely bamboo container and it was a good price for one with a panda on it. :)
