My son and I are converts. No more of the snacks, hot fires,  potato clips, etc.  with artificial colors and flavors.  They have been replaced.  We love these. I had no idea what they tasted like when I first ordered them.  I just went by the other reviews.  I am so glad I did.  We can't find them locally, here in New Mexico. My son was addicted to Hot Fries but always admitted they made him feel terrible after he would eat them. Now, he does not feel terrible after he eats these.  They have a little soft  crunch, but not too much and they do not leave you with that icky taste in your mouth afterwards.  These are all natural so I actually feel good eating them. No guilt!
