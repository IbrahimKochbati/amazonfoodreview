As a Physician and Surgeon   I am very concerned with the physical fitness of my patients. The Gayles Truffles are, without question, the best "low cal" chocolates I have ever tasted. My favorites are the milk chocolates, but they are all very good. Only drawback   they are expensive, and the portions are small, but satisfying.     Dr. J. Gerber, Los Angeles
