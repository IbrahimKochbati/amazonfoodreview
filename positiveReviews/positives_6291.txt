It is amazing to see the even split on reviews. I have a Ragdoll cat who was having the occasional hairball. He loves these treats and has only had one hairball since (shortly after starting these). I couldn't be happier with the product.          I got them at Walmart. The current amazon seller seems to be a rip off.
