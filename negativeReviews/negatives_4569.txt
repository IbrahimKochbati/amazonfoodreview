Nothing else matters, the engineering on this thing will fail, and soon.  No matter how convenient or easy, no matter the choices of coffee, forget everything else  there is a huge problem with the way they made the maker itself.  The hinged clam shell of the K cup holder uses an amazingly poorly designed plastic track.  This track is formed in a complex set of curves that the mated piece must follow.  The pieces are simply bare, dry, plastic.  Over time they start to drag and catch as they try to follow this complex curve as you open and close the clam shell.  When the inevitable dragging and catching starts, the K cups suffer a jagged puncture from the upper piercing water fill piece.  This is catastrophic because anything less than a perfect small hole allows coffee grounds to flood out the top of the K cup during the  ew.     Once this happens, you will never know if the next  ew will work normally or you'll get coffee grounds everywhere.     Just Google Keurig hole problem.  It is common and after taking this thing apart to see how it all works, obvious that the design is flawed.
