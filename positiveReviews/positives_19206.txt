My dog enjoyed getting her treats from this toy.  I had watched some videos of dogs playing with the star before I purchased it and those dogs were pushing the star around with their paw.  Mine just nudged it with her nose and was able to get all of the treats. I think I can tighten the tension on it but I haven't tried that yet.  Overall it was fun but not super challenging.
