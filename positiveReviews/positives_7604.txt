Our baby is very happy with his Similac organic ready to drink formula.     He is also very happy with the regular formula in the blue bottle, which we feed him when the organic is not available.          He did not really like the formula when we had to mix it from powder.     He is ten months old now and he rarely spits up, always smiles and is the most content baby anybody has ever seen.          I attribute that to awesome parenting and not to the formula.
