Newman's Own is the best dog food ever, in my opinion. My 12 year old white German Shepard eats and digests this food wonderfully. Before changing to this food a few years ago, she had digestive problems often, even though she was fed a "so called good  and name food".  My three year old pittie girl also eats this food, and loves it .. she is in perfect health. I would recommend it to anyone. My next door neighbor orders it now from Amazon for his pittie girl. Amazon is a wonderful place to purchase dog and cat food, groceries, and anything you need .. the prices are always good, and the specials are great! The specials are the best ever, and I was shocked to find out that a today "Friday" special price on Newman's Own dog food was automatically reflected in my subscribe and save item price of the Newman's Own.  Even though I just received a bag yesterday, I ordered two more today, and some Newman's Own cat food.  What other retailer would automatically do that for you .. none that I know of.  Amazon .. please continue to offer the Newman's Own dog food .. I would be lost without the delivery, since it is difficult for me to get out and shop and carry large items like bags of dog food.  Thank you for being here for me and Snowey and Sophie.       Linda
