I am giving the sorghum a three only because I did not know how or what to do with the product.  There was no instructions sent in with the product.  I wanted to make popcorn out of them but I did not know how much oil or how much time or on what heat setting.  I tried several times and it was a complete failure.  My girlfriend was waiting to see how it tasted before she ordered some.  It was too hard for us to figure out on our own so now I have a bag of sorghum siting in my cabinet taking up space.  Anyone out there know how to pop sorghum?
