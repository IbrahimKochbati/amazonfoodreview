We have been feeding this to our dogs for over a year.  Over the past few months, we have had a problem with the cases of Grammy's Pot Pie cans.  Some cans were full of chunks of fat and a thick lard like gravy with no veggies, and some cases were fine with chicken and veggies,etc. What happened to truth in labeling?  We also had the problem with the cans being only half full sometimes. Our dogs were getting bad diarhea from the fat in the food so we had to stop giving them Merrick.       They need to start testing their food again.  It used to be great.  Look at the old reviews from last year and before.
