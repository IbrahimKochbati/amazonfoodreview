I have a 2 yr old Lab and a 1 yr old mutt I adopted from the humane society.  They both loved this bone, it was devoured within an hour.  With that said however the bone was a little smaller then I had imagined.  I probably won't purchase this again and insted will go with the Smoke House Mammoth bone which I also tried when I ordered this   they both love that bone as well and it's lasting over a week already.
