I bought this for my 10 month old son.  He loves pumpkin and I ran out of the fresh pumpkin I pureed and froze.  He didn't like another  and so I thought I'd try this one.  He likes it a lot and it serves its purpose.  My only complaint is that it has chunks of pumpkin skin in it.  Some of the pieces are large enough that I have to fish them out so my son doesn't choke on it.  Other than that, it's exactly as advertised and when we run out of the first order, I will buy more.
