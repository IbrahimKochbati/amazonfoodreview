This product came in most handy due to my big appetite for a slim person and I am a diabetic of about 1 1 2 years now Type 2.  It became very useful for me to be able to make my pumpkin  ead, cocoa  ead, as well as experiment in making other baking goodies with this products.  The vast majority and I mean vast majority of baking ingredients such as meal, flour,  eads, i.e. are so so loaded with carbs and diabetics are limited to the amount of carbs one can eat during a meal and throughout the day.  This product "gives back" ways of baking and making things now that we cannot eat anymore, should NOT eat anymore and if one does a very limited and very small portion!  And last, the product baked up just find with me and taste great in my recipes and baked goods!  P.S., I just wished the cost was a tad bit lower.  THANKS!!!
