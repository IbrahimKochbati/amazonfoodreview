Both my dogs love all the Merrick canned food varieties, but this one seems to be their favorite. Even my hard to impress little JRT is very enthusiastic about this food. I like that although it's a stew type food (as opposed to loaf style) the gravy isn't runny. It's a thick, meaty gravy that makes the food "stretch" a lot more when I add it to their kibble. 12 cans last a little over a month for us.
