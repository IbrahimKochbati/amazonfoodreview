Mmm,  The other two reviewers seem to be lacking a key piece of information.          THIS IS NOT THE SAME THING AS GINGER ALE.          Jamaican Ginger Ale is a lot closer in taste to ginger beer which is a LOT stronger and a lot more potent.          Personally i really like blue sky over zevia's ginger ale.  After drinking a six pack of this stuff over the course of a week i went back to try zevia again and found that zevia was mild and tasteless by comparison.  The blue sky has a really strong flavor and even burns the inside of my nose a little bit...  but for me that's a good thing.  I like more powerful tasting drinks.          Very good stuff,  i will continue to buy Blue Sky.
