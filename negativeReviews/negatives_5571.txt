Now that I have a coffee grinder, I buy whole bean coffee nowadays, but this Illy pre ground coffee was adequate back in the day. The instructions on the side of the can    I can't remember what the instructed proportions are    will produce unusually weak coffee. For drip coffee, I recommend the standard 2 Tbsp coffee per 6 oz. water. This grind is too fine for a French press, but it's good for paper filters in drip coffee machines. I hear that Illy packs their coffee in nitrogen to help preserve flavor and aroma. I don't know if that's true or not, but the canisters Illy produces have a metal pop top seal under the lid, so you're probably getting fresher coffee from Illy than you'd get from other  ands of ground coffee.
