This is a high quality tea.  When you first open the can, the Bergamot scent will floor you   it is strong, but not in a bad way, it is beautifully citrus filled.  The tea leaves are the nicest I have seen in a packaged tea (not from a specialty tea store I mean).  No fragments or  eakage, just nice, clean full leaves.          Brews up just as nice as it looks, very smooth flavor, no bitterness at all.          I recommend giving this a try if you are looking for a new tea  and, it will not disappoint!
