I grind these seeds up in a coffee grinder & give them to my dogs.  They are a natural dewormer, & add good fiber to their diet.  We've sauteed them with some seasonings in a pan & the kids will eat them, they taste similar to sunflower seeds.  You can also put them in the oven, or eat them raw.  The seeds are good quality, you do have to either freeze or refrigerate them to keep them fresh.  Pretty expensive though..
