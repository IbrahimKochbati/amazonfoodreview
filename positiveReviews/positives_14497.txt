Although olive oil is healthy for you, I guess I've never found one I really loved the flavor of  either NO flavor or tastes a bit like paint thinner  or the price was astronomical; whatever the case I'd become quite frustrated in my search.  Then I learned that when an oil smokes, it releases carcinogens into the air and free radicals within the oil.  Olive oil should NOT be heated beyond 325 degrees F.  So, in searching for an oil with a higher smoke point PLUS staying within a "paleo" eating way of life I discovered Avocado Oil.  This is my new holy grail of oils:  it's got a smoke point of 510 degrees F, tastes wonderful, is made from a healthy fat, looks gorgeous in a homemade vinaigrette due to its beautiful green color.          This oil should be refrigerated when opened; the cans have an expiration date of 8 2011  they'll be long used up by then.  When my cans arrived, they had dented in a little bit  which I promptly got out by gently squeezing the cans (the metal is quite pliant).  I did advise Amazon that they need to wrap the cans in heavy bubble wrap to prevent this.  Somehow this oil is not yet well known  but it should and will be.  Hope Amazon keeps stocking it.          I would DEFINITELY, HIGHLY recommend this product!!!!
