I am a bit surprised to be writing such a high recommendation for microwave popcorn. I did not have too much of an expectation.  The popcorn is very flavorful and not overly greasy, buttery or salty.  The kernels pop a very  ight fluffy white.  I also noticed that the design and material of the bag is quite different and this probably played a part in preventing the burning that I had experienced in so many other  ands of microwave popcorn.  I also did not get a large number of unpopped kernels.  There were some partially popped kernels   but those are my favorite b c they are so crunchy.
