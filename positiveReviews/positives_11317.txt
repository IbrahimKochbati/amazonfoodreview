Like many coffee drinkers, I LOVE coffee and if you're reading this, you probably love good coffee too. I've tried all sorts of  ands from the high end to the no names in search of a consistent, enjoyable and  utally strong cup each time. I like it potent and use 1 cup of grounds for a 12 cup pot...... no matter what  and I use. Of all of the  ands I've tried, Black Silk is my absolute favorite as it comes out dark, oily and heavy but not too bitter. Keep in mind, I like a sweetened and creamed coffee, this will matter to some readers.          For a real treat, pick up (or order from Amazon) the International Delights French Vanilla creamer (better if bought from the dairy section.) Pair these two together and you have a taste treat that's truly addictive.
