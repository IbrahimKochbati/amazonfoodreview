When I got this it was melted through the package and what wasn't completely destroyed was stuck to the inside of the wrappers.  You would think that if you are going to ship chocolate in the summer time you would pack it in something cold.  I wasn't very happy with it.  I love the candy and once you peeled it off the insides of the wrappers it was good.
