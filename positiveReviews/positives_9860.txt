I have a soft spot for this coffee.     As mentioned before, it has no subtlety, and you won't be picking out notes of blackcurrant or orange blossom or whatever   this is highly roasted stuff that just tastes of strong, strong coffee. I've had plenty of supermarket coffees in the past that were terrible due to being over roasted to death (perhaps to disguise rubbish beans). Somehow this Costco Rwandan one works though, as a straightforward rich, bitter coffee. It's so charred that when I put it in my hand grinder the beans just kind of shattered, giving no resistance.     Its main selling selling point for me is that it works nicely as a robust espresso (in my Solis Crema SL90), and as a punchy filter coffee.     PS it's cheap.     Mmm.
