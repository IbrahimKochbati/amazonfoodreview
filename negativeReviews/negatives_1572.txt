Described as an alternative to soda, Switch is a carbonated fruit drink made from 100% natural juices (although not necessarily the ones listed as the flavor).  Made mostly out of apple and grape juice, The Switch Orange Tangerine does in fact have an (oversweet)orange tangerine flavor    followed by a strong vitamin aftertaste. It tasted like drinking a soda made from crushed Flintstone vitamins.          Want a better carbonated fruit drink?  Pour half a glass of orange juice and add club soda.
