I love Salt and Vinegar potato chips, but can't eat them on my low carb diet. These pork skins are a wonderful replacement for those high carb snacks. The salt and vinegar flavoring in the pork skins is a bit more muted than what I am used to finding in most potato chip  ands, but is definitely adequate to soothe my cravings for a crunchy salt and vinegar snack. The pork skins are light and fluffy, with almost none of the hard rinds that can be found in some  ands of pork skins. If the flavoring was a bit more pronounced, I would give this snack five stars.
