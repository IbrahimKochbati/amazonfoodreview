I started a gluten free diet during the summer of last year. These Glutino crackers were actually one of the first gluten free items I had purchased. I must say I think they taste really good, and my mom who is a big Ritz Cracker fan even loves to have them on occasion. They go great with Dr. McDougall's Vegetable Soup or even just on their own as a snack. My  other who is one of the most pickiest eaters I've ever met even likes Glutino crackers. I haven't tried the other available flavors yet, just the regular cracker.
