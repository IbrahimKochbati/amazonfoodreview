The items you get with this package are good quality.  The kids think it's pretty cool that they are eating "astronaut food".  Others have said they are expensive for what you get, but it's  kind of a novelty item and the variety was good for the price.  My problem was that the package showed up missing 5 of the listed items.  First reaction was to return to Amazon for a refund, but instead I emailed the seller and told them my Amazon shipment was missing items.  Within 24 hours I received a reply asking for my address so that they could ship me the missing items.  I received the missing items in just a couple days.  Sure, it would have been nice to received the items together all at once, but the seller making good on an honest mistake was greatly appreciated!
