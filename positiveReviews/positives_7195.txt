Have a senseo coffee maker given to me a few years ago. For more than a year, could not find pods sold any more in local supermarkets   even at the big W. Just happened to come across them at Amazon & went on auto ship every few months for additional savings. I have always liked the French vanilla so no problem there. Still like fresh  ewed better but if you want a quick cup of coffee,these are perfect. I'm just happy that I did not jettison the coffee maker & will next look for the Sumatra pods, my other favorite.
