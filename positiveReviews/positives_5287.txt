It seems that soda wasn't as good as when I was a kid, and people have pointed out that it might be the high fructose corn syrup that is making the taste more dull.  Well, this orange soda is made with real sugar, as well as a few extra healthy things, and the taste is much, much better than the regular orange sodas you might find otherwise.          The price is about in line with what you'll find in a soda can and the taste is great.  Why would you drink the HFCS mentioned earlier that is just horrible for your body when you have this option?  I highly recommend it, I thought it was quite fabulous.
