Love'em,  love'em, love'em,...these crackers are indeed awesome and especially with cottage cheese & pineapple! So glad Amazon carries them cause all the major grocers in my area do not...probably because they are too expensive! It's possible they could agree to carry at the Oriental market if I asked them cause the last time I was there these were not in stock!  I didn't panic then because another grocer in my area did carry them, but now not even them!  Therefore, I will be placing an order thru Amazon....it's cheaper anyway!!
