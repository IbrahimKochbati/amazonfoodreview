The product arrived without much delay but when I compared it with same product I had bought locally I was surprised to see that the pieces were much thinner and smaller.  The packaging was also different than what was in the picture.  My dogs are not as interested in these as the locally bought ones.  I would not by this product from this vendor again.  Nor would I purchase other products from this vendor do to my experience.
