I bought it particularly for my wife who enjoys the flavored iced coffees when we are on ther road.  Now wnen we are home and she gets in the mood for an iced coffee with the hazelnut flavor....no problem.  I just make an extra amount of  ewed coffee in the morning and put the extra in a bottle and place it in the frig. Then I use 1&1 2 ounces of Torani Syrup, 1&1 2 ounces of milk and fill the rest of the typical water glass with the chilled coffee.  My wife loves it, I do not have to drive out to the store and it is very cost effective.  I will definitely purchase more!
