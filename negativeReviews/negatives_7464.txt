I had been buying these treats for my cavachon for the past two years. He loved them.          The last batch was of noticeably lower quality...dry and crunchy rather than moist and chewy. I don't know if this is due to the shift in manufacturing from the US to China or coincidental. In any event, I will not be buying these any more and have switched to other treats.          Note, Amazon would not let me return this item, and I am within the 30 day purchase period. I'm not pleased.
