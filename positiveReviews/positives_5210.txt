I sampled a can of Switch Orange Tangerine and found it to be a tasty beverage. As advertised, it is a "...balance between juice and carbonated" with a light carbonation so it doesn't taste like Orange Crush or Fanta but not like orange Gatorade either. The 8.3 oz can has 140 calories, with a 12% DV carb sugar content but 100% Vitamin C and 20% Vit A. It's marketed as "100% juice" coming mostly from filtered concentrates. No sugar added, no corn syrup, no preservatives, no artificial colors, gluten free, if you're concerned with all that. Most important is that it tastes good and I would try it again.
