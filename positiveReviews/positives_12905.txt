I have always been somewhat of a soda aficionado since the days of Pepsi, Dr pepper etc. My grandparents owned a little corner grocery store so I'd get to try some of the new sodas that came out.  I really enjoyed Switch Soda .its something different. Taking juice, putting some carbonation in it. Almost in a vague way reminds me of those sparkling grape juice drinks you get around the holidays if you don't drink wine. Its very good. I would definitely buy it again. However the no sugar added part can be a bit "misleading" as you as the label states 33 grams per serving but it's only one serving per can but us diabetics should probably only drink this when we have low sugars like I just did bonus is no high fructose corn syrup which isn't very good anyhow. I liked this and would buy more to keep around the house the days I have my sugar lows as It didn't seem to be to overpowering to me. I liked the kiwi,berry as I am a fan of strawberry and kiwi both. I thought personally it was a very interesting soft drink . I really like this infusion stuff they have these days like Dr pepper put  cherry. chocolate diet one year ago and such. Switch kind if is like that. I personally prefer a fruited flavored carbonated beverage anyhow over say a plain cola type flavored one. I thought this was a change from the regular diet Pepsi and diet sierra mist i am used to drinking .I would pick these up if i seen them in a market or on here someday.  Only con I can really think of at the moment for a case off here its 22 bucks that is kinda steep for the economy were living in right now but if they sold them individual it be easier on the pocket book or pick one up in a store now and then when I see it. I really enjoyed the blends of the fruit flavor and the carbonation, like I mentioned it was really good and something different. I would definitely try this again.
