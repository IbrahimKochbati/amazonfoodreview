My mom discovered these during her last trip to Italy and  ought some home. Great combination of chocolate and coffee. I had to buy a new box as my dog (yes, he is still alive) snatched her purchase off the counter while we were out and ate the whole box, wrappers and all. The best part is the surprise burst of coffee as you bite into the chocolate! Warn others not to try to bite in half. Either venture for the entire piece of candy, or bite a corner off to enjoy the coffee and then finish the chocoloate!
