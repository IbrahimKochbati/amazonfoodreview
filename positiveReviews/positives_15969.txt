Fantastic coffee beans. I made today 2 espresso shots with my Rocky and Andreja Premium at 10 and 9 bars of pressure. These were the best 2 espresso shots I've ever had. Far better than any Coffee house and better than other coffee beans including Illy with a fraction of Illy price. I'll definitely use again in the future.  Thanks Amazon, thanks Lavazza.
