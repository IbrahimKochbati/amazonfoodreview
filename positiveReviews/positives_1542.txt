We'll see how these work out in our family over time. I'm not sure that I am disciplined enough to make good use of them, although it might be a good technique for teaching my dog. They appear to be good for what they are, a very tiny, but healthy, reward. Right now I can visualize them being used as a reward for following commands, a training tool. I was surprised at how tiny these treats were. They seem to taste good enough, but they are miniscule! They are just a fraction longer than a small paperclip and about half as wide, maybe 1 4 as thick.          My dog was a little annoyed, but took it when I gave it to him. That was yesterday. Today he came in excited to get his "treat", looked at it as if to say, "You've GOT to be KIDDING!" Then he took it and ate it. A little later I offered him another one. He put it on the floor and looked hopefully at his stash of larger treats, but when he didn't get one, he went back and took this one.          I think these might be good for rewards for obeying commands. Treats? That's stretching it.          They may also be good for my son's dog who rarely gets treats because she's overweight and would eat the whole entire refrigerator full of food if allowed. At least she would get a treat. Large treats take her 5 seconds. She'll probably inhale these, one second max.          I like the fact that these are low fat, with no added salt, no refined sugar, no artificial flavors, colors or preservatives. It says, "Treats Baked With Natural Peanut Butter."
