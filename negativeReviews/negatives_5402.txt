I think it is going to take an amazing coffee to get me away from my Folger's classic roast and the occasional Eight O'Clock vanilla.  However, I understand that this coffee is meant for those who probably do not enjoy the aforementioned  ands so keep that in mind when making your own coffee choices in life.
