I have a 13 week old Goldendoodle who is fiesty and playful. We have several interactive toys and this is one of Boomer's favorite! We use it all the time but lately my husband who takes care of him in the early morning has been away so I've been on duty 24 7, after his 5 a.m. potty I fill it up with his kibble and put him back in his crate and it keeps him busy for a while and then he falls back to sleep. It's worth it's weight in gold for us.          The bottom unscrews so you can put the treats in from there and the ventilation holes allows for the dogs to get a good whiff of the treats. It's more challenging than the amaze a ball and keeps our puppy busy.
