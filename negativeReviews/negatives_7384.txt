I have ordered Yogi Chai Green Tea several times with excellent satisfaction. I ordered the same thing this time but with serious dissapointment, I got Yogi Chai Black tea. I'm sorry I didn't notice the "Black" on the invoice that I printed. I feel partly responsible for the error. So I decided to keep the Black because it was at least worth keeping rather than reorder and wait for another delivery.
