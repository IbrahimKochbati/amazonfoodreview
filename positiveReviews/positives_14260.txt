I lived in spain for a while and let me tell you, the chocolate I ate was not French or Belgian, it was dark chocolate kit kat bars. Although I admit the Swiss are parsecs ahead, these little dark kit kats are SO GOOD. The intense dark flavor and the rich creamy center to contrast it with... you add the awesome cookie wafer layers and you have a snack you can munch on a little at a time as a special indulgence! And the best part is you can chew it for a quick sugar rush or melt it away in your mouth and play with the flavors and textures for a long time!          I thought I wouldn't find any locally until I saw this! This bag is a good price and has variety in it in case you get sick of the dark ones (who am I kidding that won't happen). The other kinds in this bag can help you ration out the dark ones better... OR... you can take them to work and "share" your stash (more like getting rid of the other ones while earning some points with your co workers :P)
