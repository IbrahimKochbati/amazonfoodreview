I love Nana's GF lemon cookies, so I figured I'd try these berry vanilla bars too.  They're a nice, soft texture but I am not crazy about the taste.  I feel strange about the berry flavoring in a cookie with no real berries, just little dried crunchies sporadically in the cookie.  I think I will try the chocolate bars next time around.
