I have tried all kinds of food with my 3 dogs, and when I started giving them Merrick, their stools decreased in size, their coats gleam, and their energy is contagious.  I will never feed my babies another  and of food.  Worth every cent to keep my dogs happy and healthy.  Turducken and the Rainbow Trout dishes are their personal favorites.
