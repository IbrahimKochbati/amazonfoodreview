I didn't know what I was missing until I tried this syrup. I've been buying real maple syrup for years, mostly Grade A and some Grade B here and there, but nothing compares to this syrup. The flavor is fabulous. It's rich with a strong caramel taste. It's also thicker than any maple syrup I've ever had, which is nice because I don't accidentally flood my plate with it. The bottle is easy to pour from as well. The price is great for organic. I will be purchasing this again and again.
