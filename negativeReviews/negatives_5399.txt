My sister in law was up for a visit this weekend, so I thought it's be a perfect time to test out this coffee.  Neither of us were impressed.  It didn't have a great flavor and she thought the texture was a bit oily.  As far as low acid goes, it did seem like it would be good in that department, but the taste made it so it wasn't worth drinking.
