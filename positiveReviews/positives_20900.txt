I have not been able to get these in the US since I left Germany 54 years ago,then found them in a Russian Deli in Washington State.I was very happy to be able to order them On Amazon after our return back home.Every one of their flavors beats anything we produce here.     Plus with typical Amazon customer service shipping was speedy and they arrived in perfect shape.
