I just tried this  ead mix today   I bought it from my local store because I was concerned of it not working out.     Well, I needn't have worried as this is the most delicious  ead   I made it the old fashioned way in my oven and it turned out better than how I remember Wheat Bread tasting!          I can't wait to have peanut butter sandwiches and BLT's again!
