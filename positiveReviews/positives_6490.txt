Taste is a personal thing, isn't it.  So I'll just tell you(as a gauge) my all time favorite K cup is Timothy's Midnight Magic a "california roast" (which is dark). I'm partial to dark roasts and probably would not have even bothered with this Sorrento, but a friend had it, so I tried it, and lo and behold   I'm very glad I did. I find this blend even better than Puck's "Kopei Ray" which is his dark roast. There's a whole lot of good flavor here   the word "luscious" comes to mind. This one's not available every where and comes at a slight cost premium. I say it's worth it. These will be a regular for me. PS: A suggestion (which seems apparent); as with any k cup, when you try a new blend, use the plain old 1 cup setting to check it out undiluted the first time.
