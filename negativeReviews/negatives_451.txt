When I read the reviews from other customers, I was excited about ordering and trying this mix. This morning we made waffles with both Stonewall Kitchen mix and Bisquick. The waffles from Stonewall were ok  and so were the waffles from Bisquick. The waffles were served to several people for tasting and everyone felt the same.          The agreement was that Stonewall Kitchen product was not worth the significant extra cost. Furthermore, it is not available in our local super market whereas Bisquick is stocked. This will be a one time purchase for us.
