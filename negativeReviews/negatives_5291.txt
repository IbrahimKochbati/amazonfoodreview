I love Barry's Gold tea, and everyone I turn on to it becomes hooked.  HOWEVER, this 6 pack turned out to be very stale, with an "enjoy by" date just two months away.  This tea had been sitting in a warehouse for about a year, it seems.  I'd rather have stale Barry's than NO Barry's, but it was a big disappointment.
