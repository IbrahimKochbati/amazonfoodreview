The product is good, the meat and cheese were as good I remember for pass years.  Unfortunately I found the amount of product very small.  There was more packaging then product.  What I mean is that the packaging made it look like you were getting more them there actually was.  I remember is years past you were able to get more for the money and in this case I felt is was a lot less even in today's economy.
