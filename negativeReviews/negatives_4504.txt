I really like the Happy Baby "Chick Chick" pouches and thought this would be a great way to introduce seafood to our baby. However, the consistency is much different   much thicker than the chicken pouch, and the smell! Well you definitely know it's seafood! It reminds me much too much of cat food.          All is not lost   our little guy would eat it, provided I dunked each bite in some pureed sweet potato or squash first. But, I don't think we'll be buying this flavor again.
