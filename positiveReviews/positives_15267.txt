Belle's Biscuits are fantastic.  My eight month old granddaughter LOVES them.  They are safe and really ease her teething discomfort.  We freeze them to extend their shelf life and she enjoys them right out of the freezer.  Prepare for a mess, though; after an hour gumming these delicious biscuits she and her seat need a thorough washing!  The only thing that would make them better is if they were eligible for free Prime shipping!
