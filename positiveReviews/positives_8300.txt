My Italian grandmother got me hooked on Lipton Loose Tea as a child. Tea is important to me  I never have gotten into coffee.  It has been increasingly more difficult to find Lipton Loose in supermarkets, so I have tried to find something to replace it  more expensive, "fancier" teas just aren't as good.  This is a great product  sooo much better than tea bags.  We like it hot & or iced.  People always ask me "What kind of tea is this?" and then are so surprised to find out that it is good old reliable Lipton.  Tea lovers  don't be snobs!  Give Lipton Loose Tea a try.  Thanks Amazon for carrying this product!
