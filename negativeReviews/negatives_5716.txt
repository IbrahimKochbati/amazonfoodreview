Shake N Bake is one of those products that has a limited market. While I like the crunch factor, it can be hard to keep the chicken from getting soggy on the bottom. It's really a glorified  eading which is about as easy to make as boiling water. If you like it fine, but for me I'd rather make a dish from scratch.
