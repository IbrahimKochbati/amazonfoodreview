Since I love both strawberries and kiwis, I thought this one would be perfect for me. Well, I was wrong. It basically tastes like bubbly fruit punch, not exactly strawberry kiwi. Looking at the ingredients list, it shouldn't surprise.... it's a mixture of fruits, kiwi and strawberry being on the bottom of the list.          I do recommend the cherry Switch drink, but that's the only one out of three that I liked.
