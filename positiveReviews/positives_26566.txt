I just bought the Keurig B70 for my husband (and myself!) for Valentines Day. We opened our  ewer and chose the Caribou blend for our first ever K cup. We were surprised at how incredibly good it was! We both enjoy a good cup of medium dark roast coffee, and this one is definetly our favorite.. I will be sending for more Caribou blend soon.. way to go Caribou!
