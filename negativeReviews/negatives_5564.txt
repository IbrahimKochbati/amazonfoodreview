I've tried both versions of Pistachio Jell O (with and without sugar). I understand eating the sugar free version for health reasons, but it's sadly lacking, and not just because of the lack of sweetness.          The regular version:      Is thicker (more like a custard)      Has a stronger pistachio flavor      Has more actual pistachio bits (the sugar free version has maybe 1 4 as many)          Either way, pudding is a great comfort food if you're looking for a tasty snack.
