I have to admit I got pretty excited when I saw this as I've been desperate for a pork roll egg and cheese sandwich since moving from NJ to the DC Area, but all the reviews here just talk about their love for pork roll or unwillingness to pay for it? Has anyone actually ordered from this vendor? I'm seriously considering ordering this to fill my Jersey Breakfast void, but I do not want to spend $96 for pork roll if it gets delivered to me spoiled or something.
