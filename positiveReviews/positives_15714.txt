First of all, I am subscribed to receive two boxes of the variety pack every month. My cats LOVE the food and refuse to eat other canned food. I have tried to give them more expensive, better quality food but they only want Petite Cuisine.          That said, I am quite disappointed at P.C.'s customer service. After researching on menadione, I emailed P.C. and asked if they plan to not use menadione in near future. I never heard back from them. Before this, I received an email from them with a coupon code. I tried to copy and paste the code on their web site and it didn't work. I emailed their CS and they told me that the coupon was working. Come to find out, they misspelled the coupon on the email. The code contained the word "cuisine" and they misspelled it. I emailed them back about it and they didn't responded nor sent out another email with the correction. Very disappointing indeed...          In the future, if I find another  and that did not contain menadione and had better customer service, and I would instantly switch over to the new  and. Well, my cats have to like the new food too, which is why I haven't able to give them something else yet.
