We got the Tug a Jug this morning and have used it twice to dispense my dog's  eakfast and dinner. She never quite figured out the "tug" method of getting the food out, but she did find ways to get the food out by nosing it around on the floor and grabbing the kibble out with her tongue when it reached the neck of the bottle. However, she gave up this morning with about half her  eakfast still in there, which is surprising because she LIVES for food! For dinner  she started crying at the bottle because she got so frustrated with it! I never heard her do that before, so I decided to help her a little. However, when I wasn't watching she chewed all the way through the rope. It's still a usable toy, but I guess she'll never figure out the "tug" method now. It's been about 50 min and she's still working to get all of her dinner out, so I guess I'd say this is a good toy. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 stars is I think you could use one of your old Nalgene bottles and put dog food in it and it would work the same way. The jug is made of Nalgene I think.
