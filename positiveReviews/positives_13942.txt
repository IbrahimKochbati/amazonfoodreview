I bought PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter to mix in with my protein shakes.  It tastes like regular peanut butter at a fraction of the calories.  Using this cuts around 150 calories out of my shakes and leaves all the taste.  2 tablespoons is only 45 calories with 5 grams of protein.  2 tablespoons of regular peanut butter is around 200 calories depending on the  and.  I'm definitely gonna keep this stuff around.
