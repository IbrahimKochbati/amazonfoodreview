I consider myself a big fan of both Reese's and Whoppers so I was excited when I saw this new product.  However, after going through one box over a few days, I find this to be a major disappointment.  The product is very waxy and doesn't have enough peanut butter taste (package says "Peanut Butter Flavored" which should have been a red flag to begin with).  Maybe this product could be improved if the company 1) adds real peanut butter and 2) tries a double layer coating of chocolate and peanut butter since this is the winning combination for the famous Reese's peanut butter cups.
