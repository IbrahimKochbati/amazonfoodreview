i bought this in a local grocery store of mine today in curiosity, i expected it to be frosting and not in anyway buttery (it just didnt seem possible) i popped off the top of the jar and smelled it. It had a very weak smell i still wasnt expecting much i got a butter knife and slapped on a thick bit of it onto a graham cracker i then proceeded to eat it. WOW this stuff tastes great!!! it has a buttery texture and a nice cocoa taste it isnt horribly sweet but a very subtle chocolate taste, this is great as a dessert with graham crackers or  eakfast with toast and a very cold glass of milk. and its a great treat for kids if they arent sugar junkies and can take a less sweet product. overall i would reccomend this 100%
