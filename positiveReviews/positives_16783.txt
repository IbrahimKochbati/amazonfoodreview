I ordered this oil from "Enchanted Wilderness...Catey13" and am not sorry that I did!  I absolutely love lavender and when I finally recieved this oil, it smelled just as I imagined or better!  The concentration is strong and just a few drops go a really long way.  I've already used it in bath salts, a body scrub, a face moisturizer, linen spray and glycerin water and the bottle is still almost completely full.  Seems like this amount could last me for years!  I use the linen spray on my bed and it really makes the whole room smell wonderful and the bed seems "fresher" for a longer time between weekly washings.  The price was very reasonable and I even received a surprise sample of some rose geranium oil and some recipes and suggested uses with my order.  Also, the bottle does not have a dropper top, but there was a pipette included which works just fine.  Looking forward to trying it in lavender short ead cookies next.  Would definitely order this again!
