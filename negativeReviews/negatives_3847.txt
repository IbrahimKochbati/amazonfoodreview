I tried this, just one can, and am glad I had not bought more.  I do admire the company for coming up with an alternative to typical soft drinks but it's not for me.  I'd describe it as a sickeningly sweet syrup with very little carbonation added.  Plenty of carbonation is essential to a soft drink, it makes it sparkly and refreshing, plus it counteracts the sweetness.  As I said I'm glad it was just one can, my only regret is that I wasted 1.5 ounces of perfectly good vodka trying to make it more palatable and it didn't.
