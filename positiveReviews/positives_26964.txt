I gotta say..... I enjoyed this bag of jerky. I ordered the sweet and hot and it was just as good as any other beef jerky  and I have ever had. Was it greasy? Yeah, a bit. Not any more or less than others. It was moist and tender more than greasy. Did it have fat on it? Yeah. A few pieces, but honestly, those taste the best to me. I guess I like all kinds of beef jerky except for the dried out, harder than leather kinds. I don't mind having to chew, but I can't stand the type that is almost too hard to eat. This was not like that. It was moist, tender and juicy with some good flavor. I am getting it again. Might not be the best that is out there, but it is pretty good.
