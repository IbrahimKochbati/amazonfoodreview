I decided to give a try to roasting my own beans, and so bought these relatively cheap green beans.  I just used a heavy stainless steel pan with a lid and did it on the stovetop.  It took a bit longer than expected because I was purposely going kind of slow (maybe 25 30 minutes), but the results came out great!          THis coffee has good complexity and earthiness, and it's not excessively acidic.  Very smooth overall, and I would readily order this again.  It is one of my favorite coffees I've tried.
