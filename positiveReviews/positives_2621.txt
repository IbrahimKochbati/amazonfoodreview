This is actually better than I expected when I paid less than 50 cents each.  We usually use a packet mix and hot water from the  ewer.  This is much easier and the taste is comparable.  If you are very particular you may not like this but for something quick, sweet, chocolate flavored and warm for around 50 cents it is worth a try.  I would not buy it at the regular price that some retailers ask.
