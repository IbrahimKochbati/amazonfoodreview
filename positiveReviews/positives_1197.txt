Provided you use clean (preferably purified) water to cook this, it can be a great tasting hold over to a main meal. Far superior to most instant noodle packages out there and for the most part, gluten and meat free (except for the shrimp flavor).          While some people have remarked on the "over sized" packaging, this actually allows for a good and thorough mixing of the flavor packets and noodles with little chance of spillage.          While the coconut ginger variety tastes good, it may be a bit too subtle for those looking for an actual "taste of THAI." I'd recommend the Thai Peanut noodles for those seeking something with a bit more of a pronounced Thai flavor and highly recommend The A Taste Of Thai Peanut Salad Dressing (added to salads, meats or the Peanut Noodles) for a very spicy Thai experience.          Overall for the taste and quantity, the subscribe and save offer provides the best deal. Comparatively speaking in terms of price, Wal Mart offers most of these noodles a few cents cheaper (compared to the subscription price) but do not seem to carry the Coconut Ginger Variety. At least not at the store near me.          If you haven't tried this  and of instant noodles yet, I think you'll be in for a treat.
