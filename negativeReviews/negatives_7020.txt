My wife bought a "Sweet Obsession Dark Chocolate" bar while on vacation in DC. Opening the package  ought forth a waxy looking bar with no chocolate (or any other) smell at all. Tasting the bar was like eating a  own candle without a wick. Not good at all. Biting the 'chocolate' has about the same consistency as biting, I don't know, perhaps an old dried out bar of soap. Doesn't seem to melt in your mouth at all.          Poland may be notable for a lot of fine products, this sadly, is not one of them. The label states "Simply the Finest Chocolates on Earth", but at best this could only be promotional propaganda from the bad old Warsaw Pact, Soviet domination days.          The label also notes that the product is "Imported Exclusively by: Global Brands LLC" whose website states "You won't believe it retails for $1.00!" Well, I do, and even at a dollar, I would have been dissapointed.          On the plus side, well, you do get a lot of it.
