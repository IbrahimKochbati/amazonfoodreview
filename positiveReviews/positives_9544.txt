I've liked the hot sauces from The Pepper Plant for a while, so I thought I'd give the seasoning a try.  It's not the hottest seasoning, and I think that's a plus with this stuff    this seasoning is more of the smokey salty spicey pepper variety, and it's a good combination.  I haven't tried it on popcorn like another reviewer (it sounds like a good idea!), but so far it's good on meat, mashed potatoes, even mac & cheese    anything you want to add a bit of flavor to, plus a little kick.
