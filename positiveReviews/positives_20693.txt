This was exactly what I was looking for. My local Trader Joe's used to sell this during the holidays but stopped selling their liqueur cakes so I thought I was out of luck because I'd looked at other stores in my area. I never even thought of getting online to find it. It was a bit more pricey than I bought at the store but still delicious so delicious I almost thought of using it as my wedding cake. It does have a very strong amaretto flavor which I love but my fiance thought it was a bit too strong.
