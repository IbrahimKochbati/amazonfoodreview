After the first go round, my little mutt knew exactly how to get at the hidden treats.  Treats are always welcome, but I think she gets more fun being put in a "sit" and watching me move around pretending to hide a bon bon in various places. She's learned that it won't usually be in the last place I stop   but in which other one? Dogs are as different as the rest of us, but seems to me that only a rather slow dog or a lovable but dumb one would find this toy mentally challenging after the first time or two.  I give it three stars for their sakes.
