This product has better grade materials used to create it than other "general feed"  ands such as Fri$kies, Me0w M!x, Pur1na, etc because they are essentially just a bunch of fillers, this has at least some chicken meal as the main ingredient setting it far above them in quality. At a price of 30 for 40LB its less than a dollar pound, and the cheapest food prices i have seen are around 60   75 cents per lb so its a great price considering its quality. You can use this as a filler mixed in with better  ands if your cats dont get snobby and refuse to eat the cheaper stuff when better food is in the bowl with it. Diamond makes another version,    "
