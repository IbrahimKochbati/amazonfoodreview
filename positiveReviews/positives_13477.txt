Before I go to bed I am getting already excited about having my Newman's own special blend coffee from my Keurig  ewer next morning. I am glad I find the one, it's strong, but still great and full of taste, perfect. It's just delicious!I drink one big cup, because if I make a small I think it would be just too strong.
