First of all, I'd say that this product tastes more like sweet potato than chicken. The white lumpy stuff in the package tastes like  own rice pasta than chicken. So I am not where the chicken is cuz you can't taste it. But my daughter absolutely loves it. She gobbles down the whole thing in minutes (except her teething time).          Although I am skeptical about the chicken part, I have to trust the labeling that says heavy amount of protein is in there.          I also tried the turkey and chicken training meal from Plum  and. It has way too much spice in there. Not for my baby who is just starting out on protein. I will try the Plum  and a bit later. But you can definitely taste the meat in their products.
