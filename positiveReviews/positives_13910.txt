I was skeptical about this peanut butter product at first, but when I tried it I was pleasantly surprised!  The ingredients: peanuts, salt and sugar.  Doesn't get more pure than that!  I'm on the old Weight Watcher's Points plan and this PB2 is 1 point for two tablespoons! As a comparison, two tablespoons of "regular" store bought peanut butter is 5 points. The taste difference between this peanut butter and store bought peanut butter is so slight that it's not worth the extra calories to buy the "ready to eat" peanut butter.          This product comes in a dry form. You add two tablespoons of the dry mix to one tablespoon of water, stir, and you have delicious peanut butter!!  It can be added to smoothies, to!!!  I would definitely get this product. I also bought the chocolate kind, but have yet to try it.
