I've recently decided to switch to eating whole grains and we picked up a box of this at a health food store as an alternative to the Kraft mac and cheese that my son likes.  I prepared it as per the instructions and the sauce was runny and quite flavorless.  After one bite my son wouldn't eat any more and after I had a bite too, I couldn't blame him because it was just nasty.  I don't have any problems eating whole wheat pasta and neither does my son, but we couldn't eat this.  I am a firm believer that food can be both healthy and delicious at the same time.  This may be healthy but it is not tasty which means to me that it is not worth eating.  Try the Hodgson Mills whole wheat macaroni and cheese instead.  It is so much better.
