4 points box (packet).  This Tasty Bite has a more gentle flavor than most, but it is still very flavorful.          It's good and more soup like straight out of the box, I often  ing it in for lunch at work.  For dinner, I supplement with fresh spinach, chick peas and sometimes chicken sausage before I heat and eat!  A very satisfying dinner when supplemented, and even with spinach and 1 2c chick peas, only 5 points!          I love this tasty bite because it is low fat, low cal, and extremely high flavor!  Doesn't taste like diet food, and it isn't.  It's just wholesome and good for you!
