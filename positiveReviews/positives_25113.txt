This is our favorite flavor of the O.N.E. products.  Pleasant fruity flavor. Only wish they contained less sugar. I usually cut with water for less sweetness sugar.  Quality has remained consistent over last few orders. I've tried a number of coconut waters and this flavor along with Amy & Brian's are favorites.
