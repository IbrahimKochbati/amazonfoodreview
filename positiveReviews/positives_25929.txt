I found these at my local Trader Joe's grocery store and I've been a fan ever since.  Pirate's Booty makes a healthy and satisfying alternative to run of the mill deep fried potato or corn chips.  As a snack, they leave you with a full but not heavy feeling.  The danger is that they're so good, it's easy to eat the whole bag without realizing it.  I'd recommend taking a few out of the bag at a time and putting the rest out of sight.  Other than that, I can't recommend them enough.
