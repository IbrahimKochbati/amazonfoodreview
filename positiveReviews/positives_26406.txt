My vet recommended these chewies because i'm so awful about  ushing my dogs teeth.  These treats are amazing.  I have been giving my two Bearded Collies these once a day for the past 4 months and their teeth look great and their  eath is so much better.  They just love them and it usually takes about 20 minutes to a half hour for the dogs to chew them all up.  I will continue to buy these and the Amazon price is fantastic.
