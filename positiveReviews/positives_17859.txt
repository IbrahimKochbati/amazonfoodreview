I remember those days growing up, when Mom wanted to make a quick supper with no fuss or mess. Out came the Shake N Bake. The Original Shake N Bake for pork makes it easy and quick to prepare and cook. The pork came out tasty, the flavoring just right.          But it didn't come out as crispy as I remember (maybe I did something wrong), although the pork chops were juicy. I also remember that they supplied the bag, but not with this packaging (which was okay).          Overall, a wonderful addition to the food cabinet when you don't want to prepare a long and drawn out meal. Went well with rice and corn.
