This is advertised as a powder...which it is not. When you get the package and you read the smaller print it says crystalline powder. AKA, it's small crystals. When I think powdered I thought of the consistency of actual powdered sugar, light and fluffy...not crystals. I had a hard time getting it to dissolve and while it tastes good and just like sugar I just was disappointed with the "powder" label. So if you're looking for a sugar substitute, get this. Tastes good. Looking for powder, don't get this.
