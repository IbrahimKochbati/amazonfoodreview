These treats are great for those who are particular about what they feed their dog.  We do a wheat corn free diet and have tried other treats from the Newman's Own line.  Our dog (a 70lb Lab Shepherd rescue) has loved them all, but most of the others are a bit small for his size and I go through them too quickly.          The New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats are a larger size rectangular shaped treat and a bit thicker than most of Newman's Own treats.  They stay intact in the bag and don't turn to crumbs at the bottom of the bag.          These are 100% Organic treats with the following ingredients;     Barley, Lamb, Carrots, Apples, Palm Oil, Molasses.          There is 9% crude protein and 4% crude fat.          Very happy with this snack for our best friend!
