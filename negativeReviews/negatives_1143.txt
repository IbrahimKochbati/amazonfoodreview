My husband works outside all day long. Due to the recent heatwave, his body is depleted of fluids due to sweat. My husband uses the energy shot along with ZipFizz. The ZipFizz provides the necessary potassium to keep the body going. I personally do not recommend too many energy shot drinks during the day, but they do prove beneficial to help you keep going.
