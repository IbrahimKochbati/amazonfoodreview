Maybe it's because of the geographic location (Greece), but I didn't care for this.  The honey actually smells quite bitter or acidic.  The taste is better, but not very sweet.  The aftertaste burns the back of my throat.  This is totally different than domestic honey.          I won't buy again.  There are better choices, to be sure.
