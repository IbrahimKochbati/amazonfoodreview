It is not a bad drink. It tastes great but nothing like Kiwi Berry flavor. I can taste more of the apple or punch flavor.     I like that it is all natural with no preservatives but I did not like the fact that it is very carbonated.     I also like the fact that it does not have corn syrup or sugar that is in most other carbonated beverages.
