Aaah, this is the kind of tea I enjoy on a cold night.  I like to let the bag set for five minutes for a true minty sensation.  It smells like wintermint, and the caffeine formula allows me to enjoy this late in the evening when I want to relax.          This tea leaves a slight minty taste in my mouth for a while after drinking this.  I only use one teaspoon of sugar to add sweetness as this tea is naturally tangy sweet.          The only drawback is the price.  This is the kind of tea I'll reserve for guests, or as fillers for Christmas stockings for my tea drinking friends.
