Got this in a k cup sampler, the best k cup so far.  If you like good strong coffee with a lot of flavor, slight hint of cocoa, this is it.  No bitter after taste.  This one goes on top of my reorder list, perfect for the K Cup System.  The one reviewer on this post that gave it one star has no taste buds.
