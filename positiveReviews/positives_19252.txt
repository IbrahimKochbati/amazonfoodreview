I have a 4 year old Border Collie Australian Cattle Dog mix, who is very food motivated.     I bought this toy after reading all the positive reviews from dog owners on this site.     A lot of the dogs referenced were Labs or Retrievers.. so I assumed this would be perfect for my pooch.     He figured it out rather quickly.. and even though he still loves to play it. Is done finding the treats in less than 2 mins. And if I am not right there with him (on the floor next to him), he will throw the toy around to just get the treats out.          I will continue to use this toy with him, mostly to work on patience with him, but as far as "challenging" this toy did not prove effective.
