We originally purchased these chews from our veterinarian. Decided to order them here from Amazon because of the reduced cost and lack of shipping temperature restrictions on the product. We get complimented on the whiteness of our dogs' "smiles" all the time. Our vet is happy and so am I because I don't have to  ush their teeth a lot! You definitely want to wash your hands after handling the chews because they have a peculiar odor.  Now if someone can figure out how to ship heart worm prevention without it getting too hot, I'd be ecstatic!
