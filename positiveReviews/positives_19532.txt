First things first, unfortunately there is not an option for "Dog Loves It" on Amazon's reviews so I hope this is not misleading...I personally have never eaten the stuff so this should not be viewed as "I like this" and I haven't been able to teach my dog to verbally communicate yet so I'm going to have to go off of body language cues. That being said....15 month old, female German Shepherd with a sensitive stomach seems to love it. Had her on it for 5 months now. Half a can mixed with your dry food of choice 2X a day and you'll have a pretty darn wild dog at and post feeding time. Just bought a pack of the chicken grain free to see if it elicits equal enthusiasm. Inevitably, some of the cans always wind up at my doorstep dented, but I don't think that has any impact on the product.
