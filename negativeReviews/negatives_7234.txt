First, let me say that I LOVE the taste of this chai.  It is my favorite chai and until I bought these two huge cans, it was something I enjoyed every couple of weeks when I was out shopping.  Knowing how expensive it is to order from a coffee shop, I thought it would be better to just make it myself.          Making it at home, I use milk instead of water and only use about half of the recommended scoop.          Once I got the cans, I looked at the list of ingredients.  Sugar is number one on the list and each serving has 24 grams of sugar in it.  (That's almost 70% of each scoop.)          As others have mentioned, it definitely has caffeine in it.  One 8 ounce cup of this prepared chai has about as much caffeine as two 12 ounce cans of Coke.  After a short while, I noticed that the caffeine was starting to affect me  by way of headaches.  I don't really understand the company's claim of being 99.8% caffeine free when clearly it is not.          While I think the flavor is great, I won't buy this again due to the caffeine and sugar content.
