I will no longer consider buying product from Kelloggs for the following reason:     Kelloggs continues to include GMO (genetically modified organism) ingredients in their products but refuses to include that information on their product labels.  There are no long term studied to prove that GMOs are safe for either human or animal consumption.  Kelloggs  position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers.  However, Michael Taylor, head of the FDA, is a former attorney for Monsanto, the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply, illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly.  It's interesting to note that 50 other countries around the world have banned GMOs from their food supply all together but consumers here in the United States do not even have the right to be informed when GMOs are present in the products we buy.  Kelloggs is an unacceptable choice as long as they refuse to fully disclose the true nature of their ingredients to consumers.
