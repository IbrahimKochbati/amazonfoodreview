We love this product!  Our baby is 6 months old and we're introducing new foods to her.  So far she has tried the pumpkin, and she can't get enough!!!  She grabs for the spoon!  We love that this product is organic and that use can use  eastmilk to mix so your baby gets added nutrients.  It's portable, compact, and you can take it anywhere.  If at a restaurant or away from home, simply warm up your milk and combine.  It's really fantastic!
