Sorry, but I wasn't terribly impressed by these light snack crackers. Okay, I admit that I never liked Oreos that much in the first place. This 100 calorie bag of thin snack crackers tastes like Oreos, for sure  minus the sugar high pasted in the traditional sandwich cookie filling. But as one other reviewer noted, they're not all that chocolaty, a critical flaw in the opinion of this chocoholic. Worse than that, they're not so good for you. If you're going to have 100 calories, there are a lot healthier ways to do so than devoting nearly 40 percent to sugar. For my money, a piece of fruit makes a lot more sense. It not only costs less, it's got lots more nutritional value, not to mention fi e.
