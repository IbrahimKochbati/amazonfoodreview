We love this whole wheat pasta. When my husband was diagnoses with diabetes last year we decided to go with whole wheat pasta, he loves pasta but the type made from refined white flour was really messing up his blood sugar. I had a really hard time finding whole wheat orzo in the local stores, so we tried this product and it's perfect and so convenient to get recurring orders of it as well! Thank you RiceSelect & Amazon!
