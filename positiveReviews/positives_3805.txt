I love this product and order it quite often for my big boys to take hunting. Just wish the seller would take the time and money to change the label to say Mild instead of spicy. It isnt spicy and they have at least put a sticker on the package but have not changed the discription on line so I thought I was actually purchasing spicy this time. Still a wonderful product.
