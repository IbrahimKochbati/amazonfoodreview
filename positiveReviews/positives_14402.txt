I've been getting these treats for the last year for my two senior dogs.  Both have had various hip and joint problems in the past, but have not had any problems since they've been taking these.  And they love them!  I've tried all the flavors, and have not had a problem with them eating it.  They think it's a yummy treat, and get excited when I pull them out.  I would definitely recommend for anyone with older dogs.
