I have been experimenting with half normal half Decaf blending for a long time. I was looking to make a blend that basically had everything   Flavor, nose, robustness and smooth taste. After trying 100+ combinations, we found 50% dark roast Hawaiian Kona (from Amazon) and 50% medium roast Lavazza decaf the best. Because it is decaf and medium roast, Lavazza by itself at times might seem a bit flat. This is compensated by dark roast Hawaiian. Both coffees have excellent nose, flavor and smooth taste. A few remaining experiments include Jamaican Blue mountain and Indian Mysore gold nugget.
