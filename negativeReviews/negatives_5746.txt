This is the best alternative to feeding your dog a natural raw diet.     But it is WAY over priced. You can make your own raw diet for less than $1 a pound. Sorry but $10+ lb is not a good bargain. You can buy human grade cuts of raw fresh meat for WAY less than that. Even Lamb.     Good philosophy, not practical.
