This particular k cup has become my favorite and I've had just about all of them from every k cup maker.  I still enjoy many others, but this one is perfection. I love, love, love it! Funny thing is it took me about a year to try it. Something about the packaging made me think it might be horrible. I was dead wrong. It's perfect. If you're a k cupper, and there are lots of us now; don't let this one pass you by.
