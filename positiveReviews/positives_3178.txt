I'm glad i came across the blue icicle (on amazon othere prices where 60 or more) before i went on to buy a mic, preamp and source for phantom power. I literally got i all in one at a verrryyy low price. Good bargain. i recomend it for anyone with a home studio and deff go buy a xlr cable. plugging a mic deirectly into it wont work so well.
