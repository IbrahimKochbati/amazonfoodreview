Ideal has the best most sugar like taste of all artificial sweeteners I've ever tried.  There is no aftertaste like other  ands in everything I used it in, except maybe my coffee, and then it is just barely noticeable.  Plus, it contains xylitol which is claimed to kill bacteria in the mouth that causes gum disease.
