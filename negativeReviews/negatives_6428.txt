I was happy to be able to order this  and of hot sauce that I discovered in Barbados.  However, when the price was calculated, e very high shipping cost did not appear until the very last click. For some reason, I did not see how much it was and I paid $50  for shipping just 3 bottles!  Because of this, I won't be ordering again.  My fault for not triple checking.  The items were as described and were delivered safely, it is just the high cost of shipping that would prevent me from re ordering.
