This variety of coffee came as a sample with my Keurig  ewer and I LOVED it, so I ordered this from Amazon. When it arrived today I thought it rattled more than usual so I opened up the carton and dumped them out to count them    only 22 in the package.  Looks like I'll have to re order a couple of days sooner than I had planned.
