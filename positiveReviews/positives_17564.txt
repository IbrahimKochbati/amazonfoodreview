This coffee tastes pretty good. I find that coffee sometimes hurts my stomach, and this low acid version didn't give me that usual burning feeling after drinking it that I get from my usual  and. I think there is some flavor trade off; it tastes a little weaker and lacks some character of some bigger name coffees. However I think if coffee bothers you though, this is a really good product.
