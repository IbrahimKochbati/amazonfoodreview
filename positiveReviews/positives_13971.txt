Wow, I am so surprised & impressed by this product! When mixed w  water it really does taste like regular peanut butter. We are used to the "natural" PB anyway, which prob has less sodium than say, regular JIF. It's really good! I tasted it by itself because I wanted to see what it truly tasted like without crackers or  ead to mask the taste. No aftertaste, totally delicious... really yummy! 3 thumbs up!
