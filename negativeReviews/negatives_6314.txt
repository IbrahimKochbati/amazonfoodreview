I ordered these based upon the reviews here and the fact that it seemed like a bargain.  Unfortunately, I was not as pleased as I expected to be.  I found the flavor to be kind of bland and the texture to be rather mushy compared to other  ands that I have tried.  They aren't terrible.  But they aren't great either.  Next time, I'll try a different  and.
