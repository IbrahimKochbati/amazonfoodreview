This is a wonderful mix of spices.  One of my favorite uses is on chicken on the grill.  Try this out:          5 6 cloves garlic, minced     1 1 2 Tbsp. Luzianne Cajun seasoning     1 Tbsp. olive oil     2 Tbsp. lemon juice          Combine ingredients with chicken in a gallon size zip lock bag and marinate chicken legs & thighs for 2   4 hours.          Mix up a second batch, and  ush over chicken while grilling, cooking on all sides.          Just made this yesterday...excellent!
