Love the nutrition, but it was a little strong for my 7 month old who had just started solids at 6 months. (Exclusively BF) First couple of bits he gagged quite a bit, so we simply stuck it in our little $10 food processer from Wal Mart and added 1 4 of a banana.  He wolfed it down like nothing.  Applesauce works well also.  Will definetly buy more!
