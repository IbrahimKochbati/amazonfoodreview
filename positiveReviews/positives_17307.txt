I love this mac and cheese. I switched to whole wheat pasta a few years ago and this is one of the best alternatives that fit the traditional American dish. I mix it with a can of tuna and I could eat it every night of the week. You do have to cook the noodles longer because they are more dense than the processed enriched noodles you get at the store. I've managed to convert my husband to the whole wheat pasta, but he still likes his Kraft Mac and Cheese. What can I say? I'm going healthy and its still tasty.
