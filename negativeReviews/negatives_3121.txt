I don't drink a lot of coffee, but when I do I prefer it black. If a coffee requires sugar and milk to taste good, it's not for me. I expected anything from Melitta to be a quality coffee, and I was not disappointed, but neither was I delighted.          The good:     * Fills the room with a welcoming aroma, one of the better smelling coffees I have had     * Taste is not too bitter, even when made a bit on the strong side (if Starbucks is too strong for you, you will like this)     * Package is vacuum sealed for freshness     * Better than your average grocery store coffee          The not so good:     * Not the best coffee I've had by far. I would put it below Seattle's Best and some of the coffees I get some a local organic store.          Overall, it's a good coffee and we will definitely use it up without complaint. I replaced our normal office coffee with this and everyone enjoyed it, but they would not necessarily want to pay a premium over the bulk coffee they normally use.
