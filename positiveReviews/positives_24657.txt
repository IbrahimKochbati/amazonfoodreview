Okay I read all the reviews before purchasing and debated on buying because all the complaints about dented cans.  My order arrived and I had about 6 dented cans.  I've already used the worst of the dented cans and the pumpkin was fine.  It tasted great.  I highly recommend.  People make a big deal about dented cans but unless they're punctured, it's no big deal.
