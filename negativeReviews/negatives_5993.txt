I really wanted my little shihtzu, Sheldon, to like this food but it was a no go here.  He barely sniffed it and walked away.  I loved the size of the cans as well as the impressive ingredient list.  I do have to say that it didn't smell alot like chicken to me though so I understand him not even tasting it.  Too bad though.  I would have loved to add this to the very small list of foods he will eat.
