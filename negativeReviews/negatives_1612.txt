The Switch Orange Tangerine looked very promising. 100% juice, with some zippy carbonation. I placed it in the fridge, and let it get a nice chill. Hours later, I popped the top, and my wife and I sampled...          And it tasted like drinking furniture polish. It's not like we we're searching for derogatory statements about Switch. Here is how the conversation went:          Wife takes a swig, looks at me with eyes all googled. "Yuck. It tastes like furniture polish."          I take the can from her, thinking she must be insane. I chug some down. "Ah, yeah...it does taste like furniture polish."          We poured the remainder down the drain. If you enjoy drinking cold tangerine flavored furniture polish, by all means...          BTW, this drink left a nasty aftertaste...still belching it up.
