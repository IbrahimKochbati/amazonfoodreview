Great choice for summer iced tea with a sparkle.......I tried several versions, but my favorite is to use 2 family size (blackberry pomegranate) bags and 1 family size regular tea bag.  I  ew my tea using my drip coffeemaker, then add additional water to taste, a bit of fresh lemon juice and sweetener to taste or sugar.  Wonderful drink at mealtime or otherwise....not too sweet
