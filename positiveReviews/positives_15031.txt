Your service was excellent and the product was what I was looking for. The $25 price was my fault, my wife wanted it,and I couldn't find it anywhere, then 3 days after I got it , I went to Sunflower Food Stores and found the same identical item for $2.87.  I thank you for your service, but I will do my homework better next time...BILL
