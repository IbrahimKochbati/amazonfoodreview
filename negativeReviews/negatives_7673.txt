i like soft baked cookies as a quick fix with coffee in the morning when there's no baked goods around the house.  these cookies are individually wrapped, good for lunch boxes but the actual cookie is on the light side not as solid as the soft baked ones by Pepperridge Farms.  when i eat one of the Pepperridge cookies i feel satisfied but these Quaker Oats ones leave me still hungry.
