This coffee is ok, but nothing great, at least in my opinion..  I will not throw it away, but neither will I order any more.  It has that sharp aftertaste that I don't care for.  It isn't as strong as I expected it to be, which could be one reason for my disappointment.  If you like mild coffee and just drink coffee for effect this is a decent and well priced product.  I enjoy coffee and drink it for taste as much as effect.  The packets are easy to open, which I appreciate.
