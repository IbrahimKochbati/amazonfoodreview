I wanted to try something new, as I was getting tired of the same old coffee creamers (French vanilla, hazelnut, etc..) this vanilla caramel is great! Since it is powdered you don't have to worry about spillage or  eakage during shipment, which is a problem with the liquid coffee creamers. I will definitely be buying this again!
