Great product, our daughter loves this and has been gaining weight great.  We try to get as many organic foods as possible for us and our daughter.  This is one of the few options that are available in ready mix.  We don't have much time in the morning or evening so this works great for us.  First we were mixing  east milk and similac advanced and she was doing great.  Then we wanted to go to organic and moved to this.  When we were doing both  east milk and this we noticed she pooped far less, not a bad thing and never farther than 36 hours.  Now she only drinks this formula and poops a few times a day and is growing great.  We started her on this at about 1.5 months a few ounces a day (sometimes mixed with  east milk , and now she is 5 months old and eating about 32 ounces a day (a regular little chubbers).          On a side note if you ever tasted  east milk, this tastes as close to that as any formula we tried.  Some formulas are so nasty smelling and tasting its a wonder any baby eats them...          Cheers!
