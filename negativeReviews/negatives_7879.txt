I bought both the CET HEXtra premium oral hygiene chews and CET Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews to switch off so my dog doesnt get tired of chewing the same thing over and over. I have a 13 pound Chug (pug chihuahua mix) and I buy the large then cut them into 2 or 3 long pieces. At first I gave her the Enzymatic chew which lasted her a whole day or even two which is good because she usually goes threw chew treats within an hour. Then I gave her the HEXtra chew to try and she loves this one. Most of the pieces are thinner but still last a good day of chewing. I cant even get within 2 feet of her before she starts growling then she just runs away with it lol. I find that most of the chews for the HEXtra are much thinner and easier to cut with basic scissors. For the Enzymatic half the time I have to use a knife to cut it. After she had a taste of the HEXtra she slowly steers away from the Enzymatic each time we give her one. After 2 weeks whenever we give her the Enzymatic she just licks it a couple times and then walk away. For the HEXtra she still goes crazy over them! She goes through all the tricks I taught her without saying the commands lol. I dont know what the big health difference between the HEXtra and Enzymatic but if I had to recommend one I would suggest getting the HEXtra. Hands down your dog will love it. Now im stuck with a big bag of CET Enzymatic that my dog no longer likes because she prefers the HEXtra. Like anyone has mention well with any kind of chew treats remember to take it away when it gets small or it can be a chocking hazard.
