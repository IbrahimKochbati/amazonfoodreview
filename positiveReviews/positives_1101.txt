The first time I tried this product  was 2 years ago at the Venetian spa restaurant in Las Vegas  having  a cup of tea with some friends. We all remarked how delicious and tasty it made our tea.  We've been using it ever since. A little goes a long way and I use it anytime I would ordinarily use a sweetener.  Since the artificial sweeteners are so unsafe and unhealthy and I have a sweet tooth, I felt this was a safe alternative. Not only is it safer, but there's no aftertaste and doesn't raise your blood sugar level. This particular stevia has absolutely no bitter taste to it. I've tried others before and since and there's no comparison.
