These anchovies are first rinsed, then filleted and then melted in olive oil in most cases and used for flavoring dishes such as Pasta Putanesca sauce. If your plan is to just rinse them and fillet them and then down them with a piece of pugliese  ead dripping in extra virgin olive oil and a glass of chianti then these will work for you also. Putting them on pizza is not what they are intended for. The variety of their uses is vast if you have any knowledge of Meditteranean cuisine, if not get yourself a good cookbook and learn, the flavors they impart are without comparison, not to mention the aromas they send out floating around the neighborhood.
