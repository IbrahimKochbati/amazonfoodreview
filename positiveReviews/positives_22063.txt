These wasabi peas are very good in my opinion.  Plus the amount you get for the price tag I also found very reasonable.  My only complaint is that there is no nutrition information on the product.  Which is very important to me because I keep a calorie nutrition count of what I eat daily.  Other then that good product for a great price!  If they added the nutrition information I would order again.
