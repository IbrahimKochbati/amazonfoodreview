I bought this dog food initally because I like everything that I have tried from Newmans Products for humans. So, I thought that my Pug, Chloe may like Newmans also. Well, she sure does, there is no turning up her nose at it. I get it delivered regualry, so this negates the need to make a special trip to get Dog food.          UPDATE 6 12 15  the last two bags I recieved had a mite in the foods which caused my dog to have severe bouts of diarrhea. I only found out today when I took her to the vet, and was informed that these intestinal bugs were usually located in the dog food. Sure enough, when I got home and looked in the dog food, guess what I cfound on the bottom of the bag, tiny mites.......it went out into the garbage containers.          I will return to this dog food in a few months......she ahs liked it so much, but will wait for a bit.
