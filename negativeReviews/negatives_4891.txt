Read the stories online....dogs have died from Greenies.  I gave my 50lb pound dog Greenies for the first time 2 weeks ago, and she became very very sick for more than a week.  She was vomiting and having potty issues the entire time.  These cause blockages and do not allow the dog to fully digest.  I can't believe these are still on the market.          From one loving pet owner to another   DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE GIVING YOUR DOGS GREENIES!  TRUST ME.
