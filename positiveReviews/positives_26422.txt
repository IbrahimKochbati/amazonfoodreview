This is a really great price for these chew sticks. My dog absolutely loves them... He sits in front of the cabinet we keep them in every night after we settle in and waits for us to give him one... Our vet says they are great for his teeth. The only thing I don't like is that he tends to swallow them whole, and they sit at the back of his throat. Not sure if that is just my pooch, but we never give them to him if he's is going to be alone.
