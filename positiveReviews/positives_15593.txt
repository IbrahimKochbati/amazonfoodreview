Otis is what I call a very picky eater. The fact is, until now, he would not eat the same cat food twice! He is 10 years old.          I was in the habit of buying food one can at a time for obvious reasons. I did that for the Petite Cusine as well....the Tuna and sole. He inhaled it. I bought 2 more. This time 2 different varsities of the same  and. Again....gone.          Since it is not cheap, I looked for it on line. Amazon had the best deal and I bought 4 cases of variety packs. That was almost a year ago. He still loves it!          The other things I like are the ingredients. They are healthy for him.....no fillers.
