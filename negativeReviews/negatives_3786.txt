I had a handful of these crackers last night   and though they are tasty, my hands, face, and ankles swelled to a ridiculous size.  I wasn't sure if it was the crackers or something else I ate   so I ate them by themselves at lunch   and again, I am a swollen mess.          I didn't realize the MSG content was so high.  I won't be eating these again.  If you react to salt, sodium, or MSG   just stay away from these tasty little buggers.
