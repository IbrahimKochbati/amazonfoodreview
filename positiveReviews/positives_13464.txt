I use many Newman's Own products and I was glad to see Newman's Own Coffee K Cups. I use K Cups and I like bold coffee so I tried Newman's Own Bold. I  really like it. It makes a strong cup of coffee. I drink this round the clock, whenever I want a cup of coffee. I guess you can say, I am kind of a round the clock coffee drinker. Newman's Own Bold is very good.
