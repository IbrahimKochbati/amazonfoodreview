I have bought this at my local grocery store, and tried it several times before giving up on it.  It tasted very similar to regular Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, but no matter how little I tried cooking the pasta I could not get it to an al dente state such that the noodles didn't fall apart as soon as I started stirring to create the cheese sauce.  I think the last time I made it I cooked the noodles for 5 1 2 minutes (the box recommends 6 1 2 to 7 1 2 minutes) and they still fell apart.  Eating this was like eating macaroni shreds and cheese, not macaroni and cheese.          My 21 month old son will eat this, but he prefers the regular version. I do, too, so we're giving up on this one.
