It's my recipient's favorite.  However, I sent it expedited handling and it took from Monday to Friday to arrive.  The cookbook, Cooking With Tea, which was to accompany the Bengal Spice Tea, arrived in about 10 days and had to be forwarded from California to Oregon as the recipient had already returned.  It wasn't the tea, it was the s & h that was disappointing.          Marilyn Russell
