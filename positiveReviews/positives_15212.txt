I give props to any mom, especially one that holds down a full time job or two, that can puree and strain her own food.  If that's you, hat's off.  You're my hero.  I'm no superhero, so my goal was to find the best quality, best tasting food with minimal processing.  Let's face it, there are plenty of organic options out there.  And these days, I think most of them are good.  The little man likes the Gerber organics fruits.  They're easy to find and inexpensive.  But hands down, the Happy Baby products are the best quality, best tasting (in my opinion) and most convenient of them all.  The pouches are great, especially for when we're on the go.  We can eat the fruit varieties without even putting on a bib.  The Chick Chick is the man's favorite (bib required).  The negative is that they're about twice the price of the Gerber fruits and meats.  So if you're on a budget, this may be a bit of a stretch.  Nonetheless, keep some pouches around for when you travel.  Baby will love them!
