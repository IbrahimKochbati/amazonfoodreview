I purchased the Old World collection directly from the Spice Lab as a Father's Day gift for my husband.  The item was extremely well packed and arrived ahead of schedule. A small wooden salt spoon, sample packets of gourmet salts and a reference index card with information about each of the 11 salts were included. Brett was responsive and helpful. This is a great company with an interesting variety of salts and spices. I will definitely make a future purchase and refer the Spice Lab to others.          UPDATE: I'm disappointed that my email reguarding a  oken test tube and cork has gone unanswered.  The first time I used one of the salts, I was extrememly gentle but a large piece  oke off as well as some of the cork top. The tubes should not be so fragile so I sent an email to that affect to Brett, the owner. Despite answering my initial email about how much I loved the gift and where could I post a positive comment, he has not responded with regards to the  eakage. Good customer service would be to follow up.....
