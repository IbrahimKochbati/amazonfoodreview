I used to regularly eat pretzels as snacks or part of my lunches for work.  Although I never really followed along with the low carb diet craze, I did become concerned that pretzels weren't providing me with any nutrition other than carbohydrates, so I gradually stopped buying them.          Then someone told me about Newman Hi Protein Pretzels.  Each generous serving size (18 pretzels) is just 120 calories, but you get 5 grams of protein and 4 grams of fiber, with only 1.5 grams fat!  That's better than what you might get from a lot of yogurts that are on the market today.  Furthermore, like all Newman products, these pretzels are made with all natural ingredients, including what flour,n pea flour, sunflower oil, and salt.  And finally, they taste great!  I truly cannot taste any difference between these pretzels and others  well, if anything, these are better. :)          If you are looking for a delicious snack that is nutritious, too, I highly recommend Newman's Hi Protein Pretzels.
