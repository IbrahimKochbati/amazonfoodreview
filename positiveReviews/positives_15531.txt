So I'm new to this bonsai tree, collecting hobby and I actually purchased this tree as a gift for my friend. I just got the package in the mail and I'm not too sure how the tree is suppose to look. Any help? I took a pic of the tree but didnt know how to attach it to this review so i set it as my profile pic.
