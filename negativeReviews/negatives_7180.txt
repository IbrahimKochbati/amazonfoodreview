Due to food allergies this pancake mix had all the ingredients I was able to have.  I liked the fact that all you needed to make these pancakes was water.  No need to add eggs,milk etc which I am unable to eat.  I read the reviews, so I figured sounds good give it a try.  I really should have tried 1pkg but because I ordered through amazon I had to get 6pkg.  Which really stinks. The taste to me was only so so.  I did add only cinnamon, since my food allergies. Perhaps thats the reason the taste was only so so.  I did not think it was sweet like another reviewer said.  But I was not going to eat them with syrup.  My complaint is that no matter how long I cooked them they always seemed raw inside.  I would not order this kind again.
