I purchased this tea because I have trouble holding my urine due to an illness. I had read somewhere that cornsilk tea was good for people with trouble in that area and I can say that it is true.  I can go to the bathroom with a peace of mind.  This tea is also good for edema, high blood, heart problems, so on and so forth.  Go and google cornsilk tea you will be amazed at what it can help you with.
