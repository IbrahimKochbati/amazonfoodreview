My husband drilled some extra holes and mounted it under a cabinet.  It holds more than my carousel and you can see all the flavors at once. The hard mesh sides and front allows you to easily check the coffee supply without opening the drawer. There were no sharp edges on the metal  Looks like it will hold up well.  A good value for the money.
