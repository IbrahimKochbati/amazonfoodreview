I bought this food for my dog (who has very sensitive skin), and, maybe either a) it is not for him, or, b), I didn't introduce it gradually enough, but, he did develop some vomiting and loose stools when eating (fed him only for about 3 days).  It sounds like fabulous food, with quality ingredients, but, I am afraid to give him any more, since I don't know if he can handle tolerate it.  I still have about 32 lbs. of this food left at my house :)
