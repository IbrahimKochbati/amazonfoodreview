The Chocolate Mocha flavor of this Hot Cocoa is really nice. It's different from the usual Hot Cocoa since it has a hint of Coffee. The quality is definitely there, I find it to be better then the Godiva  and. Mixes extremely easily, there is no residue and works with milk or even water mixed with half and half. I must say that it is a bit much of the same flavor, I would have rather 4 different flavors since the containers are big. Worth it though! A++
