My 2nd adventure for health into ingesting Aloe.  My first taste had me realizing this was way too sweet to be a health drink.  Upon examination the very small font list of ingredients, I found; 1st Aloe Gel, 2nd Honey(surprising), 3rd High Fructose Corn Syrup... yep... 15 grams of sugars per cup 160ml the bottle that is the size of a small bought water bottle is 500ml... I easily gulped it down before my full study was complete. Down the end of ingredients there is artificial green grape flavor...we all need that...to match the green bottle I guess.       After I mixed it 50 50 with filtered water I was able to actually taste other than sweet and it was not bad with a bit of pulp that I liked as in pulp orange juice.  I added some pure Aloe Juice to get it closer to the health drink I stupidly assumed associated with Aloe... and will make it thru the case I ordered.           I suppose if your looking for a better after school replacement drink than say.. Mt Dew, for one of the many new obese children it may suffice...but keep a tongue depressor handy for surely down the road they will be falling down and shaking at this sugar level as well.
