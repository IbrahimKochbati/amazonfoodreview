When I first switched to a gluten free diet, I had a hard time eating complete meals. I wasn't sure what all contained gluten, and got sick many times from guessing incorrectly. It was great to find a company dedicated to gluten free food that tastes GOOD! There are companies who make gluten free food that isn't very tasty. I knew I could make it living gluten free when I found Bakery on Main!
