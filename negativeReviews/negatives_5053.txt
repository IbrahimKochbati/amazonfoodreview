Got this for my West Highland Terrier for Christmas and she loved it.  It kept her busy as soon as we gave it to her.  She was completely focused on getting those treats out of the bottle...however, she re invented the toy and got all of the treats out by actually chewing through the thick rope that is attached to the toy.  (She managed to do this in about 5 minutes in a roomful of people.)  It's a cute toy and a great concept   and she did enjoy it   however, I think this toy would work best with a dog who is not quite as focused, or creative in problem solving as our westie seems to be.  The plastic bottle and rubbery ball are very sturdy and are continuing to hold up well.
