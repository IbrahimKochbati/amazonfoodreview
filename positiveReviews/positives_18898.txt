I originally purchased this product to serve as my dog's main food since he is allergy prone with skin issues and a survivor of mast cell tumor disease.The vet had recommended other "veterinary prescription" kibble(potato  rabbit) which seemed to really slow down our dog's healing process and worse, seemed to be doing more harm than good .  After giving up on vet reco 6 months later, we started experimenting with a number of 'healthy' and 'raw' alternatives, I landed on this just before going 100% raw. Though I have since gone 100% raw and eliminated all grain and processed food from our dog's main diet (with vast noticeable improvements in his health), I still use this food as one of his acceptable 'treats' and when I'm behind in making his raw meals. The texture is the consistency of beef jerky and the pieces are cut pretty small (think holding a small strip between your thumb and index finger about half the size of a fortune cookie paper...  It would be great for training since they are small pieces to feed frequently and more moist than dry kibble. It may be pricey to use as a main food , but it was great quality and seemed to be trustworthy ingredient sources. He likes the taste a lot too... but I can't vouch for that part.
