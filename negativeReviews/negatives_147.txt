Long story short   these are very tasty. We have purchased a number of flavors from this  and, this is my favorite.          BUT... as noted by another reviewer   these contain MSG in the form of "Yeast Extract".          It has become a popular means of hiding MSG lately by calling it different things, as a person who now finds himself having to use more caution in what I consume I find the whole process of hiding in plain site very bothersome.          Also, the bag is not very large, but half of it is air. This may well help in shipping, but when paying a premium price for 'organic' it just seems more deceptive.
