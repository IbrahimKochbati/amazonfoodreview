Recently I have been eating way too much junk food, drinking a lot of coffee, and taking advil on a regular basis (I recently had a concussion and had headaches constantly for a few weeks). I decided I needed to clean everything out, so i bought this tea. I truly believe it works! First day I used it by stomach started feeling better. The taste is great too! Some people may not like it because it does taste a little spicy and nutmeggy. I will say this, it does make you pee A LOT. especially at first, but I LOVE THIS TEA!
