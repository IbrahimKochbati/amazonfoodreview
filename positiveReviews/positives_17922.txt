Shake N' Bake is always a winner in our house. I like to use thin, boneless pork chops, they cook in about 20 minutes. The Shake N' Bake coating stays crispy and is full of flavor, without a lot of preparation or clean up.     I also sometimes use a packet as a topping for casseroles.  You know that green bean casserole that people often serve at Thanksgiving? Try tossing French fried onions with a packet of Shake N' Bake and sprinkle ontop of the casserole before baking. It's delicious!
