I bought this water when i was at college for the first week. I felt bad using my roommate's water all the time and i was 7 states away from home. So i ordered this water. It was delicious, but the only complaint i have is that the bottles were REALLY...well...plastic y. I felt really un green drinking water out of these HUGE plastic bottles.          So now, i just ask my roommate to buy water for me when she goes home on the weekends. I give her $ 4, she runs to walmart and gets me 2 cases of 30 water bottles. Yay me!          Sometimes i still think about this water, longing for it as i sip my coffee or tea or ramen juice and say to myself "This would be so much better with talking rain."          Its one college student's battle between deliciousness and eco friendliness.
