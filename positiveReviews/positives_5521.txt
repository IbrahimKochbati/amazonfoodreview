I am on my second 4 lb canister of this.  The popcorn has a good yield, few unpopped kernals, similar to popcorn from the grocery store.  The popped kernals are larger than normal for most white popcorn.          I have mild IBS and I find white popcorn is easier on my digestive track versus yellow (I think because the shells are thinner and softer), this popcorn follows the trend for me and I can consume popcorn every day when I am in a popcorn mood.
