When you first open the can, it looks like something you would eat.  And no catfood smell! Nice sized chunks of chicken and vegetables in a lot of gravy.          That being said, Ms Casiopia lapped up all the gravy and left the rest.  This however is not the product's fault as she has done this before with other catfoods          I would have given it 5 stars, but since I won't be purchasing it, I gave it 4.  If your cat will eat chunks and vegetables, this product is for you.          I have donated the remainder of the package to a less fortunate friend.          Thank you.
