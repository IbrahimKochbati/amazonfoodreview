I am an adult and I still love this cereal. It is a great deal, but ONLY from the Amazon.com seller. It is currently sold out from amazon and some other sellers have it for much higher prices, which are not worth buying. But overall, I cannot say enough good things about this cereal. When I was younger, I used to eat a whole bowl of just the marshmallows because I loved them so much. Now, I eat the cereal the way it was intended, and I love it so much. Highly recommend. : )
