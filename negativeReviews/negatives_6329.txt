I first got introduced to StarKist Tuna Fillet Gourmet In Olive Oil, when I purchased several cans from a big name "Mart". I was impressed by the tuna being packed in Olive Oil. The solid tuna was slightly darker than solid white Albacore, but had a good taste and apparently contains less trace mercury than the solid white tuna. When I went back to the "Mart", the item was no longer offered, so I turned to Amazon. I ordered two cases of 12 cans per case. When I finally received the cans, I found that the amount of Olive Oil and tuna grade were very inconsistent.     Either there was a small amount of oil along with a lot of water or there was very little liquid at all. The can's label does not list water as an ingredient. Some cans had fillets, while others had a mash of small tuna chunks. I probably will not order another case of this  and again.
