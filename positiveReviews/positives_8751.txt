I've tried a few different maple syrups, but this is absolutely the best I have tried.          First off, grade B has a much more delicious maple flavor than grade A without being overpowering. This  and is not as thick as most syrups, but it's a quality I happen to love. It's way less sticky and you can easily get out every last drop from the jug without having to set it upside down or  eaking out a knife to scrape the jug.          I love adding a spoonful into some almond or soy milk for a touch of sweetness, mixing in with some peanut butter (try it, it's delicious!), or making the best tasting lemonade on Earth.          Even if you're not on the master cleanse or don't feel it's necessary healthy you should still try the lemonade just to drink. It's way better than any refined sugar lemonade I've ever had! Two tablespoons each of both grade b syrup and fresh lemon juice with 8 oz of water is the most amazingly refreshing beverage you can imagine.          My only complaint is I keep finding so many new uses for it, that I've been going threw a jug every week!
