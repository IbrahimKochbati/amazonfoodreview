This product is, in fact, a spiced, chocolate drink.          It is yummy.          It is not super chocolatety, but it does have enough chocolate flavor to warrant it being labeled a chocolate drink.  It *is* very sugary, but what reasonable person believes that a chocolate drink should be anything other than a treat?          I give it four stars because while very yummy, it does not send my consciousness into the higher stratosphere of the realm of pure, abstract deliciousness.  It is, however, a product I will purchase again.          It tastes sweet, cinnamony, and chocolatey and has some other flavors I cannot identify.  I recommend it if you like or are curious about such things.
