I have a 5 month old Pomeranian puppy.  Poms have a tendency to develop collapsed tracheas and also have issues with luxating patellas (knee problems).  Both areas are made of cartilage.  I give him one of these per day to make sure that we strengthen his cartilage joints so that we can try to prevent or delay these issues that may develop later (and hopefully some vet bill money down the road!).  He loves these things and the chewy texture of them (I must admit, they smell good to me too, haha)!  These little guys live for a very long time typically, and I want him to have a very happy and healthy life   there is nothing like the power of prevention.  I love that they are made in the USA and not in China, and that it's very healthy for him.. very natural.
