The real Le Gout Base should have 095 on the label! I have found it on the web, but it is a bit expensive, especially if you don't want to buy a case of 12! I use both the chicken and the beef, the shipping on 2 1 pound containers is about the same as the cost of the base!     I have been out of the food biz for about 5 years now, but I still have contacts with food service, so I think I will be giving them a call!     It is a shame that Amazon couldn't get the real deal!
