This product works just as described!  You simply place a filter in the disposable cup, add your own coffee, snap on the lid, and make the cup of coffee as you would with a regular K Cup.  The coffee is just as good as any prepackaged K Cups, and you can use the  and of your choice at a fraction of the cost (and no washing out those pesky mesh reusable filters!) As some other reviewers have noted, sometimes the cup gets stuck on the handle that raises as you are trying to remove the used cup.  But you simply pull it out and I've never had a lid fall of, so there is still no mess.  I will definitely continue to use this product!
