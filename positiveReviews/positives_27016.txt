Lavazza espresso beans are wonderful!  Excellent crema, never bitter.  I mix my beans 50 50 decaf   full espresso because we drink so much daily and its a delight!  This is the best decaf bean for a super automatic espresso machine because it is a low oil bean annd won't clog up the grinder.  Its the only decaf bean I use.   "
