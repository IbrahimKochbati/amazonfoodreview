Not quite the taste I was searching for, but this is some incredibly amazing coffee! I just wish I could buy the beans instead of ground coffee so that I may adjust the grind to my tastes. But holy wow! It is incredibly smooth with just a hint of sweetness at the end. A perfect dessert coffee, or just a lazy sunday coffee. If you love coffee, this will make your day. I swear.
