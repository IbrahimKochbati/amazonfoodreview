This is a tricky product to review.  On the one hand, the flavor is great! (especially the choc. peanut butter).  If I were rating it on flavor alone, I would give it five stars.  However, I took one star off for the price and another star off for the quantity.  It has 15 servings, with each serving being two Tablespoons.  however, two tablespoons of the powder mixed with a little water only yields about 2 teaspoons of peanut butter.  So if you are making peanut butter for a sandwich or for apples, you go through the jar pretty quick (only took me about two days).  But if you are going to add it to a vanilla protein shake, the one serving adds a ton of flavor.  So I would repurchase this but only for adding to shakes.
