For the dollar, the 5.3 oz Sweet Obsessions dark chocolate bar (literally $1) is a reasonable deal.  Global Brands is either lying or deluded about this product's being the finest chocolate on Earth.  Another reviewer said it's like biting into an old bar of soap.  That isn't a real stretch.  My mild disappointment is texture related.  It also has a little grainy quality to it.          I think the sweetness is perfect and you know you're eating chocolate.  I'm sure my dopamine levels are soaring.  It's a good chocolate high for someone who is unemployed and has to pass on chocolate that's four times more expensive.
