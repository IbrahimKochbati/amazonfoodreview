I'm sitting here, (Switch) drink in hand, trying to decide how to describe the Switch Kiwi Berry. It's lightly carbonated, which I like but too sweet for my taste (think strawberry candy). The mouth feel is quite round and it has some body too it. It's made from juice concentrates and carbonated water and there are 135 calories of sugar in the small 8 oz can. I wouldn't call it a healthy beverage and whether it's natural or not doesn't matter to me.
