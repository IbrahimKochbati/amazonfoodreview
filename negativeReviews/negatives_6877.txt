The packaging is very convenient for the small 2.5 ounce popcorn poppers. The taste rivals movie theaters. The only negative is this is too salty. I do not know if it has to do with popcorn popper (it seems to have a large number of un popped kernels)or just too much salt. We compensate by adding 50% more popcorn to the popper and this produces a much better product.
