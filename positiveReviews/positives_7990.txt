Let's face it  if you have no willpower (can't limit yourself to eating 1 3 of a normal sized bag of microwave popcorn) and HATE to shop at your local store, Prime Eligible "Point click to Porch" doesn't get better, good price.  It's not homemade, but it fills the craving  what more can you ask for that has only 100 calories?
