I do not particularly care for this coffee. However, in all fairness to the product   this was my last ditch effort to find a decaf coffee that I like. I truly enjoy regular Colombian, organic coffee. I have tried other, non organic decafs before and was dissatisfied. I thought maybe an organic version would suit my taste buds. Considering that I always find decaf coffees less than enjoyable, please do not take my review as "gospel". I would recommend that anyone who is trying to reduce their caffeine intake should try this product and make up your own mind. I only drink 1 1 2 cups of coffee in the morning. So, I'm not abusing caffeine. However, I think I just enjoy the flavor of "real" coffee too  much to enjoy the taste of straight decaf. Currently, I'm doing a scoop of regular organic coffee and a scoop of HealthWise. At least I'm getting closer to my "caffeine free" goal. : )
