For those who love coffee but have bad heartburn issues, low acid coffee like the Puroast dark French roast may be a decent choice.  Pretty much anyone else can easily skip it, however, as the taste and smell are both frankly supbar.          Clearly other reviewers have enjoyed this coffee, so individual taste reactions may vary, but I'm baffled at why this is advertised as being less bitter than standard coffee. It has a very strong and unpleasant chemical taste that is significantly more bitter than nearly any other coffee I've had in recent memory.          This may not be an issue for everyone, but it's worth noting that the Puroast low acid variety doesn't create that wonderful  ewed coffee aroma at all. You have to put your nose directly next to the cup to smell it at all, and then the result is an off putting chemical scent to match the flavor. Having my kitchen fill up with that distinctive scent to let everyone know the coffee is ready is a major part of the coffee drinking experience, and this  and doesn't offer that.          It seems like Puroast may be an acquired taste, but after four cups and trying the coffee both black and with different creamer options, I certainly didn't acquire it and can't recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a serious heartburn problem.
