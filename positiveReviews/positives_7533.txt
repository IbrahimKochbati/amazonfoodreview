When I found out I was pregnant with my first child, I read in a baby magazine about the wonderful health benefits of Chia seeds. They are packed with Omega 3 fatty acids, and because healthy  ain function is nurtured by Omega 3 fatty acids, I wanted to supplement my diet with something other than fish oil pills that can pack a fairly unpleasant aftertaste.     These seeds are so tiny, and so flavorless, that you can mix them into cereal, or even juice, without ever realizing you have consumed them. I have also found that adding these seeds to my  eakfast keeps me fuller longer.     Chia seeds are more convenient than flax seeds, and a pound of them, costing around $12 (depending on the seller), lasts a few months.     If you want to avoid the potential unpleasantness of fish oil supplements, Chia seeds are a great alternative, and for new or expecting mothers, they are a great way to ensure your baby is getting what s he needs for optimum  ain health and development.     Lastly, you do not have to be considering motherhood to consider adding Chia to your diet. It is a wonderful, all natural supplement that is perfectly painless (in both taste and cost) to undertake.      Who would have thought that the seeds responsible for the (infamous) "Chia Pet" would offer so much more than a gawdy table ornament?     Highly recommended.
