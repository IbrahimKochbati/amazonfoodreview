My family and I recently tasted this Switch drink (as well as the Black Cherry flavor).  I found the kiwi strawberry taste to not be very distinguishable (ie, without reading the can I would have jard a hard time guessing what the flavor was).  My husband thought this was better than the cherry flavor, as did the kids (ages 11 & 9).          We all found this drink to be very sweet, even without the added sugars.  I was not impressed with this drink and would not buy it again.
