I recently found I that I have an allergy to gluten products. I wasn't really a fan of the products I found on my local groceries shelf, I thought I would give this a try. They taste pretty good, not as good as the normal every day kind you get off the shelf. Be careful not to overcook them as they can be dry. I made these with dairy free white chocolate chips and another batch with walnuts mmm did they taste good! I would buy again as Amazon is the best price I have found it!
