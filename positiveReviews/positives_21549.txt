I've grown up with Quaker Oatmeal and, as a busy adult, I don't always have the time to cook oatmeal the traditional way.  I've seen instant oatmeal in the store and I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Vines Program was making the Maple and Brown Sugar flavor available for tasting and reviewing.          I'm always on the lookout for heart healthy food given my family medical history and my age.  Making a bowl of this only takes about two minutes in the microwave.  Combining the convenience and delicious taste makes sticking to a heart healthy diet more pleasant.
