O.N.E. Coconut Water is a refreshing alternative to soft drinks. A splash of pink guava gives this drink the sweetness and flavor you want without resorting to anything artificial. The 8.5 ounce serving is about right because this is a drink you want to savor with or without a meal, but definitely not guzzle. Highly recommended!
