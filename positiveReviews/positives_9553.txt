These muffins are great.  I've tried many gluten free foods and wasted so much money on things that tasted like cardboard.  I make these muffins  by substituting milk for the water and add 2 mashed bananas and 1 tsp. of cinnamon.  I've tried adding pineapple but didn't like it as much as my version of banana muffins.  My daughter's boyfriend loves these muffins and has no idea that they are made from rice flour.  Another great Namaste item to try is the Spice Cake.  Just add some grated carrots, pineapple, coconut, walnuts and raisins and you've got a kick butt Carrot Cake.  Thanks to Namaste for the wonderful products......I'm hooked!
