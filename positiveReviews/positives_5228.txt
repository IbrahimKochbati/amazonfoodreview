Well, this drink was surprisingly tasty. The reason it was surprising because there is no sugar added. It's "100% juice carbonated". It was like drinking a soda but it was a drink of juice that is carbonated. This would be a good drink if you want a healthy drink that is carbonated.          Now I'm curious about the other flavors to see if they taste better. However, I do have to say if you're expecting something extremely sweet, this is not the drink to get. You may want to go buy Kool Aid for that. This drink has a natural taste to it. I can actually taste the mixture of orange and tangerine. I wish the tangerine flavor was stronger, because I like tangerine more than orange, but considering the fact that there is no sugar, it's a good drink.
