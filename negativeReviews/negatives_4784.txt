I just got these beans and have pulled a couple dozen shots, trying out different permutations of amount, grind, tamp.          I'm disappointed as I expected a better flavor from the beans.          The beans have a strong midrange coffee flavor and a strong sharp lemon note. The midrange coffee flavor is uncomplicated but good. A little chocolaty perhaps The lemon note is unpleasant for my taste which makes the beans go from a four star to a three star.          When you pull a good espresso shot it tastes smooth for about 10 seconds, then the lemony taste creeps in and makes it unpleasant.          The lemony taste is good in milk drinks however, it provides some character and interesting flavor. The strong coffee flavor also stands up to the milk and gives it a good flavor. I like lattes with these beans.          The overall verdict is meh. If you only want milk drinks then these beans might suit you. If you like shots, I'd advise you to look elsewhere.
