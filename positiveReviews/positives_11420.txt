I have a wheat allergy and have tried just about every type of gluten and wheat free cookie mix out there. I have to say that this cookie mix is a m a z i n g and the BEST.          Prep and Baking:     Super easy, you add butter and an egg, that's it. You want to bake them until the bottom of the cookie is a light  own, be sure not to over bake. I knew they would taste good, as even the dry mix was super yummy, not overly sweet, but more buttery and chocolaty tasting.          Texture:     The texture of these cookies is so light and fluffy; they simply melt in your mouth. They also have the perfect combination of an ever so slight chewiness and a hint of crunch. Basically they look and feel just like a "real" chocolate chip cookie.          Taste: These cookies are not overly sweet, which I really like. They have more of a delicious, rich, buttery   chocolaty taste, with a good amount of dark chocolate chunks throughout, simply perfect.          CONS: As someone who does not like to over indulge in sweets and focuses on eating healthy, I normally bake and share. The con is I found it hard to part with these yummy cookies, as I wanted them all for myself.
