This is a wonderful English Breakfast tea  nicely flavorful without being either too bold or too bland. Makes a wonderful morning tea without any sort of bitterness or tang y taste to it. It's a nice comfort tea and a good start to loose teas for anyone who has been using bags and doesn't know which flavor loose teas to start with.          I recommend  ewing as follows: 2 teaspoons to 12 16 ounces of boiling water for 3.5 minutes. If you over ew (particularly Adagio's teas), there's a chance for bitterness, so I would not recommend leaving it in the water for a long time.          Another recommendation is Adagio's Irish Breakfast (which I slightly prefer) but both teas are standouts!
