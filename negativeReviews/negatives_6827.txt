I ordered the Little Bambino popcorn popper along with a 24ct. box of this popcorn.  All the items arrived right before Christmas (love Amazon Prime!) as promised.  The popcorn popper itself was a  eeze to set up.  I got this for my girlfriend as she LOVES popcorn.  The reason for the low review?  The popcorn is HORRIBLE!  It was tough and chewy.  We ended up with just as many kernels as we did with popped popcorn.  I tried to excuse this since it was the first time using the machine, but 4 bags later and the popcorn is still just as tough and chewy as the first batch.  And did I mention that the popcorn was way too salty but that was more than like the result of so much of it not popping.          Once you hear the popcorn popper stop popping popcorn, your supposed to turn off the popper as it will burn what's left in the popper because it's all jammed with popcorn. The oil has to go in first so the popcorn doesn't get burned when you drop it in the popper.  I tried to alter the steps in different ways hoping the popcorn would come out better but it just didn't work out for us.          Gonna give good 'ol Mr. Redenbacher a shot next.  Now I just need to figure out how to cancel my 'popcorn subscription'.
