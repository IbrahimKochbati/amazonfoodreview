In my search to find the perfect food for my two mini dachshunds I discovered the world of " eed specific" dog food, which intrigued me because of the unique health concerns for the  eed.  The two I found for dachshunds were Eukanuba and Royal Canin.  Both received moderate ratings on other websites [...]).  I opted to try Eukanuba because of the price   granted it is still pricey but cheaper than Royal Canin.  Both dogs eat it without a fuss and have had no apparent digestive issues with this food.  I would recommend it.  The only drawback is the price of the product.
