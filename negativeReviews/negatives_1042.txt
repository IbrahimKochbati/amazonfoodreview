This ground decaffeinated coffee makes a fine  ew with a rich aroma and flavor. It is smooth and satisfying with a full bodied taste. My wife and I loved the taste and aroma of this ground coffee. For an ideal cup measure one heaping teaspoon full of coffee per cup of hot water. You could change the quantity depending on the strength of the coffee you desire. I generally drink decaffeinated Folgers's  and, and when I compared the two  ands, I did not find a great deal of difference in the richness of coffee. You may want to consider the price variance between the two  ands before you want to purchase this product.
