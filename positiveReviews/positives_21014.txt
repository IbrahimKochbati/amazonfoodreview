I think I covered it all in the title. We've tried lots of different flavors when we could find them at the grocery store, but often they're not available in high quantities. I've found this encourages me to drink more water, and this is my favorite flavor. Grocery stores rarely carry it in the quantity that I prefer to purchase, and this makes it simple for me to make sure I always have plenty on hand. Great product, great flavor, and plenty in the cupboard at all times ...   "
