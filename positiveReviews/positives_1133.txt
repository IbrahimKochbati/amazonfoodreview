If you want a hot meal with no effort that is delious...this is the way. While cooking noodles...microwave left over meat hot dog boloni(sp?). Also, microwave a spoon or two of vegetable...left over frozen canned. After noodles cook add season packet...pour over meat veg...after a minute pour some of the liquid out...you have a wonderful meal with less sodium because you poured it out! College kids live off this meal because it is CHEAP quick and can all be done in microwave if need be. You can get a case of Libby's carot peas from AMAZON for about$11! Since you are using only a spoon or two...lasts a long time!
