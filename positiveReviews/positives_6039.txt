I received my tree quite quickly despite the holidays. when I got the tree, it was packaged very well and i don't think anything short of getting run over by a freight train could have  oken the tree. I called after I got the tree and the exchange i had with the person on the other end was very helpful, and I could not be more pleased with their service. these guys show great care and dedication to the customers.          All in all, a fantastic buy.
