There are many workdays when I only have a few minutes for lunch or (all too often) dinner. On these days, Dr. McDougall's products are lifesavers! I keep some fresh, washed veggies in my office fridge and can have a great meal ready in 5 minutes. Just microwave this one, for instance, while cutting up some  occoli, peppers, a carrot, and whatever else I have around (I also added half of a slim yellow squash the other day, cut in little "twigs"   delicous!) By the time you're through cutting, you'll have finished with cooking the soup and the soup's "standing" time will be almost over. (It needs a few minutes to thicken up.) Take a tablespoon of the  oth and a tablespoon of water, add the veggies and the liquid to a big bowl, toss the veggies in the liquid, and microwave for about 1 minute 30 seconds. When through, dump the soup and noodles on top and you have a delicious, healthy meal. The men in my office come sniffing around when the aroma of the soup comes out of the microwave    several are now also fans, despite being initially worried by the fact that the meal is vegan. When I am organized enough to remember to wash and  ing it in, I add a spring onion on top (I just use an office scissors to cut it.) If you can afford the calories, a few drops of toasted sesame oil is a nice addition, as well, as is tamari. YUMMY!
