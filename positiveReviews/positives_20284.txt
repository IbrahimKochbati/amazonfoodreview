I took advantage of the 50% off special last summer to try some new to me products, including 4 flavors of these sesame seeds, and loved all of them! This was probably my favorite of the four I tried; the plum sesame flavor combination is tasty with a LOT of foods, both savory and sweet. The plum flavor is perceptible but not overwhelming. Try it on ice cream!
