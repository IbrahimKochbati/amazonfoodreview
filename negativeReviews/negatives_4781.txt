POOR PACKAGING:  The product arrived in one giant plastic pouch, of poor quality plastic, which ripped in transit and some of the dal escaped.  The packaging needs improvement.  The dal looks OK, tho I haven't cooked it up yet.          QUANTITY INCORRECT UNIT PRICING:  The product which arrived was ONE 64 ounce pouch, NOT a pack of four 64 ounce pouches, which is what the website said:  "Spicy World Chana Dal, 64 Ounce Pouches (Pack of 4)."  This makes it $5.72 pound, not $1.42 pound.  Amazon should correct this and should post the price per pound or per ounce for grocery items, like the stores do   "unit pricing."  This would help us compare prices on these items.          AMAZON SELLER FEEDBACK:  Because amazon.com is the "seller" I can't leave "seller feedback" from my order on the amazon website!  Amazon should allow for "seller feedback" re amazon as the seller.          UPDATE:  I finally found how to email Amazon Customer Service through the "Help" link, upper right of the webpage.  I was fairly impressed with their prompt response to my concerns.  I hope they will fix the incorrect pricing info & start doing "unit pricing" on grocery items.
