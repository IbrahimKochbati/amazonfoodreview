I started eating Emerald Nuts Dry roasted Walnuts about three years ago.  And I acquired such a "must have" appetite for these walnuts.  I can't find them in local stores.  Usually sold that I could find at military commissaries.  I was glad I checked with Amazon.com, because the military facility here in Arkansas is so far away.  I love them and they are good for you.  I plan on purchasing more and stock up so I won't run out.
