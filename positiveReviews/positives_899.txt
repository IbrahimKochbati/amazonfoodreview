These tomatoes taste like home canned. When summer is over and heirloom tomatoes no longer are available at the farmers market, these serve as an excellent reminder of the past season and a promise of the next. I originally bought these organic tomatoes for my stepfather, whose heart disease dictated a low sodium diet. And they are incredibly low in sodium. But I soon bought them for myself after I tried them just once. When the local organic grocery store and then Sprouts stopped carrying them, I turned to Amazon for a case. They are as much a staple in my pantry as olive oil.
