So how does it taste? Well depends on how sweet you like your drinks. It is tasty but it's not as the container would leave you to believe that it is good for you. This is no better then drinking a soda filled with corn syrup because of the amount of calories and carbs it contains. It's all sugar and it shows not only going in but around the mid section if you pounded these things for a few months straight.          Pass.
