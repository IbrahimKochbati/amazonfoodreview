Why wait 30min to marinade meat when Shake and Bake always comes in handy?  This is a very good mix, the pork came out juicy.  I also used the rest of the packet on chicken, which also came out great.  Really, you cannot go wrong.  My pro tip   first roll the meat in mayo or sour cream, then coat with shake and bake   it will be even juicier.
