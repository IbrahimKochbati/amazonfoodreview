I recently ran out of GMCR's "Our Blend' and was forced to try Newman's Own.  It took my colleagues 20 minutes to convince me that I wasn't drinking urine.  It truly offended my taste buds.          You can taste the lack of passion and pride in this blend.  Newman could take a lesson from "Our Blend"   show a little pride for your work.  Don't be afraid to think outside the box to create a coffee that doesn't taste like cow sweat. That's what makes "Our Blend" great   you can taste the uniqueness and creativity in the  ew.          My advice to Newman's Own: Step aside and let the artists behind "Our Blend" restore America's faith in coffee.
