I had previously imbibed a couple other flavors of Switch beverages, and I liked them a good bit.  This one was not bad, but certainly unremarkable.  The kiwi flavor was not very prominent, and I had to really try to distinguish that there was any kiwi flavor at all.  The berry is more what I tasted.  Since I'd like the other flavors so well, I was expecting I'd like this one as well, but I didn't even bother finishing the drink.  Other people might like it better, but I found it to be too sweet and not all that worthy of drinking.
