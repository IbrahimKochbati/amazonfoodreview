This is a really good waffle mix! It's great for a large family or group meals. If there's just two people one batch makes only 3 waffles, which was a little odd the first time we made waffles with this mix because it was an uneven amount. However, this is still a very tasty waffle mix that my family & I very much enjoy & would highly recommend!
