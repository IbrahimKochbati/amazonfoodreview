We received this order in perfect condition. I purchased this product for my mother in law. She likes the convenience of the product in the Keurig Coffee Maker. The chocolate does not stick to the sides of the cup like the cheap hot chocolate in the paper bags. Overall it tastes pretty good. It is a little weak but good. Use only on the small cup setting in the Keurig. 4 stars.
