The Caffe Lungo capsules produce one of the best Americanos I've ever had. The flavor is as deep and rich as my former $400 espresso machine made. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's better. I was quite surprised at the quality and could drink this everyday. The amount of crema also exceeded what the Senseo produces by a significant amount.          I also felt very satisfied after one cup of this although I normally drink a couple of cups of coffee in the morning. For around 50 cents a cup, I would much rather have this than Starbucks any day.          Although Nescafe does not have nearly enough varieties of coffee for their Dolce Gusto, this one is a winner.
