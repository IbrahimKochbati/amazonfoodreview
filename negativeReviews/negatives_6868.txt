Popcorn oil solidified once it was in my house. This does not do so well in my new popcorn machine. I have to squeeze the oil out of the compartment then microwave it to make it liquid,  then I have to put it in my popcorn machine. Also when my shipment arrived the box the popcorn was in, looked as though one of the oils had leaked. Not sure if this is normal for all of this to have occurred but I'm just not happy with the way the oil has set up like concrete in the package. I was not happy with the popcorn purchase.
