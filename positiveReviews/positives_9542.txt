I almost hesitate to give a review because this is my "secret ingredient" in so many things.          My husband is from SLO and when we first met I thought it was so weird that the only thing he wanted from his mom for birthdays and holidays was Pepper Plant Sauce (I don't do spicy so I never tried it).  Then he got some of the seasoning.  Now I understand.  We use it in and on everything   eggs, steaks, popcorn (tip   put it in the butter!), chilli, black beans, soups, cooked vegies, tuna salad, guacamole, develed eggs (my fave).  Somehow almost every time I am "making up" some sort of savory recipe, this stuff makes it in there.  Just 2 weeks ago I had the idea to make dip with cream cheese, sour cream, the sauce and some seasoning.  It was a total hit at the play off party.  I just made it again today for our pre superbowl potluck at work and got rave reviews again.  Heck   while typing this up I had the thought that the seasoning would make an awsome variation to garlic  ead or crostini. Mmm   I might have to try that tonight.  You have to promise not to tell anyone though!
