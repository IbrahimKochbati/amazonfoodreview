Our extended family goes through a lot of tea and we have some genuine aficionados; some may even say snobs.  We originally tried Newman's Own tea because we liked their other products and appreciate their charitable giving ethos.  What we were expecting, at the price we paid, was a relatively low grade, re  anded tea.  That is not what we got.          What we got was not only a consistently high quality tea, but also an astonishing value.  What really impresses me is that the quality and taste of this tea is so consistent; it's really the best black tea you can find, box after box, for the price anywhere near where they sell it, even much higher.  To be honest, I don't know how they do it but I'm delighted they do.  We buy this tea by the case.          The flavor of this tea is crisp and clear, rich, but never bitter.  I had been accustomed to have my tea English style with cream, but Newman's Own black tea is so flavorful and mellow I've taken to having it straight up all the time.  It's really that good.          It would be a tremendous value as it is, but throw in the fact that it is organic, to boot, and it's just a steal.  All the bags in the box are individually wrapped. Personally, I would prefer if they were loose; even though we recycle all the little paper bags they come in, I would feel better if they didn't have those at all.          Easy to give this product an enthusiastic five stars.  Highly recommended.
