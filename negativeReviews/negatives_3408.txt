I really am disappointed with Amazon for their allowing this product to be shipped to their consumers the way it is. I opened my box only to find creamers thrown in every which way, and there are several that have spilled. The whole box is now sticky and I don't even know what to do... I decided to take them all out of the box and rinse them under warm water. That has done the trick for the most part, and then I put them into a small wicker box (to be stored in my pantry). I really like the way it tastes, and makes my coffee so sweet and delicious. I gave it 3 stars for the messy situation I had on my hands. They do taste yummy though... so you have to decide if you are up for the messy clean up before you buy them!!
