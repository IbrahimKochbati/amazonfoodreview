I got this to use in tea that I preferred to use honey in(Jasmine tea). And I gave up using honey,(being a product made by bees,and it really belongs to the bees),when I became vegan.          I also found it,with Stevia,or xylitol(a sugar substitute that isn't like sugar,having only 5 molecules of(something),so it does not affect you body or teeth like sugar does. Stevia is a sugar like,low calorie sugar replacement,being like sugar in that it has 6 molecules(of whatever it is that makes your body respond to it like it is sugar). But I made a good vegan chocolate syrup,that would not have been good without a modest squirt of agave nectar.          I only used filtered water,some cocoa powder(about a quarter cup),I teaspoon(a regular teaspoon,not a measuring teaspoon) of instant coffee(I like Maxwell house and hershey's cocoa,the special dark or the regular cocoa works)...for most of the sweet taste,I used Stevia,enough to make it sweet. I don't know how much. But it had an "off"taste,and wasn't that great. I added a short squirt of agave nectar,a tablespoon,maybe a little more.but not much,and it"fixed it",and the "off"taste went away. I had it on unsweetened,partly thawed frozen strawberries. Chocolate fans I'm sure will find many uses for a basic,not high calorie,tasty chocolate syrup. With soymilk I'm sure it would make a good,vegan,chocolate milk,or hot chocolate. Or a vegan hot cocoa. Added to tofu and soymilk in a blender,vegan chocolate pudding. More ambitious cooks could probably find 101 things to do with it,if they spent an hour or two thinking of favorite recipes,I'm sure.
