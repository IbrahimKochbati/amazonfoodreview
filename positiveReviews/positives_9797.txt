I noticed in reading the reviews of these nuts that all the negative reviews were from right around the same time frame, so I figured it was likely there was a bad lot then and all of those reviews were of orders from the same lot.  I figured I'd take a chance on them since the price (as of today) is outstanding for raw macadamia nuts at a bit shy of $9   lb, and I'm glad I did since they're really outstanding.          They're extremely fresh with no shell fragments, minimal dust, small nut fragments, etc., from processing and I believe in the whole bag while processing into a vacuum sealed bag for freezing I only spotted a single macadamia that wasn't whole, and it was itself a fully intact half nut.  Assuming the price is anywhere close to what it was as of when I ordered this bag when I run out, I'll definitely be reordering these.
