I have been using AGAVE NECTAR as my main sweetner & in 1 week I gained  about 5 pounds! I eat really healthy & I am in great shape and couldn't figure it out, then I did some research. AGAVE NECTAR is made of 90% fructose, it is a HIGH consentrated sugar. It causes FAST WEIGHT GAIN. I'm not for sure what I am going to do with the rest of these bottles I have but I'm not putting them in my body! The worst thing is that I have been feeding it to my family, saying this is "healthy"! So do your research before you buy anything that claims to be "healthy".
