I was pleasantly surprised with this coconut sugar! It has a very earthy, slight maple flavor. It doesn't have an overly sweet sweetness as white sugar does. I've used it in tea and also made banana muffins which came out tasting wonderfully! I did not notice any coconut flavor at all, which wouldn't have mattered either way for me. I will continue to use this in place of white or  own sugar in our home.
