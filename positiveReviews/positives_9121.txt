Erin Baker Breakfast Cookies are an excellent alternative to energy bars and other trail foods.  They pack well and provide 300 nutritious calories and sustenance.  They are not gourmet desert cookies, they have a lower ratio of sugar and fat, and more whole grain carbohydrates.  They won't taste as good, but they will provide energy without a sugar spike, or clogging your arteries with saturated fats.          They're still pretty good tasting to me, and taste even better during an 8 mile hike.
