I love these noodles.  They are really great for a midnight snack.  It's not really something that will fill you up for a dinner.  If you do eat it for dinner, you will be hungry later.  Maybe some people wouldn't!!!!  But, it just doesn't stick to my ribs.  I love them though and Amazon has a really good price.
