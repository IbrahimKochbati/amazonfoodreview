This was my second maker, they last just about 15 months, so if what to invest your money, go ahead! The K cups are expenses. you can wriye keurig and they don't even respone to you! OH they are great at first. You know you can buy a black and decker or something like that, for lest than fifty dollars and it will last about 2 years or better! Thesa keurig are well over hundred, that's the cheaper one, now to upgrade it like $150.00. Thats my opinion.
