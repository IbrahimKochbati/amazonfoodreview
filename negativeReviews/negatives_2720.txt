I tried this once and just tossed a whole box in the garbage.  The cereal looks like Cinnamon Toast Crunch but it taste like some sort of fake caramel substitute.  It has a powdery coating that is worse than the butt end of a regular box of cereal with all the  oken crumbs in the bottom.  The carmel flavor tastes fake and almost made me gag a few times.
