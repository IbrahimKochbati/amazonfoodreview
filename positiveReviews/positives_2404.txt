I am so totally satisfied by Hodgson Mill products & I probably have purchased   100 loaves at this point.  I used some as a present to my  other with good results, too.          Never have I seen "old" smelling mix nor have I ever had a yeast failure.  Their taste & texture is wonderful. Never have I had a "slicing failure" where you can't get a slice to hold together long enough to lay it down. The different types lend themselves well to adding ingredients such as Chopped Nuts or Sesame Seeds or Millet Seed or     use your own imagination.  Coming in nice units of 6 loaves makes pantry storage easy, and once opened, the carton yields 6 boxes with "Best By" dates easily accessible on each so rotating your shelf stock is almost "goof proofed".          Next time you walk a grocery store, note the prices there! Here again, I think you really can't beat the quality with a really fair price that Hodgson provides.  It seems to me that they have expended great effort to have the best product they can produce & the best shipping available for their customers.          Buy with great confidence based on my experiences with them during the last 2 3 years.  I hope this helps decision making.
