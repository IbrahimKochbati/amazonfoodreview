I have counted, and (no joke), have, over the past 4 years, purchased 18 of these Busy Buddy Toys.  This is good (because obviously we love them), but, find that, after about a month, we need to order a new one, because my dogs jaws are so strong that, he  eaks the toy.  We eventually needed to stop buying the toy :(
