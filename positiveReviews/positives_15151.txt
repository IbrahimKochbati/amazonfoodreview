I used to buy one of those Purina  ands for both my dogs which was fine at first. Then after a friend told me about this product I looked around a bit more and decided to give this one a try. If any of you own a pug, you know how stinky their farts could get! After eating this one for a while, my pug seems to have less flatulence problems or at least far far less smelly ones. I could also feed them a little less in order to maintain their proper weight as opposed to the other  ands, it had too much filler. My pets seem to be much happier, more energetic, much healthier looking, and have less smelly farts.
