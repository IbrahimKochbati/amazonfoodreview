I wasn't sure what to expect from a carbonated fruit drink, but decided to give it a try.  While it was drinkable, I actually prefer the natural taste of fruit juice.  This actually tasted like an artificial soda, much like a very well known orange soda.  The carbonation was excessively strong, with too much bite and burn for my liking.          As some other reviewers pointed out, the amount of sugar and calories in this drink was astounding.  It is almost too sweet, and combined with the carbonation was just too much for me to enjoy it very much.
