Of all bakery on main fiber power granola's this is my favorite! the dried berry's are huge inside and you can actually pick them up to eat individually, not like a micro berry found in commercial bags of granola. Bakery on main is a dedicated facility so there is no chance of cross contamination, I am celiac since birth so I am very cautious and am excited to see BOM at Amazon because hands down this is the very best product on the market.
