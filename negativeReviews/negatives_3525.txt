I love chocolate with cinnamon in it, and artisan chocolates in general, so i had such high hopes for this product. It disappointed me.          First off, it was grainy, in a too much sugar way, not a coarsely ground cacao way. If you  eak off a piece, you can see the sugar crystals glinting in the chocolate.          Second, it had almost no flavor. I couldn't taste the cinnamon at all, and the even chocolate itself was weak.          It smells wonderful, but tastes like grainy nothing.
