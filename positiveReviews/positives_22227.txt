We've been using Chebe products for a couple of years now, enjoying the rolls, pizza crust, cheese sticks etc.  But yesterday, we tried making Calzone, which prompted me to write this review.  We followed the recipe on the insert (not the one on the package, it's slightly different) to the letter, and came out with a crisp, tasty product that even the pickiest Italian cook would have to approve.  So be creative    it's worth the effort.  You don't have to be celiac   gluten free to enjoy it.  (I'm not, my husband is.)
