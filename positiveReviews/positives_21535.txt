I am very excited about the flavor I recieved when eating this oatmeal.  Typically I have found oatmeal, especially instant, to be bland to the point that I had to add  own sugar, honey, apples, or maple syrup to add more flavor.  This was not the case here.  Beautifully sweet and very enjoyable to eat.  Quick to make.  I heated this up in about a minute using milk.  I do feel that an adult needs two packet of this product to feel fulfilled.  One packet is just a  eakfast appetizer.  I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys sweet oatmeal.  I would definitely purchase this product.
