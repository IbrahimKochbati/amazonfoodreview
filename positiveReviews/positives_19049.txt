I particularly love biscuits  similar foods and Carbquik is great! I've been using it with bisquick recipes to replace the bisquik. Even the simple drop biscuits (just water added) are great and I've also tried other things such as pizza crust and cinnamin rolls. DON'T purchase it here  netrition.com has it for less than half the price.
