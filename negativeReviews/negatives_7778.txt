I bought these for my two small dogs. A day after they had them,both acted "off" ,they refused to eat their canned dog food(Wellness).The only thing different in their daily schedule was the Petrodex Dental Chews. I read the label,it states "wash hands after handling". If there is something so toxic in these chews that I must wash my hands after handling,I sure do not want my dogs chewing and eating them.They are in the garbage.If I could have awarded zero stars,I would have.I am going to stick to the Breath Brushers made by Zuke's. Pricier,but worth it to me.
