I bought my Keurig coffee machine a couple of months ago and sense then I think I have drunk more coffee in these last two months than I have my entire life and I am 64.     I have been trying to sample all the K cups. This is just one group that I have tried.     It is soooooooooo nice to get out of bed in the morning and get a fresh cup of coffee no worrying about what I'm going to do with all that coffee  left in the pot going stale.     I LOVE MY KEURIG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     PS     I got a collection of coffee makers some hardly used. ANYBODY WANT THEM!!!!!!!!?????????     Jim Brandt
