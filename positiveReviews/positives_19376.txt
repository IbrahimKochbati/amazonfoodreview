I am always looking for ways to add a little fiber to our diet.  This does just have a little fiber, but it's a lot better than the other kraft mac and cheese products, with the same taste my kids love.  They turned their noses up at the other  ands of mac and cheese that have more fiber.  They never notice any difference with this.
