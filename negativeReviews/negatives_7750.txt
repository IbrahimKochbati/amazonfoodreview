Nothing wrong with The Glenlivet 12 YO.  It is usually what most of us on this side of the pond start our single malt journey with (also Glenfiddich no age statement no longer available)  I did back in the eighties and I still come back to it from time to time to this day.  Though it lacks complexity on the palate and has a weak finish, it posses a great nose.  A classic Speysider everyone should have in their cabinet.
