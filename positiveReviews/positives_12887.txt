I've never been a fan of kiwi & strawberry together, but I think Switch got it right by combining fruit juice with carbonation.  I am a big fan!  It was a little bit too sweet, but I'm hoping other flavors will tone that done a little.  I suspect that the 135 calories for this perfectly sized can is due to the fruit itself, and not added sugar, although there is acerola in it   which is also known as the Puerto Rican Cherry.  That means no added sugar at all.  Try this   I don't think you'll regret it.
