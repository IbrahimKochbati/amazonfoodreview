4.5. Just water and large pieces of sardines. Open for all types of combinations of which I find the old whole grain crackers, quality cheese, a particle of mayo and mustard and a hot cup of tea, the most appealing. They do lunch in a hurry and snack times as well. Solid product. Even drank the water in which they are laid to rest and not too shabby. Sardines are good for a person, everyone agrees on that. Even a Sardine sandwich sounds about right in the next few minutes (the better the  ead the better the sandwich...) so yes, 4 Solid Stars and I am hungry for the product right now, come to think of it!
