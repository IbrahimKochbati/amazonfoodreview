I have a 3 year old Siberian Husky, who has to be the pickiest dog in the world. He will go days without eating if I don't give him exactly what he wants. I must have 15 20 bags of different treats that he turns his nose up at (Busy bones, busy rollhides, busy granola, biscuits, chicken jerky treats, etc.) Greenies are the ONLY thing I can give him that I know for a fact he will eat. In fact, Siberian Huskies rarely if ever bark, but if I even go near him while he's chewing on the greenie he'll starting barking at me.. and well trying to take it away is another story. These things are EXPENSIVE, but it is cheaper in the long run than paying $10 for a bag of treat where he'll have 1 or 2 and be done.
