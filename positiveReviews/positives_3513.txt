I prepared this coffee in a french press (although it is ground too fine for this).  It had a nice aroma, a full taste and mild bitterness.  It's a fools game to try to describe the taste of anything in any detail   so I'll just leave you with the coffee was quite good and it would make a good after dinner coffee.          My only complaint is the coffee is pre ground.  Ground coffee is a bit stale by the time you get it, however, a blade grinder will ruin the coffee as well.          If you don't own a burr grinder, this is the best cup of decaff you're going to get.
