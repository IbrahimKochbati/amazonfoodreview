My dogs are absolutely crazy about these; they're like crack for dogs.  I last purchased some in Fall 2010 for $14 for 24; then we decided to take a  eak from them for awhile to ease the addiction.  Feeling soft, I thought to purchase some again.  Now, less than a year later in June 2011, they are almost $20 for 24.  That's an outrageous price increase in a short amount of time.  Yes, those of us who have dogs love our dogs, but I feel like our love for them is being taken advantage of.  I can only imagine what the profit margin is...
