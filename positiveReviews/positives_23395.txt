This is a very flavorful and excellent salt! Also a great price. The item arrived on time and we are very pleased. We bought two of these, and gave one to our  other and sister in law as a gift. All of us had tasted this product in San Francisco at the farmer's market in the Ferry Building and were impressed. It's great to have this in our own kitchen to enjoy some more!
