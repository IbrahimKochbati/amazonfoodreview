I love the shape and taste of mini pretzels like these but don't like the flavor of wheat   so this is the perfect solution. Light on salt, baked just to perfection, with the slightly nutty taste of spelt. They don't overpower anything else I'm eating or drinking, very well balanced. Thanks Newmans' Own, another winner!
