My husband is not a coffee drinker and the nippy mornings left him a little jealous of my warm cup of coffee.  Having just returned from a trip to Santa Fe where I had purchased it originally, I introduced him to the pleasures of morning hot chocolate.  He was hooked!!  Now for the other use, today , the day after Thanksgiving clean up we were at  eakfast without any milk in the house, but an abundance of leftover decaf coffee from the cele ation, his long face was  ightened when I spooned in a bit of MOCAFE Mexican Spiced Chocolate into a cup of decaf.  WOW! a new taste and he loved it!          What else can I say, it's a hit around our house.
