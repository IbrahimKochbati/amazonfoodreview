I love kettle chips and I love spicy food. This is decently spicy but I don't think the flavor is that great. You definitely taste the vinegar in these, which I don't like. I want the vinegar taste to be mild and subtle but it is a bit strong for me. It's not overwhelming, just not how I like my buffalo flavor.
