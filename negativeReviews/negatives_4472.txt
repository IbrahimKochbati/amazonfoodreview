Ordered directly from PetFoodDirect before I saw the negative reviews here.  So after delivery, I decided I would make the transition slowly.  A week and a half later, I was feeding approx half old and half new, and one of the dogs started vomiting had diarrhea, had no appetite, and was lethargic.  I'm switching him to a plain chicken and rice diet, but if he doesn't get better soon, I'll have to take him to the vet.          Other dog must have an iron constitution because she seems fine.          UPDATE:  Took the sick dog to the vet.  He was given IV fluids because he became dehydrated.  $150 and one day later, he seems a little better.  But vet said the blood work came back a little off and I should  ing him back for x ray and recheck.  I'm going to hold off because I do think he's improving on the bland diet.          The other dog had some alarming sounds coming from her stomach last night.  She seems fine today, but I think if the first dog had not become sick and if I had kept giving Canidae, I think this dog would have eventually become sick as well.
