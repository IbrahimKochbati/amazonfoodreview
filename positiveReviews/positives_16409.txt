or really my dog loves them.  When I have a busy day and I am too tired to  ush her teeth, I just give her one of these instead and they do as they describe:  keep her teeth clean.  They are very soft and easy on her teeth but also rub the leftovers off to keep them clean.  I really recommend these to anybody who has a dog and they also make cat greenies which also work for my barn cats and they love them.
