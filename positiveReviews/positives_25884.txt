As a diabetic, this is a good alternative to articial sweetners.  And its low glycemic index value makes it such a desirable product.  The quality is almost identical to sugar and provides a great deal more nutritional value.  It is expensive though when compared to refined sugar but you have to decide on the value to you.  Highly recommended!!
