I've had this a few times before and it is amazing. Last time I had it a half pill was one dose so I thought this was a bit cheaper than it turned out to be but it's still great and well worth it at $2 per dose. I like that it also came with some recommended foods to try. Lemons and limes are by far the best, beer is pretty cool too.
