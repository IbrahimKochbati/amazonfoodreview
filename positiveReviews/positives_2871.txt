What I like most about this product is its unique taste. Just enough spiciness and sweetness to make it different but it goes with virtually anything. I haven't tried cooking with it but I can imagine it would add a lot to stews, soups, etc. It keeps well   the last bottle I had got lost in my pantry and was several years old when I found it and it still tasted great. It belongs along with the A1, Heinz 57, Worcestershire Sauce, Catsup, etc as a condiment staple.
