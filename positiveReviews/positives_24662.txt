This pumpkin product arrived in good condition and is all that was available after the almost year long shortage due to Libby pumpkin running out during the 2009 holiday season. My dogs get pumpkin with each meal to help with their digestive system working properly and it works great. Thanks to Farmer's Brand for having enough product to fill our needs. It is more expensive to order online, naturally, but between my 'stop gap' measures of baking squash to serve to my dogs, and alternating between meals with Farmers Brand pumpkin, we will be able to make it through to the next harvest season, where I feel we should purchase our own warehouse full of pumpkin in case the shortage hits us again next year. Thank you Farmers  and and Amazon for helping us through your being prepared to offer your products to us on line. My dogs thank you too... woof!;  )
