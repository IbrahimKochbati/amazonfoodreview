I have a small single cup coffee maker for those times when I need a quick cup of coffee but don't want a whole pot.  All right, that doesn't happen very often   I can usually handle a whole pot.  But when I want a quick cup, I don't want to be grinding beans, getting out a filter and going through all the same steps as making a whole pot.  These filter packs are the perfect solution at a great price!  The coffee is almost as good as Starbucks for a fraction of the price.
