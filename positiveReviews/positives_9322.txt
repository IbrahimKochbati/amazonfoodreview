My 60 lb dog LOVES these.  She is very picky about food and treats, but eats this readily.  She needs the glucosamine chondroitin for her knees and even if I hid the pills in cat food, peanut butter, you name it  she wouldn't touch it.  She also has allergies to a lot of common ingredients (chicken, beef, wheat), so really this treat is a lifesaver!
