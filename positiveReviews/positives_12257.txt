Living in a rural area in America has its downs, especially the lack of diverse and international food items at the supermarkets. Never fear! La Tienda hooked me up with this deliciously spicy aji amarillo, a necessity in my favorite Peruvian dishes. It also tastes great in tuna!          Packaged extremely safely (a little ridiculous really), my aji got to me in just a few days.
