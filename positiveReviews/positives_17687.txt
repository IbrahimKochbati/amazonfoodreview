I made this coffee and shared it with people in my office.  The consensus opinion was that it has the flavor found in many other  ands identified as french roast, but is not as overpowering as  ands like Starbucks.  It was difficult to judge the lower acidity.  I usually drink decaf, partially due to acidity issues, and reacted about the same to the Puroast Low Acid as I do to most decafs.
