Like a number of other reviewers, we use canned pumpkin as a dietary supplement for our dogs. As a result, we go through a lot of it. We usually use the Libby's  and which is readily available in our grocery store, but due to flooding of last year's crop it has been out of stock for a few months. Luckily the organic growers did not have the same problem. I find this product to be more finely pureed than the Libby's so it seems a bit runnier. However, my dogs love it. The only minor disadvantage is the cost. It is more expensive than the Libby's, plus I'm paying to have it shipped now vs. picking it up at the store.          A number of other Amazon customers have complained about receiving badly dented cans. Mine arrived 100% intact. This may be a result of the unconventional courier used. It appeared to be some sort of private delivery service though I paid for the standard service. A man hand delivered the item to my house using what appeared to be his ordinary Chrysler Pacifica minivan. I've never seen an item delivered this way by Amazon or anybody before.
