Using the SproutMaster I've had great success with these, full trays of sprouts effortlessly. One container will produce a massive amount of sprouts.          If you don't know much about this kind of sprout, beans and peas are a good source of vegetarian protein. Sprouts, as they grow produce enzymes, which can play a number of roles in digestion and even immune system function, because most of your immune system is in your gestational tract. Sprouts are also a great source of fiber, and antioxidants. During the winter it is great to be able to grow a fresh, live food, because veggies at the grocery store are usually quite wilted or picked well before their peak. Sprouts, eaten fresh, are a plant that on a per size basis, is pretty much the most potent and healthy thing you can feed yourself.
