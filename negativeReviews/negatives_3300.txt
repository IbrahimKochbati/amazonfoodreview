I don't eat beef and having a jerky snack around is nice.  Bag is enormous for what's inside it.  There's basically food in the bottom 3 inches of the bag, and, because of the sauce, if you reach your hand in instead of shaking it out of the bag into your hand, you'll end up with dirty hands.  A much smaller bag would make sense.  I'd also like to see more for the price.  Flavor is good.
