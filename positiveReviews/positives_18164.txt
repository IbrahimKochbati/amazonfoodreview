I first sampled these chips at a volleyball tournament in California.  I'm a big chip lover, and these are by far the best chips I've ever had.  Better than the baked; not greasy at all, sturdy for dips.  I highly recommend these chips to any chip lover!  (I've not purchased them from Amazon, so I don't know how they will fare during shipping.)
