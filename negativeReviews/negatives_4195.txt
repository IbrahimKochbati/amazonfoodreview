the product is listed as a 150g 6 pack.     Traditionally, when US companies do a bundle pack they list the size of the individuals...so a 6 pack of canned soda would be a 12oz 6 pack, we would never see that listed as a 72oz 6 pack          I foolishly assumed I was getting a real bargain, 6 150g bags, for about $8!     Oh so wrong. It's a 6 pack of 25g bags, 150g TOTAL          So you're getting about the equivalent of one bag of chips for your money. Still, not a terrible deal for something a little exotic.          The chips themselves were good, though! I only took stars off for the somewhat deceptive descriotion and the fact it took a couple of weeks for them to arrive.
