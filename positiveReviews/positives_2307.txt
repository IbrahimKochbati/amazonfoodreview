Okay, not like the butter most people would expect, but a very smooth, full and slightly savory vegetal flavor. The first time you take a sip, you might not notice it, but let it sit in your mouth a bit before swallowing and then take another sip. The more you drink it, the more it will become apparent. It is very soothing to the pallet.          Jin Xuan Golden Lily Oolong from Summit Tea Company it a good if not great tea, especially for the price and quantity you get. A solid every day drinker. It is not as complex as some that I've had, but that could be due to how long ago it was harvested and a number of other conditions. Depending on how you  ew it, a serving of these leaves is good for 4 5 infusions before the flavor wanes, making it an even better value. And even then, the  oth is soft and sweet.          If you like your Oolongs more on the green side, then you should give it a try. I know I'll be ordering another tin.
