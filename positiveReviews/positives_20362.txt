Our 7 month old was exclusively  eastfed until 6 months when we started slowly introducing solids.  Her food is about 50% homemade purees and 50% jarred pouched baby food (Earth's Best, Happy Babies, and Plum Organics).  We tried sweet potato as her first food but it didn't go over well, so we decided to try something bland and smooth but didn't want to give her a processed white rice cereal.  We picked up the Happy Bellies oatmeal and it was a hit!  Now when introducing a new food I'll mix up a bit of the oatmeal and blend it with the fruit or veggie puree to help her adjust to the new flavor.          Plum Organics has an oatmeal that also has probiotics and my parents have purchased it to keep at their house (we go for dinner once a week). I much prefer the packaging, texture, and ease of mixing smoothness of the Happy Bellies oatmeal.  Happy Bellies also has DHA, which Plum Organics does not.
