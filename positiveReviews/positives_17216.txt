I have been using Equal sweetener for a very long time.  The amount I paid for the pack of 8 jars was so much cheaper than the amount at the store.  I am thrilled to have gotten my favorite sweetner for such a deal.  In my opinion, Equal is the best artificial sweetener of all the ones offered.  It has no after taste and it can be used in cooking the same way you use sugar.  Love it!
