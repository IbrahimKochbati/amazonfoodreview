We have a 16 week Cocker Spaniel Australian Shepherd mix (~20 lbs). We got this toy for him when he was only around 10 weeks old.  It was challenging for him the first time.  When we gave it to him the next day, he knew exactly what he was doing and got all the treats out within two minutes.  We even timed it.  Now, as soon as we set it on the floor, it takes only a few seconds for him to get each compartment open, and we don't give it to him very often.  It's a cute fun way to deliver some treats, but it's not long before he's looking at us like, "Okay, now what?  What's next??"          Pros: Opens easily so it's not too frustrating.  The star design makes compartments a bit more challenging if the treats are pushed further inside.  You can put a dab of peanut butter in a few, and it will take him longer to lick it out, but you might have to clean it after.  The grips on the underside really help hold it in place so that he doesn't slide it around the floor too far or too quickly. It has withstood his strong bite chewing. It is rare that he flips it over, too, so it's weighted well.          Cons: Too easy, finished with it and bored within a minute, if not a few seconds.
