I'm a big fan of Outburst Energy Bites, and the peanut ones are probably my favorite. They're reasonably priced and a great snack. Think of peanut M&M's and a coffee all at once. Since they taste so good, it is very tempting to eat the whole box. They claim it's a lot of caffeine, but it doesn't feel like more than a big coffee or a large energy drink, so I usually give in to the temptation!          I highly recommend these!
