Since Republic of Tea discontinued their Bing Cherry Vanilla tea, I was looking for a replacement.  The flavor of this tea is very different from Republics   it's better.  The smell is very rich, like toasted vanilla and cherry.  It almost has a coffee smell, but not quite.  I don't like coffee, but this tea is incredible.  Glad I found it.  Best of all, the price!
