What an incredible price for this many high quality vanilla beans!!          I split them with a friend of mine and we've both been making our own extract with delicious success.  At first I thought I might not be able to find use for all the beans, but because I LOVE to make my own (vegan) ice cream, I'm now totally spoiled by these beans.  I grate them into my (non dairy) milk and simmer it, then let it cool in the fridge overnight, then go about making my ice cream.  I never want plain vanilla ice cream without using fresh beans again, no way!  It's too good.          What's more, have you ever bought beans from the grocery store?  It costs, like, $12 for two or three beans, and the beans are relative garbage.  These aren't dry and odorless like the ones from the store.  Instead, they're moist, soft, and have that delightful aroma that makes you just want to bake.
