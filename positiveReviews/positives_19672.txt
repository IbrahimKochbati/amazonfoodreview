i've searched high and low for a delicious, healthy, meatless jerky product.  i'm a pescatarian, so tuna salmon halibut jerky is great, but super expensive and often incredibly high in sodium.  i found these in the aisles of pcc and absolutely fell in love.  first thing i did was search amazon for them, and here they were!  the price is better, and i knew i would eat these every day.  i take two to work and have at least one at home.  i would recommend these to anyone, carnivore or vegan, looking for a delicious, healthy source of protein.  wow!
