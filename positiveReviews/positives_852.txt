These chips are really good. They taste better than other name  ands. They're cheaper too!!  They aren't too salty like other  ands. The flavors blend really well. Just the right amount of sour cream and onion flavor with a little salt mixed in. Once I start eating them, it's hard to stop!! LOL          I will definitely be buying these potato chips rather than another name  and. Not sure if I can state the name  and or not. :)
