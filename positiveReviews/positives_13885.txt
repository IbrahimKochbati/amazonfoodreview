I love high octane peanut butter, but not the fat calorie content.          TASTE: If you are accustomed to low salt or raw products, the taste will be fine. If someone in the house balks at the taste, you can toss in a dash of fine sea salt or honey (agave works well too). You could easily mix PB2 with PB to wean onto this gradually.          TEXTURE: Mixes fast and is very smooth (surprisingly). From the jar, it's similar in consistency to powdered sugar. Open factory seal on jar carefully so it doesn't fly out (trust me).          MIXING: Easily mixes using a small spoon or spatula in a gently sloping small bowl (I use a pinch bowl)          USAGE: PB2 has recipes on their website (Bell Plantation) and they also sell a chocolate pb product. I'm a fan of straight PB2 (a spoon by itself) but have had PB2 on crackers, sprinkled on banana apple slices, and am looking forward to making homemade PB2 ice cream this summer.          STORAGE: I was a bit disappointed at shelf life projection.  As a dry product, it should last for years but the company says 10 12 months unopened and 4 6 opened. I would prefer to buy the larger sizes or a case to save more.          COST: It can be obtained cheaper elsewhere (like on the PB2 website) but I had free shipping purchases to offset the cost. I wanted to try just one jar before committing to a larger sized container from the company. If you purchase natural products, the price won't be such a shock.          BIGGEST PROS: lower calorie and fat content   hands down the best. Dogs like it too ;)     BIGGEST CONS: high cost and not a product you can 'make ahead' very successfully (though this could be considered a "PRO" because it helps with portion control. I make it as needed.          This product will not change your life, but it will satisfy your peanut butter cravings.
