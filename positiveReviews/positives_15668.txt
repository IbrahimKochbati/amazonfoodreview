Let me start here by admitting that we have 5 cats that live with us now (I know, don't even ask it's a loooong story).  I've always been a big fan of the Fancy Feast and recently the fishier varieties of the Aristocats soft foods.  On occasion I will purchase Friskies but honestly I just can't stand the smell of the latter, even if the kitties just love it.          Just for a fun little test I decided to put three cans out, to see which was favored by my cats (Fancy Feast, Aristocats and this Petite Cuisine).  Well, long story short, they gobbled this  and up, quick as quick before moving on to their usual favorites.          This  and looks and for the most part smells similar to canned tuna, one of them even has tiny whole shrimp. Bonus!! They eat it all up, so no kitty food sitting in the bowl when they are done. It is made from quality ingredients, not full of ash (like some), has added vitamins and the texture & smell that the cats really enjoy.  I admit that quality cat food has gotten a bit on the expensive side but, this isn't bad at all considering the prices of the other comparable  ands.  All in all my kitties really enjoyed this food & I will certainly be back for more.
