I have been enjoying these for years.  I was delighted to find out I could get them at a discount and on a subscription basis from Amazon.  What more could a customer want?  These nuts are very nutritious and the best part is that it is not too sweet.  This works as a candy bar, but really is a nutrition bar that is crunchy, sweet, and a great  eakfast or  eak snack to tide  you over when you get the mid morning droops at work.  Most other nut bars are not as crunchy or overloaded with too much sugar.  Slip one in your pocket or pack and you are ready for a taste treat that is actually good for you.
