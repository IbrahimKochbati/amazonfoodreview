i just received  my cans and should have listened to the reviews. i tried to be positive and go with the reviews who received the cans in perfect shape. what a mistake. ALL but 2 cans were severely dented. the other 2 still had dents. i don't think i could open them if i tried, but i would be afraid to eat the product anyway. i will not pay to send them back. they were wrapped well in bubble wrap so they weren't damaged in transit. they were sent out with the sender KNOWINGLY sending imperfect cans. they should be ashamed of themselves, and if they want them back they should pay for the shipping!  i WILL not be taken in again. i want my money back. this is the FIRST item from amazon i have not been happy with.
