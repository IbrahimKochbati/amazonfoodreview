this is my favorite roast coffee. I love the dark roasts. I cannot STAND weak coffee. This is far from it, and for the price, it's like an amazing present of happiness to get THREE bags of it. Don't forget to SAVE the bags, as Starbucks has that thing goin' at select locations, where you can take the empty bag and get a free cup of coffee. I haven't done it yet, but there ya go. Happy beanin'.
