Thank god you get 48 of these packets.  These are amazingly good.  The key for me, who prefers thicker (not watery) oatmeal, is to put just enough water in it to cook, not to be liquidy.  This makes the flavors pop.  The apples are chewy and do not taste processed.  The cinnamon is so good, especially at the bottom of the cup.  This is definitely a great product.  I LOVE the fact that its got half the sugar and is actually healthy.  If you do weight watchers, a packet is 2 points.  I typically do 2 packets in a cup at work.  Its a great snack, late  eakfast, etc.  Sooo good, and organic!
