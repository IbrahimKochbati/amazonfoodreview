These pork rinds are SO easy to prepare   and they are delicious.  Much tastier than store bought in a bag.  I put them on a napkin on a small saucer and pop them into the microwave for two minutes.  They usually come out hot and fluffy.  But be careful, the saucer will be awfully hot to handle.  I take two hot pads to get them out of the microwave and place the saucer on another hot pad to let the skins cool.  When cool, what we don't eat right away I put into a small ziploc bag to enjoy later.  Mostly, though,  they don't last very long.  If you like pork skins, you will truly enjoy these.
