Doesn't taste as good as real peanut butter of course, BUT the small amount of flavor lost is worth the trade off considering how much healthier it is.  The texture consistency is also pretty much the same as normal PB once mixed.  If you just care about calories fat and not so much about sodium, adding salt makes it taste a lot better.
