I was very excited to try this coffee flavor, but when I did, I was very dissapointed.  I think the flavor is too strong, especially since it tastes really fake.  It almost tastes like there is alcohol in it.  Since I ordered the double box, I gave one away to a friend who likes this flavor. I would never buy this coffee again.
