I had ordered these as gifts, but when I opened the box to put them in the little bags I'd purchased they were all melted and dropping all over the box.  I opened one and it was all liquid  Threw them in the fridge, but too late, can't even open the wrappers without little bits of chocolate melted to the wrappes getting all over.  Better to buy these in your local store, learned my lesson.
