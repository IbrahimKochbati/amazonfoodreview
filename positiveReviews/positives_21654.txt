This candy is quite good. I know it has to be sent cold but let it get down to room temperature and the taste and texture is quite amazing. The only issue I had with it is that since it's a pound or two in a single bag, the licorice gets wrapped up in itself and it's hard to pull it apart with alot of effort. Great Product overall though!
