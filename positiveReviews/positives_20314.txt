We've gone through 5 cans now and my daughter loves this stuff.  I still went ahead and purchased this and the happybellies rice cereal after reading some great and not so great reviews for the Happybellies products and unlike some of the reviewers I've had none of the funky smell gray discoloring.  I'm assuming they fixed the problems. We mix it with fruit or feed it to our daughter just mixed with  eastmilk.
