After using erythritol in several recipes I've found that it tastes far better than alternate sweeteners like Splenda.  It is a little less sweet than sugar or Splenda so you might have to add a bit more to get the same taste.  The only problem with erythritol is that it doesn't  eak down easily in frostings or recipes that don't require some amount of cooking or baking.  I've found running it through a blender to  eak it down into a powder or mixing it with warm water before mixing it in removes the grainy texture and makes the erythritol easier to work with.
