Store bought jerky tends to be an excellent source of jaw exercise, but this jerky reminds me much more of the products available at our local farmer's markets.  Excellent flavor (purchased the hickory, trying original next), and an awesome price for such large qauntity.  It's nice to see actual texture and strip size variations, vs. the new "pressed square beef like product" now being sold as jerky in many bags.          My fiance mentioned upon trying her first piece that it doesn't taste like store bought.  I recommend this if you're a jerky fanatic struggling to find a good price quality ratio!
