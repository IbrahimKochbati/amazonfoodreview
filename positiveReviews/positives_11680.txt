Being gluten intolerant it was really nice to see that Pamela's has put out a GF type clif bar (best analogy I had for it). Oddly enough, it does taste like a lighter version of a clif bar (which are usually very dense). Mind you, it would take two of these to fill me like a clif bar does.          It's about 2 3rd's the size of a clif bar, it's loaded with oats (this is the first thing you taste) and chocolate chips (which is about the last thing you taste). They are moist and chewy like a soft cookie. About a medium sweetness compared to a regular cookie.          Per bar: calories (180), fat (9 gr), carbs (23 gr), fiber (2 gr), and protein (2 gr).          Ingredients: GF oats, organic agave,  own rice flour, white rice flour, sweet rice flour, tapioca starch, xanthan gum, organic chocolate chunks (organic natural evaporated can sugar, organic cocoa paste, organic cocoa butter, non GMO soy lecithin emulsifier, gluten free organic vanilla) coconut sugar, monounsaturated safflower oil, organic eggs, almonds, coconut, chia seeds, natural flavors, sea salt, baking soda, xanthan gum.          They do note on the packaging that there may be traces of milk, nuts, peanuts or soy because of what they're processed on.          Overall, they're pretty darn good.  I do taste a bit of baking soda (but I think that's me, I'm pretty sensitive to it) at the end of a bite, but the oats really are the main taste.          As someone who eats gluten free would I eat these if I was out and about and had to take a  eak quickly?          Yeah, I would.          They're like a soft, oaty cookie, easy to take, good ingredients, and they do taste quite nice. I'll buy them again easily.          If I had to pick between a clif bar and Pamela's Whenever Bars. I'd take Pamela's.
