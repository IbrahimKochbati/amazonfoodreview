My husband and I have been making a serious effort to change our eating habits and be healthy, which is why I purchased this product. I was concerned about the highly processed vegetable oil we had been using, and the way the oil can become carcinogenic when cooked at high heat. Now, this is true for any oil; it should not be heated past it's " smoke point ". Avocado oil has a very high smoke point, making it a perfect, healthy choice. It has healthy fats for your heart, and tastes yummy. I also recommend macadamia oil for the same reasons. Amazon shipped these right away, and they were perfect. If you have a Misto, this is a great oil to put in it! We will definitely keep this on hand.
