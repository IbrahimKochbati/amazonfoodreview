I'm on my second order of this mix and had to buy an extra one for a friend that's hooked on this too.  Great taste although maybe not what you're expecting if you make the Americanized version of chili.  Smells wonderful while simmering.  I have changed the recipe a bit......use 2   14oz cans of Mexican style chunk tomatoes; 1   1 1 2 lbs ground round; and I use cider vinegar (1 3 cup) instead of red wine vinegar.
