I've a difficult time drinking red raspberry leaf tea in the past. I wanted to try it again during my second pregnancy for uterine health. This time I steeped it in boiling water, added lots of honey, and poured it over ice. It's still not the best tasting tea variety, but this particular  and seems a bit more palletable than some others. As far as it's potency effectiveness, I suppose I won't know until the baby comes (although realistically I'm not sure I'll even know then).          This price is amazing, too. I kicked myself for paying twice as much at a local health food store. I will definitely be buying my next box here instead.
