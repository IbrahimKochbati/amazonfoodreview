When I was training for my half, I was worried about fueling and hydration during my runs.  I used these Sport Beans for fuel.  They are great even during the winter.  I took them every so often, so it not only helped with a steady stream of energy, I was able to distract myself from my long runs, especially since I don't like listening to music when I run anymore.
