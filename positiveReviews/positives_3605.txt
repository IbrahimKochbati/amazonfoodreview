I open a can of this stuff, and it looks like real food.  I spoon it onto the dishes for my four, and it dishes like actual meat and sauce.  All four of them dive right into it, and all four saucers are licked clean.          I have seen the health benefits to my cats from feeding them high quality grain free food.  This Turducken canned food is one of the staples of their diet.  I love feeding it to them, and they love eating it.          In my view, it's worth the extra money to get really good food for one's pets.
