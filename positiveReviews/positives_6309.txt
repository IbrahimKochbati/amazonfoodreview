This is the best salad dressing, delivered promptly and in quantities that will last a while.  No other Vidalia Onion dressing compares to that made by Oak Hill Farms.  Sometimes you can find it at Costco, but you can order it to your front door.  If they want even more orders, they can cut down their shipping costs.
