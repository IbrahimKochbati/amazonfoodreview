I ordered these cookies after purchasing some chocolate ones at a local grocer.  The natural ingredient list is what caught my attention. We have enough food products on the market that are over processed and contain so many artificial things that most people can't even pronounce. I ordered the Morning Glory variety in a trio pack  which also contained the Oatmeal Raisin and the Fruit and Nut varieties.  Since I had tried the chocolate cookie but was not aware of the other choices, I started combing the internet in an attempt to mass order these cookies.  After seeing the huge variety of cookies available directly from the product maker, I took a chance on looking at Amazon to compare prices.  Bingo, Amazon won, since the value of the cookies came to a couple of cents more than $1.00 per cookie, I had to place an order.  Everyone who has tasted these cookies have fallen in love with them.  I highly recommend them to anyone who is looking a wholesome, natural snack that you can feel good about eating or serving to guests.
