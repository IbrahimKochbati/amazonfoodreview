After reading all the dented can reviews, I was a little hesitant to order. But the price was much less than locally available canned pumpkin...so decided to give it a try. The cans arrived boxed tightly within a much larger box...packing care was evident and not a single can was dented. Have used this pumpkin to make the most awesome pumpkin pancakes. Just stir it into pancake mix and add a little water milk and microwave for a vitamin packed indulgent treat. After reading articles on the benefits of alpha carotene and beta carotene, this makes organic pumpkin a no  ainer...and totally delicious, too!! WINNER WINNER!!
