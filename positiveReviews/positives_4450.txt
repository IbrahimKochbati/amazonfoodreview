I got the beans in the prescribed amount of time, and even before I opened the package I knew they were going to be great.  The amazing aroma of the beans was evident and only intensified after I actually opened the packaging.  I bought them explicitly to make my own vanilla extract, and I have to say they are some juicy beans.  I highly recommend them.
