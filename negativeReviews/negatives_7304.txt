This product is really good pureed pumpkin, but I have a problem with the cans.  I took out one can from the outside of the case to make pumpkin  ead.  It is wonderful pumpkin...dark orange, tasty, full of pumpkin goodness.  However, a few days later I removed the rest of the cans from the case to put them in my cupboard.  From the middle row, right in the middle of the case, there was one can that was SO badly damaged, that I am afraid to use it for fear of me and my family getting sick from bacteria.  Now, please tell me how a can that is SO badly damaged, packed in the middle of a case, can go unnoticed by the person who is packing the case???  Or, are you that big a company that you have automation packing these cases, and it is just a strange coincidence that the only dented can ended up EXACTLY in the middle? I feel the can was placed there intentionally so that I would not notice, nor would Amazon (the shipper), no matter what side of the case it was viewed from.  Folks, we are not stupid, and we will get to that middle can eventually, so you are not hiding anything.  As the end user of this product, I feel that this can of pumpkin should have been caught at packaging and thrown in the trash...just as I have to do.  It's all about quality control.  This has raised the price per can by about .25 cents.  That means that instead of me paying $2.36 per can, I have now paid over $2.60 per can.  You have a great product, but I have a problem with a company who tries to pull the pumpkin over it's customer's eyes. Pumpkin is WAY to hard to come by right now and I was happy to have found your product on Amazon.  But, it has turned out to not be such a deal when I have to even throw away one can of pumpkin.  I give you a five star rating for your pureed pumpkin, but I deducted two stars for the wasted can.
