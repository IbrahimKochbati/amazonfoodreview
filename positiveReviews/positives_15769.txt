It's a cute idea to produce a cat food that is similar to people food, and Petite Cuisine seems to fill the nutrition needs of cats, if you can believe the label. However, the "in sauce" makes things a little messy, especially with the "Chicken Pot Pie" entree. There's so much sauce (aka gravy water whatever) that my cat would pull the pieces of food out onto the floor and slurp up the sauce afterward. There's just too much liquid in this cat food. The Sesame Chicken is a bit more solid.          Whatever the consistency, my cat gave this product high stars, if licking up every morsel and drop is any indication. And I have to admit it smells pretty darn good, not like a lot of cat foods. (Of course, funky smells have never bothered my cat    the more odorous the better, in her opinion). The daily serving size suggestions are a bit too generous:  1 2 cans per 2 1 2 pounds of body weight. That means 3 to 6 cans for an 8 pound cat, and if you've got a healthy 10 pounder, that means 4 to 8 cans a day? No way.          I don't think we'll be using this as a daily food, but rather as an occasional change of pace. It's certainly palatable, but the messiness is a negative. I say 3 stars, and my cat says 5, for a 4 star average...
