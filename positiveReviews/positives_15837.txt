I have been trying herbal tea mixtures in tea bags for years. Whenever I go into any ethnic market I always look for them. Overall this is the very best for taste and almost more importantly for reliability and predictability. Unlike green tea which will stay good in the little bags seemingly for years, a lot of herbal teas turn sour or dusty in no time. So if the merchant has had them on the shelf for a while what you are actually buying is flavorless dust. This mixture is always very fresh tasting and super delicious. I add it to green tea all the time. Recently when my  other in law visited us he tasted my green tea with this mixture and raved saying: "This is like a meal!" It is so rich and upfront with this mixture that it is really complex and so tasty. The herbs relax you a bit, which if mixed with green tea and its caffeine is sort of robbing Peter to pay Paul in terms of energy. I drink it in the morning all the time, and it has never made me sleepy. I recommend it on the basis of taste, I sort of doubt it would work to induce sleep. It has a generally balancing effect, and its absolutely gourmet mouth feel and taste makes it seem very refined, which is great combined with a lot of the cheaper green teas I buy.
