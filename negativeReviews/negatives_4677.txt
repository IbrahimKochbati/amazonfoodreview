I do have to say that the cat food is quite nutritious and appealed to my cat's sense of smell as well as my visual sense.  He also did not throw up this food, which is a rarity for my sensitive stomached cat.  On the downside, he didn't eat much of it, either.  I don't know what about it didn't interest him beyond a few bites, but most of it got left in his bowl.  My dog, on the other hand, loves it!  I give three stars because it's potentially interesting to other cats, but mine wouldn't eat more than a little bit of it.  I gave some to a friend, and her cats loved it.
