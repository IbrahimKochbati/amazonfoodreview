I was skeptical when I tried this, but boy what a delight.  The flavor is deep but not too heavy, and the carbonation is just right; it doesn't get in the way of enjoying the juice.  It actually has a good "mouth feel"   I drank it 15 minutes ago, and I can still feel a little hint of it.  It's like I had a thin slice of fresh kiwi and strawberry melting in my mouth.
