The ice cream arrived fresh and delicous.  The kids (and adults) loved it.  The little  icks of icecream were  oken in chunks, but no more than I've seen it even at the NASA gift shop.          Thanks for a great product at a reasonable price.  I hope it inspires these youngsters to continue to support space exploration.
