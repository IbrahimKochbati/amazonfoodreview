I love coconut and pineapple, but I was not wild about the ONE Coconut Water with a Splash of Pineapple. It wasn't BAD ... it had a mildly coconutty (though not sweet) flavor, but it just wasn't anything special. It was rather bland, and I had a hard time finishing it as it started to warm up. Since I'm not a competitive athlete and don't have any great need to replenish my electrolytes, I'd rather just drink water.
