Having this flake salt on my table isn't a big deal, but when I sprinkle it on my food, it's a burst of sea saltiness that I enjoy very much, and I know I'm also caring for my health, in one more small way. I'm the only one who uses it, so the two boxes last a long time, and I'm almost out, so I just ordered more. I have other sea salts for other uses. I just realized lately that this one makes an awesome salt to coat the rim of my margarita glass....also healthy, made with organic fruit juices and 100% agave tequila. Life is good :)
