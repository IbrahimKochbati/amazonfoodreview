I had to admit I was skeptical about how these cookies would taste; it seems that anything using non traditional baking supplies never really tastes right to me.  I can detect even the slightest variation, too, and therefore usually end up throwing out gluten free products.          Fortunately, this chocolate chunk cookie mix by Pamela's is as tasty as cookies made with white flour!  They have a good chocolate flavor and nice consistency; and are not grainy like I worried they might be.          You just add one egg and 8 tablespoons of softened butter; mix for about a minute, then scoop into little mounds on a cookie sheet, and bake.  True that the cookies do turn out a bit darker than chocolate chip cookies made with white processed flour, but these taste just as good.          Each package makes about one dozen cookies.  Fresh out of the oven   these are great!
