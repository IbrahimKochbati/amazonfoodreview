This product is so dry it can cut a Cat's mouth, cause bleeding and choking. The product I received from Petco was dry as a Bone. It could be compared to eating a Fish without debonning it first. You wouldn't feed your Family Fish Bones. My cats are my Family.          Maybe te product I received was no the usual quality, but it was dry, dry dry. Both the Salmon and Whiting were equally dry.
