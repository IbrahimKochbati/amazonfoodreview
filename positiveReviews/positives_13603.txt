Enjoying a cup of coffee is not a great option for me because I only enjoy it with a lot of high calorie creamer.  I have been buying the Gloria and Green Mountain original hot chocolates because they are only 1 WW (Weight Watcher) points.  However, they always tasted watery and were just something I drank out of necessity to fill the void of snacking.          Fast forward 50 pounds lighter and I purchased the Cafe Escapes Chai Latte and Dark Hot Chocolate at Bed Bath and Beyond (because it was all they carried and Amazon quit carrying the other  ands) and I have never been so surprised!  What a fantastic flavor!  The Latte is 2 WW points and the Dark hot chocolate is 1 WW point.  I can even use the highest water option and I still get a rich full taste.          If you are looking for an alternative to coffee, this will not disappoint!          The only way I could be happier this Holiday Season if Amazon started carrying this product with Prime shipping!
