I dislike most "diet" snacks    like baked  potato chips. But the barbecue pop chips taste as good or better than most non diet snacks. I did not care for the vinegar and salt & pepper varieties    and haven't tried the others yet    but the BBQ chips are great. I make sure I always have these in the house.
