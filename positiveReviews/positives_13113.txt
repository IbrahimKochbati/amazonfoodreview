As a stay at home mom of 3, two under the age of 4, I love coffee.  And as much as I drink, I prefer the organic coffee.  I was skeptical about this  and, hadn't seen it in stores, but I love it.  I do the subscribe and save option so it is even more of a great deal.  The price is what drew me in at first and I have not been disappointed.  Great coffee
