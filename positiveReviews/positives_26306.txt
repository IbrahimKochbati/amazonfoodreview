I got this product because the kernels in regular popcorn was constantly getting stuck in my teeth an gumbs, I thougt I would try the hulless popcorn. It is smaller in size when popped and taste really good. This product solved my problem. I still have popcorn because the bag is bigger than what I normally buy in stores. It was worth the money.
