I like the ANNIE CHUN'S VIETNAMESE PHO SOUP BOWL but it has a sour taste. I'm not sure what "Pho" should taste like but I've heard that it was really good Vietnamese soup.          The other "Annie Chun" noodle soups that I've tried were pretty good so I decided to try this one for variety.          They're easy to make, just add hot water and put in microwave, and the noodles are not dehydrated and dried like other "instant noodle" soups.          The soup  oth has a tangy flavor to it and it really smells good when you open the soup base package up. Try it cause they're great for a snack or lunch.
