I was a little skeptical when I bought this, but it has really been a great purchase.  The cocoa is DELICIOUS!  It's so easy to just make my daughter and I some cocoa quickly before sitting down to watch a movie.  I didn't have to add anything to it, but I did add a tiny bit of milk just to cool it down.  I would definitely recommend this product and purchase it again.
