I buy Pike's place from my local Starbuck's and have them grind it for my french press. I can tell whether it will be a good pound of coffee by how aromatic the freshly ground coffee is on the way home. If my car is filled with the smell of freshly ground coffee I'm happy. I have had two separate pounds that were complete duds, no smell and no flavor     very disappointing. Not sure how long a stretch between the the beans being roasted and packaged to being sold but at this price point I expect consistency.          Pike Place is a strong full flavored coffee that my husband and I love in the morning. I get up and look forward to making a fresh pot of Pike's, and I don't mind paying for it. Three stars because of the inconsistency. If it was the same every time I purchased Pike Place then I'd rate 5 stars without hesitation.
