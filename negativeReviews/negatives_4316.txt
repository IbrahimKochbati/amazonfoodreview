Contains triple filtered carbonated water, erythritol and stevia ,(not cane sugar,as stated on product description) jamaican ginger, south african ginger root and west indian pimental.It has a slightly strong  sweetened flavor (might be the erythritol)that could be offensive to some.It is a distinctive taste but not for all I suspect.Zevia is better in this flavor, imo,but i would rate this a good thirst  quenching diet ginger ale.Your move.
