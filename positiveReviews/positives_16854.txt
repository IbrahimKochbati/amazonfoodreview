I've got a dog who gets bored while I'm away and in a last ditch effort I thought I'd try this product to help her keep occupied during the day and I gotta say it did it. We've only been using the jug a couple days but it has made a world of difference. It seems to have taken her a while to figure it out, but I have completely switched her over to being fed from the jug while I'm gone and she's already a much happier pup.
