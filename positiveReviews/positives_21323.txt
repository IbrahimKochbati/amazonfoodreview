All 3 of our dogs love the various vitamin enriched "tasty pastes" available from Kong.  Although they loved to chew on their Kongs before, we found that they really got into it when we inserted some of the paste into the cavity.  All of them go "nuts" when we put down the "pasty Kongs" for them to enjoy   and enjoy them they do!          I would highly recommend all of Kong's "tasty pastes"   it's easy to use, doesn't seem to make any mess, and is a great extra treat for dogs.  Our 3 give it "2 paws up"!
