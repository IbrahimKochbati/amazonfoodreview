This coffee was satisfying.  I prepared it in a Kuerig machine using the one cup mesh filter and had no grounds seep through even though the grind was fine. I enjoyed my morning coffee and was surprised to find a pleasant after taste unlike the ones I usually experience that sending me running for mouthwash to eradicate "coffee  eath."  I attribute this smooth taste to the low acid content.  I usually drink a full bodied bold coffee but could switch to this for the benefit of the low acid.
