I have purchased many different flavors of the Coffee Masters ground coffee.  They are the best I have ever found.  Also discovered that they make a really awesome iced coffee on a hot day.  I just make a pot, let it cool and put it in the fridge.  Just throw some ice in a glass and add sugar and cream to taste.  Everyone has a favorite flavor and that is just a matter of personal preference.
