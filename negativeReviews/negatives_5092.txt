I bought this based on a friend's recommendation, but was disappointed.          Although I checked the sizing chart, the item seemed too big and heavy for my dog. I recommend going one size down from what they recommend.          Also   although my dog loves playing with her stuff a ball toy, she will barely go near this thing. So   the one doesn't necessarily imply like for this item.          I suspect this would work best for a dog with strong food motivation. My doesn't like it at all.          As a toy, it's not much fun, unless a dog really wants food badly and is willing to put a lot of work into it.
