I am always looking for durable, challenging, toys for my dog! I have been wanting to purchase this for a while but was unsure after reading reviews on it. Well, I am glad I got it! It took her a while to figure it out but it kept her occupied! It has been 48 hours and she is now chewing the rope off....not a big surprise. Dogs should be supervised with this toy.     I am giving this 4 stars because there were supposed to be instructions with it and there were none.
