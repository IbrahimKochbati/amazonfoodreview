I have worked with a couple different types of fondants, wilton, fonderific and satin ice. I must say, sorry wilton but you have terrible fondant. Terrible! Anyway, fonderific is great, its soft, stays soft, tasty, easy to work with. I always have a tub just incase I run out of my main fondant. If your looking for a starter fondant fonderific is great! Enjoy cakers!!
