My experience with this was a disaster. The first push on the applicator sent gobs of the bait all over the place.  Because of the size of the tube's opening, you cannot control the amount of bait you apply. With a slight pressure on the applicator nothing comes out; anything stronger and you have a mess.  I have no idea how the bait itself works  I had to clean it all up.
