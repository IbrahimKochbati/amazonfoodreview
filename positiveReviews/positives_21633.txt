Very good tea.  I'm not sure what others complaining about flavor were drinking, but myself and others I've given it to loved it.  I usually make a whole pitcher of it with about 4 bags.  Add a little bit of sugar and you are in business.  Most of my regular teas need 1 2 Cups of sugar in this same pitcher and this needs 1 2 cup or less.  It has a very nice fruity flavor that needs very little enhancement.          The plastic bags aren't that big of a deal either.  It is a thin mesh that doesn't amount to much and we put it with our plastic in the recycle can.
