This water is pretty good, but not great. At the time I got it, it was the most economical water that shipped free with Prime, so if they keep that up, it will be a great deal for a lot of people.          I might be tainted, because I was just up in Washington, where this water is from, and almost all of the bottled water I got up there, plus the tap water, was better than this. But, I love Washington water, so I'm probably judging it too harshly          It's not bad, and it does have a unique water taste, so I'm sure this will be someone's absolute favorite water. No one will hate this water.          Pros:     +This is good water     +Has a unique taste     +Everyone will like it, but not a lot of people will ask for more          Cons:      I expect more from Washington water than this
