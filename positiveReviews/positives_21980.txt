These drinks are delicious and very quenching!  I've only been drinking 2 a day for 2 days, but I swear it has helped my stomach and digestive tract.  My painful inflammation caused by A.S seems to be greatly reduced also, which is not normal for me.  I bought my drinks in a Calgary Macs store for around $2.85 a bottle including tax and deposit.  Could be a little cheaper, but I only say that because I want to drink it by the truckload, and can't afford that kind of a habit.  As for the small chunks of aloe in them, I personally think that is what makes the drink so good for you, and I really enjoy them.
