My dog absolutely loves these things.  And his smile has never looked better.  These treats are given to him one per day after dinner time and, without fail, our dog sits and stares at the cupboard where the Chews are stored every night   reminding us that it's time for his Chew.  We feel that these Chews are a bit pricey, but our dog insists that they are worth every penny.
