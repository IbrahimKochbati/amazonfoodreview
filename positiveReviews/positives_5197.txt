This was actually a surprisingly refreshing drink that is lighter then OJ and reminds me of a virgin Mimosa. There was little after taste and the flavor isn't overbearing like an orange soda. The best thing is its all natural with no corn syrup. The bad thing is that the size is a little small at only 8.3 oz, which is probably to keep the calorie count down. Overall, a good, refreshing pick me up, but you may want to drink more then one.
