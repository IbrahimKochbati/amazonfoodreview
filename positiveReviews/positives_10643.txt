These are a great go to snack meal when you're in a rush and don't want chips or hotdogs.          The nuggets are about the size of a stack of three quarters with some smaller ones the size of a couple of nickels.          The flavor is spicy with a nice tang.          The texture is softer than jerky but not as soft as say summer sausage.          Quick comment on quantity   there are three servings, 60 calories each, in the package.  This ends up being a little over a handful for the entire package.          Great to have on hand for those on the go times.
