I am still undecided if this is a sugar free option. I know it is mixed with real  own sugar and therefore it has the drawbacks for people who tries to stir clear away from sugar. As far as the taste it is just like  own sugar and it works very good in all baking endeavors, which was the principal reason for the purchase. It does have sugar but I have not been able to determine how and if is detrimental to those who prefer not to partake in using sugar. I mostly use ezsweet that has 0 everything but needed to use some kind of sugar so I bought this. Perhaps it deserves a higher rating and also there is the chance it might deserve 3 Stars instead of 4. Still, it is a better option than most items out there in the free world so that is why I allocated 4 Stars. Hope this helps and wish all who read this the most wonderful and invigorating holidays, starting with Thanksgiving all the way to the New Year. 4 Stars for Splenda Brown Sugar Blend 16 Ounce Packages (Pack of 4), which by the way it ended being in quantity much more than I had bargained for but what can you do? Unless in the future amazon would allow to split orders such as this with other deserving amazon customers. Imagine that!
