I know this is a weird review, but the fact that I noticed it enough to write about it means I'm not making it up. I just went through a Costco sized box of Tully's bold, and that was great. So I decided to try this box. The main thing I noticed is that I have to scrub the hell out of my mouth and tongue after drinking it, because the flavor really, really stays around. I never noticed having to do this with Tully's. It's a gross, smoky taste. It's like having smoker's  eath without smoking.          Can't wait to finish this box...
