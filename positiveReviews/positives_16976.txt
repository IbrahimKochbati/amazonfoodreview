My Bichon "Shiloh" really loves his Busy Buddy treat dispensing toy, he has had this toy for over a year now and still gets excited when I offer it to him. He's the kind of dog who when bored and or anxious tends to chew on his tail and paws, so this is a welcome distraction. I offer it about once a week. I used to leave his toys laying around in his dog bed or crate, but found that he loses interest so I tend to rotate offering 2 or 3 toys every few days. Any small treat works well, as long as it's not his usual dog food. I thought it was a little expensive, but it's durable, easy to instill the treats, and challenging enough to keep him busy for at least a half an hour, but not so hard that he loses interest. I'll try to attach a 45 second video of him playing with it.
