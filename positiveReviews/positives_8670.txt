Been looking for a treat for my rottie that she would like but would also help her reudce her out of control milkbone habit and be less caloric. These fit the bill well. My only complaint is that they sometimes arrive pretty  oken up into small pieces. However avoid purchasng from White Dog Bone (very slow and poor customer service). The provider seems to vary with Amazon.          UPDATE: Tip from my vet   frozen cauliflower   has the crunchiness of milkbones that dogs love and few calories. Surpisingly, my dog is quite satisfied, but then she been eating asparagus, carrots, and green beans for dinner with roasted chicken msot nights for several years. Likes strawberries and peaches too! SHe;'ll still get some milk bones and these Texas Hold Em's but if cauliflower can helpo her lose some weight we'll push that more (and its cheaper!)
