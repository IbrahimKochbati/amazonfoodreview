This product is great.  First off, the dogs love it, they get it the same time in the morning, and they go crazy when I take out the bag.  One of my dogs has very bad allergies, he can only eat certain foods, specifically lamb and rice, and not chemical fillers. The Happy Hips fit the bill, they are quite wholesome.  My dogs are getting a bit up in years also, and it is good for them to get a dose of glucosamine and condroitin.
