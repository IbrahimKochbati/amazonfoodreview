I searched high and low for Ortega's Chipotle seasoning after finding it  iefly, several years ago at the local grocery store.  Thank goodness for Amazon!     This seasoning mix is awesome with ground beef, chicken or my favorite, buffalo.  It's spicy enough for my husband, yet I like it too, even though I generally don't like hot food.  To me it has a very slight sweet taste and is like nothing I've found anywhere else. If there is any meat leftover after tacos, I'll make a taco salad for my lunch, which is just as good. Try it you'll like it!
