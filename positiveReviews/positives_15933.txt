I visited NY for the first time last summer, and after trying the Frozen Hot Chocolate at Serendipity, my boyfriend and I decided we could not live without it. We bought three packs of the mix to  ing back home to LA. After running out, we immediately purchased the 3 pack from Serendipity via Amazon. It shipped quickly and painlessly. They are just as delicious as we remembered them! I would recommend this mix to anyone with a sweet tooth or someone who is just plain missing the city.
