It's great tasting jerky, but if you're trying to avoid sweets, you might want to steer clear of this.  A one ounce serving has seven grams of sugar.  Seven grams is almost a quarter of an ounce.  So a quarter of this product's weight comes from sugar.  Not exactly what you'd expect from a dried beef snack, but not much different from several other  ands.  In fact, most popular  ands have 5 or more grams of sugar per ounce.  If you don't mind the sugar, go for it!
