I have 2 jack russells and a Papillon.  As many people know Jacks are an extemely active  eed and keeping weight on them can be a problem.  We were feeding Flint River, a very high quality food,  both of my jacks were getting 2 cups a day just to maintain a slightly below average weight. My papillon was at the proper weight but still getting 1.5 cups of flint river a day.  We decided to switch foods and after much debate we chose canidae.  During the time it took to slowly switch foods(14 days) my jacks had already gained weight and were looking much better.  After 3 weeks we had to reduce their food becuase they were getting fat!  now my jacks eat 1 2 a cup twice daily and they have never looked better.  My papillon eats 1 4 cup AM and 1 2 cup PM.  Just the reduction in food alone has saved so much money.  Because we are feeding less there is less poop to clean up.  I really cannot say enough about this food its has made my dogs more balanced mentally and physically.
