The shipment came in pretty quickly, the box is blue and  anded as pirates booty. Inside there are 12 4oz bags as you would expect. I love these and usually have to stop myself from eating a bag in 1 sitting. At the local grocery store in town these are $2.79 for the 4oz bag. Here I got these for under $24 with the 'subscribe and save' that you can cancel right after. So you can save 30% by ordering here which is great for pirates booty fans like me.
