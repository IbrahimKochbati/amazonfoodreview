This stuff is amazing. I order it for its low cal, rather than low carb, qualities.  You can have two bowlsful and still be under 400 calories.  And it's delicious  toothy when cooked al dente but with an egg noodle texture that works in all sorts of pastas.     We moved to a city where this is not regularly stocked in stores, and I'm so glad I found it on Amazon (with regular re ups every few months).  It's absolutely worth a try!
