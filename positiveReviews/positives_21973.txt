I love a good strong cup of morning coffee and this one comes as close to perfect as one can.  I usually set my machine to make a mug of coffee & the first cup I had of this  ew tasted just a little stronger that my usual one.  I then dropped the cup size down one notch, made a second cup and found what I was looking for.  Tried my usual coffees with the smaller cup & they did not compare to the rich aroma & fine taste that I'm now getting with Revv
