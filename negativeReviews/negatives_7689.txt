When I purchased this sauce to aid in my Atkins diet, it was shown CLEARLY to be a 6 pack.  The title said it, the photo had one of those little text bubbles on it that said "6 pack" and the shipping weight was listed at like 5 pounds or something.  TITLE AS LISTED: "Walden Farms Sauce Barbecue Thick Calorie Free, 12 Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)"          One (1) bottle arrived, so I called the shipper who said the listing was wrong, and not their fault.  They said Amazon writes the listing (Lies) and to contact them.     I called Amazon, they said no, they couldn't possibly be responsible for the misprint on the ad, as they sell millions oof products for tens of thousands of companies, and each company writes their own ads for their own products. (Truth) and that I should make every attempt to resolve the conflict with the seller.     After several more "going nowhere" calls with the supplier, they said the only way they would do anything is to submit it for resolution with Amazon, and I'd probably get my money partially refunded.          Amazon ended refunding all of my purchase price and shipping.          I can't wait to never buy from All Star Health , ever, ever again.  I hope my review inspires you to look elsewhere as well. Bad, poor, lousy, unpleasant, untruthful customer service.          By the way, the sauce is good, and I have since found it available in my local CUB Foods grocery store in their diabetic section.
