My 15 months baby girl has allergy to cow's milk proteins.          I can guarantee that this food is one of the few  ands that do not contain potential allergens. And also, contain a higher nutritional value to other foods sold in the market.     My baby prefers warm. For this I put a few minutes in hot water.          Amaranth Ratatuille y Chick chick are her favorites!
