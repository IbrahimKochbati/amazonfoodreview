The jury is in.  They voted as followed:          1. Nena (I love 'em!)     2. Grizzly (I love 'em!)     3. Samantha (I love 'em!)     4. Toya (I love 'em!)          They were unanimous in their opinion!  Newman's Own does it again with     their Organic doggy treats.          I'd like to think that Paul would be proud of the ongoing achievements'     of the company that bears his name!          I rate this product:  5 stars!
