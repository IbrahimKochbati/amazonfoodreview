I bought this for my lab   boarder collie, but my Husky really likes it.  I fill it with cat food kibble.  Show them they can get out the treat   don't let them get frustrated right away.  So far none of my dogs have destroyed it   very rare to have a durable dog toy in my house.  Good toy for dogs that need a challenge.
