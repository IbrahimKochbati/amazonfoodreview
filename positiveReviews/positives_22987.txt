After purchasing a very expensive local olive oil, I reconsidered, and Amazon's great offer of renewal, shipments whenever I need them, was fantastic. I'm pleased with receiving a liter plus at a time which I use for salads and cooking, and it is a treat, and I know that when I finish this liter, another will follow. Great price; great service.
