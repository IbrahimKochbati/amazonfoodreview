For those of you not familiar with the cherry ripe, the filling is a dried and slightly candied mince of cherries and coconut. This is coated with a thin outer layer of dark chocolate. They are extremely popular in Australia, where I live, and are in fact one of the classic candy bars we all grew up with. These things are delicious, so if they don't sell them where you are and you have a yen to try another culture's junk food, let me say cherry ripes are a pretty good choice.          Unusually, on a per gram basis I'm pretty sure this bag of "fun sized" bars offers better value than the only other way I can see of buying cherry ripes on amazon   the six pack of full sized bars. That works out at over $3.32 a bar. But hey, amazon's prices do fluctuate considerably over time, so it might be worth your while to check my figures. They may well be out of date by the time you're reading this.          Theo.
