These bars are very tasty. I've had the oat chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin walnut. I have to agree with other reviewers here that the bars are very light and not totally filling. These are great for a quick,light snack to tide you over until your main meal. The texture is oaty but very moist, and not over sugary.
