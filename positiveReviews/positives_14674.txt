My young neutered male cat suffered a sudden and complete urinary blockage two years ago from struvite crystal formation, and spent almost a week in the hospital with a catheter inserted and frequent bladder flushing. Painful and life threatening for the cat, and expensive and heart  eaking for me. He survived, and the vet put him on a prescription diet, but it was costly, hard to get, and worst of all the cat hated it. I tried the Pro Plan (with my vet's approval) and it's great! The cat loves it, and we have had no reoccurences of trouble (knock wood)! I also use the Pro Plan canned food for urinary tract health in conjunction with the dry food. Cat is healthy and happy. Highly recommended.
