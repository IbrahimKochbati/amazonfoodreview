I'm a pasta who ... well I love me some pasta and I'm starting weight watchers, tryin' to grab some not so easily perishable, easy to throw together snacks and meals. This had the best reviews and also the lowest amount of points per serving (3 pts+) and I was soooooo excited to try it. It definitely tastes like real noodles AND it's filling. Grab a bag of diced chicken and this pasta and you've got dinner or lunch for like 5 days. VERY happy with it. Very, very happy!
