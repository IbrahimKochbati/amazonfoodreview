I've been using these for almost a month now and just ordered some more.  I have two labs so I split one between the two of them every day.  They LOVE them.  Ok, they love any treat, but seem really excited by these.  One lab already has good teeth, the other does not.  Plaque covered the surface of all of her back teeth.  While the plaque is not 100% gone, it is greatly improved, probably about 75% of it has been removed.  I'm hopeful that with continued use, it will get even better.  Also, this product does not give my dogs intestinal "issues" as other rawhide treats have done in the past.  Only downside is that these chews are not consistently the same size or thickness.  Great product, I am hopeful to spread out dental cleanings more as they are pricey and require the dog to be put under.
