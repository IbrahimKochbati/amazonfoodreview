We were looking for a smooth, rich, non acidic, non bitter coffee when we came upon Amazon's reviews for Yuban coffee.  Well, we've been buying Yuban Original Roast Ground Coffee from Amazon for about a year now, and folks, what can we say, it's still the best tasting coffee around.  Coupled with our marvelous Bunn coffee maker (also an Amazon purchase) which makes a fresh, hot pot of coffee in 3 minutes, it just doesn't get any better than this.     Keep checking back weekly to see what the going price is (it fluctuates up and down quite a bit) and when you can catch it at a great deal, buy some.  You won't be disappointed.
