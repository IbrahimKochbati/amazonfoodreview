I expected more crunchy size nuggets. Cereal is a good source of protein and fiber. It's more flavor and texture than my earlier experience with this  and.     I have eaten it dry more as an evening snack. The packaging was in a strong carton     within a shipping carton. There is cereal dust in the cups so it likely settles from motion.
