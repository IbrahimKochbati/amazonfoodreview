My dogs play constabtly with plastic and rubber type treat toys. I have never has one  eak before. This bottle on a rope smashed in two places the first day I gave it to my dogs leaving jagged edges at the neck of the bottle and the bottom screw on lid. It was not made to withstand shaking and banging the toy on the ground which dogs generally do with toys on ropes.
