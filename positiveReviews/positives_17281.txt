Product was exactly as advertised.  It arrived in a timely manner in excellent condition.     The taste is spot on.  I put a few drops of the pure maple extract, along with a couple of drops of pure vanilla extract in my oatmeal (with 1 4 chopped walnuts) every morning.  It's a great way to start the day.
