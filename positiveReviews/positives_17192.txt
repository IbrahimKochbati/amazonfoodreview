These are the thin style pretzels that are truly "thin" which is what my family likes.  Many "thin" pretzels are very thick.  The best thing about these is they are organic and a  Newman's Own product, which makes me feel good about my kids eating them.  I send them in their lunches to school and they love them.  Healthy snack and good price on Amazon.
