I have purchased the Popcorn popper (that looks like those at the theatre but a little smaller) and the Great Northern Popcorn 8 ounce portion packs. This is a great deal. The popcorn taste great, everyone in our center loves it. The people in charge of popping love the all in one so they don't have to measure anything. We also order the popcorn sacks. The works great for our center when we have fun days. We purchased our order from Discount Tommy's the price for the popcorn and popcorn popper was great. We got a good deal. It arrived fast and we got to popping right away.
