I ordered this stuff in bulk, because the reviews looked so good, I had no doubt that it would be great.  Maybe I'm a little hard on it because I'm like a champion  ead maker.  I was almost destroyed when I figured out gluten was causing my psoriasis.  My  ead turned out mishapen and like a  ick.  Just super heavy, and like week old regular  ead.  Kinda crumbly.  It takes like an hour and a half to finish cooking on the inside.  I guess gluten free  ead is so bad, that this is the best we could come up with.  I must say it had a nicer aroma than the other  ead I tried, but I just am not impressed.  I'm going to bake another loaf, and pray that I did something wrong the first time.  I don't mean to be a "debbie downer", but if this is the very best out there, and I've heard that it is, I may just be giving up sandwiches all together!  I hope your  ead turns out better than mine.  Is there a way to repost a review if my next loaf turns out great?  Oh well... just don't be surprised if your first loaf is a disaster, because I'm a kitchen queen, and it was no good.  P.S.  I'm vegan and had to use an egg substitute.  Maybe the secret is in the eggs?
