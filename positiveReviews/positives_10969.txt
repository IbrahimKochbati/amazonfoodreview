They are not saltines, though I've heard Glutino makes those too, and they aren't Ritz crackers (a butter flavor GF cracker would be awesome, do they make those?), they are the best I've had. The texture is not your typical GF grainy, gritty texture, and they are far tastier than the rice crackers. My favorite way to eat them is with peanut butter but they also work great as a crouton alternative in salads, or covered with cream cheese and olives. These crackers do have a very mild sweet flavor but not enough for me to classify them as a cookie. Each box contains 2 sealed packages.
