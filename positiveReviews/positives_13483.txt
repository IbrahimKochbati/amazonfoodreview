With my Prime account, I took advantage of the free 2 day shipping!     I used these as party favors for my wedding reception a few weeks ago (Nov 2011).     I originally bought OTHER chocolate candies, but they turned out to be too big for my favor boxes. So I bought these last minute, and they arrived on time, and with enough time for me to put the favors together :)     The candies came out perfect. Nothing was melted, warped, opened, unpackaged, etc.     just Perfect!
