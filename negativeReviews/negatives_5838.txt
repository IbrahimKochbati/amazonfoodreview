I don't like the taste, which perhaps can be expected    I'm not a big coffee drinker.  However, my daughter, who likes coffee, didn't like it either and says she'd rather go without than drink it again.          My expectations were for a very chocolate raspberry flavored coffee drink.  What I got was a harsh coffee taste with a slight aroma of raspberry and maybe a hint of chocolate.  I didn't taste the raspberry or chocolate at all.
