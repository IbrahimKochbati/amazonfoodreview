I have two golden retrievers one is 10 mos old the other is 8 mos old.  Every now and then I need to actually get things done, and with two goldens its quite a challenge.  I like to give them their everlasting treat ball filled with the vanilla mint treat.  It keeps them quite and busy for about an hour.  The treats can be a little difficult to get into the ball and first, but the more you use it the easier it is.  It seems like the big box pet stores and also my local supermarket do not carry these in size large.  They only seems to stock small and mediums.  Very convenient ordering through Amazon.  If you need a little time, these work great to keep the pups occupied and they have nice  eath too!          Cheryl
