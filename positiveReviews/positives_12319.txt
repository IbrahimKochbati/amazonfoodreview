I'd enjoyed these dry roasted, lightly seasoned walnuts for a couple years when they suddenly became unavailable in any of my local markets (and still aren't, a year later).  Good old Amazon came to my rescue and now I'm able to buy them by the 6 pack case which is just the perfect number that I want to buy at one time.  These are wonderful for snacking on, or, of course, adding to recipes.
