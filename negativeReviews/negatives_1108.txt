We've been feeding this food to our wheaten terrier for a year, with happy results   until last Tuesday, when my latest subscribe and save bag was opened: my dog started throwing up during the night after eating from this new bag. On the first night, I figured she'd eaten something bad off the street. On the second night, I figured it was the lingering effects of eating something bad off the street. On the third night, I started looking for other causes for the nighttime retching, and I realized that the vomiting had started on the same day as we'd started the new bag. I stopped feeding the dog the Newman's Own and the vomiting stopped for 2 nights. Last night, I fed her the food again, and sure enough, she threw up in the night.          I trusted and liked this food   and all things under the Newman's Own  and   but i'll never buy their products again. They clearly have a dangerous quality control problem.
