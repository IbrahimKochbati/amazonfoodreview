My daughter will not eat fruits or veggies, very very pick eater, so I mix it with her regular chocolate milk. At least she is drinking all the good stuff that comes in this superfood mix.     Buying it for the second time. I would recommend.     Hard to mix so just mix one scoop with a tiny bit of whatever liquid you using, smooth it out, then pour the rest of the liquid.
