I bought those chips after reading good reviews but I was very disappointed with the taste. It was nothing like what I expected (granted that I expected good old kettle cooked potato chips). I bought the 6 flavor variety pack and there were many flavors I did not care for. It was worth trying them but I am not going to purchase them again in the future.
