You won't go wrong with this popcorn. It taste great and you have everything you need. If you like your popcorn a little on the salty side I would suggest also including some popcorn & nut salt. It's perfect on the popcorn and french fries. I'm on my second case of this popcorn and it's as good as my first case. A++
