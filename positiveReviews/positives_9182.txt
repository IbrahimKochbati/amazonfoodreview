When chatchi's favorite afternoon treat became mysteriously unavailable in the vending machine at work, chatchi panicked.  How would chatchi get through the work day without his Chuckles    the delicious, fat free candy that provides you with the sweet filled enjoyment you earn every day.          Fortunately, Amazon carries this delicious, chewy, fruity candy, and chatchi can get back to doing his job.          chatchi's only complaint about Chuckles is the black licorice flavor.  chatchi normally likes black licorice, but this flavor is so overpowering, chatchi needs to eat it last, so as not to ruin the remaining cherry, orange, lemon and lime flavors.          chatchi loves Chuckles.
