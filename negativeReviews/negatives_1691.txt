Looking at all the disposable reusable K Cup designs I think I will forgo purchasing any at this time and continue to use my tried and true *free* method.     *Free after the cost of an original K Cup.          After using your K Cup filled with coffee that you've purchased:          Take off the aluminum lid that seals the top.     Empty grounds into the trash or compost.     Rinse out the inside.  You will see there is already a filter inside.     Fill with your own coffee.     Place a small square of aluminum foil on top and be sure to make it tight and sealed around the top edges of the cup.          Now reuse your cup a few times or many, it's up to you as long as the filter holds up.  Just re do all the steps for each cup you make.
