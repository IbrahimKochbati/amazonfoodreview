I use this only for coffee. It works great    reasonably fast. It isn't cheap per cup, but since I'm the only person in the house who drinks coffee, it's a reasonable solution.          However, having used it for coffee a few times, I then tried one of the tea packets that came with it. It tasted like ... coffee.          I've tried cleaning the  ewing unit thoroughly    flakes of coffee end up in all sorts of nooks and crannies    and running plain water through it over and over. Didn't help; still a definite coffee taste to the tea.          I suspect that attacking it with an even deeper cleaning would help, but I can't see doing that every time I want to try it for tea    and I certainly wouldn't want to try it with the other packets available, like cider.          So, if you just want to use it for one type of drink, it's great.
