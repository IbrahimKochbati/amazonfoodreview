I have purchased this pumpkin from Amazon to help my cat lose weight and for baking.  The consistency is, well, for lack of better word, inconsistent.          Sometimes we received firm canned pumpkin like the kind I grew up baking with, and other times we received a runny, really messy sort I would call puree.  I contacted the company and they said something about having an extraordinarily wet season.  Never did figure out what that had to do with the processing of the pumpkin...          I do not know how other organic pumpkins fare or even if there is competition in the line of product.  Some cans were badly damaged in shipping which was a surprise and quite unfortunate.  Amazon's Customer Service was stellar as always and replaced what was damaged.          As far as the consistencies go, if I still have the photos I took of the runny stuff, I will post them.  It's quite different from the firmer canned pumpkin!  I would recommend this for buying a lot of (for cats and dogs when it's a really good price), but honestly I don't use this for baking anymore because I never really know what I'll get.
