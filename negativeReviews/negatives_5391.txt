This coffee is not horrible by any means, but if you're a coffee drinker who really savors the flavor, you might want to look elsewhere. My husband has heartburn and loves coffee so we really thought we'd found something special when we discovered this low acid coffee but the taste just did not do it for us. Think of it like diet soda, not as good as the real thing, and over time you could probably develop a taste for it, but just lacking that something special.          If you're not a picky coffee drinker, however, and just want something to wake you up without the acid, this might be a good alternative for you. I add a lot of flavored creamers to my coffee so it didn't seem as bad to me as it did to my husband, who drinks his coffee black. If you flavor your coffee a lot you probably won't mind the taste (or lack thereof) of this coffee as much.          Just things to consider before you buy. It's a great idea since coffee can really aggravate heartburn, but just not as good as the real thing. I guess you have to decide which is more important to you: coffee taste even if it means constantly popping Tums OR sweet relief from heartburn while still getting your so so morning java mojo?
