There is something about this protein bar that does not sit well with me. I think its the white chocolate. I know its not real white chocolate but it still doesn't appeal to me. I tried it on a whim while traveling and probably won't have it again. I'm more of a fan of the peanut butter variety. However my friend really enjoyed this one.
