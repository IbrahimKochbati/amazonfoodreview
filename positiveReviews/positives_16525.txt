I love this product!  My dog would not chew on toys or rawhide things and her teeth were getting  own in the back from just foods she ate without cleaning them. My vet told me about Greenies, so I went on a search online for the best prices. They are wonderful, she gets one a day, chews it so it actually is helping with her teeth cleaning. It's all natural and even her  eath smells better :)
