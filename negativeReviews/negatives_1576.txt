The can says it's 100% juice, but the taste is ...powdery.  If you've ever had a glass of Kool Aid or Crystal Light, you'll know what I mean.          So there's that 'from powder' taste; also there is an aftertaste.  And all comes in a can the size of a Red Bull for 160 calories.          I did not like it.
