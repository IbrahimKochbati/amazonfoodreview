Our Saint Bernard is 4 yrs. old and has always turned his nose up to rawhide or similar type chews.  Trying to  ush his teeth is always a challenge.  A woman at the vets office (who had the same issues with her dogs), told me her dogs really enjoy these HEXtra chews.  She was absolutely right, they're great.  Our Saint loves 'em!  Not only do they keep him busy for awhile, but they actually do help keep his teeth clean . . . without fighting to  ush them!  Whatever taste they have, it sure gets his attention.  An excellent product for maintaining your dogs oral hygiene.
