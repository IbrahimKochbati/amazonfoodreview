What am I missing?          This mix creates a pretty much tasteless pancake. I've tried adding vanilla and cinnamon. I use real maple syrup on top. I cook them in fresh bacon grease. The pancakes are still, just, blah. It's like they absorb and negate the flavors.          The pancakes cook ok. The texture is fine. Just absolutely no flavor.          Won't get this again. Considering pitching the rest of what I have.
