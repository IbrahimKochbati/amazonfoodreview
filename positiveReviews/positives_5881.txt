I started using goat milk when my daughter was 1 because she did not digest cow's milk that well. This product is great, has equal or more nutrition than cow's milk, has a good flavor, just slightly different than cow's milk,is easy to digest and best of all the powder form is great if you are on the go, I don't have to worry about it spoiling I just mix and give it to my daughter.
