I have a six quart whirley pop, and these packs say they make six quarts of popcorn   perfect, right? Not so much   I find that they make too much   by the time it's all popped, the popcorn is crushed a little bit because of how it's being compressed in the popper   if they offered a 4 or 5 quart version, I'd get that instead. Other than that, though   the popcorn tastes awesome, just like the movie theater.          Pro tip: at Sam's Club you can buy a big (2 pound) container of Act II buttery popcorn salt for less than $4. It's just like the popcorn salt that comes in these packs   I add a teaspoon to the popper anytime I pop corn without these packs, and it definitely helps. Adds a yellow color too.
