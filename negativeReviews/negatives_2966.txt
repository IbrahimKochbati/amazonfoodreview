It looks llike I just walked into a raw deal. The item is intolerably stale, and there is no recourse   I am simply stuck with it!     I love licorice, and have bought Gustaf's licorice on Amazon before, to much enjoyment. What I received here is a junky plastic bag unsuitable to preserve the product, containing product that clearly is too old and has not been kept under proper storage conditions.          Add to that, labeling is generic, and apparently this item contains wheat in substantial quantities, not what I know from my  and name Gustaf's licorice packages.  Those disclaimers on the item descriptions regarding ingredients may differ are utterly pointless and plain not ok. How does that do anything other than cover the vendor's rear? Clearly, customers get no choice, and might wind up with expensive purchases of allergy triggers.          Strike one   utterly stale     Strike two   not returnable     Strike three   no declaration of ingredients pre purchase, only offensive legal CYA          [Just about every packaged food or supplement I can purchase in a store falls under clear FDA guidelines for labeling, food safety (storage conditions, materials, expiration date)   those rules are growing on me!]          I am a strong buyer, and I shall refrain from any such purchases moving forward. Not only is it too risky and pricey if duped with degraded product, it is also an inexcusable trap    who wants to get stuck with waste and have their  money taken?!     Amazon is not what I'd remembered it to be!
