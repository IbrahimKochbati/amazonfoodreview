I love this spice mix because it's organic and makes such an easy meal. I don't follow the directions because of food sensitivities, but my way is awesome, too. I start steaming  occoli & or cauliflower with green beans and corn, then add one can of organic coconut milk midway through (to help cut the spiciness and add creaminess). I make quinoa in another pot to eat with it. Brown rice works, too, but quinoa works better for me. Anyway, it tastes great, and it's easy and quick to make, which makes it really convenient.
