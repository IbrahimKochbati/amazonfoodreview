This is the only flavor my cat will eat.  She goes     crazy over this flavor.  I think because it is easy     to eat instead of a big chunk.  This looks like little     square slices of beef.  It smells good too.  Whenever     I open a can of this, she comes running!  She's meowing     at me repeatedly if she sees the can in my hand, and I     imagine that she is saying "Hey, hurry up and open that     can! I know what you got there.  You can't fool me.     Gimme that yummy food!"  But of course, she's saying     that in cat language.  Because I love her, I can totally     understand what she's saying.  What cat lover doesn't?     We definitely have that connection with our cats, don't     we?  To her, Tender Slices is the ultimate gourmet meal.
