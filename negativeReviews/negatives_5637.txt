I thought these were going to be sliced sweet potato's, but they are not part of the ingredients. It's actually sweet potato flour. In addition, there is rice flour and corn flour mixed in. I think the taste of the corn flour overpowers the sweet potato flavor. Overall, the chips taste like salty corn flakes with a hint of sweet potato.  Overall, probably fairly healthy for what they are (low in fat), but short on taste. If you are not expecting a strong sweet potato flavor, then these may be a good choice for you.
