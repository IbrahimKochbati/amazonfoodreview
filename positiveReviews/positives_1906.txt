This drink is perfect for the summer. It is a healthy alternative to soda, and a great way to hydrate your body. I know this isn't the "healthiest" coconut water on the market (it does have cane sugar), but it's the best one for those who are new to coconut water, or just don't prefer something as natural as pure coconut water. My  other hates coconut water,but loves this stuff. This drink is not too sweet,and has the perfect balance of pureed pineapple and natural coconut water subtly mixed together. I like vita coco's fruit infused waters as well, but find that this drink is a lot smoother in texture, and slightly more refreshing on a hot summer day.
