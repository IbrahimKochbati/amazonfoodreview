I'm really enjoying this tea.  I've ordered several different flavors from this company and so far all have been great.  This is a very flavorful orange spice black tea.  The tea comes in a resealable "zip lock" type back, within a nice box.  The price is quite a bit less than what you'd pay in a  ick and mortar store and these folks ship very fast.
