This machine I took sometime, waiting, studying, and I finally purchased it! I am blown away at the taste. It makes perfect cups of coffee over and over again. I have tried several Kcups, and you can find the one thats right for you with so many options on the market. I will say this: When you first buy it, it will smell funny after you turn it on. The heating element takes a little time and gives off that smell. The book states to run one cup water through before using. I did it several times throught a couple hr period, and the smell went away. I wouldnt  ew until the smell was gone, after my friend said hers tasted funny in the first few cups. I did not!
