We recently adopted a new kitten. We rotate Felidae grain free canned formula with Wellness Turkey canned food. He loves both and eats well, he's never left a single whole pea behind. This is a very high quality cat food, using excellent all meat proteins. He is healthy, active,affectionate, and has a smooth glossy coat. Definitely worth the cost in the long run.          I believe it is worthwhile to rotate different (high quality) canned foods for variety and to not create a cat who will ONLY eat one  and. I think this is useful also in the event of a recall. I'm looking for a 3rd high quality  and to add to the rotation.
