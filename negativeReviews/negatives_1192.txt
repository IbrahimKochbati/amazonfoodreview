My cats aren't usually picky and I've had them on Natural Balance Venison grain free canned and dry food but one still has digestive problems (probably from ten years of eating "junk" kitty food) so I keep trying to find a food that will help to heal him. I tried Felidae and he and one other cat eats it, but the other two don't. I do believe one is extremely picky because he won't eat Halo  and either but loves the Natural Balance and Taste of the Wild grain free options. I hate having to buy so many different  ands to please my four cats! Also   this says 95% protein derived from fish   so maybe they are having a distaste for the fish? It's too bad because they do love tuna but it causes the sick one to vomit every time. Oh well, it's a another miss in our family.
