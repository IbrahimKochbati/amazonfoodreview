This is a good organic hollandaise sauce if you haven't had a non organic store bought or homeade version in a while.  It has a much more noticeable lemon taste than non organic store bought versions we've tried.  We had purchased a non organic store bought version and decided to purchase a case on Amazon, this was the only  and and I remember buying it at Whole Foods.  That's the only reason I noticed the difference in taste.
