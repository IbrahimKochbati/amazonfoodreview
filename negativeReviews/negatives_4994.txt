My dog loves the tug a jug. I've bought three of them and on all of them the bottom has split. The bottom edges and threads split and  eak off. My dog isn't particularly hard on the toy either, it's only used on the carpet and she doesn't swing it around into walls or furniture. She stands it up, knocks it over and drags it by the rope along the floor with her paws. I really want to recommend this product, but I can't afford to replace it every three to five uses.
