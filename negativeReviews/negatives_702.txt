I was expecting these cookies were going to be normal size but i was wrong!  i was planning on dipping them in chocolates but they r not those average size at all! So disappointed! I now have to go out n find the normal size cookies. What a  waste of money. I also needed 50 but 20 of them were  oken. They do not put fragile on the box outside.
