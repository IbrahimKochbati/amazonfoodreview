These are the best skinless boneless sardines that I've tried and they are very reasonably priced.  They remind me a little more of tuna fish than sardines, but in a mild, rather than bad, way and are very firm for water packed fish.  I especially like these mixed with salsa. They work out to $1.57 can or .36 oz if you choose the longer, but free, shipping.
