Single cup  ewers seem to be the wave of the home coffee making future. And nobody seems to do it better than Keurig. This machine is simple to operate, requires very little cleaning, and just  ews a very good cup of coffee. And with the plethora of K Cup options out there (teas, hot chocolates, etc.) your hot beverages options are next to limitless. This unit doesn't include any K cups, so just make sure to order some along with it, or look at the EkoBrew reusable K Cup as an option (see my other reviews).
