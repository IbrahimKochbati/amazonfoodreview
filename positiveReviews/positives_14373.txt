I purchased both the beef and chicken flavor Hip Action about a month ago and was very skeptical for a couple of reasons. First, my dog has not liked any other Glucosomine treats I've given him in the past. The pills were difficult to get in him as well. I was also skeptical I would see any difference. My dog is a 12 year old Husky Great Pyrenese mix and weighs about 100 pounds. He has extreme arthritis is all four legs and it is increasingly difficult for him to go up and down our stairs. After giving him 4 of these treats per day for a little over a month now, we are seeing a difference. I am so surprised! He seems to feel better and though the steps are still a challenge, he is getting up them in one try now instead of three of four tries. And, most importantly, he loves these treats! Thank you! Knowing our time left with this most important member of our family is getting shorter, I am so relieved I can make him a little more comfortable in the last stages of his life.
