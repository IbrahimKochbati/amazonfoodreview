At first, my cat Timmy was hesitant to try the unusual looking cat food I put before him  a cross between spam and chicken soup. But after he gave it a few sniffs, it was chowed down in minutes. Timmy quickly devoured what appeared to be a delicacy to him.          To me, it looked too healthy to appeal to a feline, with its obvious chunks of veggies and solid pieces of meat, nicely moistened by a  oth. The can is compact and easy to store and the portion size is just right for one cat's healthy appetite. Normally, a regular can of food like Friskies or Whiskas will only get half eaten, but there was no waste here. The food was polished off with a meticulous licked clean plate, evidence of Timmy's approval of this latest offering.          Petite Cuisine is not cheap, but it is on the lower end for the "gourmet" cat foods and you get quality ingredients.  Each 4 pack I received also came with coupons worth up to $2 in savings so that is an added bonus.          All in all, a good cat food worth it's cost.  Timmy has already put in a request to sample the fish flavors.  :)
