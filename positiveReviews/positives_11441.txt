First, I do have to say that this juice does NOT look like the picture: it's grayer and more translucent, even after shaking to redistribute the pulp. It won't make pretty mixed drinks. But it is   HANDS DOWN   the *best* tasting pineapple juice I have ever had. And the fact that it's organic and ALL juice, no concentrate or water hijinks, makes me even happier! I will be drinking this juice as long as they keep making it.
