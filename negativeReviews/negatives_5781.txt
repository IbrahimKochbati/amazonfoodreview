My boyfriend's cat has been eating this food for six years. When I switched my cat over to it, she developed a UTI and has been urinating all over the house. She also gained a ton of weight. Other reviews I have found online show that cat owners have had similar problems with their cats getting sick from eating this food. PLEASE use caution! This could make your cat ill. If your cat does eat this food, always keep an eye on him or her. I always thought male cats were more prone to UTIs and yet my female cat was sick. It cost me over $300 in vet bills from feeding her this food!
