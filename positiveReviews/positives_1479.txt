+Really really tasty     +Much healthier than almost every other potato chip     +A variety of flavors, consider this a huge sampler           Sea Salt & Vinegar is crazy sour. Personally, I think they overdid it on the vinegar.      It's hard to stop at one serving, but I take this as a sign of a good snack :P
