I make coconut water a part of my daily regimen, whether I've exercised or not. It gives my body a much better   and healthier   boost than caffeine, and gives me an overall feeling of well being. I recommend this to everyone, the only downside is one could go  oke drinking a liter box every day like I've been doing.
