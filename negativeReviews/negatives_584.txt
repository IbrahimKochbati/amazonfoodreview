This product is made in China.  I would not believe any claims they make regarding allergy safety and vegan kosher.  Considering Mrs. May's markets itself as a healthy product, I was shocked when I glanced at the back and noticed this product was made in China. China has proven that we can not trust their manufacturing practices. Unsafe toys, dog food, and now we're supposed to trust them making our health food?          Not to mention the carbon footprint created by shipping something halfway around the world. I will not buy this product anymore.
