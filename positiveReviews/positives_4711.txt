Try a little sprinkle on ice cream, makes a good milkshake, mix it in cakes or  ownies, sprinkle on the cake, enhance coffee drinks and liquors, get rid of that pesky cat, add texture to Barry and Levon's 240 pounds of pudding,  own paper mache, movie prop heroin, or dip your bananas in it.  I consume it with BlueBell Homemade Vanilla ice cream.  I like the double chocolate better.
