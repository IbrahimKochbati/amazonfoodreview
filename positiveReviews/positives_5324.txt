These fill your own K cups are great to have and use with a custom coffee that doesn't come in the K cup variety.  They are disposable and you can fill several and have them ready.  I also drink a herbal tea that I buy in bulk and now I can make it with my Kuerig.  Would definitely buy again to have on hand.
