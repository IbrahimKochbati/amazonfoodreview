I have suffered from acid reflux for about two years now and I am a daily coffee drinker.  This is not a good combination, especially on stressful days at work :)  I have tried decaf, and many different coffee  ands to see which will have the least negative impact with varying results.  This is the first time trying "low acid" coffee for me.          I normally buy whole bean coffee and grind it myself, this coffee was already ground and was not nearly as fresh as I would like, but the initial aroma was still good. I prepared it with a french press at home using purified water at 190 degrees.  I let it steep for four minutes and then tested the aroma again.  It reminded me of the typical store  and type coffees, not bad, but not as layered as I am used to.          I sampled it first as regular black coffee with nothing added.  It has the right flavor and character for a french roast, with a little bitter aftertaste that I felt was appropriate.  Then, I added half & half with the second cup which is how I usually drink it.  This being my preference, the flavor improved to just above average.  However, after two cups and an hour wait, I am not having any symptoms of heartburn or acid reflux that I would normally have which is a nice improvement.  In fact, I am surprised how little this has bothered me.          In summary, while this coffee being already ground was not a fresh as I am used to, it is much easier on my stomach than any other  and I have tried so far and the flavor is good enough that I would try it again.  Could this be a daily coffee for me? Probably not, unless there is a way to take the acid out before it is ground.  I would love to try a version of that.
