This is good stuff.  I have not reconstituted it and tried it as spreadable peanut butter and I doubt that I will, BUT I am mixing it with CLICK Espresso Protein Drink, Mocha and Vanilla Latte (14 Servings in 16 Ounce Canister) mix for a fabulous protein drink.  Even if you come across a fleck that has not dissolved in the mix instead of a burst of yuck on your tongue you get a burst of peanut butter!  Unless it was a burst of chocolate, I cannot think of how that could be better.  I've only tried the "plain" PB2, but have the cocoa PB2 on order.  I've gone from having nothing palatable in the way of protein powders to 2 wonderful products that I found on Amazon  PB2 and Click.  Check them out!!
