As always, fast delivery from Amazon. This is a very good tasting flavored decaf coffee. Dark and rich in looks and aroma. Good taste but rather "light" in the flavor which I suppose is what many desire.  I was expecting a bit stronger flavor after enjoying the aroma.  Unlike some flavored coffees I've tried, this provides a good tasting cup of coffee but does have a bit of an aftertaste in my opinion.          If you are looking for a coffee with a light flavor, you'll love this.
