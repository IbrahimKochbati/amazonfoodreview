I have been using this product in my protein drinks for over 4 years or more.  It is better tasting than any other I have tried.  I could make due with the giredelli baking chocolate but it's not the same.  This product has been harder & harder to find lately & I have to stock up when I find it.  I am unsure as to why it is more difficult to find except maybe it doesn't sell as well due to the price.  However, it is worth the price.
