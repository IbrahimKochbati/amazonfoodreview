I just went GF about three months ago and I am slowly researching different mixes to find what I like best.  This happened to be the first mix we picked up at Whole Foods, and my husband (who is not GF) loved them just as much as I did.  These  ownies were easy to mix and very tasty.  After trying other GF  ownie mixes, I found that this is one of the few mixes that actually comes out "fudgy" (which we both love)... while other mixes, like Bob's Red Mill, are more cake like.  I definitely recommend this mix!
