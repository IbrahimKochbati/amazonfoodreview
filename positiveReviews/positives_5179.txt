If you love orange soda but don't want to drink soda this is the perfect product for you.  This taste just like orange soda but is actually made of 100% real fruit juice.  no joke.  It really tastes good.  I loved it.          However just b c you don't have all the "fake" soda ingredients it still has tons of calories for 8.3 ounces 140 to be exact.  A can of soda has 150 for 12 ounces so I am not sure what the trade off is unles you want 100% of your vitamin C!
