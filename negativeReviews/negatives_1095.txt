I cringed a little after reading the ingredient list. Way too much grains and not enough quality protein for our dogs. Notice all of them are at the beginning, which means they make up quite a bit of the diet. Soy protein is included but some dogs don't do well with soy (mine) and meat should be the protein source in dog food, not grains.     Not recommended for your furry ones.
