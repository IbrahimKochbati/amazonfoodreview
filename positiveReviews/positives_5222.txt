Orange Tangerine Switch is a crisp carbonated citrus beverage. Unlike its sugar laden  ethren, Switch doesn't leave a sticky film in your mouth after you've finished drinking it, presumably because there isn't any sugar added to the drink. My only complaint is the price: at about $1 per can, you don't get a whole lot of bang for your buck, especially since you can get a 12 oz can of regular soda for a much lower price.  I guess that's the price you pay for something that's "better" for you.
