this review ended up a little long, for those who want something quick, if you have any taste buds remaining this will easily provide a satisfying burn. at least when directly applied to your own food. but also works very well when used as an additive.          the flavor starts a little smoky sweet and after 5 seconds it begins to creep in with the heat.          that covers my quick verdict, and how it satisfies the reasons I got it. now here is what was going to be my original review and some personal accounts.          I had read about various hot sauces for several weeks to find something I could be sure would satisfy. while well beyond the realm of a sauce, with a rating of 1.5 million scovilles, about 6 times hotter than an habanero and nearly twice that of the bhut jolokia, is as others have said hot enough to give anything a satisfying burn with a few drops.          my applications so far include on a ritz bits sandwich, on a  ownie, tacos, hot chocolate and my sleeping  other.          for those of you that have thoughts of pranking others with something like this, I would at least recommend great care in choosing victims. woke my  other within 5 seconds and had him chugging milk withing 10.          my personal favorite application is one drop on the ritz bits. I nice strong burn for about half an hour and the small endorphin rush that follows is a good pickmeup, but, by no means recommended, I'm abit of an idiot at times and have been told in other scenarios that I have no taste buds.          lastly, so far as I can figure one drop of this in 8 fluid ounces of liquid will raise it about 300 scovilles. so I assumed 4 drops in a cup of hot chocolate would give me about half a jalapeno. well, I could hardly taste the chocolate and my stomach threatened to chew it's way out alien style.          and I just reminded myself that I got some sauce on my finger nearly 5 hours ago because after all that time and various hand washings my eye still burned after scratching it.          sorry if that's a little long, but I wanted to add more input to this highly underrated product.          and very lastly. if indeed the dropper releases 50 microliters at a time (the best description of the measurement of a drop I could find) then there are well over a thousand drops in this bottle. though I'm not that great at math, so you don't have to take my word for the numbers I give here.          happy eating,       Daniel
