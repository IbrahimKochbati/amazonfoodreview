I received this package yesterday in a very sturdy box and last night I decided to try them and they are sooooooooooooo delicious.  The cheese doesn't get on your fingers or hand like the orange balls and they are fresh. The only problem is that you can't stop eating them.  They just melt in your mouth and they are crunchie.  You can be sure that when I am almost done with them, I will order them again.  I would give these twenty stars if I could plus working as a Court Stenographer in court, I am aware of identity theft and I know when I order something from Amazon, my identity and my card is safe.
