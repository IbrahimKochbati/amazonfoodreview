To quote from the Pure Fun website:            "Today the flavor we call Pepsin is a form of Wintergreen [ . . . ] Pure Fun Pepsin is derived from Wintergreen plant extract [ . . . ] with the old fashioned flavor we enjoyed in the 1950's and 60's."          Think of Wintergreen LifeSavers, and you'll know approximately what this candy tastes like (minus the chalky LifeSaver texture).  You may not like the taste, but the information about the dangers of real pepsin is not relevant to this candy.  The only reason I can imagine for Pure Fun to use the misleading name "Pepsin" would be if they are trying to associate the digestion aiding properties of pepsin enzyme with this wintergreen candy.  Looks like they made a mistake.
