This isn't powdered milk, but a whey based product and thus a milk substitute. Of the powdered milk products (or substitutes, I put them all in one group) on the market today, this is easily the best I have tried. The old Milkman powdered milk (with a touch of cream) was about as good, maybe a little better.
