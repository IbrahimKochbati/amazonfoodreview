Just want to note my initial impressions.  I usually use sugar at home only for beverages and cereal.  I was running low on the 'raw sugar' I bought a few months back, and was looking for some more, when I ran into this.  For the price, it was worth a try.          When I opened the package and caught the first sniff of the product, the first thought that came into my head was 'grape nuts'.  Odd, but that's what it made me think of.  The flavor is acceptable, no coconut that I could discern.  I agree that it doesn't seem quite as sweet as regular sugar.  It dissolves well in my coffee, but I haven't tried it on cereal yet.  I like the fact that it provides some nutritional value as well as sweetness.          So, my 5 rating is qualified only by the fact that it is less sweet than I am used to.  I'm going to try using the same amount as I would if I were using 'regular' sugar and see if it's something I can get used to.  I could stand to become a little less dependent on sweetness.
