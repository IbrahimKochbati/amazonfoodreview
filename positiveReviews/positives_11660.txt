Calbee has so many delicious flavors, I wish I could buy them in the states. This one tastes good, it's paprika if you were curious, if you're german yes it's basically the same thing they sell back in Deutschland. As for me, I like this snack a lot but I would l really like to taste more of their 'eccentric' flavors from Calbee which left me drooling in appreciation, like this plum and pork flavor (watashiwa nihongoga wakarenai) I'm guessing at what the flavor was from the drawing but it's very delicious  sort of sweet with a hint of meat flavor. Motto!          Definitely recommend in any case, this paprika bag of chips is pretty conservative for anyones palette and most likely won't offend anyone but rather addict people.
