We only like WHITE popcorn, and the only grocery store option where we live is Jolly Time, which is not bad.  For fun, we started ordering various white popcorns online, and THIS is BY FAR the VERY BEST white popcorn!!  Wish it were a little less expensive, but we've decided that it really is THAT much better than others.  We are now Snappy white popcorn snobs!  :)
