A quick recommendation, get the .5 ounce bottle, or smaller. And if you keep one in your pocket or purse or bag, make sure you swap it with the one on your counter that you use for the morning coffee. What happens is that the liquid dries up and begins to clog the opening. Not right away, but after several months of being opened. And once it's clogged up the single drop either gets smaller or larger. The issue is that you want one perfect drop! No more, no less. One drop is VERY powerful. If you get half a drop, don't try adding more. Open a packet of Splenda and add a tiny bit. You can easily get coffee so sweet you'll have to throw it out.          There are a lot of reviews on this product criticizing it for drying up and problems such as I've just mentioned. Consequently, the smaller the bottle the better. The faster you go through it and open a new one the less problems you'll have.          After a week or so of using EZ Sweetz you'll be hooked.          I'm an Amazon faithful, but I have to share this with you: Amazon charges $4.81 shipping for a six pack. If you go to the EZ Sweetz website and order there it's $.99 to mail it to you.
