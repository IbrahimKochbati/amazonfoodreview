I have been on a low carb diet and this  ead has made the diference in the world to me, I firts found it in the wal mart in griffin georgia but now they dont have it anymore, the only thing I wish for is to find it locally sold more, if there is anything I can do to help promote this  ead someone please contact me, I have told all my Latino friends about it that want to eat healthy and I know there is aneed for it out here but for right now I will order it on line.
