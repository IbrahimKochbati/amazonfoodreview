When I was a kid, Shake and Bake Chicken used to be one of my favorite "treat" meals.  Now with kids of my own, I decided to make Shake and Bake for my kids to try too.  The response was as good as I remember that I had   it's crispy and delicious!  Shake and Bake is really easy to make: simply put the Shake and Bake in a plastic bag, wet your chicken a little and toss in and SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE!  Bake it for about 45 minutes at 400 degrees and you'll end up with some crispy "almost like fried" chicken.  The flavor isn't too salty, and leans more on the mild side.  If you like it a little spicier, rub on a little tabasco before coating the chicken.          This version of Shake and Bake doesn't come with the shaker bag included.  You will need to either 1) have a ziploc bag to put the chicken in, or you can just put the S&B in a pie dish (or other shallow dish) and coat it that way.  We don't like using too many bags, so we just used a large bowl and tossed the chicken around until coated.          For people who are having problems with getting soggy bottoms on your chicken, an easy way to keep that from happening is to crumple up the foil and put the chicken on top.  This creates some air pockets under the chicken so that less of it is sitting on the foil.  If you're using chicken wings, you won't even have to crumple the foil because most of the chicken is off the pan.  You can also use a wire rack to make the whole chicken crispy.  Each pack can coat about 6 pieces (we did 2 each of wings, thighs, and drumsticks and had a little left over in the bowl).
