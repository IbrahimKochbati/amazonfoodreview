All by itself, I would have to give this a 3.  But, as I've learned with most packaged food, it can be easily made into a 5.  I prepare as described on the box and top with mixed Italian herbs, crushed red pepper, and a pinch of shredded Parmesan.  Not only does it look more appetizing, but it tastes great!  And these are things I usually keep around the house, so I just grabbed whatever I had and it only adds about 30 seconds to the prep process.  I highly recommend if you're willing to add things you like to flavor it up.
