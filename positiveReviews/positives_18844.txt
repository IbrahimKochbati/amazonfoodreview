I have a very picky puppy that would often rather starve himself, than to eat something he doesn't like. Because of that, he was becoming underweight and I decided to switch him away from dry kibble to have him gain some weight first before worrying bout his picky taste.     However when I give him ziwipeak, he would finish it up right away!          This  and is expensive, but based upon the amounts you feed, it isn't really that much expensive if you have a small dog. I have a 2 pound puppy that is expected to mature at about 4 5 pounds, and the costs is about 25cents extra a day. If you have a big dog that's gonna gobble up 1 3 of a bag or more a day, then that will be a lot more expensive for you.          But......     The quality of food and the fact that it is in a jerky meat form makes it a lot better than eating hard dry kibble all day long.     Anyone would be bored of eating biscuits everyday for his entire life :           The quality of this food is unsurpassed.     There have been no problems at all with this food at all as well either. No recalls, all made in New Zealand as well.          Something that I tell a lot of people.     Spend more on food daily, and not risk the possibility of having a sick dog due to some pet food recall. Vet bills are going to cost you a few thousand dollars.     Expensive dog food will probably add up to the same cost as most over the duration of your dog's life, unless you have a really big dog.     So instead of having to go through the grief of having a puppy in pain, and you undergoing mental and emotional stress, why not just give it a food that is good and safe and something that the dog enjoys, and spare yourself from all that unnecessary trouble?          Yes times are hard and most people are having difficulty putting dinner on the table for themselves or their kids. So there are situations where foods like this are just too much to afford.     So unless if your budget really is a problem, I would recommend this food to anyone!
