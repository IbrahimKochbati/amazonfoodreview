Love this oil. Use for everything from cooking to cosmetic use. Makes a great (out of the sun) moisturizer for my face and a wonderful hair treatment oil. But I just found a website that sells in larger quantities for a better price. Example: They charge $24.15 for a gallon and $11.65 for shipping. That's less that $40.00. Where here you pay for more. Don't know if I can put up the site.....but it is located in Tucson AZ and search for avocado oil bio genesis. Please let them know if you are buying for cooking or cosmetic use. I buy cooking and use for both.
