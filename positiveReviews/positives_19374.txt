Perhaps it's because we haven't had "regular" mac n cheese for a long time, but this product didn't taste any wheatier or different to me than good ol' Mac n cheese. Our whole family gobbles it up (11, 7, 2 and my husband & myself) and I love that it has a good amount of fiber. Never had issues with it falling apart as the other reviewer mentioned, but you do have to be careful with all mac n cheese pastas as they are so small, they do over ook very quickly.
