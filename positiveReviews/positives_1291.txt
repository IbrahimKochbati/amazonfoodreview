I bought the 6 flavor variety pack.  They are pretty good... nice thing is that I'm not 100% sure if I'm crazy about the texture so by the end of an 0.8 oz bag I don't really want anymore.  However in my quest for different snack foods I found the "Food Should Taste Good" line of cracker chips.  My money will be spent on those rather than pop chips.  However I think that people should give these a try as well.
