I've been buying Big Train Vanilla Chai since 2002 2003ish, and it is by far my favorite chai that I have found. The taste and texture is smooth, and flavorful... I tend to like my chai rich, so I mix it with milk instead of water. I also like to add BT to my coffee (with a touch of milk) when I'm in the mood for sweet pick me up :) My husband likes to mix Big Train Vanilla Chai mix in his Tazo Chai tea for a little extra spice once in a while, but he does like BT all on it's own. It's always a big hit with company too. :)
