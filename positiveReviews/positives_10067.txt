I am not a coffee connoisseur by any means. I only know what I like and what my family likes to drink.  Gourmet coffees to me taste pretty much the same as a good ole can of generic coffee.  Until I tried the Melitta Cafe Collection Classique Supreme Ground Coffee.  First off I noticed that the flavor was not too strong.  I am not a fan of coffee that tastes like sludge and lean towards the medium to light roasts most of the time.  Secondly, it smells great  ewing.  I know I am having a good coffee day when I can smell it.  The taste is delicate but flavorful.  I tried it black, black with equal, and then black with equal and powdered creamer (my favorite flavoring) and each time, the coffee was enjoyable.          I would definitely buy this coffee again.  It comes in a pack of three for only eighteen dollars which is comparable to other  ands of coffee that taste ten times worse.  The only negative thing I can say is that the bag is 11 ounces and not a full pound.          In fact, I think I'll got make a pot now!          Natalie S.
