My dog has still not figured out what to do with this.  He is a very smart dog with a vocab of about 50 words.  I was surprised how hard the plastic is and am also worried.  Once he does figure out how it works I am afraid he will knock himself out when he shakes it from side to side! Let alone what will happen if it flies out of his mouth!
