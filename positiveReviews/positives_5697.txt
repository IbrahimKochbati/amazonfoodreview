Grandpa Po's is the best snack ever!  Driving around in LA, I so often find myself stuck in traffic just when my blood sugar starts to drop.  Add the stress of being late to my next appointment and I'm a basket case!  Grandpa Po's is the perfect snack to take on the road.  Not too salty or sweet, they  satisfy that need to nosh without feeling gross. I even feel fortified!  Plus they come in this nifty zip lock bag that keeps them fresh even if I leave them in my car for a couple of days.  I never want to be caught in traffic without them!
