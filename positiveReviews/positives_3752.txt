Hazelnut coffee is my favorite and our local stores don't carry it, as we live in a very small town.  The flavor and taste of this coffee is wonderful.  I  start every day with it and often have an afternoon treat of a cup of the coffee.  I will buy again and highly recommend. Arived far earlier than I anticipated.
