I ordered the 16oz Cowboy Strips Original, the product arrived promptly, and this is some of the best jerky I've had. Reminds me of a  and (long forgotten) I loved as a kid (1960's).     This Jerky is not too sweet and with a hard texture like Jack Links, Oberto, and the store  ands. Nice salty taste, thicker strips, tender (for Jerky) texture. The one pound size is a great value too.          I ordered two more pounds of Cowboy Strips, Pepper and Original right away.          I hope you plan to continue to offer the 16oz bags. I will definately be a loyal customer.          Thanks for a great product!
