I'm hesitant to give this too good of a review, because I don't want the whole world buying it and then the price goes up.  BUT, this jerky is truly the best.  I've found that all the Wild Ride Jerky is fresh and easy to chew...it is very tender.  Hickory is by far the best Wild Ride flavor and I would eat it over Jack Links everyday!  Don't listen to the idiots giving this bad reviews, saying that it was stale or moldy.  This is what happens when you leave any kind of jerky out for 2+ weeks people!  Any way, just thought I'd chime in with an honest review.  Hope you dig this jerky (and price) as much as I do!
