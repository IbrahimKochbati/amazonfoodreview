This snack is scrumptious beyond words!!! But it deserves words,so here I am reviewing it. All the different flavors of Snyder's of Hanover Pretzel Bits are good, but this one, the Honey Mustard and Onion flavor is my favorite  and it's one that you should definitely try at least once in your life if you haven't before.          These pretzel bits are, after probably healthier than potato chips  the only remotely negative about it, is that they're so tasty it's hard to stop eating them! I find it's good to divide the 10 oz. snack into zip loc bags  otherwise, the whole bag might as well be one serving.          Make sure you try out these pretzel bits!!
