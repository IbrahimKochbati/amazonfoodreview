Beware   This product may contain sharp pieces of husk that can get lodged in your mouth or throat . I've been buying this granola on a subscribe and save basis and love the taste . Unfortunately , on several occasions I've gotten sharp bits of husk slivers imbedded in my mouth . One particularly large piece that was shaped like an arrowhead lodged deep into the back of my tongue causing me intense discomfort and uncontrollable gagging until it was removed . I've been going through the remaining product by hand and have found them in almost every package . When they say Au Natural , they mean it .
