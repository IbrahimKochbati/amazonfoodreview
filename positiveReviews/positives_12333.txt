I'd just like to say that this seems to be a great  and of dog food. I've been doing some research on which  and to stick with and so far this is it. After finding  ands I like and then having such a difficult time getting them in the stores, I knew it was time to do more checking around. My 1 yr old dog loves Blue Buffalo! I encourage everyone to research what their pets are eating.
