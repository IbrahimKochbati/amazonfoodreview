This popcorn tastes fantastic. I just bought this popcorn and an air popper and I'm never going back to microwave bags again.          Just a warning to you all though ... I bought 6 oz packs to get more bang for my buck but man 6 oz of popcorn makes A LOT.  Between me and my roommate we were stuffed.  If you want to have movie night with your family though, this is a great size.
