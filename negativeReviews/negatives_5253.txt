This is my first review ever....I've been a Pho lover for years.....grant it I didn't expect this to be perfect....actually its so horrible I gagged...I wasn't sure if i was smelling the  oth or the plastic from the container. I didn't even smell the star anise was non existent. Please, do yourself a favor and save your money do not purchase this product. Again, I did not expect this product to be great....I am not a picky person, but this stuff right here is just plain nasty. The only GOOD I can say is the noodles were of nice consistency.  I would really hate for someone to waste their money to buy this product. Now I have 5 containers I wouldn't even want to give away....
