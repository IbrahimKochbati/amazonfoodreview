I don't write too many reviews, but I read them all the time...so I though it was high time I wrote a review for this product (my dog told me to).  I have a Maltichon and she loves her mid day treat.  Her  eath was horrible, so I thought this might freshen it up a bit.  First of all, so goes BONKERS when I take this Greenie treat out.  The smell is so so...and her  eath is at least 1 2 better than is was before.  The greenies are not hard   you can bend them.  Not that the dog notices, but they are in the cute shape of a tooth ush.  She (the dog) runs around the house and hides the treat, then finally gives in and gobbles it up.  She then sniffs all over the place   hoping there is a crumb left behind.  There must be some doggie drug in those things, that's how much she loves them.  So   long story short   your dog would be crazy to NOT love these treats!  Worth the price   and they come in a nice container with a plastic lid that you just pop off to take a treat out.
