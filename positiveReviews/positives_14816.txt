As I'm not much of a tea drinker, so I gave this to my wife (who is from Japan) to try out before I tried it myself.          In Japan, tea is a big deal.  The tea (the leaves as well as the tea itself) has to look good, smell good, and overall present itself as something of great refinement.  No Japanese would offer another person tea that was less than wonderful, except maybe at the office.          If the eyes are the window to the soul for Americans, the tea a person serves is the window to the soul of Japanese people.          So my real expectation was that my wife would open up the canister, maybe try some herself once, and it just wouldn't pass enough to serve to anyone else.  Wow, was I wrong.          She opened it up with her friend, who is also from Japan, with the disclaimer that I got it from Amazon.  Clever Japanese strategy.  If it was coffee, I'd be offended as coffee is my thing, but tea is alright.          They loved it right away.  They said, "Come here.  Smell this.  It's a wonderful aroma."  They added a few obligatory potential criticisms like, "This isn't from Japan I suppose."  And then they drank it.          You have to understand, these two ladies drink nothing but the best.  It has to be great or they wont serve it.          My wife has served me this tea every day since.  It's that good.
