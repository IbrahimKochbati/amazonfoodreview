We have two small dogs with two small mouths, so when I opened up the bag of Newman's Own Organics New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats Lamb and Barley Recipe I was taken aback by the size of these biscuit treats. The one inch square  icks are joined together in pairs   pairs than can be separated by hand at the indentation in the middle. Trying to make furthur manual divisions is fruitless unless one is a pro wrestler or football player. The treats are also too big, I thought, for our two dogs. Now what?          Using the serrated edge of a metal ice cream scoop I was able to  eak the biscuits into manageable pieces. After some intial sniffing and backing away Gabby and Piper took their first tastes and seemed to like the new treat. On subsequent days they've taken to them more and more eagerly. Just to see what would happen, I gave a whole biscuit to Gabby the Bolognese. She coccooned in her doggy bed and ate the whole treat leaving a few crumbs behind but not as many as expected. The next couple days I gave her whole biscuits again. These biscuits were carried about the house all day and hidden in secret places like on the middle of our bed, on the sofa, and on  the stairs leading to the upper level. She hasn't tried to bite into a whole biscuit after the first and only time.          Piper the shih tzu just can't handle these biscuits because of their size and hardness. As long as she seems to enjoy eating them, I don't mind using the ice cream scoop to  eak the Newman treats for her.          I like the recipe ingredients used to make the lamb and barley treats and the absence of fillers and artificial chemicals used in many supermarket treats. The organic aura is also a plus.          Based on our experience I think these wholesome treats are best for larger dogs who have the teeth and jaw power to tackle and enjoy such hard biscuits. The Neman's Own line of dog products is excellent, but for our pooches something smaller would serve our needs better.
