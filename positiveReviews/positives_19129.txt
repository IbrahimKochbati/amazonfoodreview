I've been trying to duplicate Baskin Robbins Capuccino Blasts for years. So I have come close using this Keurig coffee cup, then add a little artificial sweetener, a tablespoon of Hills others English toffee mix and a little heavy whipping cream. Once the coffee is  ewed I mixe everything together and let it cool off and then stick the freezer safe glass in the freezer for an hour or so until the mixture is almost frozen. Then add some crushed ice and have a delicious cold drink. I am not fond of hot coffee, but love this refreshing drink when I need a pick me up.
