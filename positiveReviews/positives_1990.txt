If you like nuts and you're looking for a healthy, great tasting snack, you can't go wrong with Almond Crunch!  My husband and I recently eliminated high fructose corn syrup and partially hydrogenated soybean oil from our diet and we feel so much better.  Trying to find tasty snacks that don't contain these products is not easy so we were thrilled to find Mrs. Mays Naturals.  We love the Cashew Crunch as well!
