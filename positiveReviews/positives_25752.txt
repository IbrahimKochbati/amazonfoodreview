I haven't purchased this item here, I get it at my local grocery, however, I love the stuff.  I do not use it as BBQ sauce though.  I agree with some of the comments stating that it is a bit thin, and not really BBQ flavored.  However, I do use this more as a condiment, instead of catchup or 57 sauce   for THAT purpose, with zero cal,carbs, etc...it is an awesome product! :D I also really enjoy the flavor.  But taste is completely individual.  It is def. worth a try if you are watching carbs or looking for easy places to cut a few calories from your diet. :)
