I go through stages where i seek out different alternatives to regular mass market products and look instead for artisinal or just somewhat unorthodox alternatives.  sometimes it works out and other times i end up with a cabinet full of stuff that noone in the house will touch.          this time it worked great.          this mix is an excellent change from the standard big  and pancake mixes (haven't used it for waffles).  the flapjacks have an excellent consistency and taste great.  i've actually noticed the whole family uses less syrup with this mix than our old stand by which produced pancakes that weren't much more than syrup delivery vehicles.  the cakes are moist and delicious.
