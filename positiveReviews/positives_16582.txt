My two little Italian Greyhounds love Greenies. I did buy the wrong size Greenies this time. I usually buy the teenie Greenies with 96 in the package for aprox the same price, but I must have hit the wrong size product. Not too big a deal, I just  eak them in 1 2.     The product arrived very quickly and I will be certain to order again in the future....thought I will be sure to order the correct size next time!
