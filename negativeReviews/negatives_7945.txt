I'm using this with the Presto Flip Belgian waffle maker. This is my second mix after Carbon's Golden Malted Flour. The latter requires more prep time and is more bland, but turns out with a perfect fluffy consistency on the inside with a light crust on the outside. I like the blandness too since it gives a blank slate to work with when adding nuts, blueberries, bananas, etc. I wanted to try this Heartland Mix for mornings when we have less time to work with, and because I love chocolate (who doesn't?!).          I really liked the smooth texture that the waffles turned out with. They looked more professional than the Carbon mix which had a slightly mottled surface. The taste was pretty good too. But the waffles themselves were very rubbery and you had to work harder to chew them. I did let the mix rest for 20 minutes so I doubt that's the issue. Maybe I got a bad mix? Maybe I needed to wait a little longer? I'm not sure. I will revise this rating if I find out I missed something. As it is, the consistency is not going to work for us.          I found that I could salvage the mix by adding 1 part to every 3 parts of Carbon's.
