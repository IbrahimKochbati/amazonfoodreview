I don't want to say these are awful but I won't ever get them again. The praise in other reviews, especially for the hickory strips, convinced me to try them. I now suspect the praise was "planted" by vested interests.          The weaknesses of the product are legion. First, it's so hard to get the package open I had to get out the scissors; thinking you could get it open while hiking is delusional. You'll have to stop along the trail and get out a tool. I recommend a hatchet.          Finally opened, the first realization is that slugs are less slimy. This in no way resembles a jerky if that's what you were hoping for. It's more like a piece of fruit leather that got left in the bathtub over night. Or just a mashed slug.          Then there's the taste.  It basically tastes like sugar. Very unhealthy treat for diabetics certainly; you'll need an electron microscope to read the molecular fine print, but basically it provides a heavy load of cane sugar.          At best this is like slimy candy, not jerky at all, not even close. For a vegetarian jerky product that is both tasty and relatively healthy and won't leave your fingers covered in pancake syrup, I recommend Stonewall's Jerqee.
