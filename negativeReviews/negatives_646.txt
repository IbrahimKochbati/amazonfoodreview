I've had better canned clam chowder.  Bookbinders is one that comes to mind.  I don't buy the ones with preservatives or a long list of ingredients, so my choice is limited.  For this one, if I add just half a can of milk and a pat of butter, along with some extra sea salt, it's ok.  The longer it is gently heated    not simmered or boiled    to let the flavors mingle, the better it becomes.  More clams and potatoes would improve it.  As it is, the ingredients were skimpy.
