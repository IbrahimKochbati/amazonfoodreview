When I bought my Keurig Brewer, I was so impressed at how it worked.  The different types of coffee and how it  ewed.     HOWEVER   I did not realize how expensive the coffee K cups would be.  I couldn't spend 80.00 dollars a month on coffee!!          Then I found DISPOSAKUPS   What a great idea and they are so easy to use. The very best part about them is that fact that they can be thrown away   No having to wash the insert that Keurig provides.          These cups do not leak.  They work perfectly!  I will be ordering more.
