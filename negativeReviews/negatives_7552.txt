I purchased based on reviews here and elsewhere about all the wonderful things these chews accomplished on dogs teeth and the price per unit was so much less than the "Greenies" I have been using. Upon receipt I immediately noticed that these are just large rawhide strips with a coating on them. They are not even particularly thick rawhide. Rawhide in any form is very dangerous and you must monitor your dog very closely when they are chewing on these. My Great Dane is not a "swallow whole" kind of eater   he tries to chew up even the tiniest training treats before swallowing them, BUT with rawhide strips like these he will chew on the whole piece until it eventually becomes soft, then swallow it. Whole. Then choke it back up, chew some more and swallow it whole again. Repeat until it goes down and stays down. This is not healthy and not very safe and I always have to be poised to remove the offending chunk of soft wet rawhide from his throat as he gags it up. He does love these chews but I have not seen any wonderful changes in his teeth so far with 2 weeks of daily use so it will not be worth the trouble or risk of choking for me to buy more once this bag is gone. I now wish I had gotten the smaller quantity bag so I could be done with these sooner!     Edited to add that I finally finished the whole bag and still didnt see any big changes to his teeth or gums. Also, the coating comes off on his white legs and my carpet and they make his  eath smell weird (not fresh, kind of medicine like). I will never buy these again.
