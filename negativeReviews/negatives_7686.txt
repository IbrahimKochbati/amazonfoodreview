I took one sampling of this barbecue sauce after opening the bottle and immediately threw it away.  The taste is really disgusting, nor is the consistency anywhere close to "thick."  Using this product with any type of meat (pork, chicken, beef, etc.) will absolutely ruin what you're eating.  I should have done a better job of reading the other reviews, since they are dead on.  You can find a number of low carb barbecue sauce recipes on the web   I'd try that instead of this product.
