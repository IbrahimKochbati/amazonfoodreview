Customer beware of VitaPlus, Canyon Creek, & waggin Train products, because of many reports in U.S., Canada, & Australia, that dogs are getting sick from these products made in China.  This is especially so in smaller  eeds.  Do your research on these products and then make informed decision on whether you really want to fed your pet these foods.  I threw out all these products, and now I buy only made in the USA.  You have to really look at packaging, as Canyon Creek says No. Carolina on back right side and then on left back side it says made in China.
