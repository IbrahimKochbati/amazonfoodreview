If you love Macadamia Nuts you know they can be $$$ but you will still pay because there is a difference with Mauna Loa.  I ordered these and the butter toffee.  They tasted as good as when purchased in HI.  The price was amazing!  I will order more.  They are the smaller cans that you find in the store.  Fresh, tasty, quick ship and you need to buy six cans because you will easily eat two cans the min. you get it.
