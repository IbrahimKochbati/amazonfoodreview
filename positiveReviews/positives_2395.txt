I didn't have high expectations that I would like this but I love coffee and have trouble with nausea from the acid. I am a Starbucks fan and while this was not as full bodied as that it was surprisingly good. Nice to not have the acid issues that come with coffee, this did not bother me at all or make me nauseous. I still prefer the taste of Starbucks houseblend but now I'm not sure the extra body is worth the acid. This is a good alternative that i found i liked better and better as i got use to it. Give it a try!
