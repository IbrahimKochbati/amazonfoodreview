white peppercorns are white peppercorns, so long as nothing is wrong with them.  i knew when i ordered from jr that my pepper would arive fast and be good.  buying a 1 2 pound of pepper will last me, and take up a little space in the spice cabnet,but it is mych cheaper than paying what the grocery charges for 1 8 pound
