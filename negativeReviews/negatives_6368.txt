I love the Donut House Extra Bold Decaf.  Best decaf of all the  ands that I have tried and I have tried many.  I ordered here and expected to get what I ordered.  What I got was the light roast that was NOT extra bold.  It actually did not say Extra Bold on the label.  By this time though I had thrown the box away loading the k cups onto the carousel. Now I know that I must watch closely and examine each and every one as I load it into my machine to make sure it is what I think it is so I am not so disappointed in the future.  I won't buy from here again.  Someone is responsible for the switch.  I expect to get what I pay for.
