I bought a bunch of the Kitchens of India items during a promotional sale and the only one I'd recommend is the butter chicken sauce. If they were tasty I could overlook the salt content for the occasional enjoyment but I'm not loving the taste. I ofter buy similar products from Trader Joes and those, in my opinion, are much better and cost far less.
