In the fall, I used this product and made pumpkin caramel chocolate truffles rolled in cinnamon toasted chopped pecans.  Everybody loved them.  This is not a sweet extract, but is so flavorful.  use it to add that taste of fall to confections and soups, risotto, etc!  great product and well worth the price.
