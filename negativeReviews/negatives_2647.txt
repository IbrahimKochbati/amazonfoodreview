i was shopping for SUGAR FREE cookies, so they suggested other SUGAR FREE cookies and i selected them, unfortunately, i'm a diabetic, and when i received the "lucy" chocolate chip cookies: NOT only were they assorted flavors (Which i DIDNT order) BUT they were NOT SUGAR FREE!! why would they suggest these i have NO idea,but i'm very upset.
