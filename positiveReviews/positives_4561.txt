These flat eads are definitely my favorite cracker, but they're messy when I  eak them apart to have something closer to bite sized.          Caution: Despite the description that they are made with spelt and good for people with wheat issues, people with celiac disesase cannot eat these. Spelt has gluten and the flat eads contain barley malt. I love them and heartily recommend them, but please don't misunderstand the nature of spelt and accidentally serve them to someone with gluten intolerance.          Oh, yes, great price at Amazon compared to my local grocery store. I hope that advantage continues.
