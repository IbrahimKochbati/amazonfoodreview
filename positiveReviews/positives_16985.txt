I bought this toy for my puppy (She's a frug, 3 4 French Bull and 1 4 Pug) It took her a while to learn how to get the treats out. When she's a little hungry and she's in a hurry to get to the treats, she  ings the jar to me so I can shake out some treats.  For treats we use Rachel Ray's Nutrish dog food. The pieces are just the right size for the Busy Buddy. The only problem we've encountered is that our puppy chewed up the cord. We've tried a few different cord replacements and haven't found one that works very well. We don't recommend letting your dog take it to bed (especially if he see sleeps with you) because you'll wake up with pieces of treats ... well you just won't like it! Other than that, it will keep your puppy well occupied.
