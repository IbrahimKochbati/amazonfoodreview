Allow me to say that my situation may be different from yours. I have been a vegetarian since childhood and have perpetually experimented with all sorts of crazy foods    so my pallet is accustom to more "natural" flavors.          I have struggled for years to  eak my soda habit (besides the high fructose corn syrup there are a number of other ingredients I'm simply not comfortable putting in my body). (And, Dr. Oz has been fairly forthcoming in saying that these products promote free radicals which hurry the aging process). Switch gave me the carbonation and sweet taste that I crave. No, it's not my favorite Mountain Dew ... but it's a good second place and a wildly better choice.          Some people are complaining about the calories (140 a can). For me (and maybe you), that's not a concern. What impresses me is that this drink is 100% juice. Why drink empty calories when you can fuel your body with goodness?          Bottom line: this product may surprise you! It has a pleasant flavor, is lightly carbonated, and crushed my desire for soda. I must admit, I am a fan!!
