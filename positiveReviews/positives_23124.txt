I've been trying this  ead mix for around six months now, firstly by mixing it manually and then in a  ead maker; both come out first class but the  ead maker version just has the edge! The baked loaf has a superb flavour as well as retaining it's moisture for days. If you are thinking of using this great gluten free product then don't hesitate, just buy it and enjoy.   "
