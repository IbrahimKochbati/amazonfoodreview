One pack was Heavenly,the next was disturbing.We have yet to try the third one.     They all have the same expiration date so it's just a quality problem.The only way to describe the gross pack was it tasted flat and had a lingering aftertaste.No matter what you did it still tasted like reused grounds.This was in an esspresso machine so I can only imagine how weak it'd have been  ewed in a coffee pot.          The first was bold and just really good.One of the best that my husband or I had tried.We even reheated it in the microwave and it retained all flavor and quality.          So this ones a buy at your own risk.It's a gamble how they'll taste.
