I have been hunting for a decent treat for my GSD.  She just had TPLO surgery and has been recovering nicely.  I did a search for healthy treats and came across these happy hips.  The ingredients are natural and she absolutely loves them.  The idea that it is also benefitial for her joints adds a special bonus to the product.  No sugar or garbage in these.  I have been keying in on more protein in her diet as she has had digestive problems.  She has had not problems since I changed.  You can't go wrong with these.
