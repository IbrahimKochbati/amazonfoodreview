Most recent purchase 02 15 12     I cut these in half to give to my Aussies     These are the sizes that I received today.  I judge these on thickness, not on length          13   Very thin, I could cut them in half with regular scissors.  I give these to my friend who has a small dog      7   A little bit thicker, I had to use utility scissors     10   What I consider to be the "correct thickness" for size extra large.  I have to use pruning shears to cut them in half                                                                           I just sent an e mail to the Virbac company concerning the decrease in the thickness of the Extra large size. My dogs love them but they can finish this new thickness (or thinness I should say) in no time flat.          The reason that it is very noticeable to me is because I buy the extra large for the thickness & cut them in half (with pruning shears) for my two Aussies. The bag I got today, I could almost cut them in half with kitchen scissors.          I hope that I just got a bad batch & that the future batches will be the usual thickness of the past.                                                                                    *** Update:  It has been at least a month since my first review when I wrote that I e mailed the Virbac company about the the decrease in size of the Extra Large chews.          I have NOT heard a word from them.  Needless to say, their customer service is non existent.
