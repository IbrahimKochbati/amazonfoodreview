This has become one of my favorite teas   it is a delicious, smooth blend that requires no sugar. My husband even likes it. We've also found it to be an exceptional immune system booster. We've tried many different  ands of echinacea capsules many times over the years, but this tea seems to be especially potent and quick acting   maybe because it's a blend of 3 species of echinacea, and also includes astragalus & elderberry. It's a very enjoyable way to do something good for your body!
