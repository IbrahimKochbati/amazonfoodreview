This may simply show that I was ignorant as to what a Polish dill pickle would be, but I was expecting something closer to a kosher dill, like let's say what's produced by Claussen or maybe Vlassic. Instead, these almost remind me more of a  ead and butter pickle, sugar is used in the  ine along with garlic and dill.          Having said that for those that like a sweeter pickle instead of a more sour dill this would easily be a five star product, since it was my mistake to buy the wrong type of Polish pickle I'll still rate this product 5 stars. What impressed me even more is that the only ingredents were the cucumbers, vinegar, water sugar, dill and whatever other spices were used in the  ine, no preservtives were used at all. So for those wanting a true all natural product, this is it.          Addendum:  To clairfy, I looked up polish dill pickles on a couple sites, and I have to admit it was due to myself being clueless.  There are some that are more like what I wanted, then some like this product.  So, I should have researched the difference.  I'm going to raise the review to five stars since the mistake was all mine, I previously did have it at four stars.
