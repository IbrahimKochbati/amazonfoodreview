Switch Orange Tangerine soda comes in a smaller can than a regular soda (a little over 8 ounces, compared to the usual 12 ounces in a regular soft drink can).  It is labeled as "all natural" because the sugars in it come from fruit juices rather than added corn syrup.  I chilled the can of Switch in my refrigerator overnight, and then sampled it poured over ice in a glass.  The color is not so "neon" orange as some orange sodas    it is a softer orange color.  The fizz is also less than in a regular soft drink.          I found the flavor pleasing, with none of the chemical or metallic taste which can occur in many  ands of orange soda.  The soft fizziness of the drink complemented the orange flavor well.  I didn't really get a true tangerine taste from the soda.  Tangerines are a very acidic fruit, and have a very distinct taste, which I did not really get from this soda.  However, the taste is very smooth and quite refreshing.  My teenaged daughters and their friends loved this soda, and I have been re ordering it every so often as a treat.           Switch is a bit pricy.  You can cut down on the price by signing up for regular deliveries, but so far I haven't given in to that temptation.  However I am buying it for special occasions, for the travel cooler, and for planned teen get togethers.
