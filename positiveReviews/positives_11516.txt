I've been using this for at least 15 years.  Started when I did "Fit for Life" and was stir frying veggies.  My family loved the veggies, they were finished every night.  I've been using it ever since, on veggies and meat.  Great in hamburgers, on pork chops, chicken, etc.  It's our favorite of all the seasonings that Chef Paul sells. My grown children with families of their own are using it too.  I've also used it in some of my home made salad dressings.
