At first I wasn't sure how this would compare to my usual tea cabinet staple, Celestial Seasonings India Spice chai, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well it measured up. It has a spicy but pleasant aroma, and no harsh peppery taste like a lot of supermarket chais. Instead, there was a strong note of cinnamon with a hint of ginger, so if you like either of those ingredients, you would probably enjoy this. Unfortunately, as others point out, it is no longer available in leading grocery stores, so you will have to buy it here.
