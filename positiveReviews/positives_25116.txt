I can't drink plain unflavored coconut water because of the horrid taste.  Since coconut water works so well to hydrate after a workout, or on a hot day, I am so glad I found this flavor!  I tried it after being unable to find the passion fruit flavor, which is also quite tasty.  I have tried other flavors and other  ands, but this is my favorite.
