I absolutely love the crystal lite on the go packets. They are perfect for work, home, etc. I got these online because they were always sold out at my grocery store. I love the peach iced tea as well as the lemonade. Its true, you really dont have to use the whole packet but I like mine tart so I do. Perfect if you are like me and trying to cut calories.
