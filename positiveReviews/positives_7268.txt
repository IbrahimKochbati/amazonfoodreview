We drink this coconut water every day in our house. It's become somewhat of an obsession. We used to have a subscription to the 12 pack of vitacoco and when that ran out we tried this instead. I like it better. It tastes cleaner though I can't describe what's different about it, I just feel better after drinking this than drinking the vitacoco. Coconut water in general has an odd taste to it but it's still really sweet and feels SO refreshing when you drink it. If I'm really hungry I drink this between meals and it's kind of like a protein shake or energy drink. It settles my stomach and gives me a fantastic burst of energy!
