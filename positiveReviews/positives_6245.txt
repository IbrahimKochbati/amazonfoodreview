I agree with one of the previous posts   coffee is a matter of personal taste. My wife and I really liked this coffee, it was fresh and flavorful. If you like dark roasts, don't buy this one, it is definitely not dark. The flavor is very distinct and pleasant, as opposed to some Kuna and Blue Mountain blends we have tried before.
