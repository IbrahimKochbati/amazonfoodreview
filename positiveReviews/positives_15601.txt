Well my mother has a couple cats so I thought what the heck I'll get this stuff for her to feed them instead of hard food all the time.          The cats who will eat anything and everything that you put in front of them were little apprehensive of this product. Granted the one cat does like spicy food but he did eat it throughout the days. They both like it but it's hard for them to get a hold of the pieces because the chicken is kind of stringy and not cut into smaller pieces and some of it ends up on the floor.          But now that they kind of used to these they do definitely practically yell at me when I don't give them the stuff as soon as I open the can, lol. But it would be better if it were smaller cut pieces to reduce the amount that ends up on the floor.
