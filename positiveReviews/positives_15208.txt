I have to give it to the makers of this line of organic baby food. This stuff is obviously high quality. It smells very fishy even though salmon is not one of the first listed ingredients. Again I was surprised but my little guy wolfed it down repeatedly. I was happy to find an organic fish food for my baby. Thumbs up.
