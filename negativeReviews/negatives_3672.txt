I thought what i ordered was nuts but instead got a stale tasting nut that was smothered in sugar, salt and many other unpleasant seasonings   I would not buy any Emerald product. I went to the store and checked   for the most part these green type containers are smothered nuts, not just nuts. Just basic walnuts   NO WAY; ingredients list seasoning (maltodextrin, yeast extract, carrots, garlic puree, celery, corn syrup solices, ascorbic acid, silicon dioxide, modified potato starch and natural flavorings and spices   not exactly all ingredients but you get the idea.          If you like them that way, enjoy and bon appetit. but if you want plain nuts, suggest you look elsewhere
