These pork rinds are delicious, but learning how to cook them in your microwave takes some practice. My first 2 bags were wasted, but I finally just dumped the bag on a paper plate and microwaved it and they turned out GREAT.  The bag has NOTHING to do with the cooking, so I actually just emptied all of my bags into one big ziplock bag so I can put how many I want on a plate and only cook a few at a time (cooks better that way)          All that said, when these babies puff, they are delicious.
