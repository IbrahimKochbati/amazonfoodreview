Product had 4 months to go on date when I received it.  Tasted stale.  You cannot return this item, so your stuck with 10 boxes of them.  $30 down the drain.  2nd food item I've received from Amazon in the last few months that was stale tasting.  I think your local grocer is a safer bet for this type food item.  That is, if you can find it locally.  At least you can try a smaller quantity and return it if neccessary.
