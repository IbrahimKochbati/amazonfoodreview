I'm not big on writing reviews, but since this product has such a wide variety of reviews I thought I'd add my own thoughts.  I was looking for a good, mild decaf coffee for myself and to offer friends in the evening and that is exactly what I received.          Does the picture say "extra bold"? Yes, but everything else about the product in the description says that it's a "light roast"...not to mention the scathing 1 star reviews stating that it's not extra bold even though the picture says it is. Take an extra 30 seconds next time and read through the description and maybe some reviews before spending your money. That is a technical error and shouldn't be held against the quality of the actual product in the review.          Overall I'm very pleased with the coffee as I do not like dark roasts   so if you are like minded, I believe you will enjoy this coffee, and hey   the price is right, too.  There aren't too many k cups you can get for around .50 cup.
