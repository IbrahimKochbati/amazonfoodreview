This is a tasty drink that is a nice alternative to soda since it's 100% all juice.  Other reviewers have mentioned that it has a tart taste to it, but to both me and my husband (who is the primary soda drinker in our family), it tasted sweet, with no aftertaste.  As my husband put it, it's sweet with a little tanginess, so that it's not overly sweet.          Although this purports to be primarily kiwi and berry, the main juices it is composed of are apple and grape.  It is also high in calories:  a small 8.3 ounce can has 135 calories.          Other than that, it's a nice change of pace, and it's worth a try if you're looking for a healthier alternative to soda.
