Be careful when odering this, because they say it's a 6 pk, but you will only get a 4 pk, plus the formula goes out in 4 months.  So if you did like I did and got it early for grandchildren your out of luck!  So I know I will not be buying off of this site again for food for my grandchildren, because they won't be able to eat it.
