Pamela's makes an awesome, delicious, easy to use wheatfree baking mix.  The 25 lb bag is clearly a wholesale product, coming in a  own paper bag without any fancy labels.  In January Amazon was selling this product for $66 which was clearly an appropriate price for a wholesale item, especially if you compared it to the other sizes of the same baking mix.  Now they are charging $82 for the exact same product which makes it MORE expensive than buying the same product offered as 3 of the 4 lb bags in the very pretty retail packaging.  Something isn't right with this product offer, anymore.  Shame on you Amazon.  You're supposed to be above such schemes!     STILL, swear by Pamela's wheatfree Baking & Pancake Mix.  It's the BEST.
