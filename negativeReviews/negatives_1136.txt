I have ordered numerous teas, potions, lotions and other remedies...BUT have never had a lack of product in an order that was sealed.  The tea bag wrapping in question was sealed without a tea bag inside.  I would have said something sooner, however...I only tried these when I had a sinus infection and the last 3 times I tried to use one...the sealed pouch was EMPTY.  BEWARE!
