I would not purchase this item again.  It has some sort of scent or perfume added which is not only very noticeable but unappetizing. No listing of any additive of that sort on the package except aromatic spices and I doubt there is anything in nature that smells like that. Packages are marked 'Product of China'.  I have had no problem with Lee Kum Kee sauces that I purchased in the past.
