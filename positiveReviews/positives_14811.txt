Not all Earl Grey teas are created equal. Because the bergamot oil can mask a less than stellar leaf, many tea companies do not use really high quality tea leaves for their Earl Grey.          Rishi uses a solid leaf from Yunnan for their Earl Grey, a hearty black tea which comes from the same region as Puerh tea comes from. As a result you can easily get 2 full steeping from these leaves.          The tea has a nice balanced flavor, the bergamot isn't overpowering and it compliments the sweetness of the Yunnan tea. Prior to the Rishi I was purchasing Mighty Leaf's Earl Grey and I have to say that I prefer the Rishi. It all boils down to the choice of tea leaves (which should seem obvious) but Rishi's choice and the price point of this tea make it THE Earl Grey to beat!
