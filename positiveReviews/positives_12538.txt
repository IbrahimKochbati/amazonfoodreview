Having a delicious, hot, instant cup of coffee in the morning is the perfect picker upper, eye opener, and motivater to leave those toasty blankets behind.  BUT it took more than just the  ewer to do all that.  We received ours for a Christmas gift along with our first pack of coffee and quickly had to order a new supply from you.  Why did the world wait so long for K Cup Green Mountain Coffee?  We feel like kicking up our heels  at least mentally!  AMAZON, you are s o o o good and up to date.
