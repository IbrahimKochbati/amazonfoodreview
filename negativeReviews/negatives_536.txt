When tea is decaffeinated, is all the flavor removed? Or is this just lousy tea? In any case, all you get from a couple of these tea bags in a (12 oz.) mug of hot water is  hot water! True, the hot water is slightly  ownish after five minutes of steeping, but there's no tea flavor at all. Very disappointing.
