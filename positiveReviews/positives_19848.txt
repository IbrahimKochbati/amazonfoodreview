This is a top notch company & my dogs love their treats. These are the most sought after treat for my 2 labs; they make ones that have clams in them and the dogs love those even more. This company is based in New Zealand and I don't prefer to buy things that are from so far away ... but their quality is the best; if I could afford their soft food I would buy that as well; it is not available locally. Currently my dogs eat EVO grain free.     Anyway, have a good day & enjoy your dogs every moment you can ...
