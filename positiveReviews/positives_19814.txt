I used to overpay at Harry & David's for small packs of these. When I found a 5 pound bag on Amazon, I HAD TO HAVE IT! These little things are great, and they're also guilt free b c they're not really bad for you. The flavor is really close to actual grapefruit, but the sugar coating makes them sweetly delicious. I love 'em!
