Hibiscus Tea 24 Bags, I've got this tea for my Dad to help him with his Blood Pressure, it is a little early to tell. I also taking it myself, I like all kinds of Tea, Green, Triple Leaf Tea, this one has a very deep purple color and nice Fruity Flavor, I really like it. Hibiscus Tea is the combination of two herbs. Hibiscus is cultivated throughout the tropics, its flowers are highly prized for making Jams, Jellies, sauces and Beverages          Lemongrass is a sub tropical herb known for its strong citrus flavor and aroma. It became a popular edition to Tea blends in the 1970s and was quickly accepted in Europe. By blending these tropical flavours together, they have created a tart and fruity Tea that is Kid friendly and truly wonderful hot or cold. I also like the fact that this Tea does not contain any Caffeine, that usually keeps me up, no problem with Hibiscus Tea. It tastes Great! Thank You
