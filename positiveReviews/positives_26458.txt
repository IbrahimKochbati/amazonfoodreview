I cannot rave about these enough!  My puppy is a boston terrier, on a grain free diet.  We do give her some table food from time to time, and if she gets into anything outside, I swear (for my puppy) that these are a cure all enzyme to  eak down whatever is in her belly.  She loves them so much, she completely understands if we ask her if she wants a "new bone".  Also, we had to switch to the larger size so she wouldn't try to consume them fully, choke, spit them up, and scare us half to death.  I totally recommend these!!
