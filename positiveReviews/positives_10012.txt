The key points here are probably the vacuum packing (no air!) and the extremely fine grind.  The fine grind results in a stronger cup off coffee with fewer grounds, meaning the bag lasts longer than a regular bag of coarsely ground beans.  I really can't say aenough about how finely ground it is: it's almost like a powder!  The vaccuum packing also means it's just a bit more fresh when you first open the bag.  Overall   no complaints at all: great tasting, strong as you want it coffee here.
