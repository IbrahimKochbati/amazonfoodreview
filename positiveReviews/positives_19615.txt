I was at Trader Joe's, randomly  owsing at the deli meats section for something to munch on later when one of these individual links caught my eye. At first I thought the white on the outside was some sort of wrapping, but upon squinting I noticed that it looked like a residue.     "Hm. This is weird", I thought. Maybe I'll eat it. Sorta like when you find strange crumbs on your kitchen table and stick it in your mouth when no one's looking.     So I bought a link, and read the information about Columbus Salame Secchi. Lo and behold, it's actually a sort of mold that grew on the outside of meat! Well I had already bought the thing, and figure I might as well eat it, strange as it may be.          I was back at Trader Joe's the next day.     They had ONE left. My entire week was ruined!     So I did the only thing I could do. Buy it on Amazon!!!!!     The package of 12 links came two days ago. Went to the nearby hippie grocery store, bought some Cabernet, Stilton cheese, and imported Italian olives.     Wow...          The flavor on this meat is just... irresistible. I know when people say something is irresistible, they mean it's really, really good. I actually mean this thing is impossible to resist. I always start eating a link with the intention of just having maybe a third or a half of a link, not because I'm a health nut or something, but just because I don't want to pig out on just some salami. This isn't just salami. This is Salame Secchi. Before I know it, I've eaten the whole darn link of sausage, and I'm feeling guilty not because I've eaten the entire thing, but because I have one fewer link left to eat later.          The meat, mold, and fat in the salame come together in a joyful union taste bud heaven. There's nothing else quite like it. I've always been a fan of salami and prosciutto, but you NEED to try this. If you've ever been a fan of smoked salmon, sashimi, or any kind of meat period, I think it will be impossible to turn this down.          I'm ordering another 12 links ASAP.
