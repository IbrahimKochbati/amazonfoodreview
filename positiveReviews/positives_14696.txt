I'd started a long time ago purchasing this product from a local organic natural food store.  I don't allow regular cheetos in the house because of what's in them and this one is allowed because of what's not. When you find artificial preservatives flavor enhancers in food that's not good for anyone, and if someone has a learning disability those preservatives can make those kind of symptoms worse.  If you can pronounce it, you probably shouldn't be eating it.  This a  very tasty and much healthier crunchy snack that can be enjoyed by anyone.
