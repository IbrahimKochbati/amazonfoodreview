I've blended this with a darker full caf Melitta coffee and LOVE the results.          The fine grinding is a tad small for the french press I use, but the taste is wonderful.          I was a little concerned at the darkness variation in the two when I decided to blend, but the outcome was fine.          The only real complaint I have is the packaging. Cheap glue on the metal fold down part causes it to fall off (true for both bags I received), so don't rely on that.          Otherwise, a delicious coffee that is mellow in taste the way I choose to prepare it.
