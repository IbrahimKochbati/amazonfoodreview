this maple syrup is so rich in flavor this is truly grade B maple syrup     the price is much better than in a specialty grocery store as well     the texture thickens in consistency if you keep it refrigerated, but once you leave it at room temperature it's a bit runny but still really delicious.     this grade of maple syrup tends to have such a richer flavor it's like regular grade A times 4 in flavor but without the extra sugar.     it's still a bit pricey for some, but very worth it, you'll notice you won't need need to use a lot at one sitting as well because the flavor is so rich.
