I ordered one case on a lightning deal since it was significantly less per can than any grocery store in our area. My shipment arrived in perfect condition. It was packed well, and no cans were dented at all. The contents in the cans are the color and taste I would expect for pureed, commercially canned pumpkin (not gray or tart as some reviewers mentioned).  The pumpkin worked well in a vegan pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving, in pumpkin spice muffins for  eakfast and in a cream cheese pumpkin dip to accompany ginger snaps on New Year's Eve.  I ordered a second case on a Manager's Special and that one arrived in excellent condition as well.  I was also pleased with the long shelf life.  I would give this product five stars if it was packed in BPA free cans.
