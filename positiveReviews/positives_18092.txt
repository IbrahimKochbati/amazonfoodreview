The Illy company was set up in 1933 in Italy by a Hungarian officer who had come to Trieste with the Austro Hungarian Army during World War I, and stayed. Today, the company remains with the Illy family, with the founder's grandson at the helm. They have 700 employees and sell their  and in over 100 countries. The company uses only Arabica beans, purchased directly from the farmer, rather then the middleman, and produces only one superiour blend.          So much for Google info ;o)... Now, here is my personal Illy "journey":          I am down to only one cup of coffee a day and so I need its taste to be perfect (quality vs quantity). I like my coffee very strong, but dread the bitter aftertaste many strong  ands induce (Starbucks would be one). I was introduced to Illy by a co worker a few years ago, and have not looked back... It provides the strength I crave, with a sweet and smooth aftertaste. Yes, this coffee will grow hair on your chest(figuratively...). The coffee is packed in air free conditions (with nitrogen gas), to help preserve the taste. When you pull of the inner metal seal, you will hear the air hissing its way into the can. The metal cap is a twist off. It is designed to be air tight as well, to prolong the freshness after the can has been opened.          Regarding the  ewing process: for a decade now I have been using the French press exclusively (I believe it delivers a stronger sweeter  ew). I find the medium grind medium roast "blue band" Illy to be perfect for the purpose. The instructions on the back of the can help you with coffee to water ratio for both the drip machine and the French press. Do not over agitate the French press after  ewing and you will be ok. Alternately, you may purchase whole Illy beans and grind them to your satisfaction (sadly, I am too lazy for that...).          Regarding Amazon price and service: Illy is not easy to find in certain parts of the country. Where I live, it requires a trip to the local mall... So, I was happy to find that Amazon offered this product at the same price as my mall, with the cost free, directly to my door, service. The item arrived promptly, with the "open by" date fourteen months away. I am a happy customer!          I hope the coffee will work for you as well!
