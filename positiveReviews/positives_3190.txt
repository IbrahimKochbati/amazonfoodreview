A few years ago, going Gluten Free was really difficult. I missed the basic things I loved to eat and pancakes were certainly one of them. I tried other mixes but the batters were very dry and required items to moisten them such as fruit, etc. But Bisquick's GF pancake mix was surprisingly good! It is a great alternative to the real thing. Certainly all of us Gluten Sensitives out there know it will never be that delicious stack of buttermilk pancakes like we once knew, but I'm happy to know there's a great alternative. :)
