Well, I didn't actually eat one, but my faithful Golden Retriever did. The thing with dogs is, they eat pretty indiscriminately. How do I know this dog biscuit is any better than any other dog biscuit? He eats them all! Open the bag and smell. Most dog treats smell horrendous. I was very surprised at the non offensive odor of these. Yes, the idea of organic all healthy treats appeals to me too. But mainly, they won't stink up my car if I take them with me someplace. They are a nice size for bigger dogs, but have scores on them so you can  eak them up to smaller sizes. Nice packaging too, with a zipper top. I like that much better than a box that comes open constantly. We give'em five woofs!
