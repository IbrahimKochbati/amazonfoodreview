I have been spending at least $150.00 dog yr for dental cleaning....after only 4 5 months their teeth were starting to look dirty again...my Vet recommended these....I have always been suspect of rawhides but these have enzymes in them...gave them one a day for two weeks and then twice a week after that....don't think they will have to have their teeth done for a while....they look great....when the teeth look slightly dirty...give them one a day for 3 4 days....they look better again....also...got these at half price...even better....
