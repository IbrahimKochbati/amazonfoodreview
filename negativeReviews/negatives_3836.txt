This is not a bad product, just an average one. It's carbonated fruit juice so it's certainly a better choice than soda, and contains 100% of your vitamin C for the day. But, the taste is nothing special    strong on the strawberry flavor and sweeter than you would expect from juice.          The price is rather steep once you figure in the per ounce cost. I would rather have regular juice, skip the carbonation, and skip the high price. But, if you're trying to wean the kids off sugary soda, this is something worth considering    they get the carbonation and sweetness of soda, but not the corn syrup and other junk.
