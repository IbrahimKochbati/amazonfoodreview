I was quite excited to try this product, so I bought 4 packs. We opened one, and I tested a half tablet. No result. My wife tried the other half. Ditto. The next day, we tried a full tablet, letting it completely dissolve over the entire tongue. I found the tablets pretty tasty themselves, while my wife found them too chalky to enjoy. Anyway, again there was no effect with lemons, chili sauce, etc. Our daughter also had no discernible change in her taste of foods.          Happily for me, the company is going to refund me for the other three packages. But I would have preferred that they'd worked. I was looking forward to  inging them out at an upcoming party.
