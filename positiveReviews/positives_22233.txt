I have used this product to make rolls and  eadsticks often, but I just finally decided to try to make calzones out of them, adding some Italian Seasoning into the mix.  They came out beautifully and the leftovers were an easy lunch the next day.  I've been GF for 3 years now and, knowing that I can make am excellent calzone any time I want to, I really have no reason to miss products like Hot Pockets.  This product really does seem to be pretty versatile.  Happy experimenting!
