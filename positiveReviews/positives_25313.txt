I give these to both of my lab mix mutts every other day & their teeth look great! One of them had slight to medium tartar build up around his molars and they look much improved.  (They also eat dry food and not wet which helps).  It doesn't do much for their  eath however, so I will still have to  ush their teeth occasionally.
