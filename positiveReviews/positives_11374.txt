Pamela's makes some of the best tasting cookies I have ever had. I have never tasted a bad product from this company, all the cookies are great but this one is my favorite of all time. They're moist, chewy and a much healthier choice than most other cookies on the market. So if you are on a diet or not, if you are sensitive to wheat or not, these taste great. I look forward to the day that Pamela's expands their product line!
