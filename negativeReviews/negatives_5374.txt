As a rabid, unrepentant coffee drinker, I had to try this product.  Although I love the flavor and texture of French roast coffee, it's acidity tends to wreak havoc once inside of me.  Given my (minimum) two cup a day habit, coffee can be tough going, to say the least.          The Puroast  and delivered on the caffeine, but I found the flavor to be a bit bland, both straight and with cream.  I generally like my French roast to be strong, sharp and over powering (so as to awaken me with a jolt and keep me fully hyped up), but the flip side of this is typically very high acid content with the usual medical complaints.  To achieve that same full sensory experience, I had to use a bit more of it  about 1.5 times the usual amount of grounds that I  ew of typical French roast in order to achieve a similar 'kick' from the coffee.          In passing, I also like to spice up my coffee with either 1) a little cinnamon and Kahlua (usually during winter) or 2) one part twenty year aged rum, minimum two parts Grand Marnier, chasing both with a strong batch of French roast filled to the rim of the mug (a kind of after dinner dessert on the weekends for me).  I tried the latter recipe with and without a touch of cream, and while typically the coffee tends to eclipse the flavor of the alcohol mix, with Puroast both the aroma and taste of the aged rum and the Gran Marnier came through right nice as my ever so sensible British friends are fond of saying.  I also found that for best results with the combo of aged rum and Grand Marnier, Nestle's Coffee Mate French Vanilla product provided the best results, which featured a smooth, even finish combined with a creaminess that was, well, positively orgasmic!          In sum, this product is an adequate and satisfying entry to the coffee space, and I highly recommend it to those who literally cannot 'stomach' their coffee.
