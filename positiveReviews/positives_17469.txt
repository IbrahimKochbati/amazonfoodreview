I was crushed that my fav store discontinued my fav crepes (& the *only* mix I ever liked!).          I called Trader Joes Customer Service, they were a  ick wall ("Confidential" who the real manufacturer of their crepes were)...My French friend had a  illiant idea to google the ingredients which lead me to this discovery! It also appears others are catching on b c the Kungsornen crepe mix is sold out all over the web...          The boxes from Amazon taste slightly 'barkier" (hard to describe but I am a huge food snob), but it's the exact same ingredients so I'll live with it (ie, wheat flour, no sugar!).          Pass the word out there, & if anyone else is as fanatical about this mix as I am, please help me petition Trader Joes to carry it once again! :)
