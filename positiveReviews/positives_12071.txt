I tried Simply 7 hummus chips at the NY winter wine festival 2 weeks ago and to say I was pleasantly surprised is an understatement. They are absolutely delicious!! It has the requisite crunch of a chip and no artificial colors, flavors, preservatives and is gluten free. Definitely will look for it in stores!
