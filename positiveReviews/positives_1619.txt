As a new Keurig owner, I'm trying as many "sampler" packs as possible to determine what both my husband and I like the most.          Although quite pricey and not coming in the cute gift box some other "Crazy Cups" purchases have been received in, I am enjoying this variety thoroughly.  It is almost entirely iced drinks and this sampler pack had a good mix of the following:          Southern Sweet Tea, Unsweetened Black Tea, Raspberry Sweet Tea, Peach Sweet Tea, Sweet Lemon Tea, Half & Half Tea and a few different iced coffee k cups.  Additionally, there were a few seasonal Island Coconut which my husband loves.          I would consider purchasing variety packs as my main source of k cups, but at a price of over 90 cents a cup I can't justify the cost.  However, this is a good starting point to narrow down some favorites to purchase in single flavor boxes!          If these were presented in the gift boxes they use for other samplers, this would be a very ideal gift house warming present for these hot summer months!  I don't mind them not being in a gift box, but I could have at least used that as an excuse to myself for the price.
