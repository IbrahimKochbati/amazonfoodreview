These are almost too good: buttery, not *too* sweet, perfect with almost any beverage.  Like another reviewer, I often "fancy these up" by dipping in melted semisweet chocolate and dusting with chopped nuts (pecans, hazelnuts, etc.) or crushed Heath bars.  I've made short ead myself, but why go to the trouble when I can get excellent ready made?  Really exceptional stuff ...
