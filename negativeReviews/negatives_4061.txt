There is nothing "extra bold," or even "regular bold" about this coffee.  On the other hand, if you like your coffee meek and weak, you may well like this.  This comment isn't meant to suggest that my tastes are superior, I'm just stating that this is not "extra bold" at all.  If you want your coffee "slap your face" strong, try another Green Mountain flavor.  Dark magic, for example.
