I have been looking for this whole wheat orzo for the last year and none of my area grocery stores carry it. So I was delighted to find it on Amazon.  It is very tasty made with sauteed green onions and several cloves of garlic and then added to 14 oz. boiled chicken  oth and then simmered for 15 mins. (using 1 cup of the orzo).  Very yummy tasting and good for you too.
