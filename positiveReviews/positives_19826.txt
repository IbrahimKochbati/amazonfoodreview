It is hard to find candy that is overly sweet. My wife and Granddaughter both love Pink Grapefruit anyway and Pink Grapefruit candy has some of the tang of real grapefruit which cuts down on the sweetness a bit.     I did take away one star because I think they have a bit too much of sugar coating on the pieces but you can scrape some of it off to make it less sweet.     My wife uses the pieces when she has a low sugar spell since she is diabetic and sometimes when she has her insulin injections and doesn't eat quickly enough after that her blood sugar drops too low. Since I bought this she hasn't had that problem, but has to guard her supply from my Granddaughter though.     I have bought a pack for myself as well since I don't eat candy that often since I don't like overly sweet candy. This candy tastes good to me. I want to try the fruit salad next time just to have some change in taste. It has lime, grapefruit, lemon, orange, cherry and passion fruit and I like all of those flavors except cherry. But my wife likes cherry flavor so I can give those to her. Wish they had watermelon instead of cherry in that mix but its no big deal.
