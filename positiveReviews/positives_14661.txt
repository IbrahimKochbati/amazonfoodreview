Well, KURT A. JOHNSON, on April 8, 2008, has said it best.  There is nothing he has written that is incorrect about this tea; HOWEVER, I enjoy adding just a bit of lemon to my Lady Grey tea.  BUT, you really don't need to add any lemon if you don't want to.          THIS IS ONE OF THE  B E S T  teas produced!  ENJOY!
