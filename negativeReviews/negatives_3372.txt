It's hard to find crackers and other traditionally wheat products that are gluten free.  These crackers are a poor substitute.  They don't have a good taste  just starchy and, well, blah.  No amount of cheese or cracker topping can fix it.  I recommend Crunchmasters Multigrain GF crackers. They are the best that I have found.
