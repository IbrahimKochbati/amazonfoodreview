There is one thing I do love is classic food in the morning. Oatmeal has never stopped changing with the times, yet there are some traditions that have never died. Quaker has been no exception. They have made great tasting oatmeal for generations that is still as delightful today, as it was back then. Their classic Maple & Brown Sugar hasn't changed since it was introduced in instant oatmeal for decades. The taste is absolutely a joy to have every morning. It is simple to make with a simple pot of boiling water, and you get a classic treat in your morning  eakfast. If you have never tried Quaker's Oatmeal, or even had Maple & Brown Sugar Oatmeal before, you do know what you're missing, especially on those cold winter mornings. I definitely recommend Quaker's oatmeal, and this is a great flavor.          Price: B+          Taste: A           Overall: B+
