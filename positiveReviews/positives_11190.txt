Emeril's Big Easy Bold blend coffee is a full bodied good cup of coffee you will enjoy every morning. I can't wake up until I have the first, then the second cup, and then let the day begin. If you like a stronger cup of coffee without an acid or bitter taste, this one's for you. I prefer cream and sugar in mine and feel it stands up to the taste of any coffee house selection.
