Our family, wife, 2 year old and 4 year old, have had other Switch sodas in the past, and liked them quite a bit. They had a bit  of an apple flavor overrode the main That's definitely not true for the Orange & Tangerine. It tastes almost like fresh squeezed orange juice with bubbles. Far better than Orangina or orange soda.          My kids kept asking for more sips of the soda throughout dinner, and we all have enjoyed it. I appreciate that there's no caffeine, and it's all natural, so I have no problem giving it to my kids. I'd definitely recommend buying the soda, we'll keep some around the house regularly.
