I baked a few pork steaks bone in and the batter came out golden and crispy. The meat was cooked thoroughly and tender. The flavor wasn't too salty.          This isn't hard to make of course. You simply put the contents of the packets into a bag, wet the meat you intend to batter and shake to coat them. You then put them on the baking pan and bake. I think we all know that by the name of the product.          It only took about 30 minutes of baking. I served it with rice and veggies along with some gravy.
