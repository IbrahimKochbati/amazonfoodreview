I used to use agave nectar and honey. Even though I picked organic, there was still more sugar than desired after I put in my recipes. I actually got Tinea Versicolor due to the sugars in those products.          But this product is great. I use it in my protein shakes, smoothies, and baking recipes (muffins,  eads), and it's awesome.          I make a chocolate milkshake and this stuff really rounds off the edges:       Cottage Cheese       Chocolate Protein Powder       Cacao powder       Almond Milk       Nustevia powder          Just need maybe 1 4 cup of each ingredient and 1 cup of almond milk and it takes just like a sugary chocolate milk shake.
