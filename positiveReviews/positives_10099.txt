This is a strong, smoky coffee that can make you feel like a sophisticated coffee snob in the morning. It's smooth, rich, and velvety, and I always feel like a genius after  ewing it, like, 'yeah, I just  ewed this and it's so good. I am a coffee master.' That being said, it's almost a tad too strong for me   but I tend to prefer medium roasts. If you're looking for a strong coffee, I'd recommend checking this out.
