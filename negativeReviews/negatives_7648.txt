Okay, taste is subjective, so your mileage may vary when it comes to these cookies. With that disclaimer, I will say that I was looking forward to consuming these cookies because I do not just have a sweet tooth, all of my teeth are sweet  and baked goods are my number one temptation. I had one of these cookies and did not want another, even when I was jonesing for sweets and dying of hunger. I wouldn't even eat a second one of these when there was nothing else available. That's a bad sign. I ended up putting out my box in the  eak room at work, where they were snatched up (note: if you put out a half eaten sandwich in that  eakroom, someone is sure to eat it, if you get my drift). The cookies were bland, dry and nothing at all like good homemade cookies. If you're going to indulge, don't waste calories on something like this!
