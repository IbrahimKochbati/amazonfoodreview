I've been eating Annie's Mac n' Cheese (not the whole wheat type) since 1994.  Amazon offers a excellent price (around $1.50 per box for certified organic, whoa!) and if I'm going to commit upfront to 12 boxes of mac and cheese, I figured I try to be a little healthier and get the whole wheat type.          It is a quality product but it isn't suited to my taste buds.  I am surprised because I prefer  own rice and wild rice to white rice and generally enjoy whole wheat products.  But to this eater, the whole wheat shells were too heavy and chewy.  The watery white cheddar sauce enhanced the pasta's rougher texture and blandness.  (The white cheddar sauce is like an alfredo, and less creamy than Annie's regular cheddar.)  My friends love this stuff, but I think it's an acquired tasted.  If I had known what I know now, I'd have stuck with the enriched white (yet stripped of it's nutrients) shells or at least gone with the regular cheddar sauce.          *Update*     While still not a full on fan, I enjoying this product more now that:          1.  Tastes much better when cooked 10 11 minutes at sea level (the box recommends 8 10), the texture is less rough and gummy and is more noodle y.          2.  Adding fresh herbs with the cheese sauce.  It gives a depth to the flavor.  My favorite herb to add (so far) is cilantro (add about 1 3 cup chopped after mixing in the cheese sauce).  Other enjoyable variations were adding 2 3 cup of Italian parsley or 1 8 cup fresh dill leaves.
