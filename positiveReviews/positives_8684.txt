Krusteaz Pumpkin Pie Bars are out of this world!  We first made them for a big party that we hosted and the guests just went nuts over them.  They were all gone before we even got a chance to try them, so we had to make more to find out what all the hoopla was about!  Well, the guests were right and they are absolutely amazing!!!  We buy 5 boxes at a time now, usually from Amazon since the local stores only stock it seasonally, but it is definitely worth purchasing.  They are very easy to make and we love them right out of the oven, but I think that they are even more amazing after being in the refrigerator overnight.  If you love pumpkin, you must give this a try!
