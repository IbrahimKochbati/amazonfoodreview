I have tried each of the flavors in this combo pack and I must say I am really impressed! The flavors are amazing   like what you get when you take the time to  ew a cup of coffee or steep tea bags for an amazing ice tea. I am so impressed with the convenience that I have with making these products in my Keurig  ewer. In about 30 seconds, I have the drink of my choice to enjoy. I used to be frustrated with the length of time it takes to make sweet tea    ewing the tea bags and then having to wait for the  ew to chill in my fridge take about half a day. And then you have to drink it in a timely manner so that the tea doesn't lose its freshness. But with these tea Kcups, I can have a fresh  ewed sweet tea in 30 seconds made specifically for me or my guests and it is so fresh tasting and cool and refreshing. My friends who frequent coffee shops, have been impressed with the quality of the coffee and say that the  ew is just as good if not better than local coffee shops because it is so fresh and made just one cup at a time. So I am very impressed and will keep buying this product now that my campaign is almost over. I am so happy that Keurig decided to make this product. Makes me love my  ewer even more! I received this product as a sample from bzzagent.          Pros       1. fresh  ewed taste one cup one cup at a time     2. No wait time for  ews to be perfect     3. No stale day old taste from product sitting in the refrigerator     4. Coffee house taste at a fraction of the cost          Cons   NONE
