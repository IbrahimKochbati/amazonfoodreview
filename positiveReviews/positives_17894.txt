I grew up with Shake n Bake and it still remains a delicious way to bake port chops.  It is easy to prepare your meat in the shaker bag.  The tasty topping seals in juices and prevents you meat from drying out.  If you want an easy way to prepare pork chops with minimal mess and preparation, then Shake n Bake for Pork is for you.
