I've ordered this product from Amazon before and always been happy with its delivery condition, until this package arrived. I opened it and found most of the little creamer containers to be crushed to some degree, with the creamer leaked out all over the inside of the box. It had apparently been in this condition for a while as some of the creamer had thickened and adheared to the insides of the box in nasty clumps. At first, I thought perhaps I could check and save some of the little containers, but on second look, it was apparent I was wrong. What a nasty mess, and the worst part is even if I wanted to return this mess, I discovered it cannot be returned. So I'm appealing to you to consider refunding this horendous example of bad packaging. Until now, I've always been happy with Amazon and will probably order many other things down the road despite this incident, but I just think I shouldn't have to pay for such a mess. Thank you, Susan
