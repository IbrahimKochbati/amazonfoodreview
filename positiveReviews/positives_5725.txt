It's cornflour, period.  But, ground as only Masa is to make a good corn tortilla. It has great flavor.  Tortillas can be a real pain in the fanny to make.  Too many people worry about how it doesnt look like a commercial tortilla...but, I'll bet you that crooked as it is..it will leave Tia Rosa in the dust.  The hardest part is getting the mix right.  After that all you need is a rolling pin and two pieces of wax paper.  Make a few and you will get the hang.          You really don't need a tortilla press.  What you really need is practice.
