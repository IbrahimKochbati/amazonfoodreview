Purchased this for my Mom as a gift.  Somehow 600 tea bags seemed much smaller in my head then when I got the packages.  Needless to say my mother was amused!  However, like other reviewers have mentioned this is a really smooth tea.  My Mom said that it wasn't astringent, and there was no aftertaste or bite.  I'll be sure to purchase another box in a year when she's done with her 600 tea bags ;)
