I actually liked this drink a lot.  It tasted like...  hmm.  I have no idea how to describe its taste.  Sort of like a fruit juice spritzer maybe?          It didn't have much of a smell, but there was a distinct strawberry flavor.  It wasn't too sweet, and there was a little tartness to it (the kiwi?).          The carbonation was pretty mild, so I didn't feel as bloated as I do when I drink a soft drink.          It has about the same number of calories as the equivalent orange juice, and a lot of vitamin C...  but I'm not going to swap it for my morning OJ.  Nor am I a really big soft drink fan, but if it's a choice between Sprite or Switch?  The cost is similar.  I think I might Switch!
