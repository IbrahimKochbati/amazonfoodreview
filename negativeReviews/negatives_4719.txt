Our cats usually get the "green can" Fancy Feast shredded varieties (they aren't interested in the green can souffle types, and the Florentine varieties give them gastric problems).  The green can stuff is more elegant cat food, not amorphous  own blobs.  Petite Cuisine cat food, while something they dove into, was much more watery than the meat packed Fancy Feasts, and they have been suffering from loose bowels ever since we started them on the test cans.  We're going to do one can every three days to see if they can handle that, with the green can stuff on the other two days.  I'll report back.
