I didn't actually order these, but wrote to the seller. He replied that these are indeed "roasted", not "raw".          The raw ones cost a bit more, about $65 + shipping for 10 pounds (at the time of writing), or you can get the raw 320's (which are a large size), at 5 pounds for $35 + shipping. Both are still fairly reasonable.
