I had never cooked or baked with dried strawberries until I came across a recipe for granola that I had to try, and it called for dried strawberries.  I purchased a bag of these Barry Farm strawberries, and I was so amazed by their pure flavor and soft texture that I came back for more ... and more!  Barry Farm must choose berries at their peak of ripeness because the berries are rich in pure strawberry flavor with a perfect consistency. I am particular about the food I buy, and I want good quality.  Why bother to bake something with inferior ingredients?  I would highly recommend Barry Farm Dried Strawberries to anyone.  They are truly excellent.
