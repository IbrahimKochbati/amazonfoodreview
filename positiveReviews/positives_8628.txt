My 22 year old son introduced us to this tea, which is quite refreshing. This powdered version has several virtues over the prepared version. It is much less expensive. It keeps much longer. My son says the taste is equal to or better than the prepared version (he makes it a bit stronger), and I like being able to make it a little weaker and less sweet. It mixes very easily with no powder remaining.
