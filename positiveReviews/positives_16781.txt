The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star rating is because one of the bottles was busted when I received it.  Thankfully they were wrapped in a bubble wrap bag, but it wasn't enough to prevent the safety seal under the lid from popping loose. Judging by the condition of the box, evidently something heavy was placed on top of my package, and the pressure caused the safety seal to separate from the rim by about 1 4" inch) so I lost about 1oz. of product.          Aside from that, I love the agave, and it's a far better deal than what I can get at a grocery store.
