I love pineapple juice and drink it every day. Fresh is the best, but this is surprisingly good. I usually keep some on hand for convenience. It is so much better tasting than the stuff from concentrate. The price on Amazon is kind of high though. I find it's cheaper just to stock up at our local grocer.
