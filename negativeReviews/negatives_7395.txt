Chips Ahoy, chewy oatmeal cookies are so moist that it is difficult to separate a single cookie from the package without it  eaking into pieces.  My tastebuds say they are too sweet, not cooked enough, lack ample chocolate chips and oatmeal flakes.  If you like cookie dough, you most likely will enjoy these.  I'll stick with a crunchy, less sweet cookie.
