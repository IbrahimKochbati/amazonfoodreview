I had bought a Black and Decker one cup coffee maker that used these pods.  It didn't work properly, but I have managed to use the pods with my old, stand by coffee maker and am please with the flavor and convenience.  Someone had commented about a problem with some of the pods being sealed in the outer packaging.  I have not encountered that problem.  Overall, I am pleased with this purchase.
