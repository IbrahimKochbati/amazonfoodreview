These Barksters by Loving Pet are the the only product on their line that is made in the USA. My dogs loved the Loving Pet Sticks but when I read they were made in China, I threw them away and refuse to buy Loving Pet's many other products until they are made in the US. As for these Barksters, they are made with only four ingredients and all are healthy ingredients. All of my picky Chihuahua's love the treats, or I should say they loved the crumbs. I rated these healthy treats 3 stars instead of 4 stars because the crisps were all  oken up and were in crumbs.
