I am disappointed in the quality of this and of the Darjeeling loose teas. Years ago when I used Twinings regularly, it was of a higher quality. Then I switched to Murchie's of Canada,excellent quality teas, and now I tried Twinings again and am disappointed with it. It is acceptable, but not what I like in my teas.
