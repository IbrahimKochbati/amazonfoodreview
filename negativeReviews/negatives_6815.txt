The oil is SOLID and hard in the package. Just looking at it made my 50 year old heart slow down.  Plus, we did not hear a choir of angels singing the Halleluja Chorus when we ate it; it was mediocre popcorn with many unpopped kernels. My own fault   I should have known that, like sausage, its better not to know how "movie theater" popcorn is made (hint: yellow food dye is essential). We cannot  ing ourselves to eat this again.
