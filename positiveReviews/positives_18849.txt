I finally upgraded to the 11 lb bag after purchasing several 2.2 1b bags. I have two small dogs at home, both are 10 pounds each. I was trying out the raw food diet after doing research online, and while the dogs loved it, I was definitely not a fan of the raw meat and having to wipe everywhere when they were done eating.          Along comes Ziwipeak, and I tested out the different flavors in the smaller portions, ALL of which the two dogs loved.          Here are the marked differences since switching over (previously they were on Merrick dry food, before that was Halo).          Fresh  eath, no more doggy odor!     Stools do not smell (or very very faint)     One of the dogs   a Maltese   her tearstains have completely disappeared!!     Glossier coats     More energetic          Etc etc.          So even though this is expensive, in terms of the visible differences you can see in the dogs, I believe it's worth it!
