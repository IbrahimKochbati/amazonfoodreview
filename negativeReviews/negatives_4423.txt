got the wish pearl as a gift. My daughter thought it was a "little disgusting " the mollusk and the necklace  to hold the pearl was cheaply made so it wasa struggle to open it.  (we still haven't gotten it open)  We live at the ocean so my daughter is not sqirmish around sea creatures but didn't really enjoy this gift.
