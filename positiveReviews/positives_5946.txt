They are just that   100 calorie bags of pretzels. Snyder's tends to have one of the best tasting pretzels according to my taste buds. These bags create instant portion control and are a great value for the price, especially with subscribe and save. I also throw them in the kids' lunch bags and keep some in the car for road trips.
