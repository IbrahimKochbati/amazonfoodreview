Used to use another  and (that changed), in a jar, but this is so much better! Has a very pleasing hot spicy taste with a hint of lemon lime and a good amount of heat. It is a little too salty though, if you like to use a fair amount to "spice it up". We wish it had a lower sodium content. While, made from scratch with fresh ingredients is always better; this is the next best thing! Really good with chicken, beef, pork, tofu and veggie dishes. Quick and easy to make good for you meals. We don't like the packaging and wish it were in a jar, but other than that and the sodium content, we like it. Will buy again!
