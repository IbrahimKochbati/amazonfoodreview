I get energy drink for our IT department and we've been trying out random ones off Amazon with free prime shipping. Out of all of them thus far, this is by far the worst. The cola flavor was alright, a little too sweet, but not too disgusting, and it provided a great kick. This orange flavor we couldn't give away. It tastes like regurgitated orange juice with some artificial sweetener thrown in.          If you tempted to try this energy drink, try a different flavor! Cola is super fake sweet tasting, but not bad, this one is repulsing.
