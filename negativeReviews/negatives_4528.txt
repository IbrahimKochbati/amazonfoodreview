My 10 month old baby hates this stuff!!  I've tried giving it to him on 4 separate occasions but everytime he tastes it  he makes a disgusted look and won't eat anymore.  I even tried mixing it with his favorite foods and he just takes one bite and looses his appetite and won't eat anymore of anything for the rest of the night!
