This coffee proved to be a really nice treat.  I read the reviews, but gave it modest hope based on pricing. That proved to be a mistake.  The beans are dark and oily and very fragrant.  I used my burr grinder and had to poke at it several times so that the beans did not jam due to their oiliness.  I drink my coffee black with nothing in it, and this made a rich wonderful cup, with no bitterness.  My husband and I went through the 5lbs quickly.  I always have several kinds of coffee from which to choose, and found myself turning to this one more than not.  I'm back for my second bag, and trying more from this  and.
