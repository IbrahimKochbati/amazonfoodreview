I purchased this at my local Costco (I'm still a little unsure as to how Amazon carries Kirkland  and?).  It was much cheaper (less than ten bucks), but it is some DARN good coffee!  It is mild, smooth, and has an amazing flavor.  I was a little "iffy" on it when I first picked it up, but you surely won't be disappointed!
