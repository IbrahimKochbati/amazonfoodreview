I drink another low acid coffee so when this showed up on Vine I requested a sample.  I got a 3 oz bag and made 2 small pots of coffee.  I found the taste to be bold.  It reminded me of Starbucks Dark Roast.  There was not an aftertaste.  The coffee was smooth and did not cause me any trouble.  If you like dark roast and have trouble with coffee this is a good coffee to try.  The price is in line with other coffee of the same type and is cheaper than some.
