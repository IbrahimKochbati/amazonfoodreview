I was worried about it before I served it to my 12 month old... but after a tentative first session (there is a pretty strong salmon smell, and he seems opposed to strong scents), he's since eaten this package w o problem, and finishes it every time!  We're pretty pleased with this meal   great texture and I feel good that he's getting some salmon in his diet.  We had one instance of diarrhea after eating this for lunch, but since it only happened once, I'm not 100% sure that it was because of the salmon package, but definitely I keep an eye for now.  It might have been one bad package in the stack... so it's still probably advisable to not serve this if you're going to be away from home :).
