Lipton loose leaf tea beats any other tea I've tried, hands down. When the local groceries stopped stocking Lipton's Loose Leaf Tea. I assumed Lipton had stopped selling it because tea bags were more profitable, and people found it easier to use tea bags. WRONG, we've been sold on the idea of convenience, and taste took the back seat. This tea is packaged in a foil lined package, is fresher tasting and very consistant in quailty. Make it sweet or unsweet, it does not matter. If you make it too strong, just add water, the flavor is there!  You will be amazed as to how many GALLONS of tea you can make with one box.  You will need to  ew it a few times to figure out your formula. It's worth the time!  I live in an area that has very soft water, so I don't need as much product to  ew a gallon. It definitely takes more if you have hard water.     This is how I  ew mine (this may help you get started). Using a Mr. Coffee,(12 cup) Measure 3 Tablespoons (slightly rounded) and place in the filter (just as you would coffee) Fill you crafte to the max, and  ew. For sweet tea, I use One and 1 4 cup sugar per gallon. It's  easier to put the sugar in a gallon pitcher, then add the hot liquid. The sugar will dissolve completely, and you won't need as much sugar. When the sugar has dissolved, add water or ice to  ing it up to a gallon. If you are not pleased with the outcome try making some adjustments. Once you figure it out. It becomes routine, and is probably one of the the most economial drinks you can make!     ENJOY!!          PS I keep mine in the freezer in a ziplock, after I've opened the box.
