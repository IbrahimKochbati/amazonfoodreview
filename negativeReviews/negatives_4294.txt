When my local grocery store stopped carrying my favorite avacado oil I started a search for a new favorite. I typically use it to make homemade mayo so I prefer a mild creamy flavor. This is far from mild or creamy. It gave my mayo a pungent almost bitter taste the was more like olive oil than avocado oil. In the past, quality oils have turned my mayo slightly greeninsh, this stuff turned it an odd  ight yellow which does make me doubt the quality of the product.
