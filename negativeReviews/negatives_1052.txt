Decaffeinated coffee is for most an oxymoron, for others an afterthought. It possesses few spots on grocery shelves and has shared little in the "gourmet" coffee line which changed how people accept this ancient drink into their lives. Comedian Bob Irwin even compared the blend to "kissing your sister." The day's first cup comes with a sense of entitlement; subsequent cups transition through the day (work, afternoon, dessert), while wanting both coffee's jolt and cozy sociability. (Instant? Don't get me started!)     That's why this new Melitta Riviera Sunset gourmet coffee is a pleasant surprise. It carries a full, almost nutty flavor without the bitter bite of the coffee which, for many, defines their image of coffee and its lifestyle. (This isn't surprising since Melitta's ad copy references the  eezy feel of European cafes, a far cry from the irked lines at the morning coffee shop.)     No less than Henry Ward Beecher once said. "No coffee can be good in the mouth that does not first send a sweet offering of odor to the nostrils."  Riviera Sunset invites with its scent upon opening and doesn't disappoint when poured.(Hold to the preparation instructions; yours truly made one cup a little too strong and it came across a bit acidic.) Its taste, not its caffeine jolt, is your wake up call. Recommended as a tastier, if somwhat pricier, alternative to major  ands.
