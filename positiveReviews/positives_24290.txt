Like many others, I've been so addicted to Dunkin Donuts' Vanilla Chai. DD's Vanilla Chai is so incredibly delicious, it's almost too good to be true. I realized I have been spending a lot of money at DD for their Vanilla chai, and started to search online to see if there's anything that's as good. I found this, Big Train Vanilla Chai. It is good. It's very good. It doesn't taste exactly DD's, but it's pretty close. I make it with half water and half milk, it's amazing on a cold morning. I'd recommend it to everyone that also likes DD's Vanilla Chai. Although, I still miss DD's Vanilla Chai, for it's rich froth and creamier taste.
