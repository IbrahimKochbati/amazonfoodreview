Our Pomeranian LOVES Greenies, But I Was Getting Really Tired Of Spending Almost 50 Dollars A Pack At The Local Pet Store, So I Decided To Check On Amazon. I Spent A Lot Of Time Checking Prices From All The Different Sellers And Found That These Ones Were The Cheapest. I Ended Up Getting 2 Boxes For The Same Price That I Would Have Paid For 1 Box At The Pet Store.     The Package Arrived Very Quickly & We Even Recieved A Free Sample Size Bag Of Dog Food, Which Was An Unexpected Bonus. The Only Issue I Had Was I Feel They Could Have Put Everything In A Smaller Shipping Box. Other Then That We Are Extremely Satisfied & So Is Our Sweet Little Pom. Thank You Amazon!
