O.N.E. Coconut Water tastes much better, IMO, than sports drinks and electrolyte drinks sold in pharmacies.  I didn't really taste the coconut flavor or Pink Guava for that matter.  It has a light, not to sweet, flavor with electrolytes you need to replace if you've been sick or after exercise. The price is not to expensive and I like the single serve containers as most electrolyte solutions have a short shelf life after opening.  Coconut water is good and good for you.
