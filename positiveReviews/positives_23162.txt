I have been searching for a good tasting wheat free  ead mix since I found out I cannot have wheat. This is by far the BEST that I have tried. And you can make it in your  ead maker. I also cannot have dairy or eggs, so I use Ener G Egg Replacer (about 2 3 eggs worth) and it works great! My friends and family who can eat regular  ead prefer Pamela's over any  ead that has wheat in it!
