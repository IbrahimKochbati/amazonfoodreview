If you are looking for something to substitute for pasta this ain't it. These are great for asian dishes like noodle soup, stir fry etc. We love them and a side benefit is they are good for you. If you want a wheat pasta substitute try the rice pasta (not the asian rice noodles), just do not over cook them.
