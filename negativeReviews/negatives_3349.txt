I have a chihuahua and while he did take this and try to eat it, it was just too big for his little mouth.  The treats are too hard to  eak into pieces and he wasn't all that interested enough to chew the bigger pieces.  Though I will have to say my dog has never been the dog biscuit type so that could be part of the reason he didn't enjoy it.  It's a good quality product made from great ingredients, but not every dog is going to like it obviously.
