The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips. The bags are very strong   much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right. Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion, some are cooked more than others, which gives it a more authentic, non manufactured feel. Some people may not like that.          I reccomend them!
