I obtained a sample and when I opened the package the aroma was not inviting at all.  Well, I  ewed it up anyway on a regular Cuisinart coffee maker and used the sample bag with enough water for 2 3 cups to make a stronger cup of coffee. Nevertheless, it tasted weak to me and didn't smell any better after  ewing it. It was drinkable and ok, just not very satisfying to me as it didn't have a richness or depth or good aroma to it. Admittedly, I am not a big French Roast fan as it tends to taste bitter to me and acidic.  This one may be better than other French Roast because while I thought it tasted weak and bitter it presumably is lower acid. If you need a low acid coffee, then this is okay, but if not you may not find this satisfying, especially if you like dark, full flavored strong coffee.
