We started our son on solids when he was six months. The first "food" we introduced was rice cereal as recommended by our pediatrician. We tried every day for 2 weeks to feed my son rice cereal and then oatmeal cereal but he hated both! He'd refuse the food by turning away and keeping his mouth tightly shut. I was at my wits end and gave him a  eak because I knew I had to be patient. I was never a huge fan of the idea of feeding my son rice cereal so I went searching for something that was convenient and came in small portions. I didn't want to feed my son the traditional baby food from a jar due to the risk of BPA found in the jar lids. Luckily, I found NurturMe! My son loved it from the start.  We started with the peas and then worked our way through the apple, squash, and sweet potato.          Here is what I love about NuturMe Baby Food:          CONVENIENCE. The food comes in BPA FREE paper pouches that are easy to travel with. They contain the same amount of food as a 2.5oz jar of baby food. When we first started my son on solids he ate 1 2 pouch at each feeding. We saved the rest in the fridge and fed the the rest at his second feeding. It states on the packaging that they can last 2 3 days refrigerated. I personally only trust 24 hours if prepared with formula and 2 3 days if made with water. This is because it states on the formula can that prepared formula should be discarded after 24 hours. If I still  eastfed, I would trust  eastmilk to last 2 3 days as well.          TASTE. Although the food is quick dried, it tastes fresh! The peas actually taste like peas and they are actually  ight green, like they should be. I've tried the foods myself before I first fed them to my son and they passed my taste test! I also love that the baby food is organic. This is very important to me that everything my son eats is free of pesticides. I am conscious about what I eat, it shouldn't be any different for my son.          MIX & MATCH. I love that you can mix and match the baby foods together to make new flavor profiles for the baby. I am all about introducing new foods to my baby and this is the perfect way to do it! Another great idea is to add juice to the baby food once your baby is 8+ months. When my son gets older I am going to try out adding pomegranate juice to the apple variety. I don't plan of giving my son juice to drink so this is a great way to introduce him to the flavor of pomegranate.          ECO FRIENDLY. The packaging to completely recyclable and doesn't take of the space that canned baby food does. That means a smaller carbon footprint! In addition, the packaging is BPA FREE. I emailed the company and asked them before I purchased the product on Amazon.          Here is the only issue I have with NurturMe:          CONSISTENCY. I noticed that it can be difficult to mix the baby food together to get the desired consistency. For instance, the apple was really clumpy and hard before I added the water and I had a difficult time getting all of the clumps out. Its similar to mixing formula    you have to take extra care! My remedy for this was to use a handheld milk frother and from then on I got the perfect consistency with no clumps! I've also noticed that the peas have a little bit of a grainy texture but my son doesn't seem to mind.          I am definitely happy with NuturMe baby food. I think it is a quick and convenient way to serve my baby organic baby food for when we are on the go! It is the best alternative I have found to homemade baby food.
