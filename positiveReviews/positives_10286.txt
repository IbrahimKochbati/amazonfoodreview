I buy a huge bag of Costco Limes for Mojito's and unless I have a party, I usually don't make it through the bag before the limes go bad.  I bought this to squeeze the limes into and then freeze so that I would be able to have a nice mojito even when I don't have any fresh limes.  It works perfectly for that.  It is super cute and I love it!
