The condensed mincemeat is the only way to make a mincemeat pie! The results are far better than the jar type of mince filling. For some reason,the condensed mincemeat is getting harder and harder to find. It's my family's favorite Thanksgiving and Christmas pie, and I hope we won't be disappointed this year.
