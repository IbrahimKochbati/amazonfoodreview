I have been buying these for my dog for a few years.  She has had excellent dental     checkups and no gum disease. I highly recommend this product.  It is rather pricey but it still beats getting a dental cleaning from the vet. The only issue I have with them is that the size of the chews are not uniform    most are of the expected size but some are not really extra large.
