After doing a TON of research and reading about Civet coffee  I finally  oke down and purchased this for my birthday, just to give it a shot. At first, I was not impressed  thinking that I just overpaid for some upgraded Folgers  but then I figured it out. The secret to this coffee is making it in smaller batches  At first I was making 4 5 cups at a time in my small coffee pot  then I cut that back to a two cup using approx. 3 tablespoons of freshly ground coffee  It was AMAZING!!! The depth and natural sweetness of this coffee were unbelievable. Definitely something worth trying at least once  I for one will be looking forward to the next time I can justify purchasing this special occasion coffee...
