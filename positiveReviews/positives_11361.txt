These cookies are excellent in flavor and texture. They are the best wheat free, gluten free and non dairy cookies I have tried. My son is on a very restrictive diet and is a picky eater. He just yums up these cookies. I often have to battle him to eat something else because he wants his cookies. These are the only cookies of this type he will eat. I don't know much about the other flavors but this flavor of cookie is tops.          The only complaint I have is that Amazon will not package them correctly. They will not cushion the bottom of the box and so a lot of cookies are  oken upon arrival. I have E Mailed a complaint but have not heard anything. Hopefully my next shipment will be packaged correctly.
