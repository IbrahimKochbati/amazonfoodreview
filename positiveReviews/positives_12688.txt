I have never tasted anything so delicious in my life!  I had always thought that maple cream cookies were the best thing to happen to planet earth, until I tried these.  My Christmas present to myself this year: a box of these cookies and a canister of honey roasted macadamia nuts.  I think my  ains will explode, lol
