I ordered this coffee for my daughter to try. She's a second year med student and has had some Gerd and Lerp problems. Coffee was something that she's always liked but had to give up because of acid reflux. Although the Amazon Vine offer clearly said that they would send ten 3 ounce bags, only one bag was delivered. I emailed back and asked them to send the correct order.  Lo and behold, they once again sent one bag. I contacted them one more time to explain that there must be a coding problem in their system but this time I wasn't favored with a response. In the hundreds of orders that I've processed through Amazon over the years, this is the first time that Amazon has made a shipping mistake and not cleared it up.          So both my daughter and I tried a cup. Neither one of us had any acid reaction    but neither one of us would have ordered it again based on the taste. We both like a stronger and bolder cup of coffee and this one was weak with some sort of strange after taste. Not exactly our cup of tea. Keep trying though, a lot of people with acid reflux are looking for a great cup of coffee.
