not having a lot of choices in puppy food at the local store, i was glad they had Cesar.  Toy Fox Terrier puppies have a very sensitive digestive system and mouth teeth.  this is good quality and texture.  also at a small 3.5 oz. container, it's the perfect amount.  no leftover or waste.  this is perfect for small  eeds and they love it.  mixes well with dry food too.
