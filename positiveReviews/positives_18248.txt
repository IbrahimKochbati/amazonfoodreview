For those who have never tried Popchips before, they are not exactly a normal potato chip.  Popchips are air popped rather than fried.  They have a sort of puffy physical trait and kind of remind me of the Munchos chips I used to eat as a kid.  You still get the crunchy feeling of a chip, but they are just "different" than a regular potato chip.          As a huge fan of barbecue Popchips, I was very anxious to try the Chili Lime flavor.  After the first few chips I ate, I didn't think there was much kick to it.  However, it seems like the more you eat, the spicier they get.  I didn't neccesarily taste the lime in it.  I would personally prefer a little sweetness to the chili flavor, which it didn't have, so maybe that's where the lime falls in.  Overall, these chips have a lot of flavor and are decently spicy.  They are now my 2nd favorite Popchips flavor behind the barbecue.  So, if you like a little spice in your chips, definitely try the chili lime variety.
