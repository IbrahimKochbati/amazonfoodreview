I was so excited to treat my 3 kitties to "People Food for Cats" ~ Petite Cuisine!!  They eat dry food daily and then once in awhile they get the moist food as a special treat.          In opening the can, there was not the overwhelming ucky fishy smell that most moist cat foods have.  And it looked like people food too!  I portioned out on one plate 3 equal helpings and called in the calvary!          As they licked, the plate rotated on the floor ...ha ha!!... and so did they!!  They followed their portion around like it was the last thing they were ever gonna get to eat!          The response ... a resounding purrrrr and then paw licking face cleaning!  They loved it!  And that was just the  Steamed Tuna & Sole Entree!!          Each day after they got a new flavor, Yellow Fin Tuna, Red Snapper, and Steamed Tuna and Shrimp ... responses were all the same! 2 paws straight up from my kitties!!          Highly recommended for humans owned by cats everywhere!!       1smileycat : )
