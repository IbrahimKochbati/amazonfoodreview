Not only does Tetley Tea come in cut little drawstring pouches, but it     is rich and tasty without being the least bit bitter. I enjoy all of     these flavors. What is better than sitting down with a nice cop of tea     and a book, I ask you?          My daughter started sending me Tetley tea bags some time ago, and it     has been one of my favorites since.
