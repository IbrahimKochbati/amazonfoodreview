These are positively the most delicious cookies ever  smooth milk chocolate covering meringue biscuits.  However, when we received them  albeit in the Texas summer  they were fused together in the packaging. They are now not only less attractive, but also hard to eat.  So I would not recommend ordering these in the summer with the way they are packaged by Amazon.
