We had eaten regular Cheez It crackers in our family for years, but once the White Cheddar flavor came out and we tried it, we never went back to anything else. My wife and I go through a box or two each week. These crackers are absolutely delicious and have a strong cheddar taste. They are also more filling than other snack foods, and each cracker is low enough in calories so that you can eat quite a few without worrying about gaining weight.          Although these have somewhat more fat than the reduced fat version, I think that these taste much better. Also the fat in the regular version is still relatively low compared to other snack foods like potato chips.          Bottom line: Very tasty snack. I eat it almost daily and recommend it.          I have signed up for subscribe and save to get this delivered monthly, which lowers the cost 15% to less than $2.50 box and is cheaper than I can buy these in my local supermarket even on sale.
