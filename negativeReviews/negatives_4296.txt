I got this based on the all the positive reviews and was so excited to try this out since I love avocados.  The day I got this, I poured some in a small dish and tried using it as a dipping oil with  ead.  I normally use olive oil and love it but love trying new things and was looking forward to this since others said the taste was great.  Well I personally did not like it all as a dipping oil.  I could not get past the first bite of  ead and immediately dumped it and got the olive oil.  I've used it in saut&eacute;ing dishes and it is fine for that purpose.  I don't fry food at home so I've never used this other than in regular cooking.  THis is a decent oil if you are in the search for different products to try but I personally prefer olive oil for dipping and cooking and prefer walnut oil for salad dressings.  This is decent but I probably wouldn't buy it again.
