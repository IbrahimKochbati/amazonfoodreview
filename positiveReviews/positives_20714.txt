I have purchased another soy based chocolate power product (ASIN: B000HCX5RQ), and that other one wasn't as good as this Naturade Total Soy.  We have this just about every morning in smoothies (1 1 2 scoops, 8 12 frozen strawberries, 1 TBS chocolate cocoa mix, 3 cups milk, 2 bananas).  Although my recipe may not be the healthiest, it tastes great.  I have also tried the French Vanilla Total Soy as well, but we love chocolate too much to switch.          Also with respect to the other  and mentioned, I had to use 3x as much cocoa to cover up the after taste.  This Naturade version has a very slight after taste   probably due to the soy   but it's better than using pure cocoa!          Update: All Star Health is very very fast.  I reordered it on 9 10 and received the very next day.  It wasn't expected to arrive until 9 16.  I will order from them again.  It's too bad this item from them is not on the subscription program.
