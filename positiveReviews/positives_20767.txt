Its a great tasting tea with subtle hint of many spices. Tea tastes great with milk or without.Also works great for vegans who want to drink strong tea without milk. Surprisingly Spiced Chai is not always available in all leading grocery stores and if you do find one then you may not always find it in stock. it was great to find a bulk pack available from trusted Amazon so we did not have to worry about looking for it or missing it!
