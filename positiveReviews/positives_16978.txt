I have had this toy for three months. My big dog loves plastic bottles and will assume every water bottle is meant for her so I was curious about how this toy would go over. It was a definite hit!  She loves it and ever after the beagle has tried to destroy it you can hardly see a mark on it!  At least as far as dogs are concerned I think this might be indestructible.
