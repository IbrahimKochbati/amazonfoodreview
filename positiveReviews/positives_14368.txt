Our older dog, Broccoli, has been quietly aging.  Sleeping on the couch instead of the bed, not jumping up, rarely playing...it all started so gradually we didn't really notice until he was virtually sleeping all day.  His hips were so stiff when he walked, his gate stilted and he never ran anymore.          A friend and I were talking about his decreased mobility a few weeks ago and she recommended we try glucosamine and chondroitin, so we purchased Zuke's Hip Action (beef.)  After two weeks of feeding him a double dose, we've noticed a HUGE change.  While some stiffness in his hips is still evident, he's been running around, jumping on the bed, jumping up on his back legs and playing much more often and for longer periods of time.  Where he would once play for a few seconds and then lie down, he's now begging to play and run around.  I can't wait to see his progress in a month.  We plan to reduce the amount to the one treat a day (recommended for his size) after 6 weeks, per recommendations I've read online.  We're also giving a treat to our new puppy every day to ward off any future problems and keep his joints healthy (he's a greyhound mix with really long legs, so we're concerned about the various bone joint problems that he could be prone to.)          As far as taste, both dogs LOVE these treats, more than any other we've tried in fact.  We'll be giving Zuke's as a daily supplement from now on, as we're firm believers in the benefits of them.  I'm so glad to see my old friend acting like a puppy again.  Thank you Zuke's!
