I purchased these on a whim, and after researching for other disposable products. I have the single mesh filter plastic re usable one, but the "convenience" factor of a disposable is not there. you have to then clean it and all that mess. with this product, simply pop a filter (included_ into the cup, (included) fill it with 1 2tsp of your own blend, or folgers starbucks, anything. and use the included cup holder to pop a lid on (which are also included) I bought 50 and am now so happy with these I'm ordering 200 more. why?? because for the 12 15$ you spend on these cups you can make 50 coffee's  if you have some regular coffee in your fridge, use that. you can even say a bag of starbucks  eakfast blend ground is around 10.00, so your at 22.00 , thats only 2 boxes of 12 Kcups coffee's and you can fill 75 100 on a single 1lb bag, a 1.5lb tub of folgers can fill about 400 of these refills for 9.00 for the tub  so go for it, you won't regret it...          one thing i want to point out is the included filters DO hang out the edges a bit, nothing wrong, it just adds to the seal, and depending on your  ewers strength you can see "seepage" AFTER  ewing a cup, but who cares, they are disposable. if you are a total cheap wad you can pop the lids off and use the cups again if you don't mind a whole in the bottom from where the  ewer pops it. but your Freshness won't last with a re used cup.  Hope this review helps!!! thanks!
