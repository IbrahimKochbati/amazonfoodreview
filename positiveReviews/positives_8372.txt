This stuff is pretty dang hot.  It doesn't have the best flavor, but that is understandable for sauce that comes with a dropper.  Best used for spicing up a pot of beans and rice or chili.  So if you want to try this stuff on a chip or something you better have a half hour or so to deal with the burn...its intense!
