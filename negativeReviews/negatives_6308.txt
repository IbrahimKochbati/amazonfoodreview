I was buying Mastic supplements for my stomach and came across this gum; it said it was a product of Lebanon so I was intrigued but when the gum arrived, the box says it's from Jordan. Also, it doesn't actually say it's got real mastic in it   the words natural identical flavor (mastic)does not convince me it actually has mastic in it... plus, the glucose and stuff has me suspicious that it's not really healthful...but the taste is good enough to chew, different, interesting and I will chew it daily to see if it helps me...still, I'm very disappointed that it's not from Lebanon. I love Lebanon.
