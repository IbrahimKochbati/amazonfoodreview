I am always a bit hesitant to give my dog new treats   as many are filled with fattening and bad ingredients.  These appear to be all natural, with the following ingredients:          Organic Barley     Organic Lamb     Organic Carrots     Organic Apples     Organic Palm Oil     Organic Molasses          They are large treats with a nice consistency, and my dog loves them, so it is a win   win: healthy treats she loves.
