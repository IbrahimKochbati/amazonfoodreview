I have to agree with the other reviewers here.  I recently bought the Keurig model B77 at Costco.  And when I tried the Caribou Blend, I found myself sitting on the couch, sipping this nectar, and literally saying out loud to no one in particular, "Man, this is good coffee."  I like mine with about a third of a teaspoon of Splenda.  I'm definitely buying more.
