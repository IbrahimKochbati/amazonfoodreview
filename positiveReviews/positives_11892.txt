My dog loves these treats. He's really picking with his treats so it says a lot that he loves these. I had been buying him bags of the freeze dried treats at petco, etc. and it was costing a fortune, not to mention they were smashed. These are great quality. You get tons!! in the 14 ounce bucket and my little dog is in love.
