This pesto paste is so incredibly convenient, tasty, and versatile. As someone who suffers from dairy sensitivity, I was enthused to find a GOOD VEGAN pesto product! This is coming from someone who is an authentic Italian who grew up on homemade goods. Maybe the previous users who disliked it weren't using good, quality olive oil? Just a thought. It makes the sauce. It's SO MUCH better than cheese laden commercial crap...
