When in N.Y. visiting my sister she introduced me to amazon vanilla chi tea. We would have a cup every night before bed. It would be a relaxing time enjoying a good cup of tea and conversation. It is delivered to her door every couple months. Now I am back in Ks and have ordered it to be delivered on a regular schedule. Miss my sister and the conversation though.
