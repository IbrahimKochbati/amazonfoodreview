This is hands down one of the best coffees I have ever had. Not bitter, smooth, wonderful full body flavor and not acidic. I was surprised when I opened the can, the grind is very fine, finer than what I would consider using for a drip coffee pot. I just used less grounds to adjust for the fine grind. I think the Amazon price is high. I usually purchase this at my local grocery for $12.99 per can
