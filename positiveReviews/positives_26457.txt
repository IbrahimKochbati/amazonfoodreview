My dogs absolutely LOVE this product.  I wish they'd make this product in a knotted bone because these chews are easy to get stuck on the roof of their mouth and or once they get soft they are hard to  eak apart but easy to swallow whole.  As long as you can be around and throw them away once too soft it's a great product.
