Huge bags. I boil the flowers with cinnamon sticks and let it steep. Sweeten with Splenda, and have a concentrate. I only use a shot or two and then top with water and ice. Great healthy beverage. Cholesteral has lowered dramatically. I plan to use this seller again.          (might make a nice martini too!)
