I dont take it to lose weight, this is a laxative tea, as all the ones labeled "weight loss tea" .I'm very constipated and taking this tea everyday has helped me very much, with no cramps or other negative effects. It's strong and dont recommend it for ocassional constipation or for losing weight. Warning: when it works you "have" to go.
