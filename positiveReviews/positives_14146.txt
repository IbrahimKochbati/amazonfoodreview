I love these healthy dog treats. My dog has trouble with a lot of processed dog foods and treats. These are a great way to give her a little something extra when she's a good girl and not have to worry if she will get sick or have an allergic reaction. I will warn you, though, they often arrive  oken in pieces, even though they are packed fairly well. They are very delicate, crispy treats. I usually  eak them down into pieces anyway, so it isn't much of a drawback for me, but it may bother some of you.
