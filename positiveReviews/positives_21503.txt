Quaker Instant Oatmeal cooks up very quickly.  Add hot water and thats all.  Vary the amount of hot water to adjust the consistency.  I like the oatmeal a little thicker than "normal" so I put about a tablespoon less water into the mix.  It works great.  The consistency is the same time after time.  I really like the maple and  own sugar oatmeal.  It tastes great, and the smell is out of this world.  Just smelling the stuff makes me want to eat about 6 packets.  I normally put two packets into the mix because one is not enough quantity wise.  If you like oatmeal at all you will like this.          AD2
