Bitters go in and out of style.  They are only called for in a few drinks (or food dishes) but are just imperative for an Old Fashioned or Manhattan.  Bitters are certainly a matter of taste, but this  and is considered by many to be the gold standard.          The House of Angostura has a long and storied history, and a shortage of bottles a few years ago put their product in short supply, probably worsened by hoarding.  Angostura is back, with its famous oversized labels, but it is absent from most local shelves, so Amazon is a reliable source.          A bottle this size will last me a lifetime, and I just might mention it in my will.
