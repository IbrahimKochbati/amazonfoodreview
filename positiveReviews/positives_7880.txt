Campbell's Roadhouse.  Best microwavable chili on the market.  Used to be able to get it in local grocery stores, but haven't seen any there for a long time now.  Don't know why.  Glad to find it available on line.  Just the right amount of spices.  Lively flavor without trying to burn out your taste buds.  Only good Campbell's lean meat used.
