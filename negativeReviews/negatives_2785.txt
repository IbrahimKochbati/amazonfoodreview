I bought these in Mid July ('09) with 2 day delivery along with 4 other flavors.  This is my least favorite.  I still have the original bunch while I've finished the others and have re ordered them.  For some reason, there is an after taste that I really don't like with this flavor.  Wish I did like it.  I will keep getting the others through Subscribe and Save as long as they are available.  The others are great when I don't want to cook a full  eakfast or lunch. I do freeze and microwave them, then drink a cup of milk with them.  Very filling and satisfying.  I recommend the other flavors I've tried but not this one.  I've tried and like the Oatmeal and Raisin, the Banana Walnut,  the Chocolate Chunk, and the Apple and Caramel flavors.  YMMV
