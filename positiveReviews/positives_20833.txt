I've always had trouble getting my dogs to eat dry dog food.  I had ordered a small bag of the potato, chicken & blueberry just to keep on hand just in case.  Well, my dog got sick and would not eat his regular food.  We tried everything.  We opened the bag of First Mate, and he ate the whole bowl!  He's been eating it ever since, and I'm totally amazed.     It works!!!
