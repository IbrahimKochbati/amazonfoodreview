Hypoallergenic formula was necessary for our daughter's acid reflux.          We found out from a friend that most insurance companies will completely cover the cost of hypoallergenic formula, either by reimbursing you what you've spent on it, or if you get it as a prescription through your pediatrician. Ours did!          Many doctors don't know this, so they don't know to give a prescription for the formula. Call your insurance company today!
