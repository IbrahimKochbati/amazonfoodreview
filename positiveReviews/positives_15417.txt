I did a search on Amazon for Kettle reduced fat chips, hoping to find a good deal on Kettle  and chips.  I stumbled upon these Deep River reduced fat kettle chips, and liked the per bag price (works out to about $1.50 per bag, about half the price of a similarly sized bag of Kettle  and chips at my local grocery store).  I am so glad I ordered these.  I love the taste, and I love the texture, and never would have guessed they were reduced fat.  I particularly like the short list of ingredients: Potatoes, Sunflower or Corn oil, and Salt.  That's it.          I do wish Amazon would make it easy to find the nutritional information...so, here are the basics: 12 chip serving (28g) is 120 calories, 6g fat, 1g fiber.          I will definitely order these again.
