Please be aware that although dogs absolutely LOVE these treats, that they may have caused a recent unexplainable illness in our 9 month old Mastiff pup. He was getting 1 or 2 a day of these chicken jerky's for about a week and then suddenly became very lethargic, along with vomiting, diarrhea, and had no appetite "except" he would eat only these treats and drink water. Vet thinks he'll recover OK, but advised us to stop feeding them to our dogs. These are still "Made in China" and in 2007 reports had shown that dogs were getting sick from these and other  ands, and there are still reported cases today. Just be careful and watch your pets closely if you are feeding them these. We will no longer feed these to any of our dogs, ever. Wish Dogswell would manufacturer these in the USA again.
