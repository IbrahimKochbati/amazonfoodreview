An Amazon Vines review of the Newman's New Zealand Lamb and Barley Organic dog treats. The product arrived timely and well packaged. I received one 10oz. re sealable pouch.  Newman's states that the product is organic, which Newman's say means the production systems seek to provide food and fiber products of the highest quality. The treats are rectangular dog biscuits, that are about 1 inch by 2 inches.  Each biscuit is scored in the middle so it is easy to  eak the biscuit into two pieces.          The package listed the ingredients as: Organic barley, Organic lamb, Organic carrots, Organic apples, Organic palm oil, and Organic molasses.          Newman's claims that the dog biscuits do not contain poultry by products, chemical fertilizers, antibiotics, chemical additives or artificial preservatives, no wheat or corn, and no artificial flavors. The biscuits had a pleasant smell and looked like quality dog biscuits.  But of course, the real test was, would the dogs like them. Well, the dogs devoured each biscuit I gave them and I think they would have easily eaten the entire bag at one time if I let them!          This seems like a good quality product, which my dogs greatly enjoyed so I give Newman's New Zealand Lamb and Barley organic dog treats a 5 star rating.
