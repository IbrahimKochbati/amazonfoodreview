When my toy poodle finishes her dog food she comes to me and barks and barks for her treat, GREENIES.She will not stop barking till she gets it.  I make sure she has eaten her dog food then she gets her GREENIE. It is the highlight of her day,and she is the happiest dog. Her teeth are very white and she has the sweetest smelling  eath.I make sure I am never out of GREENIES.The price is the greatest too.Thank you.D D
