After having not so good results with taking Airborne to prevent catching colds and flus, I started taking Emergen C. Each time during the past 2 years when a family member has caught something, I immediately started taking Emergen C and have successfully not caught anything they had.          Before, I managed to always get at least one cold or flu each season. But since I started taking Emergen C, I have not suffered from any. It works great, and since it comes in so many flavors, it's easy to find a flavor that's right for you.
