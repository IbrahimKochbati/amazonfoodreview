I bought the 6 pack of these mixes and was really excited that they turned out so well in my  ead machine.  The  ead tastes amazing, but about 2 hours later the problems start.  Myself and everyone who has tried it has developed severe bloating and gas that lasts about 12 hours.  I think it may be from the sorghum flour, as I don't have any intolerances to eggs, milk, etc and neither do my family members.  I also tried making the pizza crust, which also tastes very good, but results in the same effects.
