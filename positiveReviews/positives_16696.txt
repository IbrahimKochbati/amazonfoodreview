All my dogs have absolutely loved Greenies, though my latest little guy tends to gain weight in the winter, hence Greenies Lite!  This is the treat that my dogs will literally DANCE for, so when I can find these tubs for a great price, I grab them!  They really do prevent stinky  eath and keep his six year old doggy teeth looking good.  This was a "home run" hit under the Christmas tree!
