I'm kind of a popcorn fiend (I routinely walk into theaters just to buy popcorn and walk out without bothering to see a movie), but I hate hate HATE microwavable popcorn.  My wife bought me the Great Northern Little Bambino tabletop popcorn machine for Christmas, and I ordered the 24 pack of Great Northern popcorn packs because they were compatible with the machine and had consistently good reviews.          We decided to take the popcorn machine for a test run during our NYE party, and the popcorn was, without a doubt, some of the best I've ever had.  It was just the right combination of salty, buttery and fresh, and it was a cinch to make.  Everyone at the party loved the stuff (we went through half the box), and I find myself craving some now as I write this review...          In short, I enthusiastically and wholeheartedly recommend this popcorn.
