Wow, I remember when I ordered this back in January, the order came to my doorstep the next day!! I was so surprised! My boyfriend and I love this tea to death. It has a smooth, sweet taste to it and its fragrance is beautiful. This makes a wonderful, refreshing iced tea that's perfect for hanging out on sunny afternoons. It's a shame that it's a bit pricey both in cost and shipping.
