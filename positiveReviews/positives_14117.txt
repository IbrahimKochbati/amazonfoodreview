This food saved my sanity and my dog! after trying dozens of holistic foods and countless vet bills I have finally found the one dog food that doesn't give my dog projectile diarrhea!!  and after a lot of experimenting I believe its the legumes because I have try several other grain free limited ingredient forms from NB and this is the only one that works I still mix it with pumpkin because it is the only thing that has given him solid stool, but this food is so good I'm going to try it with out the pumpkin! PS I have four dogs and they are all thriving on it!!!!
