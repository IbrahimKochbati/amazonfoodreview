Being a peanut butter lover, have to keep it out of my house or it disappears way too fast.  So when I found powdered peanut butter (with more than half the fat removed, but with the same peanutty taste), I was in heaven.          Now I can mix it with my yogurt and or ice cream; make my peanut butter pie and don't feel quite as guilty while totally enjoying the flavor.          And ... so does my daughter in law who is a big fan of peanut butter also.          So for all those peanut butter lovers out there, I highly recommend the Powdered Peanut Butter!!!
