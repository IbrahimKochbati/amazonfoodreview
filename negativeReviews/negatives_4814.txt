I love these biscuits with tea in the morning and haven't been able to find them anywhere locally. I was delighted to find them available at Amazon and after reading a few reviews that sounded as if the packing problems had been taken care of, I ordered a box of 6 packages. The biscuits are great, the packing...not so much. All six packs were stuffed into a small plastic bag which was crammed into a bubble bag which was wrapped in bubble wrap and placed into a box with air pacs stuffed around it. Four packs are mostly crumbs, the other two had a lot of  eakage on the ends. I think they might have been ok if they hadn't forced them into the too small bag and bubble bag in their zeal to over protect. Maybe carefully wrapping each pac individually in bubblewrap and placing them in the center of a box of air pacs would get them delivered in one piece, but I doubt that will happen so will not bother to order them from Amazon again...
