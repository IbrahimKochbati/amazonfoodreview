I also ordered a flat of food (they were on sale) that contained The Turkey and Wild Rice Dinner.  One of them was also improperly sealed; the lid popped.  We were lucky because I just happened to check that one.  Now I'm so paranoid that I check all of them several times.  I called Earth's Best and they assured me that they haven't had this problem before and that I shouldn't worry about it.  I'm so suprised that this got passed QA QC inspection at a baby food manufacturer.  Why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety?!
