The coffee at my office is so bad   I didn't know a coffeemaker could output such disgusting sludge.  2 pumps of the Coffee Mate concentrate and it is a totally different story.  I was initially skeptical about the no refrigeration, but it stayed fresh through the 6 weeks it took me to go through one bottle (although what that means for the additives in it I don't want to think).  I'm able to lock this away from my thieving co workers and look like the hero when I do share.  With the 2 pack it takes a while to run out, so sharing and keeping my hero status is easy.          A word of warning   it does not travel well once you insert the pump.  We moved offices mid bottle and I could not get the pump to lock.  In the move some concentrate leaked out of the pump, but not a big deal if you're not planning on moving around a lot with the bottle.
