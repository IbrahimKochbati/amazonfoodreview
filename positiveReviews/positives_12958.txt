I was really pleasantly surprised with this drink. It's made from 100 percent fruit juices with no added sugar... and still tastes great. I was surprised that it does actually use the juices that describes the flavor. For example, this product actually contains real Kiwi and a blend of different berry juices. It's kind of a rare thing these days (since everything uses artificial flavors and sweeteners now)          The only negative thing I can think of to say is that the bottles are too small.. only 8.3 ounces.  I wish they were at least... 10 ounces (preferably 12 :)
