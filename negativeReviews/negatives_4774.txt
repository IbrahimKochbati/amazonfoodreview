I was definitely expecting something fabulous by the way Oprah and her guests spoke about this product.          It was tasty, but by no means the dessert to end all desserts.  My husband, who is the real chocolate lover in our family, just shrugged and said it was okay.          Oh well, it was worth a try.  I'm just glad I didn't buy a 5 pack of the product.
