My cat had a severe allergic reaction from this food resulting in deep, crusty, oozing, lesions on his face around his mouth, up to his ears, and down to his neck. On close examination of the ingredients, one unusual additive is sunflower seed oil in this and other Fussie Cat flavors. He's back on his old food and healing nicely. I'll stick with the less expensive  ands and save on vet bills from now on.
