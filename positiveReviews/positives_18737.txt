This is like a pre mix with herbs, flour and  ead crumbs. It's the same instruction as making your own mix, except that the mix is already done.          Dump the mix in a ziploc bag. Then put one chicken into the bag. Shake it up and down a few times until the meat is all coated. It's very easy. Then just put it in the oven. Viola.          It's pretty delicious!! The convenience is really what makes it great. This is good for busy people or busy moms during the week.
