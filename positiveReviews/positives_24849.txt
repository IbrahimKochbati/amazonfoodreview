I love this tea! I start drinking it at the first sign of infection, and it WORKS!!! I love the taste, especially with a little bit of honey! I recommend it to anyone wanting to boost their immune system in a natural way. The Yogi Teas have a strong taste, but that's exactly how I like it. I keep at least 4 boxes on hand at all times.
