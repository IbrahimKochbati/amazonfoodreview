My wife and I ordered this product for her bosses birthday.  We received it quickly, but we did pay extra for the shipping, but we were in a hurry.  The product we received was in perfect condition and Absolutely Beautiful!  I hardly ever write reviews, but this one was worth the time.  I love Bonsai trees and will definitely buy another one just like this for myself in the near future.  This is a product that can be admired for many years to come.
