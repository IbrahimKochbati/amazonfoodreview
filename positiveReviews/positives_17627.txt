I just got a sample [3 ounce bag] of this "Dark French Roast" via mail    and  ewed it immediately via Gevalia drip machine to full European expresso concentration. It indeed has the rich deep dark chocolate aspect of a traditional Dark French Roast    but not bitter [beyond the strong dark roast aspect] and indeed no notable acidic aspect. As for drinking modes    I tried it hot and black by itself [not at all my usual way]    hot with  own sugar and a little cream    then cold with lots of cream and ice    and finally with real French vanilla added to that, for a full French Latte. It was good all these ways    rich and mellow. I do not have acid problems    BUT am more of an English or Irish tea drinker    SO a bit suspicious [and picky] as for coffee variants. This "Puroast Low Acid Coffee" variant is indeed way okay +++
