Anyone shopping for chives in the grocery store knows how expensive chives are. I'm almost surprised restaurants don't charge extra for them. These chives are a "steal" compared to the grocery, and taste as good as McCormick's at probably a 1 4 of the price. Also the shipping was very fast. I would buy again without a doubt.
