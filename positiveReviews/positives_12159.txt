Buying K Cups appears to take more math & literacy skills than most people seem to have.  People keep comparing the price of different boxes without accounting for the cup count.  The trick is to comparison shop the price per Kcup because the boxes vary from 18 count boxes to 24 count boxes...eight more cups makes a difference.  This a a fair deal in my opinion since you get two 24 count boxes, and it is shipped to your door.
