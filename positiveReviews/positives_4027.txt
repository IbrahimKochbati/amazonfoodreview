I found this mix at the Ft Myer Commissary.  I looked for this product last time I visited the commissary and could not find it.  So here I am online looking and found it here.  I could eat this all day.  I've tried several different snack mixes, but most have too many pretzels.  This has a very nice balance of flavors and textures    and not a lot of pretzels.  I'm stocking up!!
