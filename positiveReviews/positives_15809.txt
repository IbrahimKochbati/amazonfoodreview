I like every one of these syrups and the price is right. I really didn't want the raspberry but its very good. Served flavored cappuccinos to my Bible study group and they loved them too, especially the Irish Cream. My favorite is Hazelnut followed by Vanilla. Hard to find Torani where I live so, so I'm happy I can reorder on Amazon. There is no artificial sweetener aftertaste as long as you don't overdo it on the quantity you use per beverage. It's great in yogurt too!
