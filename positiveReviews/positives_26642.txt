When my pug reached 2 years old, he had one skin rash after another. My vet suggested that we put him on a limited ingredient diet that cut out corn and other grains and instead used potatoes as the carbohydrate source. Natural Balance LID Potato & Duck Formula worked quite well for us, but we could tell that our pug was looking for some variety so we tried their Sweet Potato and Venison formula.          According to the Natural Balance web site, some dogs develop sensitivities to commonly used proteins, carbohydrates, and food additives. This may cause stomach and intestinal problems, as well as skin irritations. In our dog's case, it was his red irritated skin on his belly that led us to try a limited ingredient diet. The Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Venison formula combines fresh venison, a source of animal protein that most dogs have not been exposed to, and sweet potato, premium quality carbohydrate rich in potassium and a highly digestible energy source. Other key ingredients include canola oil, low in saturated fat and high in monounsaturated fat, as well as an excellent source of Omega 3 and Omega 6 fatty acids, along with flaxseed, another quality source of Omega 3 fatty acids. The food is completely grain free (no barley, wheat, rice or corn) and contains no artificial colors or flavors.          The kibble is a small oval shaped disk. It's fairly flat and measures just a hair over half an inch wide. My pug is able to eat it easily, although in his case, he pretty much inhales his food and doesn't chew it much. It has a slight meaty smell, which I think he likes, as the Potato and Duck formula didn't seem to have much of an enticing scent.          My local specialty pet food store tells me this is #1 selling dog food. I can see why! Our pug continues to do well with this LID formula, just like he did with Potato & Duck. His skin shows no sign of redness and irritation, and just as importantly, it appears to agree well with his stomach. He doesn't get gassy and his stool is not loose or showing any other signs of intestinal distress. It also appears to keep his appetite under control as he doesn't beg for so many treats between meals and doesn't start asking for dinner so early as he did with some other foods in the past. If it keeps him happy and itch free, then we're happy, too. 5 stars.
