The tree I received in the kit is beautiful, although getting it into the pot was difficult as the roots were wrapped all around the inside of the grow pot. also the drainage hole in the bottom was either too big or the gravel was too small because the "drainage layer" was hard to get in, the gravel kept falling through the hole.
