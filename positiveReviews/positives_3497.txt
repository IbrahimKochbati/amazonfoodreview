I have been enjoying the Melitta coffee in the evening. It has a nice smooth taste with none of the burnt coffee bean taste of Starbucks. I used much more coffee than suggested in preparation though. I used 2 tablespoons to eight ounces of water. I like my coffee strong but not bitter and this worked for a very good cup of coffee with half and half added.I will be buying it again.
