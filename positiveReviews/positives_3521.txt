I remember the cool, modern Melitta drip coffee makers from decades ago. A visual delight of glass and wood (without a hint of plastic), they were elegantly ahead of their time. I wish I could say the same for their coffee. It's fine coffee. Good, actually. However, nothing really special. I would buy it again if priced right, but probably would not go out of my way to get it, and certainly not at a gourmet price point. I must be honest and say that with the Melitta name, I expected a little bit more. Maybe I just got a an "off" batch. Let's hope so.
