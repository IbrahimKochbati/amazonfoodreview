i ordered this on a whim because i love jerky, i love bbq, and Pounds of Jerky are usually around 20 25 bucks and I figured 2 bags of this  and of Jerky was a pretty sweet deal. I got barbecue and teriyaki.          Taste is great, it was very fresh and flavorful, and the jerky was the perfect tenderness.          I highly recommend this product. Well, the barbecue. Now the Teriyaki, that's another story. Very bland flavor, tasted like regular beef jerky that was thrown in some teriyaki sauce for a few minutes before packaging, definitely nowhere near the quality of the bbq. Same great tenderness though. I can't wait to try the other flavors. :D
