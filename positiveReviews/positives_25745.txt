I was skeptical about Walden Farms products when I first saw them, but a co worker raved about them so I decided to try a few. I picked up a bottle of the Thick and Spicy at my local grocery store but boy was I surprised when I tasted it. It was great! It has the rich sweet taste you expect in a BBQ sauce (thanks to Splenda) and packs quite a punch. The thick and Spicy is definetly for people who are a fan of spicey hot BBQ sauces.          I would definetly recommend this product to anyone who is following the low carb diet or is just watching your calories.          I don't often rate things 5 stars, but for zero calories and high on flavor and kick this deserves it.
