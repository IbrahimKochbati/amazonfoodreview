I have tried every  and of stevia on the market and this is, hands down, the very best out there.  I use Nu Naturals NuStevia for all sweetening purposes.  It can be hard to find even in health food stores and the ones that carry it usually charge a premium.  I was delighted to find it on amazon.com for a very reasonable price, even less when obtained through a standing order.
