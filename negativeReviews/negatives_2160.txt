If you like to taste the "flavor" in your flavored coffee, skip this one. I've struggled to taste the creme caramel flavoring that is supposed to be in here. The coffee flavor is also slightly bitter, but that could just be my taste buds longing for some flavoring! I'd recommend Green Mountain, Gloria Jeans or Van Houtte  ands before this one.
