I discovered Popchips when I was on a trip to Vegas.  I doubted I could find them when I got home and I was almost right.  I found a couple of stores that had them but only one flavor and the price was exhorbitant.  I was thrilled to find them on Amazon.  They are low fat, low calorie, and still delicious.  The single serve bags are ideal for lunch or to throw in the car when on a short trip.
