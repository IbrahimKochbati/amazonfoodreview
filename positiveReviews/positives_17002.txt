I received the first jug as a gift for my golden retriever (80 lb.), then bought a second one when I picked up a Wheaten terrier (30 lb). Both dogs enjoy working their  eakfast kibble out of the jug. The Wheaten will eat until full and the retriever, true to his nature, can't stop eating and playing. They are able to almost completely empty the jugs. Their size difference changes their strategies a bit but doesn't affect their ability to play.          When first introducing the toy to the dogs, I "primed" the jug by spilling out a couple high value treats mixed with kibble (later moving to only kibble). The rope knot inside the jug can also block the entrance, so I was careful to make sure that the knot was well inside the jug. And I made sure to fill the jug about 3 4 full because the jug can clog if it's totally full and I didn't want them to be discouraged if it was too unrewarding. Now the dogs are more experienced, so I don't prime the jugs anymore. I am increasing the challenge by sitting the jugs upright and will soon be moving to asking them to find the jug.          The container is easy to fill but the cloth rope makes cleaning a little more difficult. My Wheaten uses the rope to retrieve the jug from under the coffee table but I'm still considering removing the rope because of hygiene and because it blocks the jug opening.          I recommend this if you have dogs cooped up indoors, if you have dogs that need to keep themselves occupied, and especially for large chested  eeds who gulp down their food (because the jug forces the dog to literally only eat a couple kibble at a time).
