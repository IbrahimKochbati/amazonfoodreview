To the people who can't drink milk this is Great ,the reason it's great is because it is one on the original chocolate candy formula's .Originally All chocolate was dark chocolate ,There was no milk chocolate ,without milk and lactose being used as a filler the normal chocolate had 85 to 90% chocolate solids per volume .          Milk was added by the Swiss and used as a filler .Way back in the 1880's they found that when you combine milk with chocolate you could reduced the chocolate content in the candy .Milk chocolate was sold as a less expensive form of chocolate because the manufacturers like Hershey could sell a chocolate with 25% Cocoa content for a low price and still make a huge proffit as the could make 3 to 6 cheap candy bars by reducing the Cocoa in each bar .          So in America we eat cheap chocolate because we see it as the normal type of chocolate candy.
