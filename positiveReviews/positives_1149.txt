Love this soup.  I have been eating this soup for a long time. I have tried several different soups with these same types of ingredients, and this one is the best by far.  However, I will not order it from Amazon again.  I ordered a case, two different times, and the first time 6 of the 12 cans were dented.  The second order, the postal worker delivered it to me in a plastic trash bag because 2 cans were busted open, the other 10 cans, were dented with the labels coming off of them because of getting wet from the soup that had leaked from the busted cans.  It was a huge mess to clean up.  They need to package items better.  Amazon did issue a full refund, but after having 2 out of 2 shipments being damaged, I am not willing to order soup, or any other food items from them.
