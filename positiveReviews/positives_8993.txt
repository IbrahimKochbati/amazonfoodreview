I grew up using King Syrup on biscuits, pancakes, in pecan pie, in pumpkin pie.  It is the best.  I used to have my  other send me 16 oz bottles, but most stores only carry it in 32 oz. bottles.  One 16 oz is just right for two pies.          My complaint is not with the syrup.  It is in the way it was shipped.  I ordered two boxes of 6 each.  I wanted one for a gift.  However, you sent the 12 bottles in one container.  The UPS man left it on my porch and I couldn't lift it to get it in the house.  Bad call on your part.
