I've only given Greenies four stars because they're pretty costly at one Greenie per day (and we have two dogs).  That said, we stopped giving our dogs Greenies for a period of time and there was a significant amount of  own colored build up around the base of our dogs' teeth.  We started giving them Greenies again and within a short period of time the build up was gone in most areas and, overall, greatly reduced.  I realize that we could  ush our dogs teeth in order to avoid the cost, but neither of us wants to take on this chore; plus, the dogs LOVE Greenies.          I used to buy this product at Petsmart, but they're much less expensive on Amazon.
