This is not organic and priced on the high side. It tastes great but olive oil is not something that it tastes the same since it is a natural product and final product taste depends to the season and origin which olives are produced from. Pomperian is an old name that has changed many hands during 100 years of its business history. It is a  and with reputation in Baltimore. I purchased a bottle of their olive oil produced in Chilli that was lighter color but it tasted so great that seemed like I was having olives straight from the tree and amazingly I paid only $6.49. I have been consuming olives and olive oil for years and years for its nutritional value. I cook with olive oil or use it as dressing or add few spoons into my dish since I need the good unsaturated fat contained in olives in in my diet. All vegetable oils are processed and diluted including LIGHT or EXTRA LIGHT olive oil which is a highly refined oil without the nutritional value. I use much more expensive EXTRA VIRGIN olive oils which taste very fruity and sharp from EU but I have been to their farms and know the product real well and trust the producer as well. Unfortunately, olive oil being the gold standard of the cooking oil is produced and mixed with other oils and adulterated by many for financial gain but not this one since it is pure olive oil from a reputable seller but as I said it is not organic. Only EXTRA VIRGIN, the first round of olives that have been pressed have the 200 antioxidants, not refined or mixed with other oils. I keep the oils in the freezer, away from heat and light all the time. Bravo.
