Yes it is low acid and doesn't cause acid indigestion or heart burn. It had a really full bodied aroma while  ewing but fell a bit short on taste   but I'm a black coffee drinker so sharpness & flavour are very noticeable to me. My husband (who does take cream & sweetener in his coffee) said it was a good cup of coffee to his taste.     I think it may have been the "dark french roast" that to me tasted a bit "woody".     So I'll give this 4 stars & try again, with a different roast.     My final analysis is, if you get heartburn or acid indigestion drinking coffee, this is the answer to your prayers. But I wouldn't recommend the Dark French Roast   unless you take cream with your coffee.
