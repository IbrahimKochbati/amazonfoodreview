I'm not much of a coffee drinker and prefer tea but thought I'd give this a go. I've never been a huge fan of the after taste I get with most coffee and that is where this one surprised me. It didn't have the same bitter after taste I was expecting. I tried it plain and found it bearable (keep in mind my lack of coffee taste) and then with some milk and sugar which I really enjoyed. To make sure I was enjoying the coffee I kept my sugar and milk in check so it was a cup of coffee with milk and sugar and not a cup of milk and sugar with some coffee added. That said the expense of the coffee may keep most none coffee connoisseur away but if you are in the none coffee club but are thinking of crossing over this is worth a try.
