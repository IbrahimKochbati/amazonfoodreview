We ordered this with a gift card, and it arrived right in time for the holidays. We really liked the smoked turkey  east, and it made the best sandwiches I have had for quite awhile.  The ham was OK, nothing to shout about, but it was good. I thought that the meat was coming boneless, but that was a blessing because the ham bone made for some excellent bean soup after all the meat was consumed. I would order again. One big plus was the speed of filling the order, and the rapid delivery. It was originally stated that when shipped it would have a window of 8 days to be delivered. it was delivered 4 days after I ordered it.  I was impressed, and so was the Wife.
