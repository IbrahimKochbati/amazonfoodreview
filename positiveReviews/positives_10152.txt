I do not have human children so I can only comment on how this works for my furry kids. I have a cat with severe pancreas GI issues & he has steadily lost weight over the past 2 years.He cannot seem to absorb enough nutrients from his foods. He is on B 12 shots & prednisolone to help calm the inflammation & spure his appetite but sometimes the ONLY thing he will eat is this chicken baby food. He has also eaten the ham & turkey versions of this  and but lately...........just the chicken. He's fussy & has always been a "drama queen" & he also has allergies in the Autumn that affect his willingness to eat (if a cat can't smell the food a cat won;t eat the food) so getting anything into him is helpful & the baby food is good for both nutrition & for hydration.My husband & I will do most anything to keep him happy & enjoying his quality of life for as long as possible & this baby food helps us do that for him. Our other 3 cats also enjoy this as a sometimes treat so it works well for our family.
