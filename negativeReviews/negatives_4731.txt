I've tried only the caramel, chocolate and hazelnut flavours so far and am disappointed. This is the first and last time that I will buy a sugar free syrup. I don't usually do sugar free but I was recently on a diet so I gave in. In any case, I've had regular Torani syrups in the past, and they never failed to please. The sugar free chocolate was gross. Did not taste like chocolate at all. The caramel smelled very hopeful, but ultimately tasted awful as well. The only one so far that actually tastes like its indicated flavour is the hazelnut. For the time being, I am back to my regular Torani syrups, but perhaps one day soon, I'll  ave another sugar free one...
