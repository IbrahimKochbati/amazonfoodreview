I love this tea because it really works, to ease lung congestion and helps lungs to feel clearer quickly and feel  eathing is easier. i have a lung disease  onchiectasis, i drink this tea when my chest feels bad or when i am getting a chest infection  virus. I did not like the taste of it at first but didnt care because it helped me  eath easier. but the taste has grown on me. I think its  illiant and so glad i found it as it really does help me. I buy it several boxes at a time and wouldnt be without it.
