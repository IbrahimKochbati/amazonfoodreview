I come from that part of asian subcontinent named after the coconut tree.Coconut trees are in abundance and we use every part of the tree imaginable. when we want a refreshing drink we just pluck a tender coconut off the tree.  What i wanted to tell u is that I am a difficult nut to crack when it comes to coconut water. And I love the One.
