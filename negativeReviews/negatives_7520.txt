Guys   can't call it coconut water if the the product contains sugar.  That beverage would than be JUICE. After yoga, I went to Whole Foods to pick up dinner and to hydrate. I thought this could be a good one   the minute I tasted it I KNEW it! Sugar. Gross. Kinda the last thing I wanted to put in my body after a bikram session.
