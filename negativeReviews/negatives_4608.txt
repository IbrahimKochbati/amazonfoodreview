I have severe diet restrictions.  All you who would like to be thin, I can recommend the IBS diet  as little fat as possible (I find I can take no more than 5 grams of fat in a meal), no dairy, no nuts, no chocolate, no caffeine, no decaf, limit wheat flour, no red meat, no heavy meals, no empty stomach, and on and on.  Deviate from the diet restrictions and you will lose weight. Eat carefully and you still lose weight.          This allows very few options when you eat out or you're on the road.  Since I work a job which requires a fair amount of travel in a large rural area, finding a 'nutrition bar' or snack food I can eat was a challenge.          Cliff bars are easy to find in most Walmarts, and cost just under a dollar each.  They're a little cheaper in case lots    $5 for a box of 6.  I can only eat 2 kinds, and of course they're popular, so I seldom find them in boxes.  I searched online and was surprised to see Walmart.com offers an assortment of 3 boxes (18 bars) for $15.  They add $1.47 for shipping, but even so, that's a much better price than Amazon's offering here. If you like these, or have a lot of kids and family who do, you may want to check out that source.
