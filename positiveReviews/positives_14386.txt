I have an elderly dog with hip and joint problems. She has been taking Zuke's Hip Action Dog treats for a little more than a month and there has been a HUGE difference in her. She loves the way the treats taste; and best of all she is walking with ease, has an easier time with stairs and yesterday  oke into a full sprint for the first time in ages! We followed the guideline for her size as listed on the back of the package and have been so surprised by the results. We love Zuke's!
