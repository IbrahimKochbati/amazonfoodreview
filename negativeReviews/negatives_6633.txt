For the price I expected much, much better.  It says it should be used within a month but (unless it's used by one person one cup per day) this wont last anymore than a couple of weeks.  It is not as concentrated (I had to pump 3 4 times), and the past reviewer is right it is not as rich as the refrigerated kind.  We have three people who drink coffee here, it was gone in 2 weeks.          I was upset about it gone so soon, but felt some liquid left behind in the bottle; unfortunately the nozzle can't be removed due to a lock system it has; once it's on, its on for good!  I took a butter knife to open the cap and to my surprise there was enough liquid there for at least 5 more cups of coffee!          On top of that the second bottle kept clogging even with twice daily use.  And now Amazon had raised the price!  I decided to go with the plain creamer this time, much more economical.  I will test and review it as soon as I finish the first bottle I hope it works better for us.          It very pricey, sure no mess, no hassle if you've got loads of money there's really nothing to worry about.  But for someone in a budget, I honestly believe it doesn't amount to the value of the one from the dairy coffee section.  Save your bucks, this is not worth it.
