We were thrilled with the sugar bees for use on cupcakes.  We held a baby shower with a Winnie the Pooh theme and focused the food and decor on honey, bees, and other things from the 100 Acre Wood.  We had cupcakes that looked like honeycombs dripping with honey and the bees were the perfect size to place a couple on each.
