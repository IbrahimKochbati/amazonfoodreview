Amazon refunded my purchase price for these, but I thought I should still warn others against ordering. The ones I ordered arrived as furry, rancid walnuts. Unfortunately, I dumped the first cannister into my existing walnut storage without looking (since the packaging was in date). This caused me to have to throw away about 2 pounds of good walnuts because they were touched by these rancid ones. (Perhaps buying food online isn't the best idea...)
