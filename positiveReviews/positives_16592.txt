These are our dog's absolute favorite treat!  As recommended, we only give one each day and make sure he doesn't get choked.  These are not as tough to chew as the old formula, which took him longer to chew.  Greenies are supposed to help clean dogs' teeth and  eath, but we buy them because he loves them so much.  The large box of Teenie size has 96, so they aren't that expensive at one a day.  Well worth the price for our loyal baby!  He's been enjoying them for several years with no problems.  Be sure to get the correct size so your dog can't gobble them whole.
