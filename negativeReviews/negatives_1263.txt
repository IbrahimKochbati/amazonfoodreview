It's got the typical Jif taste, which to me is unremarkable    it's ... just peanut butter    however, the single serve containers are convenient and transport well. The consistency is great    it's not runny yet it's also not a solid hunk a peanut butter with floating oil either. Good for dipping pretzels or celery other veggies, and    in the absence of a spreder    you can just tear off the top and squuush the contents onto  ead.          The price is right.
