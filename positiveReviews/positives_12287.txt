Until I found out about this product, I wouldn't bother making pancakes or waffles. When cooking for one person, it's just not worth the cleanup time.          This product is fantastic... no cleanup at all, and it makes excellent waffles.          Just make sure, as per the instructions, that you put the top on loosely when storing leftover product. Pressure builds inside the bottle, and if you put the cap on tightly it will spray batter everywhere when you open the bottle.          Highly recommended!
