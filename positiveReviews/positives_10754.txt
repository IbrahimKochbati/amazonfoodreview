I have a pair of 50 lb. bird dogs who eat rawhide frequently.  They love these treats  so much that they both run into the next room to enjoy away from the other dog.  For a smaller  eed or less enthusiastic and able chewers, these might be a little hard to chew.  The biscuit is scored so it's possible to  eak it.  My dogs don't have allergies, but the organic, no wheat, no corn recipe might be good if yours do.          I have a Milk Bones budget rather than a Newman's Own budget, but I'd consider ordering the 6 pack of these to keep a pack and share the rest as gifts for friends and family with canine sidekicks.
