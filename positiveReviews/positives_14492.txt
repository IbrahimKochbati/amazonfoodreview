I ordered this because it was one of the cheapest energy drink options on Amazon. It has enough caffeine to wake me up in the morning and tastes good, despite having no sugars or aspartame.          I think the calorie burning claim is silly, and would not use this before exercise as caffeine can dehydrate you. Since I didn't buy it for this purpose, it does not affect my rating of the product.
