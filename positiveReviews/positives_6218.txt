Was pleasantly surprised at how good these pretzels were.There are 3 servings per bag at 140 calories each.This is about 14 to 15 pretzels.The pretzels are really filling.The bag has approximately 45 pretzels.I was expecting them to be bland since they are made with natural ingredients but they are very flavorful.Made in the USA is a big plus.
