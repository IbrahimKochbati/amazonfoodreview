I tried one of these cookies without looking at the nutrition label and I think the taste was at the one star level.  It tasted highly processed and while soft, was dry.  It didn't have the taste of an indulgent treat.  I give it an extra star because my child seemed to like it.          However, I wouldn't want my children eating these often because when I looked at the nutrition label, I saw that indeed, these cookies are highly processed.  Yes, the first ingredient is whole grain oat flour and rolled oats and whole wheat flour are up there.  So I suppose things could be worse.  The four grams of fiber per serving is nice, though it may come from the inulin rather than the whole grains.  What is not nice is the palm oil, multiple sugars (including corn syrup) and multiple preservatives in the ingredient list.          The cookies are individually wrapped and the packaging is probably the most attractive part of the product.          For myself or my children, a home baked cookie would be much preferable to these. So would a power bar or a handful of nuts, which would also be more healthy. Or a packaged cookie with fewer preservatives.  I wouldn't purchase these again.
