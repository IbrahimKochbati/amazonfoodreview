Do Not purchase these! 90% of the cups burst spilling grounds into the mug. I called the Company directly they really had no cares. They told me to contact Amazon to send them back. Amazon does not accept food product returns. Amazon was great enough to refund this portion of my order. I will not buy these ever again. I sent Tully's an email expressing my displeasure and I have not heard back from them. Lousy customer service!   "
