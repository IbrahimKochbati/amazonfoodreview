I got this maple syrup for my family after finding out the store purchased syrup is loaded with the high fructose corn syrup, which is loaded with mercury and other pesticides, organic is what we needed, now I can drown my pancakes and waffles with butter and Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup, delicious, great product.
