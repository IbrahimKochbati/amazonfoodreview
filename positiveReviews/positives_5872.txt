My son recently had a stomach virus that gave him temporary lactose intolerance.  Buying fresh goat's milk in the dairy section is very expensive compared to organic cow's milk, but most of the milk alternatives don't have enough fat and too much sugar for growing toddlers.  This powdered goat's milk was a great solution.  It is easy to mix with my formula pitcher, even using cold filtered water, and the taste is very good.  My son likes it as much as he did his regular milk.  This item is hard for me to find locally, so I was glad to see it on Amazon through S&S.  I plan on keeping this in my pantry from now on in case his intolerance comes back or I run short of regular milk.
