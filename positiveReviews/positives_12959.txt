I think this drink accomplishes what it sets out to... to taste like a sweet can of soda while delivering all the nutrition of its natural fruit juices.  Just while drinking one can it was easy to forget that this was a health drink and not an ordinary soda.          I gave it only four stars because I had trouble digesting the mixed message that this product represents.  My mind is trained (maybe irreversibly) to associate this type of sweet carbonation with a junk beverage.  I didn't have that good mental feeling after drinking it that I do with juice, milk, water, etc.  I guess that's just my problem!
