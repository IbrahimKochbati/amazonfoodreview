Often, foods that are targeted toward being free of an undesirable ingredient end up being heavy with other ingredients to make up for it   anyone remember the "fat free" craze that gave us sugar heavy, calorie laden foods?          I was concerned that these would have a cloyingly sweet flavor to make up for the lack of wheat and dairy   I was pleasantly surprised to find just the opposite.  Actually, my first bite immediately took me back to the days in the 80's when my mom tried to find healthier ways to make cookies without sugar.  Sorry to say, Mom's experiments didn't work out well... but with only 8 grams of sugar per bar, these would make Mom proud.          I found enough chocolate to tip the scales from "unsweet" into "just right".  The almonds, coconut, and oats give a great texture that took a while to chew up, making the eating experience more satisfying.          These were really great warmed up!  I ate my first one straight from of finding the package in my mailbox (summer + Texas   baked mail), and it was like eating a fresh cookie straight from the oven.  I had to stop myself from eating another one right away!          Just for fun, I tried another one chilled.  This was also pretty good   the softness of the bar plus the cold made it a nice treat on a hot day.          At the current Amazon price, it works out to about $.76 per bar, which is a fair price for a snack with less sugar than your average granola bar, and better ingredients, too.
