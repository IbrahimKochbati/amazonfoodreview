We live in Costa Rica and I'm shipping this product here because our pediatrician recommended this cereal to help in the esophagus reflux of our 4 months old daughter's. The idea was to make her formula a little bit thicker so she wouldn't experience the reflux that much. I'm not really sure if any other doctor is using this product for this purpose but it actually worked great with our daughter
