This salad seasoning is so simple but extremely tasty.  It enhances the salad as it's not too over powering.  It's a salty, mildly seasoned packet of goodness. It's also very addictive probably due to the MSG. Add olive oil and red wine vinegar, Mmmmmm.  I can't believe I found it here, b c you cannot find it in mainstream supermarkets nor ethnic markets anymore.
