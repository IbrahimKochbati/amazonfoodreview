I got two of these for gifts at Christmas for two different friends. It happened, oddly enough, that I happened to visit each friend in January after Christmas. Each friend had a significat amount of dried fruit left and I was initially surprised when I visited the first friend and saw fruit remaining. "Well, the first friend explained, this fruit just wasn not as good as most dried fruit so I haven't eaten it all yet. I tasted an apricot. Dried apricots generally have a nice tangy flavor even after a year. No flavor. I visited the next friend and the same basic scenario was repeated. Either I got two bad batches of fruit, or this company is just not up to snuff.
