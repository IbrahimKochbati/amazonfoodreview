I have bought two boxes of these now and love them.  My first box came from a local health food store and the second came from Amazon.  Yum Yum.  As a Vegan I never heard of these, but I have seen them on the shelf at my local health food store.  So one day I bought two packs.  I loved them.  Went back and bought the rest of the box.  That store could not get them in fast enough so I bought from Amazon.  I really like them.  The lime flavor is the one that I have tried.  I will try the other flavors soon.
