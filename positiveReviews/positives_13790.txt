PB2 is AMAZING!!!  Whoever thought you could eat peanut butter without all the fat and calories?  I don't know how they did it, but they managed to remove the bad stuff and still have a product that tastes just like the real thing!  I'm counting calories and PB2 is the *perfect* low calorie snack that tastes like rich, creamy full fat calorie peanut butter.
