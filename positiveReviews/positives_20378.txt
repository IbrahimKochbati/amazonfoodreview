I was blessed with a picky eater, so at 7 months old, my son is barely on solids.  I read about Happy Bellies, and switched to this cereal from Earth's Best.  My son likes it!  And I'm relieved that it doesn't constipate him like Earth's Best did (for a full week).  I definitely plan to try other Happy Bellies products in the future.
