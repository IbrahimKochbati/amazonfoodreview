When my dogs see me reaching for the Greenie box they immediately sit on their bottoms and behave wonderfully. One of the dogs will even do a little dance when we finally give her the treat. We give our dogs one greenie about every other day and they just love them. They take a lot of time in carefully chewing the greenie, so it doesn't appear they are swallowing them too quickly. I usually get the Petite or Teeny varieties for our two 10 lb dogs, but since they like them so much I moved to regular. Hopefully I'll see a change in their  eath soon as they hate getting their teeth  ushed.
