I bought these for my dad and husband, who are doing the Atkin's diet. They love them! I live in New Jersey, so pork rinds are not that popular. I describe them to people as Funyuns texture with bacon flavor. They are very tasty, and calorie wise, you get alot of bang for your buck. They are quite salty, however, which is not a downside for my family.
