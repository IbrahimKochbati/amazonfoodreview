Years ago, I used Melitta's coffee, and I'd forgotten how good it is.  When I tasted a cup of this blend, I was reminded how good it can be to drink a cup of coffee that has bold flavor, but NO bitterness.          Unlike some "designer"  ands that are so bitter they give you the shakes, or some supermarket  ands that are weak and lacking aroma, Melitta has hearty, satisfying flavor, and a rich coffee smell. Brew it to your desired strength, sit back and enjoy!
