Jack Links beef sticks are apparently fine, if you like eating mold. I can't give a review on the taste because I haven't eaten any of the beef sticks.  I was shocked when I opened the box to see a package of beef sticks with white mold on the front and the back.  I wrote to Jack Link's about it but haven't received a reply.  Apparently quality control and health concerns for the customer aren't important to Jack Links.  The mold on the package was very visible, so whoever packaged it and shipped it out to me didn't seem to care all that much.  I'm so grossed out that they would send me this unappetizing and unhealthy product.  Blech!  Will be returning the whole shipment shortly.
