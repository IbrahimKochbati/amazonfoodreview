These candies are great if they are NOT expired. I have ordered these candies from several different sellers on multiple occasions and I have consistently received expired products. Additionally, some sellers put company stickers over top of the expiration date so you can't tell when the product expires. Beware of the following sellers as I have had trouble with each of them: Toys Samurai, ABCTOY4me and ToysDiva. I have reported each of them to Amazon (4 different complaints in the past 4 months) and Amazon has done nothing to stop them from sending out expired products or products with hidden expiration dates. Good luck.
