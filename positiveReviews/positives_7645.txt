These are some of my favorite beans. I've purchased this  and a number of times in various roasts, and I've never been disappointed. Whether you use them in your French press, your espresso maker or your conventional coffee pot, some of the best tasting coffee you can imaging comes out of this bag.          Definitely recommended.
