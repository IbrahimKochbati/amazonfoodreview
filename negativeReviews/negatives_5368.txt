I'm such a coffee snob that I source from specific farmers in Ethiopia. I say this so that people will understand I don't drink grocery store coffee.          This Puroast low acid stuff? Flavorless. No body. No "coffee ness" to it. It tasted like vaguely coffee flavored water. It's caffeinated, so it's got that going for it. I'd rather take 50 Tums and drink good coffee though.
