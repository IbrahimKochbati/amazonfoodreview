Bought one stick of this at a health food store and loved it!  I often crave a jerky like food.  This completely satisfied my craving.  The health food store was selling them for 2bucks each so it was a no  ainer to just order a box.  I got the hickory smoked.          I have also tried the Teriyaki flavor, but didn't like it much.
