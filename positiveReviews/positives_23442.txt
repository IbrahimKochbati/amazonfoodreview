I love to bake and I have to say that this the best  ead flour I have ever used. I love that it is unbleached, and it gives a smooth texture to whatever your baking.I made homemade pizza last weekend using this flour and it made the best crust ever, chewy inside, crispy outside and no bleachy aftertaste.
