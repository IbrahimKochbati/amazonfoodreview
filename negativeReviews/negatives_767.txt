Since I am willing to try alot of new things. I thought that I would buy this product.. And since I do like hot cocoa, I bought 2 boxes.. WORST thing I could have done.. This is bland, with very little flavour. It also has a grainy texture near the bottom of the mug.     Personally I will not buy this product again. I will stay with swiss miss or another hot cocoa  and for the Keurig K Cup
