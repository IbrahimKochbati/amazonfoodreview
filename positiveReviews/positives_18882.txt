Tuffy, my 7 lb Pomeranian, has been the pickiest eater these 12 years and I have spent many hours searching for organic natural products for him. It's been very difficult to find food he likes, but he went right to the venison and I am elated!          I was unfamiliar with air dried products and was surprised how dense the pieces are. He's eating a little more than recommended, but that's okay with me, it's good stuff.          I highly recommend this product, not only because Tuffy likes it, but it is also a great value.
