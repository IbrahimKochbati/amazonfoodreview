Switch, with it's 100% RDA of Vitamin C, and it's lack of added sugar, corn syrup, or preservatives, is not only healthy, but it has the nice twist of carbonation to appeal to soda drinkers young and old.          This is a great beverage for soda lovers  children and adults alike, as well as for health foodies looking for something a little different. It's an especially great product for kids, because they think they are getting soda, but it's really just fancy juice that's (GULP!) good for them!          The Kiwi Berry flavor is sweet, but it's a natural flavor that derives its sweetness from fruit juices. Overall, it's definitely an enjoyable product.
