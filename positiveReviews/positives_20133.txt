I recently tried the Gnu Fiber bars in Banana and Walnut for the first time.     I have some dental troubles, so I am always concerned as to whether or not I     can even chew some of these fiber bars. Some are so hard, I can't bite them at all.     Others are expensive, and taste like cardboard.          These bars are very tasty!  They are soft enough that they are enjoyable to eat.     There is one little seed in the bars that I have a hard time with   guessing it is     the millet. Other than that   they are easy for me to eat too.          I didn't have troubles with them crumbling like another reviewer said. Mine were     very fresh and tasty.          I am going to be buying these from here on out, and plan on trying some other flavors     as well.  I wish the cost was a little better, but watch for sales   they are out there     from time to time. If you like banana walnut flavored items, then you'll like this bar.     It tastes almost like a banana walnut muffin. Well worth trying.
