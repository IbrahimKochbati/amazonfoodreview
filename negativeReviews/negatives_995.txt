Having recently been placed on a gluten free regime, I felt I needed some quick and easy help to get me started. It works great but is way too expensive for what it is. There were just over three cups of bisquick in the box. When I read the ingredients, I realized I could quickly mix up my own quick  ead flour and keep it in the fridge. I'm glad I tried this item because it taught me that I could do just as well on my own and save a great deal of money.
