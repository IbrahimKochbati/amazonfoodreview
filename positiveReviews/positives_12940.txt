I only received one can for testing instead of the 24 pack promised.  But I really have to say that this is truly a new and wonderful taste experience.  The taste of kiwi and berry juice is a very great mix, but carbonating it makes it irresistible.  It sure beats out cola drinks both in nutrition and taste.          100% fruit juice, no added sugar, no preservatives, carbonated: The only thing wrong with this product is that it comes in small (8.3 ounce) cans.
