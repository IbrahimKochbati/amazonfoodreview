This is an excellent bag of chips!  I bought two cases and shared them with the folks at work.  Everyone is raving about level of heat.          The chip quality is very good, very crunchy like a kettle cooked chip should be.          Must agree with the previous review, wash your hands after you eat these.  You do not want Habanero in your eyes!          I have found that they are often out of stock, I signed up to be notified as soon as they came in, then I snagged two cases.
