Wow ... this pasta tastes just like the real thing unlike the  ands labeled as whole wheat pasta. I tried them many times and simply could not get the same pasta eating experience.  I eat half the box at a time, which is about 4 ozs, and it's so filling I can't eat more if I wanted. It keeps me satiated all night. I don't even get the urge to snack. This is like a miracle to me.  Even my children who are the absolute pickiest eaters in the world love this pasta and will eat it in substitute for the "real" (and unhealthy) alternative. The other reviews are absolutely correct in that you should cook it 2   5 minutes longer than you would cook other pasta or even what the box says.  I'm not sure if Amazon will like this comment, but it is much cheaper on the Fiber Gourmet web site at about double the amount for the same price on the day I am writing this review.
