I bought this tug toy because of the reviews...However, none of my three dogs had any interest in them, even when I put their favorite snacks in them. I dog is a big chewer, one is a medium chewer, and one is too old to chew! Not one would go near it...Also, it does not look like the picture. It is entirely in purple, and the tug is all purple and rubber... This is the only toy I ever bought that all three dogs disliked. It has been a week, and I keep giving them the toys, but no luck.  I personally think it is too awkward and heavy..Fell on my bare foot, and it hurt somewhat.  I think you could make this with a plastic soda bottle, for nothing...       Sorry for the bad review....The review is from the dogs, and not me!  I paid quite a bit for 2 of them, and I     need to figure out what to do with them...paid too much to throw them away.. maybe make a bird feeder?
