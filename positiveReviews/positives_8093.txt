It's sad that most food based Hemp products come from outside the USA. But this is not a political review, but rather a quality review of a very enjoyable product. Since I eat a very strict Paleo eating regimen seeds and nuts are a large part of my daily routine. When I bake chicken, or make a big salad I always sprinkle on Hemp Seeds. The taste is not overpowering and it seems that Nutiva's quality is by far the best and most consistent. Another great selling point is that it is available through Prime. I'm not going to get on a soap box about the health benefits of Hemp, go look it up and do your own research. I enjoy this food and have for many years.
