This is a great tasting large dense chewy oatmeal and coconut cookie. The BAD news is it's 180 calories and 9 grams of fat with only 2 grams of fiber and 2 grams of protein. I would of thought they would have made it a little  more nutritionally balanced since it seems to be marketed as a "bar" so if you want a large cookie then this is the product for you. I just wish they would have packed a little more fiber in it.
