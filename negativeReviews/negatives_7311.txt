The pumpkin is good, but 7 out of the 12 cans arrived dented (and not just little dents).  I read that dents aren't a big deal unless they are at the seams of the cans (which most of these are at the top or the bottom). Would have been a good deal, but I'm definitely disappointed.  Like other reviews said, these dents don't appear to be from them being shipped as cans that were even packaged in the middle were dented, makes you think they are selling the companies "seconds" or something.
