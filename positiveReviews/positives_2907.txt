Several Gevalia  and coffee's have been among my favorites for years....Velvet Noir, Signature Blend, Traditional Roast, etc.  The Breakfast Blend is my "go to" every day grind.  It's got a perfect blend of bold rich taste, terrific aroma, and full taste, with very low acidity and harshness.  Just incredible coffee!
