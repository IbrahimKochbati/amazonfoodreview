I love all the flavors of Zatarain's.  I love to cook cajun style food and will make my own from scratch when I have the time.  Reality means I usually focus on cooking the main course and will use boxed shortcuts for side dishes.  Zatarain's really shine in this role.  You give up surprisingly little for a ready mix product.  The flavors are within shouting distance of the real deal.  Compared to most foods made from a mix that require less than 2 minutes of your attention   it's practically a miracle.          The Jambalaya and the Black Beans & Rice are the best flavors.  The Jambalya is hot and spicy   so kids don't like it.  The black beans & rice is a little spicy too   but subtle.  Mainly it's zesty and hearty and delicious.  My children eat it.  My little son just devours it   and has since he was a tot.  My daughter less so.  Actually I think I love this stuff more than my wife   so maybe there's a gender thing going on.  It's a little greasy when made properly.  I recommend using 2 1 2 cups of water, instead of the 2 3 4 it recommends on the box   for thicker, less soupy rice.  The foil lined container is bug proof and keeps for a long time.  Because it's a big flavor it sits best next to something assertive   like steak or blackened anything.  It's a regular side for us on BBQ nights.
