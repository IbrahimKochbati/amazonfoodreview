This product is carbonated and 100% fruit juice with NO high fructose corn syrup. It has packs 140 calories in a little over 8 oz. of product.     I prefer my drinks with 0 calories or just plain water.          The taste wasn't pleasing to me and it left an unpleasant aftertaste. Also, the sweetness of the drink made it less than a thirst quencher.
