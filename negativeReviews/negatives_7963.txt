First of all, the picture that Amazon has with this Organic tea is not the right picture. We are LONGTIME fans of the non organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.          Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit "add to cart" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought "oh, boy" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.          What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion    and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The "burnt" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.          So, we recommend that you try the non organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.          Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . .
