I ordered this Chai because of the reviews I read expecting a yummy taste comparable to chai products purchased in Starbucks or gourmet drink establishments.  I followed the instructions using 3 heaping teaspoons, and mixed it with hot milk first, and then experimented by mixing it next in hot water, and again in half and half combination of hot water and hot milk.  I even have mixed it with hot water and used it with a chai tea bag for a stronger taste.  I am not getting the spicey taste I desired but the product is good.  It's just not AS good.  I am not certain if I will reorder.  What I like about the product    you can use it just with hot water and it is good.
