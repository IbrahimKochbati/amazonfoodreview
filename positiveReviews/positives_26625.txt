My Black Russian Terrier has had chronic vomiting and dry heaves for six years. Multiple vet visits and and a trip to MedVet for a thorough workup could not pinpoint the cause. I tried many meds supplements foods to try to solve this problem with no results. After seeing the reviews of this food I decided to try it even though the price is outrageous   desperate times call for desperate measures! Titan's vomiting and dry heaves have decreased dramatically since being on this food (he's been on it for about 1.5 months now). Yay! Since it worked so well for him, I decided to try it on one of my other dogs, a PBGV with major stinky anal gland issues. Even though I hadn't read any reviews about this food working for that, I thought it was worth a shot. I was told that more fiber in his diet might help to bulk up his stool and this food seemed to have more fiber. Jack has been on this food for about a month now and we haven't had any stinky anal gland issues so far. My only issue with this food is the price (a 110 pound dog goes through it like crazy). If it weren't for the ridiculous price, I would give this food 5 stars.
