I switched to mate from coffee a few years ago. I know it's generally an afternoon drink, but I drink it in the morning like coffee. There were a couple of websites where I bought it regularly. Unfortunately, Dr. Oz saw fit to publicly endorse it as a health tea, and the price went up everywhere, including my regular sellers. So I went looking, and found this on amazon.          This is my favorite  and. The Selecci&oacute;n Especial is aged two years in special wooden boxes with vents to let smoke in. This is "elaborada con palo", meaning that it has stem bits in it, which makes the flavor last longer for more refills. Some will prefer "sin palo"(without stems), because the stems also add a little bitterness to the mate.          I understand that in Argentina, where mate is a common as coffee is here, Rosamonte is generally regarded as one of the best commercially available mate  ands.          Of this seller in particular, I can say that they were prompt, and that the box came with a couple free samples of flavored mate. A lot of people will prefer the flavored kinds, especially either "citron" which is lemon, or "hierbes de monta&ntilde;a", which means moutain herbs and tastes like mint.          I, however, prefer this for day to day consumption. I run plain water through the coffee maker, fill a large coffee cup about 1 3 full with mate, and just keep topping it up with hot water for a couple hours as I sip it through the bombilla.          The main thing that pleased me about this merchant is that the product was considerably less dusty than what I had been getting from my previous suppliers. The difference is probably about handling and storage. The bags are like a bag of sugar, and a lot of rough handling could crush the leaves inside, creating dust. In the mate, dust gets through the holes in the bombilla and coats your tongue, tastes a little bitter, and generally degrades the experience.          When it first arrived, I opened a bag and poured it into a big tupperware container that I use to store it. And I immediately noticed that there was very little dust compared to what I had been getting when I ordered this from my old seller.          I'm very happy with what I received.
