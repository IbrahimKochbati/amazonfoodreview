There ought to be a recovery program. But the good side is that a Mrs. Mays addiction is healthy. I already have a stack of boxes in the garage so I won't run out. And here I am stockpiling more (in case of nuclear holocaust).          Almonds have always been my staff of life    raw, roasted, dry roasted, blanched, flavored, and of course Mrs Mays. I rarely have a day without them. I even feed them to the parrot. A bird guy told me they were the healthiest. And the bird goes nuts for Mrs. Mays.          These are, dare I say, miracle nuts. One taste and I was hooked. How she can pack all that goodness into such a tasty snack with such healthy ingredients is a miracle. If you're tired of tastless, bland, gotta eat it because its healthy snacks from the nutrition store, try these for a pleasant awakening.          Mike
