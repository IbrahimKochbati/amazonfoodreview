This tastes great. At first it tastes a bit strange but i enjoyed the slight coffee taste. I mixed the Amazing Green Superfood (the chocolate version) with it which made the Amazing Green taste much better. I need to buy more of this Hemp Shake since i'm out. It really makes the Amazing Green taste much better. I mix it with milk using a little wisk, which works well. I recommend this to anyone trying to be healtheir, boost their immune system, and it is a great snack.  Try both the products together, it's a great combination. I have been using it regularly for a few months now and i have noticed that i have stayed healthy. I even managed to go to disney world during the new year holiday without getting sick! As a teacher getting sick is common for me, but i have noticed that i've been healthier since using these products. Give it a try!
