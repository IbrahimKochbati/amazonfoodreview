I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of this coffee as I wasn't sure what to expect with an "acid reduced" coffee. I generally like to drink a medium roast coffee as dark roast usually gives me an unpleasant after taste and indigestion. However, with this coffee I didn't experience either. And as far as the taste it seemed like any other premium  and dark roast  this one with pleasing,subtle nutty overtones. Though I don't us sugar in my coffee I did find just a dash of it  ought out even more depth of flavor in this coffee. So don't be wary of the "acid reduced" process  it doesn't seem to take anything away from the flavor of the coffee itself. It really is like having your cake and eating it too!
