Whether you like this candy depends a lot on why you are buying it.          If you are older like me and looking for the Grape licorice laces that were once sold in Department Store Candy Counters and Candy stores by the bunch in the sixties and seventies you will be disappointed. This is not even remotely similar to that candy.          This order was my last hope to find the kind I liked as a kid and it seems it simply isn't being made anymore.          Personally I did not really care for the taste but that means nothing since I was looking for the kind they use to sell and this wasn't it.
