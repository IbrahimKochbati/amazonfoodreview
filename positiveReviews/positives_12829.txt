Recently I had the pleasure of trying the Kiwi Berry flavor of Switch 100% fruit juice. It is unbelievable that a sugarless carbonated drink can taste so great and yet be good for you. The Kiwi Berry was bold and tangy instead of sweet and cloying. The carbonation made the drink sparkling and energetic. Since I have recently kicked my 15 year habit of drinking Diet Coke, I have been looking for a substitute drink that wasn't straight fruit juice or straight soda. As an American I have become accustomed to thinking that carbonated drinks are the fun ones and that merely being healthy by drinking juice is boring. So Switch allows me to feel healthy and have some fun at  the same time while also giving up caffeine which I really don't want during the day. If Switch comes out with additional flavors I will certainly try those as well.
