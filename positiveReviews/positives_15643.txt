I'm not too sure why they named this chicken based cat food with names like "Chinese Chicken", but my 2 cats seem to know.  Both of them eat this stuff up like it's the last supper.          Based upon the ingredients, I feel like I'm feeding them something far more nutritious than Fancy Feast (which they love, except for the salmon, which makes them puke).
