I don't think these coffee bags are as good as fresh ground fresh  ewed coffee, but they taste far better than instant coffee.  At work, we have a water cooler with hot water dispenser.  This  ewed in hot water just like a tea bag making tea tastes far better than any instant coffee.  I highly recommend it to any coffee lover when you have access to very hot water but don't have access to a coffee maker.  Individual wrapped and sealed bags allow you to take one tiny tea like bag with you in your pocket or purse to your early morning meetings.
