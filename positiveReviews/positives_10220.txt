I have had 2 German Shorthairs with allergies, requiring daily medication durning Spring and Summer.  Not only do these things work like a charm, but Pill Pockets have actually become one of their preferred treats.  The pups have no idea they are getting medicine.  I have been completely happy with all Greenies products I've purchased, and they come recommended by my veterinarian as well.  No complaints.
