I tried this coffee because I drink a lot of it, and sometimes it gives me a stomach ache. I was looking for coffee that had a robust flavor while being a little easier on my system. This one lives up to the advertising. It was good, flavorful, while being easier on the stomach.          I will be ordering this again.
