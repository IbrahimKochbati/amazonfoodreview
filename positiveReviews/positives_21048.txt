I've found that going gluten and sugar free has been a real challenge. Some products have helped and this has been one of them. I've used this as a substitute in recipes when calling for  own sugar (and have had to guess a bit about quantity) and it has worked well. I recently made a pumpkin  ead using it and the whole family enjoyed! Warning: the bottle top does get sticky and feels a bit crumbly from the honey that can remain on it. To avoid this I have stopped using the flip top and simply remove the top entirely to measure out the honey I need.
