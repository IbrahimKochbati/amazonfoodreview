I bought these chips thinking that they are "all natural" per their description of "No preservatives, no artificial flavors or colors."  When I received them I checked the ingredients, and they contain "yeast extract," which is synonymous with MSG (yeast extract contains processed free glutamic acid).  I will never purchase this product again.
