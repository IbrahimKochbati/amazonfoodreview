I read several of these reviews that state how often this product arrives damaged.  I decided to chance it and order it anyway hoping to be one of the lucky people who wrote good reviews.  The box arrived and I could see and smell the leaking creamer from the porch.  I had not been one of the lucky few.  Several of the containers had ruptured and leaked all inside the box.  If you like washing close to two hundred tiny containers of liquid, go ahead and order this product. You'll enjoy it.
