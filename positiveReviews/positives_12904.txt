it' an okay drink and didn't have a harsh or oddly synthetic taste to it as some "juice" drinks have, yet it wasn't anything super.          This is a nice alternative to regular soda, but I don't see myself buying it that often. The high carbonation makes it less healthy than it is touted and is bad for your stomach. Too bad they didn't make it less carbonated or perhaps a non carbonated version.
