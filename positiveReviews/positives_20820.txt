I have tried a lot of beaf sticks and this is the best I've tasted. Yes, it was spicy but that what "Hot n Spicy" means. I purchased a box of 24 for a little under $23 less 30% off promo   $15.73 which is a great price. If Amazon offers it again for that price, I will definately pick up two more boxes.
