This is the first time I am using McVities  and biscuit, and I am impressed. Unlike most made in "US" biscuits, these are not overly sweet or smelly or buttery. Just a perfect balance of light flavor, sweetness and baking make this biscuits phenomenal. If you never tried McVities, this is the time to do it.
