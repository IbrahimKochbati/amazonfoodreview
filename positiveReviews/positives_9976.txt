I bought this for my mother's 50th birthday. She loved space food sticks as a kid but it was more of a nostalgia thing than a "tasted amazing" thing. We all know space food sticks taste like modeling clay. But this assortment of food with the retro space food sticks magnet was perfect.          She loved the gift and the dried cinnamon apples and peaches were delicious! I wish they sold them in large quantities outside of the space food package.          (The strawberry section of the space ice cream was delicious as well)
