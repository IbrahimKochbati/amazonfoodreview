These arrived relatively quick, considering they were shipped from Hawaii to WV via Priority mail, however they have obviously not been placed in the coolest part of the shipment as they had some serious melting happen apparently in transit.  I gave these a 3 star rating because they did not have as good a quality of chocolate as I am used to having with macadamia nuts, Hershey's chocolate would have been better (but not good enough to make me happy)
