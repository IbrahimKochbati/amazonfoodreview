I re potted all my plants in the fall of 2010 and spent a fortune all winter trying to get rid of these bugs! I never even considered the soil.. I thought I  ought them in from a new plant purchase but couldn't understand how they could multiply so rapidly. When I heard my husband clapping his hands as they were flying around his desk downstairs (where there are no plants) I went into my potting room and opened the bag. BUSTED! I couldn't get that bag outside fast enough!     I ended up throwing out many of my favorite plants (some very old ones) and now I'm starting from scratch. In this case I didn't get what I paid for but a whole lot more than I bargained for!     As for the reviewer who claims it's from over watering...I can't agree.  I've been an avid indoor and outdoor gardener for over 30 years and I NEVER experienced anything like this.  Yes, be sure you have good drainage and don't water all plants the same. Different plants have different requirements. Maybe all bags aren't infested but I'll not take that chance again!
