As an ex New Yorker, I've had fond memories of fresh baked 7 layer cake from a local Brooklyn bakery. Unfortunately this product is a very poor representation of the product. The cake was too dry and the filling had very little taste. The chocolate topping was both too sweet and too soft.  I purchased 2 cakes and they were sent US Mail. One cake had its topping melt in the Texas heat while sitting in our mailbox and was thrown away. I'm still searching for a great cake.
