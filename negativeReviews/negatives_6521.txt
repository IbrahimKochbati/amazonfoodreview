So, if you look really closely at the picture of the product, it does say small dogs under the name.  However, it doesn't specify that in the amazon description, which I think is lame.  Suffice to say, these little 3 or so inch diameter patties will not function as anything but the world's most expensive bag of dog treats for my 100 lb. dog.  Had purchased these hoping for lightweight, packable dog food for backpacking that could be rehydrated, but this won't do it. The product itself seems fine if you've got a small dog; it is the lack of proper description that leads to my mediocre review.
