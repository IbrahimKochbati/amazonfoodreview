My three dogs like these treats, including my picky Chihuahua.  That's saying something right there!  These treats are fairly large, measuring approx. 2" x 1".  I have observed that they are very crumbly when eaten.  Each treat has a score line in the middle, which when  oken, make two 1" x 1" squares for smaller dogs like my Chihuahua.  My dogs all enjoy them.          Ingredients (from the packet): "Organic Barley, Organic Lamb, Organic Carrots, Organic Apples, Organic Palm Oil (Preserved with Mixed Tocopherois, a source of Vitamin E), Organic Molasses."          These treats are certified Organic by the USDA.  They contain no wheat or corn, just organic barley.  They are a "Product of New Zealand."
