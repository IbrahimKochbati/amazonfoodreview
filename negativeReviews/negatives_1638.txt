I think the Switch is a beverage with soda replacement in mind.  The can boasts it contains 100% of what one wants (being all natural, 100% juice, full daily serving of vitamin C, and the clincher, carbonated), while having 0% of what you don't want (no added sugar, corn syrup, preservatives or colors.)          The Good   So with that in mind, I have to agree that it is refreshing to see companies trying to fill the void in "sodas" with no corn syrup, with tons of juice and vitamins to boot.  I like that you get a full dose of vitamin C, and a little bit of A.  As for taste, it has a nice slightly crisp bite of carbonation, and it's very orange tangerine y.  It's a little heavy (read syrupy without being too sweet), but it does have a reconstituted juice base, so it gets a pass.  It's also in a single serving size can (8.3oz), which is nice considering I typically treat most 20oz bottles as a serving, even though it's 2 and a half and I tend never do the math to figure out the true content of what I'm drinking.          The Bad   The price is a bit steep.  At about a dollar a can, it's roughly twice the price as most 100% juices you can find, including most selections of orange juice.  Whereas a 64 ounce carton of Tropicana will run you upwards of four dollars, 8 cans of the Switch would cost eight bucks.  For soda lovers, the Switch is about twice the cost compared to your average 20oz bottle, and roughly 4 times the cost of cans (when comparing equal amount by the ounce.)  Also, read the ingredients, it contains more apple and grape juice than orange or tangerine, which means that the taste is probably aided by the natural flavors (which doesn't mean oranges, just that it was derived from natural substances not chemically made.)          The Ugly   The Switch seems straight forward, but it's also a little devious which leads me to my biggest complaint.  Granted it's all natural, but each 8oz can contains 36g of carbs, 34 of sugar alone.  That's more sugar than soda, in some cases by almost 10 grams a serving.  More sugar (even if it's not corn syrup) is more calories per can, so even at it's single serving size you'd almost be better off drinking a Coke and taking a vitamin C pill.
