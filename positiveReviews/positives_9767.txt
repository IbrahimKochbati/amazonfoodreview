These anchovies are excellent; nothing like the salty, fishy cousins packed in oil available on a grocers shelf. Instead the taste has depth and character, somewhat like a sardine but with a little more bite. The drawback here is that you must scrape the skin off and "filet" the little fishes, worth the effort in my opinion.
