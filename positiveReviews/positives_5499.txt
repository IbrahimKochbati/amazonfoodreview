I'm not much of a soda drinker, but I enjoy a good natural fruit soda in the summertime. Izze describes their sodas as "100% Pure Fruit Juice and Sparkling Water". That's an exaggeration, as there are a few more natural ingredients beside fruit juice and water in these drinks. But the description is apt in that Izze's drinks are more sparkling fruit juices than sodas. They are lightly carbonated, not super fizzy. And the best of them taste like fresh fruit. The Sparkling Grapefruit will be a fast favorite of grapefruit fans, because it tastes like fresh squeezed pink grapefruit juice, but lighter and a little sweeter. It's a little tart. A little sweet. A little fizzy. Very refreshing. It's like drinking fresh grapefruit juice, only better. There's never any trace of sourness. No refined sugar, artificial ingredients, or caffeine either. 12 fl.oz. glass bottles.          Ingredients: sparkling water, grape juice concentrate, grape fruit juice concentrate, lemon juice concentrate, natural flavor, gum acacia (from acacia trees), ester gum, red cabbage extract (color). One serving (which is 8 fl.oz.) contains 10 mg sodium and 25 g total carbs.
