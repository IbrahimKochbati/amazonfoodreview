For years I've walked by the tuna aisle in the grocery store and seen canned chicken.     My initial thought was...ewwww.     It just struck me as just plain wrong that chicken would be stuck in a can.     Then out of curiosity I picked up a can and......as soon as I opened the can it was like a revelation.     I drained it and no chunks came out with the water.     Sure enough I opened the can and all I saw were juicy chunks of white meat.     Perfect for salads, stews or soups.     I made a chicken salad for lunch and it was delish.     I can't wait to make some homemade chicken noodle soup this weekend.     Cheap and tasty.     Recommended.
