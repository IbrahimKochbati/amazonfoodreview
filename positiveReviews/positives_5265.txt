This product is a light and fruity carbonated beverage.  You might ask how that's different from any other soda.  The difference is that this one leans more on the fruit side rather than the soda or sugar side.  I liked that about it.  While it was sweet it wasn't syrupy sweet to the point that it was cloying and it did not have a strong after taste.  Also it had a much more juicy aspect to it.  Its kind of hard to describe but the best comparison I can make is it's like one of those fruity V8 juices only carbonated.  Maybe that's not right either but I'd recommend trying this at least once.  It just may be a taste you'll find you'll like again.
