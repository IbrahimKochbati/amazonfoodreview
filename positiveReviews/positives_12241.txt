If a milder, smoother taste is what you are looking for, you won't find anything better than Green Mountain Nantucket Blend. This is the first coffee I ever tried in my Keurig and it's been a staple in our variety of K Cups for two years now. The quality is superb   I wouldn't expect anything less from Green Mountain. In fact, a friend who has a relative who works there says the quality control is so strict they throw out cups that have even a tish more or less coffee than the cups are supposed to. At less than 0.60 cents cup, this is a bargain. With Prime Membership, to have these delivered to my door is too good to be true.
