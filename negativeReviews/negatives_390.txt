I was at a charity fund raising event where they were handing these out. They seemed pretty tasty, so I bought a couple bags at Target. The ones I bought (Barbeque and Salt and Vinegar) were AWFUL! I ended up throwing away most of them, neither I nor anyone else who tried them could choke them down. The ones they were handing out as samples were clearly very different from what they are selling. Don't waste your money.
