Well, when I ordered this, I was expecting something quite different.  I mean, c'mon, look at the name!  However, after reading the ingredients I found that it doesn't contain ANY of the product listed on the label.  Falst advertising!  But being a trooper, I dumped it out and ate it anyway.  It was pretty good, but not what you'd expect...
