This is a great pork seasoning. I first tried this as a sample I requested  from the company   for FREE   and then had to buy a large can because I loved it so much. I tried it the first time on a couple of 1 1 2" thick Iowa style pork chops, cooked on a charcoal grill, and was hooked. I have since used it on ribs and pork roasts and have been pleased every time.
