Our vet stocks these dog chews and we found our dogs loved them.  The vet charges way too much (because everyone needs to make a profit), so I searched the net and found that Amazon carries them for far less.  Even with shipping!  These chews are not rough (as so many bought in the store are), enzymes have been made a part of what the dog chews, and they come in varying thicknesses within each package.  We have three dogs with individual chewing preferences (a retriever's teeth are far different from an Aussie's, in our case) and each bag has plenty for all our dogs.  Highly recommended!
