Unlike some other faux milk sports drink, Mix1 is worth the calories.     Pros: *Easily digestible with a good mouth feel (not sour or slimy)       *The nutritional value (vitamins and minerals) makes it worth the calorie expenditure       *Unlike some rival products, tastes like vanilla, not overly sweet or fake.       *Haven't tried it but would probably make a good smoothie w fresh or frozen fruit     Cons: *Can be pricey and hard to find       *Not a vegan product because it contains milk solids  can't recommend to vegan friends       *Unlike the recyclable plastic bottles the fruit Mix1 flavors come in, the tetrapaks used for the chocolate and vanilla flavors are hard to drink without a straw.          But overall, I recommend Vanilla Mix1, especially since recently my favorite Mix1 flavor, blueberry vanilla has disappeared from the shelves.
