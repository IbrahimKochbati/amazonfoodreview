Nacho Cheddar and White Cheddar are our favorite flavors. They are addictive, and it's hard to imagine eating popcorn without them. One problem is that they don't do well in humidity, turning into a solid mass.          That fact will make it hard to buy a six pack from here. Unless you live in Arizona or in a permanently climate controlled house, you do not want to keep this product too long on the shelf. If it cakes, we have found that you can open the bottom of the container, place the product in a blender and make it usable.
