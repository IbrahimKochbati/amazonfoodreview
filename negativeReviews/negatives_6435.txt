The chocolate is just as delicious as could be expected. The wrap is easy to remove and re wrap again. The kisses in the inside come in a nice bag, keeping them safe inside. The box it comes in is sturdy enough. I ordered two, one came intact and the other came demolished on one side...very very disappointed.
