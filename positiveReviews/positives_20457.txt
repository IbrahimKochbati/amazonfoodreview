MAYBE IT'S MY DOGS WHO SEEM TO PREFER CHEWY TYPE TREATS OVER HARD COOKIES BUT THEY HAVE LITTLE TO NO INTEREST IN THESE ALTHOUGH THEY SEEM TO BE A HEALTHY PRODUCT.  THEY WILL EAT A FEW HERE AND THERE WHEN THEY GET HUNGRY ENOUGH BUT OTHERWISE PASS IN HOPES OF GETTING THEIR CHEWY TREATS INSTEAD.  BUT DON'T LET MY DOGS' TASTE AND PREFERENCES INFLUENCE YOUR DECISION.  THEIR INGREDIENTS ARE HEALTHY AND THE AMOUNT YOU GET FOR THE PRICE IS UNBELIEVABLE.  CRUNCHY IS ALWAYS BETTER FOR THE HEALTH OF THE TEETH, TOO.  THE GINGERBREAD SHAPE IS CUTE AND A GOOD SIZE.  DOESN'T HURT TO TRY...I DID CONSIDERING THEIR INGREDIENTS AND PHENOMENAL PRICE.
