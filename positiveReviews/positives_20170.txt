I am so excited to have a sugar alternative that acts and feels like sugar!  And it tastes great too   not exactly like sugar, but very close.  To me it tastes less sweet than sugar right off the spoon, but it definitely works just like sugar 1 to 1 in recipes, as promised.  And it is absolutely delicious in coffee!
