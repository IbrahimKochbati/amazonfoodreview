This is the most expensive loose tea I have purchased so far.  I have not strayed from the Davidson's loose bulk here on Amazon at such a great price but thought I would give this one a try.  The tea itself looks nice   partial leaves, better quality leaves than what I had seen so far out of other cheaper teas.  The taste is decent as well.  I do however have a HUGE problem with stray hairs in my loose tea.  The first time I scooped some out and noticed a long hair (and not the color of mine) in with the tea I was grossed out but thought "Hey it happens".  The second time I found another hair down further in the bag (oddly enough a different color and longer) it completely repulsed me.          This isn't bad tea, but I would say there's a quality control problem in filling the bags.  Needless to say that I won't be buying this  and any more and back to Davidson's cheaper (and hair free) tea for me!
