I have had mixed luck with many of the gluten free bars... some hard as a rock, crunchy and crumbly choke to death on, weird pasty flavors that are nothing like you imagine... On a whim I got a box of these ThinkThin White Chocolate Chip bars, and I was just going to struggle thru them if they were not as good as I had hoped...but I really really like them!  I'll admit the first bit I thought it was way too sweet and the white chocolate was a little weird tasting (isn't is always, really?!), but that faded away to the nice chocolate flavor with little choco crunchy bits.  They remind me of a denser 3 Musketeers bar only with white choco coating and the choco crunchy bits.  I am almost tempted to try to other flavors, but I am spoiled on these.
