I've been a happy Canidae customer for over a year, recommending the product to everyone.  However, they have recently changed the formula and my dog has been violently ill.  I've talked to most of the suppliers of Canidae in the Chicago area, and they are receiving countless complaints about very sick dogs since the new formula was introduced.     I'm taking my dog off of this food immediately.  He's been sensitive to different foods in the past, but never as violently as this.     It's disturbing that they would make this switch without notification.  At least I finally know what's wrong with my dog, and that it's been happening to countless others.  Beware.
