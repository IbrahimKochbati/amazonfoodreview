Item says in stock and will ship in two days! Then after two days you get an email that says "Sorry for the inconveinence but your item is out of stock and will be 10 days later" (or MORE!) I wish AMAZON would just go back to doing it themselves instead of letting any dork with a website sell stuff. This is BS! This is probably the last time I will do business with AMAZON or ANY of it's so called merchants.
