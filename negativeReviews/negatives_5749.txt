My dogs love the taste of it. my worry is the next day one of them vomit the entire food he just ate plus the one from the previous day. I have to said I did not gradually change to this food, so maybe that is the reason. but I notice lots of urine more than normal. I just don't feel comfortable feeding this food to my dogs.
