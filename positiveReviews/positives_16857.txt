I like this toy.  My puppy dog cant figure it out yet, but she is young yet. I have confidence she will get the object of the toy.... I had gotten another bottle, but the larger one.  THAT bottle was the same size as the dog.  Well safe to say the sister and her much larger dog now have the bottle, my pup me and my leibkins now have the smaller one.
