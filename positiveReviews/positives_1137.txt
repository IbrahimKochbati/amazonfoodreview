If you like garlic this is for you. I've been making this as a dip with Greek yogurt and reduced fat mayonnaise. I usually add chopped spinach to it and serve it with crudites and chips. I have gotten rave reviews from my friends. My only complaint is that it consists of dried vegetables and a powder and it is difficult to make sure they are equally distributed when measuring it out.
