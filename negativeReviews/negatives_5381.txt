Sorry, but I could not drink that. Some people call it old world coffee. I call it old cheap hotel coffee. It is soooo dark in color, just like ashes. The smell is not pleasant at all. And it tastes just like a bad coffee made with terrible tap water you can find inside of a cheap hotel. Sorry, I rather drink no coffee than drink this! One star for me.
