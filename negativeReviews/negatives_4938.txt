This product is good in theory, however just couldnt get our dog to pay attention to it after training him that food comes out when you tug. He still just tried to lick in the open hole....he is too used to his Kong.     But it is really put together well. I like it, but unfortunatley my dog does not,therefore I had to put it at 3 stars.
