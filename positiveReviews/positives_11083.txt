I really love this tea.  I have IBS, I try to eat healthy but eating a lot of fiber, fruits and vegetables can be hard on my stomach.  This tea relieves nausea, gas, bloating and excess acid issues.  I also love the flavor.  I drink this tea every evening, it is so soothing to my poor stomach.  And its naturally slightly sweet flavor takes care of my sweet tooth.  As a side note...the Yogi  and of Ginger tea works amazingly well to soothe coughs.
