My doogie loves it a lot, my budget howls though. I can't find it steadily at the local stores so catching it on sale is out of the question. It's great, no digestion problems and his skin, eyes and coat are much improved so I know it's good for him too.          I've had great results with Harmony Farms Dog Food that I orderd through Amazon AND there's 5 pounds more for about the same price.
