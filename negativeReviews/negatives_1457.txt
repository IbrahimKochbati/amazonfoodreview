I love the other Nana's cookie bars and cookies, so I thought I'd give these a try even though they are "No Gluten" and made with rice flour instead of wheat flour. They look nice, but the texture is a bit strange (it's kind of like eating really fine sand) and they are too dry and crumble at the slightest touch. They don't taste bad, which is a plus, but I won't be buying these again.
