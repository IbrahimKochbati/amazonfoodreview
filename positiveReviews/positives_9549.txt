I found out about this product a year ago when I began training for an ironman. The long training days and intense interval work was beating my body down. I needed something I could take that would help get me ready for the next day's training. I have had nothing but great experiences since incorporating this into my workout regime. Vanilla Core Power reminds me of soft serve ice cream!
