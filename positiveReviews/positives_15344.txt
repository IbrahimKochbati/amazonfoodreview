I am surprised at all the negative reviews as I love this machine and have had it for over a year with very little problems.  I had to descale it once during that time but I usually use purified water for coffee so I wouldn't imagine I would have to do that again for another year.  There are two cup sizes.  One is a normal cup and one is a stronger cup.  If you are looking to fill up a mug, you can hit the smaller cup size twice.  I find that is perfect because I buy the stronger blend coffees.          The only problem I have had was a couple of times I had to turn it off and on a few times to get the water to flow through the k cups.  All in all, not a hardship          I am going to buy one for my son this year and am not sure which model to get.  This standard has worked great for me so I may just get the same.
