I never drank coffee in my life because I only wanted one cup.  I guess you could call me a one cupper.  At work, I would drink one cup of coffee in the morning because it was there.  I found that that one cup really got me going in the morning, and also in the afternoons if I was feeling drowsy.  I started working from home and found that I missed that coffee.  I purchased this basic Keurig because it has everything a one cupper needs, nothing more.  I love it!  My only complaint is that it only lasted one year.  I attempted to dscale it, and it never worked right again.  I bought the same machine again and am hoping for a longer life.  I would recommend this product to all the one cuppers of the world.  Just be sure to descale on a regular basis.
