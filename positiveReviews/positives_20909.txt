In the northeast it's pretty easy to find this stuff in gas stations and convenience stores, so if you're just looking to sample this stuff I'd try there first; but once you know you love this stuff the deal on amazon is pretty good.  I eat this stuff a stick at a time, so I was a little nervous about ordering so much, but I just put it in zip lock bags and it kept just fine for 60 days or so.          Taste wise this stuff gets a 9 10 for me.     Quality is 9 10 as well.     Spiciness (I like spicy jerky) is only a 4 10.
