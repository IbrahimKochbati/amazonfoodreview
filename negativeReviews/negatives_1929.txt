My sister gave her cats these and loved them, so I got them for my cats. Our 4 cats have been vomiting a lot lately, and we traced it back to these treats. Google whiskas temptations recall...they were recalled not too long ago and I don't know why they are still on shelves. Don't buy these... They will make your cat sick and who know what else it's doing to their internal system. Please keep your cats away from this product!
