I like the ingredients that these biscuits have    everything's organic    meat, veggies, and grains.  Each biscuit comes in two squares, so I tried to  eak the biscuit in half to separate the two squares and found it very difficult.  Those biscuits were hard!  I also smelled the biscuits and didn't notice much flavor scent at all.          I gave one square each to my two dogs.  While my one year old dog gobbled it up (as she does with everything, and may have swallowed it whole for all I know), my six year old dog was hesitant at first.  He sniffed it a bit and then had a very hard time taking that first bite into the very hard biscuit.  I think he was afraid of  eaking his teeth!  (And he chews on very hard toys bones rawhide.)  He didn't seem too wild about the taste either, as he wasn't in any rush to finish the square after he  oke into it.  They looked and probably tasted like cardboard, so I can see why.          I appreciate what Newman's is trying to do for dogs in giving them healthier snack alternatives, but please don't  eak my dogs' teeth!
