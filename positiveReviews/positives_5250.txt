I tried the Black Cherry version and liked it but this one is much better.  Great orange taste plus the benefit of juice.  And no corn syrup sweetner for those worried about its use.  The carbonation helps make it a satisfying drink to quench thirst and the knowledge that it is healthy satisfies the mind as well.
