I eat a handful of these walnuts daily for Omega 3 fatty acids with a diet coke as a great snack.  I eat 1 bag per week.  They taste great & they always have tasted fresh.  I empty 1 bag of walnuts in a plastic storeage container & either keep it in the fridge or in a kitchen cabinet.  I am about to order subscribe & save to save 6.00 on my next order.  I am sure that they would be great for baking as they are nicely chopped.
