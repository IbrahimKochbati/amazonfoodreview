My wife bought this for our Cane Corso when he was 8 weeks old.  He wakes up in the morning, does his job and gets that bottle and starts banging it around.  We all love it because it definately keeps him occupied and us laughing, where as he gets bored with the other toys.  Unfortunately, he's banged it around so much that he has actually  oken the bottle in two.  He's 4 1 2 months old now and even though it  oke, it did take a lot of beating and banging before it  oke so we will definately be getting another one.
