I drink this tea regularly to help with allergies.  It has been one of the few natural remedies that works really well for me.          If you can find a single box of this to try first, I would suggest that before buying a bulk amount like this.  The taste is very herbal, and many of the ingredients have a strong flavor on their own.  In general, I am not a fan of liquorish... at all, but I really like the taste of this tea.  The other flavors balance out the liquorish root really well and it comes across as more of an anise seed flavor.          I've also handed this tea off to family members getting over a head cold, and they have seen good results with this tea.
