Fantastic product. Keeps fresh for months. Had a bag in my desk that I had opened but packet was resealed, product still fresh after several weeks. Product has a spicy but not hot flavor and is enjoyed by my whole family. I am diabetic and have a hard time finding low sodium, low calorie snacks. Grandpa Po's products are both low sodium, low calorie and also taste great. I would highly recommend.
