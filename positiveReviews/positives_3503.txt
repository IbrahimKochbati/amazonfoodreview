OK  I have to admit I was a huge SB fan (you know, that big StellarMoney coffee chain on every corner). I didn't expect much from a coffee ordered online, but I take any thoughts back after the first sip of this smooth, rich coffee. There is none of the gritty, acidic after taste of other coffees; but instead a blooming, silky flavor of nuts, mocha, and pure coffee. Mind you, this isn't a flavored coffee, it has all of these nuances built into the Riviera Sunset Decaf blend. Oh  did I forget to mention it's decaf? I couldn't believe it myself when I looked at the bag the second day! I thought it was true, caffinated coffee by the flavor alone, though I did notice the lack of energizing (as would any decaf). Highly recommended... and I am switching!
