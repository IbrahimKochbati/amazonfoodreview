I don't know what possessed me to try this but am sure glad I did.  I made it per directions, just adding water and a can of tomato paste.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I didn't tell my SO there was no meat in it and thought it was awesome.  Couldn't believe the very low calories and high fiber.  A definite keeper and will be a staple in my pantry!
