I bought this immediately after finding out I could no longer have gluten. From everything I was reading it seemed daunting to mix different flours to make anything.          The boxes are SMALL!  While this mix is okay for making pancakes, the biscuits are alright, and to use it as a coating chicken fingers is 'eh', I'm glad I bought it when I was first diagnosed.  It helped ease my transition into gluten free cooking and baking.          Now that I know what I'm doing, I will not buy again.  It's much cheaper to make my own flour mixes at home and use those to make pancakes, biscuits, and  eaking for chicken fingers.  And my own mix tastes much better.  But, if you are new to gluten free, definetly pick this up, it will help with the transition!
