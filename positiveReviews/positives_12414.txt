I was looking for a good mix without alot of candy coated junk mixed into it and this one does the trick. Like the other reviewer says, there are alot of peanuts and raisins, but there are plenty of cranberries & almonds in that mix as well. I would say cashews and the yogurt covered raisins (about 15 per package) are what there are the fewest of. For me that's great because im trying to lose weight but i still like the addition of a few yogurt raisins too.          All in all 5 stars from me, you wont find a better healthy mix for around $2.50 a bag. If you get melted yogurt raisins from a hot summer delivery, just stick the entire bundled pack in the freezer when you get the package for 30 45 minutes, they come out just like new without damage to nuts.
