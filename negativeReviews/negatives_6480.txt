You cannot imagine my disappointment.  The other reviewers say just like Grandma's homemade.  I suppose it is possible that my Grandma was a better cook than yours.  These are awful preserves.  And that is the nicest thing I can say about them.          The packaging is spectacular, the quality, the flavor and the overall experience eating these preserves is way below par.  I did consume some, just hoping my initial experience was not good.  These preserves are terrible.  These are the worst tasting fig preserves I have ever tasted.  I was so excited reading they are just like Grandma's; I got the cherry flavored one too.  Yikes.          Side by side, you could not tell the difference in the two jars.  They tasted identical.  The fig did not taste anything like figs and the cherry did not taste anything like cherries.          They tasted identical.  They tasted awful.          I am very disappointed especially since after reading the other reviewers; I was really excited to have finally found some good fig preserves.
