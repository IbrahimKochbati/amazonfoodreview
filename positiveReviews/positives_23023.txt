I've tried different  ands, and different roasts, including gourmet coffees, but I always keep coming back to Folgers Classic.  To me, it offers a smooth, relatively full bodied flavor, without being overpowering or bitter.          Happily, it is usually among the lower priced coffees.  I don't buy on price alone, so this is an added bonus for me.
