This sauce is most definitely hot.  Not intolerable, but definitely hot, the hottest I own and I have sauces made from the Ghost Pepper. I put a drop about the diameter of a pea on a tortilla chip.  Immediately you have the flavor, which isn't too bad to be honest.  Kind of a dark, smoky, pepper fruit flavor.  Then the heat shows up and keeps building from a tinge until your mouth feels like its glowing.  Maybe its because I wasn't an idiot who took a spoonful of the stuff, but there was no 30 minute burn.  The real burn lasted 5, *maybe* 10 minutes.  The gut bomb that everyone talks about?  Nonexistent.  And I am not one of these people who claim to eat habaneros plain on their own, because I don't.  Personally I have to call BS on the people that say that.  Its a bit expensive for a 2 oz bottle, but when all it takes to give something a pleasant heat is a drop or two without changing flavor, its worth the price.  This sauce will last you for a while.          Final thought:  Dont be a hero and try to take a whole spoonful of this.  Not only is it too expensive to use it like that, but take that much and you will regret it.
