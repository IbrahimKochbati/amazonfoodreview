I have a very different opinion than the first reviewer. I think the Triple Berry Granola is simply great. Its tasty and full of whole grain goodness. It may need more berries though. Sometimes you can get a bag that has no berries in it. Try some for yourself and see if you like it. By the way its full of fiber and is very good for you.
