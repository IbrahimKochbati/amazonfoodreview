I was not able to find potato starch in my local stores. I went to specialty cake decorating stores and was told that this product could be found in the regular super markets....not the case. I came across this cake recipe which called for the potato starch and I wanted to use the ingredients stated. I was so happpy when I found the product in small and large quantities. This is a web site that I will definitely book mark. The end product was a beautiful looking and great tasting cake.
