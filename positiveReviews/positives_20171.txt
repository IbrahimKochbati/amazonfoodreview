I have really enjoyed using this coconut sugar.  I used it when baking oatmeal chocolate chip cookies and the flavor and texture were great.  I've tried substituting agave in cookies and the texture suffers so I am pleased to have a healthier sugar alternative.  I cannot (and more importantly, the kids cannot) detect any flavor difference.  It's worth switching to Madhava!
