Honestly    I do prefer my own recipe (which is to use an egg batter,  eading and hot oil and butter in a pan).          But we (spouse and self) just tried this product and we consumed a lot less fat and calories using Shake'N Bake. My husband's first words were: "Oh, this is good!" And then, the more he ate, the more he thought he "tasted vegetables." By the time he finished, he said, "It was okay." My first (and lasting) impression was that I tasted, along with the pork chop, a hint of thyme and paprika and not much else.          Shake'N Bake adds 40 calories per chop, but my recipe would have added more than that (egg dip plus  eadcrumbs). Plus if each chop would absorb 3 tablespoons of oil, another 360 calories (and 42g of fat) per chop would be added. We're always looking for ways to remove calories and fat from our meals. From that perspective, I really like this product! (Isn't there always a trade off between additives, calories, fat, carbs and how something tastes?)          I also thought Shake'N Bake was a lot less messy and much more convenient than my recipe. (There was no runny egg wash dish to rinse out, no sticky  eadcrumb mess to clean up and no greasy frying pan or grease splatter.) After shaking the pork, I simply threw away the plastic bag. (I supplied my own ziplock bag.)          I had enough coating for six boneless pork chops. After coating each chop, I shook it a little and placed it in an ungreased baking dish. My oven must run a little slow, because I ended up baking the chops longer than the recommended 15 minutes.
