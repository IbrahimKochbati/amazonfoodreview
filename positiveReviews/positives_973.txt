I purchased this product because I have previously used it and it is not always easy to locate on store shelves.  I prefer it to other powdered custard(pudding) products for ease of making and taste. It's wonderful in trifles or just about any pudding type dessert you want to make. Amazon gets the product to you almost immediately and at a reasonable price.
