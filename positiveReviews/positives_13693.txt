Ok, living in Chicago one would think we would have everything, right?  Well, these little green apple flavored wisps of goodness are very hard to come by.  Walgreen's use to carry them till one day, a year ago, they all of a sudden disappeared.  We tried to find them at any and all Walgreen's and CVS, but to no avail.  Now we knew the only place that we could find them was Fry's Electronics, but we do not go out there all that often.  When we do go to Fry's you can bet your butt we stock up by taking most if not all of them off the shelves (21 bags last time).  Some people we know were in town from NH over Memorial Day weekend and we took them out to eat, in return they sent us a 5lb bag of gummie frogs!  You could imagine my surprise when I walked back to my desk from lunch and found a box from Amazon that was squishy.  I opened that puppy and was like OMG!!!  Yeah, the bf  eezed through the 5lb bag in about a weeks time sharing them with co workers (mostly consuming them himself) and with myself (i still have my little zip lock baggie in my camera bag : ) ).  I just ordered 2 5lb bags of these yummy frogs and hopefully they will last a lot longer then the first one : )
