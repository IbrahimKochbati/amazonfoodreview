I purchased these tea bags in hope for a good night sleep. The first night I drank it, I slept great.  I have continued to drink this every night and I still sleep well but I find myself waking up in the middle of the night once in a while.  I do find myself urinating more often so maybe it is cleaning me out.  No bad side effects, tastes good alone, no sugar or honey needed.  I recommended this to my family and co workers and they all love it.  I discovered this from Dr. Oz.  Hoping to continue to sleep well.
