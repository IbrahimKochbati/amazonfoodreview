Wow, I can't believe I just placed my fourth order for the 5 lbs. pack. Compared to the "Hapi" wasabi peas at the grocery store, these are about 27% of the price, a great savings. But there are other differences to consider. These peas are hotter, saltier and harder than the "Hapi" product. With the "Hapi" peas, there is no way I can achieve a good wasabi burn, even by the mouthful. But don't fill your mouth with these. Three or four at a time give me plently of heat. And around 8 to 10 of these at once leave me screaming for a quick and painless death   I love it!          As others have noted, these peas are harder too. Not rock hard, but every once in a while I find one where it is simply better to discard it than risk any damage. I always chew on these gently, to avoid any issues. If you are a fan of burning your nasal hair with wasabi heat, try them! If not, better stick with the Hapi line. Both are good to me, it just depends on which mood I am in.
