I had fed my dogs Science Diet and Iams for years, but I grew concerned after all the recalls of tainted food. I did some research and found Canidae, which only uses high quality ingredients from the U.S.A. My dogs like it just as much as Iams and Science Diet and I feel great because they're eating healthier food.
