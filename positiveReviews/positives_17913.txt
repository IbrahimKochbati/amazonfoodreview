You really can't beat a handy Shake and Bake packet on a night when time is pressing and hungry kids are waiting. All the Shake and Bake products seem to have this time saving benefit of just rinse your meat, shake, bake, and serve. So, the question to address is the flavoring. The flavoring was average. It's not something you would want to eat on a daily basis (as you would get tired of it) but it's certainly tastey enough for a 'once a month' family dinner. When you need something quick, easy, and don't have time to be frying... this is the way to go.
