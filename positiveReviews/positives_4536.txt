This is the good kind of fat, and tastes great.     I actually like the taste better than butter.  It has a similar quality  rich, indulgent, blends well with foods, and it is way healthier than butter.  Not as aggressive tasting as olive oil.     I have substituted it for butter every chance I get, with good results. (disclaimer  I'm not much of a cook...)          Please buy this, so Amazon will keep it in stock for me.  It costs much more in stores, and is hard to find
