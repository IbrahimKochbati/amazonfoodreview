My family has been on a hunt for crackers that are lower in carbohydrates and these fit the bill. We eagerly purchased a box and were delighted to find that they are the best crackers ever. Even if I did not have to restrict my carbohydrate intake, I would happily purchase these. We use them to replace  ead for open face sandwiches as well as a serving bed for scrambled eggs etc. Treat yourself, they are well worth the price and you will not be disappointed!
