The label on the little bag says 1 serving is 120 calories. But one serving is 1 ounce. The little single serving sized bag is 1.5 ounces! So there are 180 calories in the bag. This is sneaky. No one is going to open their bag and measure out one ounce, then save the other half ounce...          EDITED TO ADD:     I ordered these again because the price went down momentarily (is now back up) and the product is now changed. Although Amazon still had it listed at 12, 1.5 ounce bags, what I got is 12, 1.2 oz bags. So now yes, one bag is a serving but the nutrition facts do not add up to what was listed before. Now a bag has 120 calories and 15g carbs. Another sneaky move, you get less for the same price.
