I've been using this for my dog for just about a year now.  For the first 3 1 2 years of his life he had regular bouts of the poops, even though he was getting a premium kibble.  He used to pick at his food,  it took him hours to finish his bowl.  He LOVES Dr. Harveys, and has not had a loose stool since on this food.  I will never use anything else.
