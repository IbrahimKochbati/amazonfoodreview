I am thrilled that my dogs got to sample these new, organic dog treats. I've been a fan of Newman's Own treats for a while and my dogs love them. I have been looking for a *Large* size treat since the last company I bought treats from discontinued making theirs. These treats are a good size rectangle which are scored so you can  eak them in half if you wish. I won't be  eaking them in half because I want my dogs to have a good sized treat between meals which will keep their belly full. They're *good and crunchy* which is wonderful for keeping tarter in check, and they smell like the earth.          They are made from organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic apples, organic palm oil and organic molasses. Excellent !! There is also a cute story on the back of the bag about Paul Newman's dog which is very creative and amusing. I'm so happy to have found these snacks !! I also love the option for *Subscribe & Save* on Amazon.com with free shipping with 6 bags shipped all at once. A great deal and a great product !! I can't wait until they become available.
