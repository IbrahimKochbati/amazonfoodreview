At first, I thought these tasted a little artificial. After a few handfuls I realized I like them, regardless.          I am a big fan of this company's products, and have even gone so far as to speak with one of their growers about the integrated pest management systems they employ (using the smallest amount of pesticides possible).  I will keep buying all their other flavors. The Bold line, especially the Habanero, is also excellent, as are the dark chocolate variety.
