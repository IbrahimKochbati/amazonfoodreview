The price is cheap for a reason. This is some of the toughest jerky that i've ever had, and I've been eating jerky for over 35 years. Too much dried fat to be able to pull the stuff apart with your teeth. Flavor was good on about 50% of the pieces. The others had little or none. I think this stuff would be much better suited as a dog treat for a small  eed. For me, it's pretty awful.          I also got a bag of the peppered type. That review is pending.
