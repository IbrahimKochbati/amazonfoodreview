For those who need some darn good chili fast, here's the answer. This stuff is very open to doctoring and I highly recommend adding at least 12oz of ground beef. Not a huge fan of the rice but I found it to be hardly noticeable. It's a mild chili, so for spice add either cayenne powder or chili powder. About two TBL of cayenne powder whisked in added a nice additional kick for my batch. The alternate recipe on the back of the bag calls for chopped tomatoes but I feel they are unnecessary. My additions were toppings; sweet onions and shredded cheddar. Usually skip the sour cream in favor of ice cream for dessert. Knocks out heat real quick.
