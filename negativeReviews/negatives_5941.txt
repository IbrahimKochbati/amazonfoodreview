This stuff was awful. It tasted like water soaked in Cherios except the Cherios had a better flavor. This mud had no coffee aroma or flavor! My stomach was still aching so I really dont know how low acid or decaf this sewage was. As an unexpected bonus I also got a terrible headache.What a bunch of crap!
