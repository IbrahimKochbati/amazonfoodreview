When we adopted our 6 year old Basset Hound from a foster home, her back teeth had so much build up that they were actually  own.  Now after four months, they are not completely back, but they are about 75% better. Although they are not inexpensive, I think they do a good job.  And she also enjoys them very much.  I have checked many places and have found Amazons prices to be the best so far.
