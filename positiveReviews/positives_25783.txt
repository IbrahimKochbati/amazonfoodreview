After years of drink the same old Folgers drip coffee a group of us decided to purchase a Keurig unit for our office.  When any one of us purchase a pack of K Cups we often share with other so that we can find our favorite, and not spend on those that just are not up to par.  I enjoyed the flavor of the Italian roast, and the people that I shared it with said they did too.  So far, out of the ten or so K Cup "flavors" that I have tried this is my favorite.  Being that it is a "bold" coffee   I can change the cup volume setting of my Keurig unit to alter the boldness...a larger setting yields a slightly less bold cup, and the smaller cup setting will increase the boldness of the taste.  Of course you can do this with any coffee, this coffee seems to fit the boldness range that i desire.
