My 7 year old daughter thought it was good tasted like pop but only drank 1 2 of the can. I thought it tasted like watered down orange soda with very little fizz with funny after taste. It is suppose to be  100% juice with vitamin C that has been carbonated. Ok here is my thought either buy 100% orange juice that taste like it came right of the tree or buy a orange pop. For me this product won't be flying off the shelves.
