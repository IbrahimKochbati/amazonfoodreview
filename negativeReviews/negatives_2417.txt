taste is not like other pork rinds.  but does not taste bad.  when you microwave them, the bag only pops up about half way.  when its done popping and you eat them immediately, they are pretty hot and seem to melt in your mouth.  needing much water and a  ushing to get the rinds and the taste out of your mouth afterwards.  I think the idea is pretty good, but the product did not turn out how they expected in my opinion.
