I have a 11 yr old Pomimo (1 2 Pomeranian, 1 2 American Eskimo) who seems to only like human food. Although I'd love to give him human food all the time, I know it's not good for his digestive system, and it doesn't have the proper nutrients required for a dog, especially at his current age. Upon trying various  ands including Blue and Call of the Wild, I couldn't justify the price in comparison to how little my dog liked the taste. After reading some positive reviews here on Amazon for Newman's, I decided to give it a go. Surprisingly, my dog started eating the food immediately after I poured some into his dish. He never does that with other dry dog food, and usually waits to eat after I've given him a nibble of everything that I eat during the day. What makes it even better is the reasonable price for the quality. Yes, I understand that organic and quality US made food are naturally more expensive, however some of the  ands charge double of Newman's and provide only half the taste. As humans, we're usually sold by the nutritious & wholesome advertisements when buying dog food, however I think its pretty important for my dog to actually like the taste of the food also. Newman's seems to be the ticket for both nutrition and taste. Will be buying Newman's as a regular!
