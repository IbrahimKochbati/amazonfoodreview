Baxters soups are usually very nice, but the lobster bisque is especially good. It tastes authentic, it has a good flavour, is creamy, and has just enough lobster bits to make it interesting. Add some fresh black pepper and a dash of  andy or sherry and it rivals soup served in a very good restaurant.          It's also surprisingly low calorie. Though the nutrition info here says 130 calories for 8oz, the label actually says 120 calories, so even if you ate the whole can for lunch you would consume only about 220 calories.
