My Maltese absolutely LOVES anything that Exclusively Pets makes. But if you really want to train your pet, give him or her a cheese treat! The greatest thing about their products is that they smell exactly like whatever the package says. The cheese treats smell like Cheez It! The carob cookie treats smell like chocolate chip cookies... So forth and so on. I used to buy these locally but saved buying them online.
