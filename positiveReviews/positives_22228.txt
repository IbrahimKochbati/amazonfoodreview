Well what a surprise!  This stuff is really quite easy and good.  I used my vitamix to make the dough and it was a bit too much for it (sticky)   unfortunately hand blended is easier on kitchen equipment.  But you don't have to worry about handling the dough too much.  The thinner the end product the better it cooks inside. My current fav is a mini french  ead loaf.  Crispy outside and slightly 'holey' inside. I made cheese  ead sticks in with the plain mix and kneeding shredded cheese into it.  There is a slight odd, but not objectionable, taste which dipping in chili or smearing with butter covers up.  Next project   PIZZA!!!!!
