I've had pork rinds in the bag and all, and they were usually stale with no flavor.  Since these are cooked fresh, they come out nice and warm.  They have a slight bacon flavor and aren't greasy like potato chips are.  A little salty, but very good.  I can't find them in any of the stores here either, so I'm happy Amazon has t hem.
