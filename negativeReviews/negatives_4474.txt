Canidae was the best food for my lab for the last 5 years until they changed the formula in June.  OMG...what a disaster from the very first bowl with the new formula(which I did mix with some of the old stuff to transition him).  I'm so disappointed...and no notice on the bag about the new formulation????  The old stuff worked GREAT, but I'm sure to save a few bucks, they've changed to cheaper ingredients.  Well I'm DONE.  My dog has had the worst gas and runny stools.  I now need to find a food that he can handle which is not an easy task since he's got skin allergies...and I won't buy just anything...it's got to be topnotch.  Canidae was ideal with the old formula...not so anymore...  Any suggestions out there on what I can transition to???
