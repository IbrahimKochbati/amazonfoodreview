I found that best way to  ew this is to use the drip style coffee maker. 1 tea bag for 12 cups of coffee. I tried in a pot of hot water but coffee maker extracts the most tea out. It tasted funny at first but it's not unbearable. It's much easier to drink while it's hot or warm. At first, I couldn't drink it cold because of its strong flavor. I also found that this helps with digestion too. After a big holiday meal, I drink this and I never get indigestion.
