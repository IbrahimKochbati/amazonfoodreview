This product works great for me.  I hate spending money on herbs just to use a little and have the rest go bad shortly after.  I put some herbs (mostly basil) in here and they were fresh for a few weeks!  No leakage probs either, the bottom is clearly labeled to twist to lock and the plug stays flush.     This thing has already paid for itself in money saved and looks pretty cool in my fridge and on the counter when I'm ready to cook.
