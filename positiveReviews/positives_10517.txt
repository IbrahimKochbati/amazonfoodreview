I used to buy this in the individual packages for about $12 for 6 servings, so I was really glad to find this canister. I add coffee instead of water in the morning, to make a low carb, high protein cafe mocha. It does have a little "diet taste" but not bad at all. Be sure to stir thoroughly with a fork. I also add it to chocolate smoothies in the blender.
