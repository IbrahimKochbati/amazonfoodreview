While I have not purchased this from Amazon I have used it for many years.  It makes a super layer for, my version, of Zuppa Engelesia and mixed with cream can be incorporated for Pate Choux.     I don't live in Hollywood any more so it is getting more difficult and thanks to Amazon I find it it available and in larger cans.........  I plan to order soon.
