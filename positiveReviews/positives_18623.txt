I don't get how some people say the rawhide does not last? I have a BIG Black Lab who can chew up a store bought 2 foot rawhide in less than an hour. That being said this one has lasted a week now. I am so pleased with this product that this is our 8th purchase of the different styles offered. Our furry baby just loves them. A PLUS to this product, it is not only good for his hips and joints, but he digests this one easily. Unlike the cheap store bought ones he has choked up and has gotten sick from. We have no complaints about this rawhide at all. Just wish they came even bigger. Best rawhide we have ever bought and we will not go back to the store bought ones now.
