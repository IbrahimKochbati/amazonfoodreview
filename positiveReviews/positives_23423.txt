My cat loves this flavor of food!  (Beware of the salmon flavor, as my cat isn't picky, but absolutely detested that flavor.)  I was very impressed to find that Amazon carried this  and food and for a great price too.  I had originally ordered it at PetSmart and not only was the price much higher, but I had to pay $14 in shipping.  Great buy on Amazon!!
