My golden retriever was very excited to try out this new toy!  The first time we gave it to him it took several minutes to get all the tops off and get the food; however, by the third time it was introduced to him he had mastered it in 1 2 minutes.  We now use it as a way to feed him full meals so that he doesn't eat too fast.  Love that it is dishwasher safe but wish it kept him entertained a while longer.
