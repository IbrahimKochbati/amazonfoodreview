Starbucks Sumatra is a little better than a few others I've tried. Sumatra is a great earthy change of pace. Unfortunately, it loses flavor and the potent aroma the minute you open the bag. It also sours quickly if you leave it on the heat for more than a few minutes. This is not a flavor I can drink daily, but that is unfortunate because the flavor doesn't last long enough in the bag to use it within a week either(pot a day). So in the end, I'd rather just buy this flavor as a fresh cup down the street at the local shop once in a while. As a daily drinker, my palate is in tune with the Melitta's Enchanted Evening.
