I like the convenience of having canned chicken on hand. It's great for soup or salad. However, I found the flavor of the Swanson's canned chicken to be good, however, the texture was so soft, it just seems to mush away into whatever you're making. My kids LOVE chicken salad, and they were so happy to see I had just made some. One taste and they were like, what's this? Why is it so soft, so mushy. I bought a dozen cans, so I have to finish them up and we will be eating mushy chicken salad for awhile. I don't recommend this product.
