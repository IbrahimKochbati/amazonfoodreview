If you had a lot of lamb in your life you'd be impressed with how "lammy" this dog food smells. Our little dog absolutely loves it too. Why wouldn't he?          A hidden advantage of using this food is that you don't have to pick up much poo at all. Because this food is nearly twice as concentrated as kibble you'd only be picking up about half as much poo, which is a good benefit. Also, it takes up half as much space in your storage.          An all around winner which more than makes up for the small premium in price.
