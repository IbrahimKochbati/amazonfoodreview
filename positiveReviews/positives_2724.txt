I first encountered this flavor at an airport magazine stand.  I sampled a couple and was hooked.  I thought this flavor was the best of all in the TicTac line.  On my flight, I was munching on the pack absent mindedly.  I landed with the idea of buying several packs.  Then came the rude surprise   Grapefruit flavor is not a common sight on TicTac stands   anywhere.          I finally settled on this purchase as the only way to maintain a steady supply.  This flavor of TicTac is best used as a "chaser", following a heavy duty  eath freshening from TicTac Power Mint, the blue color.  Not only is Power Mint effective, it also numbs out my tongue for several minutes.  A follow up with a single Grapefruit restores my mouth to normality.          I rate Grapefruit as the best flavor, with Watermelon and the new Strawberry Foelds close seconds.  In general any flavor TicTac is effective  eath freshening, but Grapefruit is truly addicting.  TicTac settles the issue that the tongue is a major contributor to sour  eath.
