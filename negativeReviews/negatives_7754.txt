Oatmeal is a great food. I question the supposed suggested savings being offered.     Since when did a canister of Oatmeal cost $35?          That is what Amazon is saying the list price is.     In reality the average price is $3 to $5.     In fact, at this writing, Amazon actually lists a single 18oz canister as being available for $3.89     see
