My son has food allergies to wheat, dairy, and peanuts. I've tried other gluten free pancake mixes and none compare to this one. I tried this mix with just water and enjoy life gluten free dairy free chocolate chips and they were delicious! I decided to experiement and I added one egg and 3 4 cup water to the mix with chocolate chips mixed in and they were fluffy and delicious. We ate them all up and I am so happy to find something my son can enjoy that tastes good. I am back to order more.
