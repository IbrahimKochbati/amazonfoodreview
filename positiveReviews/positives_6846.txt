Buster is a recovering shelter dog, and a little picky in his eating sometimes. I've tried a lot of food treats, and some things he won't eat at all or is allergic to. (Note: he has no problems with steak that I've seen, lol)          The Zuke's line of products are now his favorites; I've tried several items in the Zuke's line, and he loves all of them. The Jerky Naturals Lamb has a strong smell, (thus a strong flavor too, I guess) and he really goes for that.          USA made too, so all in all, highly recommended!
