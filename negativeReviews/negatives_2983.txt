I was hoping for the sourness of a hard Warheads candy with a sort of gummy center, but this was not it. The outside was only mildly sour, and it's gone within about 10 15 seconds, then you're left with the chewy (not so much gummy) center. I was hoping it would be chewy like a gummy worm, but it was actually just sticky and soft. Not very appealing. It stuck to my teeth constantly! I found myself sucking the little bit of sourness off, then spitting out the chewy part. Not that great for me, hopefully others will enjoy it!
