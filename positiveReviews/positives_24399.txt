We have 4 cats a little over 1 year old. We started out feeding them Blue Buffalo but they were always very gassy and 2 of the cats were getting plump.. while another was too skinny. So we ventured into trying other  ands healthy or otherwise. They can be a bit picky but they eventually got used to anything. "Their" favorite was the Purina stuff... but that's just like us loving junk food isn't it...while the 1 skinny one did attain a normal weight the 2 plump ones became quite fat! So eventually we picked up this Goodlife  and, for indoor cats. They took to it well and before we knew it the 2 fat cats are down to a healthy weight. The skinny cat is looking a little skinnier too but she has maintained a healthy weight with this stuff. It's been about 5 months now and they are all still very healthy and I am very Happy with this  and and this particular recipe (indoor). It has been a perfect balance for all 4 of our cats. We did try the all ages a couple of times but it doesn't seem to satisfy them as well and they eat a lot more of it.
