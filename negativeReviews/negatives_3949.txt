I did not know that Pace Mexican Four Cheese was discontinued until just now when I googled... my husband just went to 4 different grocery stores looking for it since that is one of the ingredients of one of my very best personal recipes!!  I am very disappointed that once again a company discontinued something that was JUST FINE!!! Now I have to write Pace next. :((
