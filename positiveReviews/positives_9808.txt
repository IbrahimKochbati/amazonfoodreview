Wisdom Natural Brands Stevia Dark Concentrate is a chocolate lover's answer to the taste without the calories! I always use it in my coffee. It sweetens & flavors it just right! The only thing that bothered me once I received my order was that the label says chocolate, not dark chocolate. When I called the company, they told me it is the same dark chocolate that it's always been, that they just changed the label. Honestly, that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. If it's dark chocolate, label it such. Even so, the flavor is great, as far as I'm concerned.
