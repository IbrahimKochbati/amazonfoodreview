Organic, and loaded with calories, fat and protein, this the ONLY baby food with meat that my picky little one will happily eat.  I've found that very few groceries carry this near my home (and I live in metropolitan Seattle) and so I've resorted to ordering it by the case from Amazon.  The free 2 day shipping Rocks!
