Having been on a gluten free diet for less than a year, i was scared that gluten free foods would be flavorless and disappointing. This has certainly been true for some of my previously favorite foods, but not with Bakery on Main's granola. It's delcious! I was not disappointed at all. Great texture, and satifsying crunch as well!
