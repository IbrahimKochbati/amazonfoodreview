My wife is on this soy kick where soy can do no wrong and milk is all wrong ("cow milk is for calves, not humans"). Of all the soy drinks that she's  ought home I like Vitasoy the best.  I'm not much for unsweetened soy milk, and this is the least sugary of them and has a mild taste. Best of all, these come in serving sized containers that need no refrigeration. It even has a straw taped to the side. A great alternative to sugary drinks and soda if you don't want your kids drinking those things.          Now if my wife can only explain why if cow milk is unnatural for humans, what's natural about harvesting soy beans from a field, grinding them into paste and making a drink out of it? I guess to her the most natural drink would be to bottle up human milk and have that with your cornflakes but I think I'll take a pass on that...
