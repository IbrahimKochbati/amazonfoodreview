Kettle  and chips are very crunchy.  I would say regular plain old Lays potato chips are at the "soft" end of the "soft crunchy" spectrum.  Ruffles  and potato chips used to be considered the crunchiest, but Kettle  and chips are far more crunchy.  If you have a tender mouth or bad teeth (dentures) you might want to steer clear of Kettle  and.  Otherwise, you'll love these chips.  The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are super TANGY.  I enjoy taking swigs of vinegar bottles from time to time.  I am dissapointed with all other Salt & Vinegar chips either because the chips are too soft and or the vinegar taste whimpy and or chemically.  Rest assured Kettle Sea Salt & Vinegar has a gourmet flavor.  The vinegar flavor has no chemical flavor and could NEVER be called whimpy!
