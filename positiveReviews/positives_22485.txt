I first found this company on ebay.  I purchased one of their poppers and popcorn.  Shipping was quick and the popcorn was awesome.  Love how simple to make the popcorn with all the fixings in the bag.  If someone is on a reduced sodium diet it is very simple to not allow some or all of the butter flavored salt to go into the hopper.  I've found just the oil has a great flavor too!          Floyd
