I'm not really a tea drinker but my husband is and he loves this tea. He drinks several cups a day and can't do without it. So on his behalf I'm recommending it.          I did taste it and went yuck but I'm not a tea lover. In fact I hate tea so disregard my comments and just go on my hubby's recommendation.
