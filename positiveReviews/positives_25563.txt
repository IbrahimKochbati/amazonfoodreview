I bought this tea not just for the health benefits, but because I'm a fan of red teas, period. I always keep a 1 gallon jug in the fridge for both iced tea and to "nuke" for hot tea. The color is lovely and the taste is heavenly. It doesn't require a lot of sweetening, but I've used both sucralose and stevia and both taste fine (as well as sugar free raspberry syrup   YUM!). And yes, my very inconsistent blood pressure went down from the 125 130 systolic range down to 115. Pretty amazing stuff, highly recommended.
