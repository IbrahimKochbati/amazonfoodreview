This was just not my cup of tea   er, I mean coffee (har har). It had a sharp, acrid taste to it, and left a bitter aftertaste. I'm not a coffee connosisseur by any means, but I know what I like and I know what I don't like, and I don't like this. I would not recommend it, especially with so many other Keurig coffee options.
