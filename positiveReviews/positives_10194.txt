These pill pockets work great and I don't have to fight to get the pills down my dog's throat. She thinks they are a treat. You don't have to use an entire pill pocket per pill. Because they are soft, you can mold it easily around the pill, using just the amount needed to cover the pill. This way you can get maximum use out of each pocket & they last longer.
