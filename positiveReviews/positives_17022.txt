I bought the Tug a Jug after having bought the Twist n Treat. It's a good toy, but I would say it's ideal for a dog of above average intelligence. The Twist n Treat only requires your dog to nose it over. This one has a more complex mechanism that requires more work. Our dog couldn't get much out of it the first few tries but she is very food motivated and now can empty one in about an hour or so. The advice to fill it more than half full on the first go is good. In all, I like this toy, because it's harder and requires more time and effort from a dog that the typical treat dispenser, which is good if you want to give you dog something to occupy her. If you are looking for a first food dispensing toy, I would recommend getting the Twist n Treat first, however.
