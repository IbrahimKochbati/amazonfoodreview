Chia seeds are a great, healthy food to add to your diet. I make chia gel by mixing them with water (1 2 C. per tablespoon of seeds), then stir the gel into yogurt, oatmeal, smoothies . . . it's flavorless and the seeds have a pleasant crunch. This  and is high quality and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.
