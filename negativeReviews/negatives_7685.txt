Yeah, yum.. If you like candied liquid smoke. I've never tried Walden Farm's before but the idea of 0 calorie, scratch that, *TRACE* calories and zero carbs. Wait, there's Splenda and it has half a carb per serving, plus tomato paste which also has carbs and other things on the ingredients that you can't de carb.     Anyways, I digress, the idea of very little calories and very little carbs sounded too good to be true and yep. I drizzled it onto a grilled chicken wrap and bit in. Oh my god. The first thing to hit was a overly sweetness and not a real one, the chemical kind, bletch. The next thing to hit was a smokey taste, and again, not a very good one. It was way too strong and chemical tasting.     It ruined my wrap. I should have tasted it separately, but I thought for sure it couldn't be that bad, plus the taste of the Cajun seasonings on the chicken would help hide the taste. I was wrong. By the time I got to the end of the wrap where the liquid fool's gold had collected and bit through, it was way too much. I spit it out and threw the rest away. And all this from a small drizzle down the middle, after all, I was trying it.     I couldn't imagine pouring this on something and grilling that nastiness into it.     The other reviewers who gave it 5 stars. I don't know what they were thinking. Or maybe Walden Farm's changed the recipe but I didn't get spicy at all in this. It was a bottle of chemically candied chemical smoke flavor.     Absolutely horrid. I'd advise staying away unless you like wasting money, not just on this bottle of septic tank juices, but anything it touches. I must now to gargle Listerine and  ush.
