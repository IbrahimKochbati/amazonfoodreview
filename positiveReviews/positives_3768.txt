I have been experimenting with K cup  ews for almost 2 years now.  I tried Timothy's Colombia Excelencia ONLY because it was on sale and I was still looking for THE ONE.  Well, I finally found it.  Columbia Excelencia is the best  eakfast coffee I have found to date.  Rich, full bodied, with a clean non acrid finish.  It goes well with milk and Splenda, no odd aftertaste whatsoever.  Donut shop is my favorite over ICE, Newman's Nantucket is my favorite BOLD, Timothy's Italian goes best with dessert, and Colombia Excelencia is the first thing I drink every morning.
