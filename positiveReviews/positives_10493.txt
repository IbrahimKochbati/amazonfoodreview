If you purchase saffron then chances are you have encountered at least one of my other saffron reviews. I've tried most of it from Amazon after finding it exceptionally difficult to purchase decent saffron in my small town. Unfortunately, nothing replaces the truly exceptional delight that is pure saffron so my search for superior saffron continues.          There we no other reviews on this and I was a bit hesitant to purchase an entire 1 ounce tin especially from the Roland  and name which is often associated with imports from China. The description did not even indicate if this saffron was from Spain or not but the price was ultra right (also somewhat suspect since it was such a good price).          First, set your mind at ease...this saffron is indeed from Spain rather than the often inferior products from elsewhere. It comes sealed in a plastic bag inside a decorative tin but even at that, the aroma was clearly evident before opening the shipping box.          As for the quality of the saffron. It's good but not great. To test, I make a standard dish and compare the quantity required to  ing it to the right level of taste...it required more than that of the Frontier  and of Saffron (very fresh but the selection of packaging requires it to "air out" due to lingering odor from plastic liner) but not nearly as much as some of the other dried little sad saffron selections I've encountered in local grocery stores or even via ordering here online.          The actual touch texture also denotes a fair level of freshness rather than the dry stubble of inferior  ands but wasn't quite as supple as I'd normally desire.          Fragrance   very nice and aromatic.          Overall   for the price, I'm very pleased. It will not be my first choice on the finest dishes BUT it does provide a very solid option for general use with a price that won't make me cringe.          On a side note, Amazon and or the Roland  and ran a special promotion for an additional percentage off all Roland products...combined with the subscribe and save option this was the best price per ounce I've EVER encountered for true Spanish saffron. Keep an eye out for guilt free, affordable saffron you can use in any dish rather than having to save for special dishes only.
