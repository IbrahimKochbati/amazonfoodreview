They're magically delicious.          Okay...but seriously ... great price, cereal arrived promptly and in good shape.  I especially like the Amazon automatic shipment program for cereals:  it gives you an additional 15% discount, you set the shipment intervals and you can cancel at any time.  Go for it!
