These are the most flavorful gummi bears I have ever tasted. I came back and ordered the 5 pound bag after just trying a few. They are incredibly soft and have a great mouth feel. I shared some with my coworkers and now they ask for them all the time! I haven't heard a bad thing about them yet. Definitely worth it to go for the 5 lb bag.
