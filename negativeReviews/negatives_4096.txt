I'm giving this three stars because it's so low in calories and doesn't cause gastrointestinal effects. It worked fine when I made my own mint chocolate with unsweetened chocolate and mint extract. That tasted good. But, it was terrible when I made chocolate biscotti (Xylitol works fine). I had to throw the big batch away. It has a strong "cotton candy" aftertaste.          The gastrointestinal effects of Xylitol can be mostly overcome by gradually increasing the amount you eat over time. It tastes much better than Erythritol. But, as I mentioned, you can make a very interesting bitter mint chocolate with it. The erythritol doesn't dissolve so at first the taste is very bitter not sweet chocolate. Then, as the erythritol dissolves in your mouth, you get a burst of sweetness and cooling effect. The cooling effect of the erythritol is so powerful that is enhances the mint. The chocolate overcomes the "cotton candy" aftertaste if you don't use too much erythritol.
