I thought these would be the perfect answer. Sadly, I guess the pressure with which my Keurig machine shoots the water through the k cup is too much for the disposa cup, because every single time I tried it, coffee grounds were spewed up through the tiny hole in the lid of the disposa cup all over the inside of where the k cup sits in my keurig. And yes, I used them properly.          So the issue, at least in my Keurig machine, seems to be with the lids. Some have suggested its a design flaw with the Keurig machine. In either case, these disposa cups were NOT the answer for me.          Biggest waste of money ever. I cannot recommend.
