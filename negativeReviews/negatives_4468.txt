I have an otherwise healthy and active 1 year old Rottweiler.  I switched her from Blue Buffalo to Canidae, as it came highly recommended by the holistic pet store I frequent (they are going to be the next to get an earful from me!!!).          Shortly after, I noticed her stool became loose, which is common when you change a dog's diet (I mixed the new food with the old for a week, gradually increasing the amount of the new).  I figured it would get better after a few days.  In fact, it became increasingly worse to the point where spots of blood where showing up in her stool.          I took her to the vet thinking at this point she must have picked up a parasite.  The test came back negative.  My vet thought it must have been something she ate and recommended I feed her chicken and rice for a week to even her out.  I did this and the problem was solved.          After a week I put her back on her regular food  Canidae  and the problem she was having before began to return, albeit gradually.  We have now started to see spots of blood again.  This convinced me it was not just "something she picked up," but the dog food itself.          Now I have learned there is actually a CLASS ACTION SUIT against this dog food maker for the exact problem I described  in some cases people's dogs even died.  I will NEVER purchase this  and again and am switching my dog immediately back to Blue Buffalo  this time no mixing!!
