I have a bit of a sweet tooth. I've tried to ignore it in times past, but the reality is that I want  NEED  a cookie from time to time as a welcome addition to my  own bag lunch. These 1.4 ounce single servings make that easy without overdoing it. If I  ing one with me I know I'll only end up eating one package and not HALF of a 12 ounce package! Single servings help keep the portion size healthy while not killing your soul by ignoring your need for some desert...          Reasonably priced and shipped to your door, these are a great purchase.
