Hi, I am from the UK and we are used to all the varieties of naan  ead.     This  ead is eaten normally with indian food.  This is the best l have eaten since moving to the US 7yrs ago,my local Target has been supplying these  eads for the past few weeks but are ALWAYS out of stock!!     The best way to cook your naan is in the frying pan...a little olive oil and coat your naan  ead with water turn the naan  ead over as soon as it starts to turn  own.. the oven method is OK..but wait til you try it the correct way ;)))     I am definately going to order the box.
