I can just look at a carb and I gain weight.  This product allows me to eat pasta and not get all the high impact carbs on my blood sugar.  18 grams of fiber is outstanding! Unlike the other reviewer I think it tastes really good.  The texture is a little more chewy and thick but again this is something I like.  I dont miss white pasta at all when I eat this.
