If you deal with diabetes or hypoglycemia, please use real licorice products with care.  I ate some of this yesterdy (it was delicious!) and had to skip both my dinner insukin shots.  I also woke in the night with a reading of 66 too low for comfort!  So, if you have insulin resistance, please be aware that true licorice candies or extract may have an affect on your body.  BTW, I am buying more today to use medically.  (I just won't eat so much in one day) What a lovely way to get out of getting shots! : )
