I ordered the pork rinds as a Christmas gift for my father in law. (He is one who has everything, and if you buy him anything, he will put it up.)Then I ordered some for my husband, needless to say I took some to work with me. We all have fallen in love with them. During this time, I have contacted the grocery store and they have now put them in their store, for everyone to purchase and enjoy.
