I am a creature of habit, and when I purchased my Keurig, I tasted alot of the coffee  ands and flavors made for my appliance.  However, I never found one that I said "this could replace the coffee I am currently using".  So when I discovered the disposable K cups I was delighted.  The problem now was I did not purchase enough.  So now I am waiting on my second delivery.  Great service.
