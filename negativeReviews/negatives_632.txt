Bought 6lbs of this popcorn based on reviews that the hulls are softer on this Baby White than on regular popcorn.  Not only are the hulls just as tough as regular popcorn, the corn pops up so tiny that it's about 1 3 hull, 2 3 popped corn per kernel! I was hoping to use this as a healthy snack for my kids who love popcorn but not the hulls.     I popped this using every tip I could find on the internet; all experiments still resulted in a tough hull.
