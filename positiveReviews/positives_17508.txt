I sometimes use these on days where I haven't had much sleep or where I'm doing a ton of work. It does work, but it's not a clobber you over the head type energy that you get with an XXL Starbucks with 2 extra shots or Red Bull. The taste is a very bitter lemon, not the best, but tolerable for a bit of pep.
