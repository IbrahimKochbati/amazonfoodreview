I've had my Keurig coffee maker for over a year and have tried many different K cups. Most recently, the new Dunkin' Donuts. HATED IT.  I couldn't wait to dump it out and  ew one of my Emerils. Of course, with the Keurig  ewer, I didn't have to wait long. YUM.  This coffee is for the real coffee drinker. It is strong (even on the large cup size setting), bold and full bodied, but smooth with no bitterness.  By far, my favorite. I order them through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program for the best price. Once in awhile from Bed, Bath and Beyond with a 20% coupon, but their prices have gone up substantially and I prefer the size (50 pack) from Amazon.
