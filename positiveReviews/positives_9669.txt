We love these Wintergreen Altoids! While they are a very good  eath mint, we use them mainly for flavoring our coffee and sometimes, tea. One, in the bottom of the cup, or a few in the coffee tea pot makes life more interesting! Also, good with just a touch of hot cocoa, added along with Altoids, in coffee. And yes, they are good in hot cocoa, too. Very inexpensive, easy way to flavor coffee or tea, much cheaper than alternative. Almost no calories, but big on flavor! We've used these for decades!
