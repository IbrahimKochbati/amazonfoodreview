The coffee is strong and potent and stands up to its promises.          That is if you can get it out of he coffee maker.  Half of the cups had  oken seals and dripped grounds into the cup.  I saw that on the reviews before I ordered, but I figured it had to be a one time thing and would be fixed by the time I got mine.     I was wrong.          What I have learned in the past to do when the seal on the K cup is  oke is to wrap a small piece of foil over the top  before putting it in the coffee maker.  The foil puts enough extra pressure on the cup to keep the seal.  No big deal when its one cup out of 100.  But when its half the cups in the order its a bit of a pain.
