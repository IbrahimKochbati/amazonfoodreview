We are iced tea drinkers.  My spouse and I fell in love with this tea after finding it at Wal Mart.  As is often the case for other products, Wal Mart quit carrying it so I checked elsewhere, locally and online, and found it in only one place: Amazon.com. It arrived right at our door   and was actually cheaper than Wal Mart. Life is good!
