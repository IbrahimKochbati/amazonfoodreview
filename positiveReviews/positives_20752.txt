This is my favorite tea! I love the balance of spices   not too much of anything, not too strong, just nice flavor. Other  ands of chai tea seem to be too strong, too bitter, or too much of one spice or another. Lipton Spiced Chai is just right; a nice flavor change from standard tea, Earl Grey, English Breakfast or fruit teas. I've just subscribed to this tea because I have been having a hard time finding it any more, and I drink several cups a day year round. I've tried most of the other  ands, but don't like any of them nearly as well. I hope Lipton continues to make this tea!
