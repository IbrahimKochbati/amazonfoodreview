I bought these to put in our Christmas stockings.  Yes, my kiddos are older (13, 17 and 21) but we all love kit kats.  What is great about this assortment is that you get the white, milk and dark chocolate kit kats all in one bag!  The kit kats arrived quickly and were very fresh.  I'm back to buy more for Valentine's day treats.
