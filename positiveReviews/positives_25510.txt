do you love tomatoes? This is like a super concentration of tomato flavor that you can add to anything. Like a meaty flavor in a beef stew, add this! Look it up, tomato paste   powder  ings out the meaty flavor in beef. We add it to omelettes, crock pot beef dishes, kale chips... it works well in many recipes...and it never goes bad like a store bought tomato. Best of all....the price. Have you seen the price of tomato paste? This is how they make it... and you skip the middle man. makes me smile, how about you?
