There's something very special about foods you've grown up with.  The taste reminds you of home, perhaps of childhood and happy memories.  That's Welch's Grape Jelly for me.            There was always a jar on hand at home and I loved to slather it over peanut butter for a sandwich.  Well, I've given up the peanut butter but the jelly is still one of my favorite comfort foods.
