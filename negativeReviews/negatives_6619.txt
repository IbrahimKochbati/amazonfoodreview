We bought these for an event our church held to make care packages for soldiers. We looked all over for large packages of individually wrapped jerky sticks and thought these were perfect... Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews first which others clearly complain about as well. I bought 3 boxes and had to give them away to friends, family and coworkers before they expired. So I am out $75 and had scramble at the last minute and bought slim jims at smart and final, which is what i was told soldiers hate, but it was our only option. It seems Amazon makes no effort to make sure their sellers are showing real items and makes me rethink renewing my prime account for another year.
