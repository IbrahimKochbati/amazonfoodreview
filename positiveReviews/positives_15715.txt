We've gone through all of the flavors now three times.  Both cats chowed down quite happily on the food.  The boy got quite vocal and insistent the next few days about how much he wanted more of the wet food.  Far, far more vocal than he got after getting the 9 Lives canned food before.  Judging from that it seems to be tastier.          It definitely looks more appealing to me.  Actual flakes of fish, small shrimp, no unpleasant smell beyond a slight seafood smell.  After putting the food into a bowl the can doesn't look nasty either.  White interior, no discoloration spots.  A quick rinse gets rid of any remaining juices before tossing the can in the recycle bin.          Can is made of aluminum, not steel.  Cans are opened with a pull tab, no can opener required.  The other cat food we had varied; some flavors had a tab on the can to open it and others required a can opener.  In our house it's much nicer when it has a tab to open.  Otherwise I had to go hunting for the can opener after pulling the bowls out of the cupboard.  And of course the cats heard the clang of the bowls coming out of the cupboard which meant they appeared within seconds and promptly started exclaiming how much they wanted the wet stuff while weaving in between the legs in an attempt to get me to give them the food as fast as possible.  We all know how difficult it can be to dodge cats weaving around underfoot  while digging through drawers and cupboards searching for the can opener.          Amusingly, the label lists the product as being gluten free.  Not something I expected to see on the label.          Overall we're pleased.  I'm not offended by the way the product looks or smells  and the cats love it.  My only complaint is that it is rather pricey compared to other options.          Update Feb 17, 2009:     Well, after trying this I started sampling some other upscale cat foods.  I also started reading the ingredients.  I had no idea that wheat gluten was such a common ingredient.  Now that makes sense.          As for price, it is close to the price range for other upscale   premium   gourmet (whatever you want to call the  small expensive cans) cat foods. Without subscribe & save the pricing is a bit higher here compared to what the other premium foods go for in the local stores.  With subscribe & save there isn't as much difference.          I didn't think I would want to spend this much on cat food yet I just ordered some more.  To me there is significant value in that it doesn't have that 'canned cat food' smell.  You know what I'm talking about, and it really isn't a great way to wake up in the morning.  It also helps that Petite Cuisine is more visually appealing than the other stuff.          The menadione thing?  From what I can find that may be valid.  Most of the stuff online references (and quotes) one article but the material safety sheet does have notes about toxicity of the substance to human organs at high doses.  It is in other pet foods as well, not just Petite Cuisine, so if you're concerned about it you need to read the label of any product.          I did contact the company asking about it and stated that I was concerned about its use in their product.  If enough people contact them about it explaining their concern they may rethink using it as an ingredient.  For me, I'll probably use it in rotation with other foods.  Hopefully I can find something that doesn't stink and doesn't have any potentially objectionable ingredients.
