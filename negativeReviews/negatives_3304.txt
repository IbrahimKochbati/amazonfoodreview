The nose evokes the earthiness of white truffles, just barely.  The white truffle presence in Bartolini is weak with mineral (almost chemical) notes, not the earthy, warm and almost intoxicating fragrance you expect from white truffles.          There is no such thing as white truffles (oil or otherwise) on a budget.  The real thing is expensive, a deserving price for the experience you expect.
