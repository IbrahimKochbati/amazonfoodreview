I have pain and numbness down both arms from a pinched nerve at the bottom of my neck.  I started drinking this juice three months into what will likely be a four to six month recovery.  Because my doctor has put me on a long term anti inflammatory medication, I am not allowed to take over the counter medications like Advil and Tylenol.  I can say that taking a glass of this juice has the same pain killing effect as taking two Advil.  I enjoy two glasses a day   one in the morning and one at dinner.  The only down side is the sugar, which is really the only processed sugar I eat during the day.  The juice tastes good and the quality of the syrup is consistent and pleasant.          I usually don't go for "miracle" foods or diet fads, but this juice simply works   this is the real deal.  It will not cure pain, but it will inhibit inflammation and facilitate faster healing of arthritis, spasms, and sprains.
