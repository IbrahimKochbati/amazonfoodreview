These crackers are certainly Crisp and Light. I am a low carb eater and am happy to have something crunchy to munch on while watching my carbs (4 net carbs per cracker for Atkin's followers). If you are used to buying different flavors in the grocery store, the ones that come in the kind of flimsy paper wrapping, these actually arrived in a more sturdy cardboard box. For the people complaining about bland taste, I think the point is to put stuff on them not necessarily eat them as is. I like that they have a very mild flavor so as not to overpower what you put on them, you can top with something savory or sweet. My favorite toppings are cream cheese, ham and cheese, chicken salad or sugar free preserves (they are sturdy enough to stand up to spreading cold cream cheese on them).
