I eat dried mango almost everyday and have tried so many different  ands, but this  and is the worst. I almost thought it was spoiled, but every 1 of the 6 packs tasted the same. Mushy and overly sweet. I had to check the package to make sure sugar wasn't added. I would definitely try a different  and!
