This is my grand daughter's favorite  eakfast....although she likes all the flavors.  These little toddler meals are simple, easy, and best of all, loved by my little munchkin (17 months old).  She lives two hours away with her mother, who is in college, so I send these meals to her apartment so that she has them there, as well as when she's with me (every other week).  They may be a little costly and not on a college student's budget, but I'm happy to ensure that my little munchkin has healthy meals that she loves and that make her feel independent (she can feed them to hershelf).  The size of the meat and carrots and green beans are perfect for a toddler.
