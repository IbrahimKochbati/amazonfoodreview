This is my all time favorite tea.  There is a nice hint of cinnamon that is great at any time of day.  I can easily go through 4 of these teabags a day.  Probably 90 percent of the hot tea I drink is Bigelow Cinnamon Stick Tea.  I've tried other cinnamon teas and by far this is the best one yet.  Thank you Bigelow and thank you Amazon.com for carrying this  and in bulk.
