this review is coming from a person who enjoys coffee more than the average morning coffee drinker. I requested a Keurig machine for Christmas. I thought single serve would be better than it is. I like the concept of a diverse coffee selection just for you, when you want it. I was disappointed with the plastic after taste and smell as well as watery flavor. the k cups do not have instruction of cup size. Not a good experience for me. keurig has discussed on their site that they are working on an alternate packaging that would also be recyclable. Until then I'll make it in the pot.
