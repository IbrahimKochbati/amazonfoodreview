I actually love this seasoning. The no salt factor is great as it allows you to control the amount of salt you wish to add to anything when you use this spice. I used it in a taco soup I make and it tasted wonderful. Here's the thing about spice mixes: you may find something missing flavor wise due to your own tastes expectations. However, I find I can always adjust a mix to suit me. All the spices I've ordered from this company have been great and I've used them for years. To me this spice is definitely worth the money spent.
