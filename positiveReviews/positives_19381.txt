I used to  ing these back from Italy, so I am delighted to have found them here! No artificial ingredients, they taste as close to a home made cake for a commercial product. I put them in my kids' lunch box, and I love them in the afternoon or after dinner as a little treat.  The other good one is "Trancetto"  which is also available I believe.
