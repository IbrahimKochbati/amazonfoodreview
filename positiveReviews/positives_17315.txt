Kids that are not used to whole wheat pasta may not like this since the texture of whole wheat is chewier than white enriched pasta. My boys have had the less healthy version of mac n cheese, and the whole wheat (we are big whole wheat eaters!) and they love Annie's whole wheat shells.  It's their absolute favorite.
