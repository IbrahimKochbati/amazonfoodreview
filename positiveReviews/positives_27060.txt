This was my first time I used Peanut Oil , as I am not big meat eater and avoid fast food , but thanks to the great reviews as tried it in my fryer , it was so delicious, no funky smell, amazing taste , did not transfer any taste from one to another food, also used with salad and I LOVE IT !! and it become my favorite from now , for my weekly frayed Friday :))
