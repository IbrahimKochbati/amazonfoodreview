This coffee is not quite what I thought it to be. Taste a little on the strong side. It is rather pricy, and yet I found it on sale, so I thought. I have plenty of caribou and that should hold me for a while until the seasonal coffees come out, hopefully they will not be so high in price. Saw a review on the Kcup coffees and found that they got the rating of being simply just "ok", so it is more of the easy of making the coffee rather than the price or quality of the  ew of coffee. I shall keep my eyes peeled for the cheapest place to buy my kcups. The day  eak of the caribou is the best variety of the caribou  and.
