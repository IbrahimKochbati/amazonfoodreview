I got a 6 month cheesecake order as a gift, and the first cheeesecake arrived packed in dry ice.  It was frozen and tasted great after a night in the fridge.          The second cheesecake arrived spoiled.  They did not ensure rapid delivery of the cake and the dry ice melted while the cake was in transit.  When I called the company and asked for a replacement, they said that would be impossible, and that I would have to pick another product.  I asked to speak to a manager and the manager acted like it was my fault that the cake spoiled in transit, and said I was lucky that they were willing to give me anything.          I've ordered other month clubs from other companies in the past, and never once had an item spoil prior to delivery.  And on the very rare occasion a product arrived damaged, other companies were very willing to make it up to me.  Amazing clubs made it very clear they had no interest in customer satisfaction.
