Maldon Sea Salt is increasingly difficult to find in my community. Imagine my delight when I looked for it online and there it was thru Amazon! Thanks for making it so easy to restock my pantry, Amazon! If you haven't used this product, I cannot recommend it highly enough. I seldom use salt while cooking (except where it makes a real difference such as baking); instead I provide a small wooden bowl of Maldon at the dinner table as a finishing salt. Years ago a friend shared a conversation she and her husband had on their way home from dinner at our house: Husband asked why food at our home always tasted so good; wife replied "well, it may begin with the salt and pepper "gingergal" uses! Enough said.
