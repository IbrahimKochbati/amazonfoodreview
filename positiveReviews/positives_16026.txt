If you haven't been introduced to Saint Andre soft cheese you are not living.  It's like Brie mixed with butter.  The flavor is milder then Brie and the texture is very much like fresh butter.  It's firmer inside then Brie, especially a ripe Brie.  I can't imagine it is very heart healthy but makes the absolute best baguette for  eakfast instead of butter.  I am a cheese person and I eat cheese from a number of EU countries and this ranks as one of if not the best.  Enjoy and keep the red wine flowing.  Buon appetit!
