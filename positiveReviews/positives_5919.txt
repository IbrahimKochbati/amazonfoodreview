In a world toxic from factory farming, unnatural additives feed (mad cow anyone?) making sick cows (RBGh and pus in the milk) I avoid any dairy not from grass fed cows. If you shop organic, you know how expensive this is for animal products.So far as I know, goat dairy is free from these evils.          I tried goat products after reading a couple books on natural diet and healing by Dr Jordan Rubin. "The Maker's Diet" is good, but the protocols repetitive, and he is of course promoting his products he designed to recover from Crohn's. Coconut oil and goat milk were important for reasons you need to read yourself. Anyhow, it helped me, improve my health too.I find I have less congestion, allergies, and sinus problems.          The "goaty" flavor can be overcome by a gradual switchover mixing some goat milk into whatever milk you use   be it cow's, soy, rice. After a while you will not notice it much, then you may like it! I bet after a month or two of no cow's milk, you will taste "cowy" flavor in it. Our tastebuds change.          I like both the evaporated and powdered milks. My cats do too   and it has been okay for feeding a sick cat who couldn't manage solid food.          I am going to make some cultured goat milk products, since yogurt is over $2 a plastic cup in Ohio. Maybe cheese will be next   goat farmers cheese? mmm.
