...one of my favorite pleasures in life and I decided to try this  and once it was on sale for under $6. A bit lighter coffee then I'm used to but it was smooth and well rounded with just the right amount of nutty after taste. I'll be watching for the whole bean since I'm sure it will heighten the flavor. Actually bought some interest in the company (JAMN) since i think Mr. Marley has a winning product. Sure would be fun to sit down with him and listen to stories about his father over a cup of this Joe!
