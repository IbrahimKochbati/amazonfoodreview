We have a border collie husky. She is 13 years old and we love her dearly. She has such a sweet disposition. I keep the Zuke's treats in a basket in the utility room. Whenever I go to that room, Sasha follows me and starts doing some of her tricks on her own hoping she will get one of her treats she loves. Judy Watson
