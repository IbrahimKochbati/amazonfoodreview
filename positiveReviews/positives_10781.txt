My four mixed  eed dogs (40lbs 100lbs)gobble up Newman's Own dog treats.  But, these terrific dogs gobble up just about anything (except fresh green leafy vegetables), so perhaps their standards shouldn't be the mark of "goodness".          I'm an ingredient list reader for all foods (human & animal), so that is what I did when I received the Newman's pet treats.  The ingredient list is short & consists of the following:          Organic Barley, Organic Lamb, Organic Carrots, Organic Apples, Organic Palm Oil (Preserved with Mixed Tocopherois, a Source of Vitamin E), Organic Molasses          The treats themselves are rectangular & scored in the middle.  They are 2" x 1  4" for the full size & 1" x 1 1 4" for the 1 2 size.  They do not have a strong smell, but a hint of apple is noticeable (& a grain smell, which I presume is the barley).  My 10oz bag came with 18 full size treats.          I like the rectangular shape of the treat.  Sometimes my large dogs get excited about treats & forget about "nicely".  With the rectangular shape, my hands won't fall victim to an enthusiastic chomp.  Since the treats are scored down the middle, I can  eak them down, so my older, smaller dogs can easily eat the treat.          Overall, I think the ingredients are excellent for a dog treat, and it is nice that they are adaptable for different sized dogs.
