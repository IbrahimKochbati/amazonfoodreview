this product is tasty. You add a half lb of ground beef, 2 cups milk, and some water. It is very much like Hamburger Helper but with less processed ingredients and whole wheat pasta mix. It takes a few minutes to thicken after cooking, the sauce is thin before it sits. Overall, I like the smaller packaging and that it uses ingredients that I can read and understand.
