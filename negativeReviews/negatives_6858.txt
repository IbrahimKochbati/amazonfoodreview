I read all the reviews before giving in and buying. After all the comments on how good this tasted I really expected to like it. For the price it better be as good as the reviews claim. I was completly dissapointed. So far I have tried 3 bags, all of which have been stale and not what I expected at all.  Nowhere near the taste of movie theater popcorn either. I think I'll stick to buying plain kernels from the grocery store. The only positive thing I can admit is that it did pop up nicely in my popcorn popper.
