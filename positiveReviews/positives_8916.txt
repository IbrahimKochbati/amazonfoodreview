I was introduced to ghee during my yoga studies in Southern India.  This is the best ghee I have found in the U.S.  It is slightly superior to the Ancient Organics  and, in my opinion, due to richer color and flavor.          Thanks to the website, I now pop my own organic popcorn in ghee, as well as using it almost exclusively to cook with, as the heat does not destroy its beneficial properties.          As someone who used to be afraid of fat, I am so glad I discovered this ghee.  It's delicious, and I know I am giving my body a healthy "oil change" at the same time.
