I really enjoyed the KOI Navratan Korma. All you need is some basmati rice, and you are good to go. Usually, I get concerned with products containing paneer (cheese) in prepackaged form, but the paneer in these packs turned out not to have the rubbery texture I was concerned about. Along with the special discount, the price on these packs is great as well. Unfortunately, as with most prepackaged Indian foods, sodium contact is high and the korma is pretty oily.
