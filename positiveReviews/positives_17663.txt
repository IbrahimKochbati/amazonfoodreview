this was a nice flavor,as I do enjoy french roast coffee.  it seemed a bit bitter to me, though.  I am not sure if that is because I have been drinking coffee from a keurig single  ew for a while, and a "pot" of coffee tastes different after sittting a while?          I would have to say that the low acid was a plus.  I didn't get the upset stomach that I would have after 4 cups of other coffee.  My only request is make this in kcup form, please :)          so, all in all, it does what it says it'll do, it's low acid, doesn't bother your stomach, and does have a nice flavor.  the foil packaging would be great at keeping out heat and light and keeping the flavor in.          if you need a low acid coffee for whatever reason, this would be a good buy at the price.
