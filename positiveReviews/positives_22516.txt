I purchased popcorn from Discount Tommy twice now...The popcorn packets are great and easy to use in either a pan or in the popcorn maker I also purchased from Discount Tommy at an incredibly low purchase price...The popcorn is better than some of the popcorn at movie theatres, Just add real butter, its great.......
