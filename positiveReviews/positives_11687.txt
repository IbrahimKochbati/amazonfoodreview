I'll admit I had low expectations for these Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut bars, since they are wheat, dairy, and gluten free.  I was pleasantly surprised.          These taste like oatmeal chocolate chip cookies in a 180 calorie bar shape.  The addition of coconut helps add some creaminess, flavor, and texture that really make these enjoyable.          Nutrition: 180 kcal (Calories), 9g fat (2g saturated), 8g sugar, and 2g protein.          I'm very impressed if these really only have 8g of sugar.  They taste almost as sweet as a good oatmeal chocolate chip cookie.          Overall a very tasty, alternative snack, with good nutrition for a lasting boost of energy.  Recommended.
