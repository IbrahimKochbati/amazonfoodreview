I absolutely LOVE this  ead maker  ead mix.  It is very easy to use, with the yeast included in each package.  There is no measuring except for the oil and water, and it is delicious.  I had been discouraged with the taste of many gluten free  eads, but this is enjoyed by my non gluten free friends, also.  In fact, if I  ing a fresh loaf to a pot luck, I usually do not have any to take home for myself! This is the best thing I have found "since sliced  ead". (Haha)In addition, buying a case of six from Amazon is much cheaper than buying 6 packages from off the store shelves.
