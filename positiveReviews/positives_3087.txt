I love canned sardines and when they put me on a low salt diet     I figured that was the end of my sardines until I found these. They taste fantastic,the price is reasonable and you can at least have     something that before these sardines was not available to people     on a low salt diet. Side benefits as they are skinless and boneless.     Thanks to the Roand Co.
