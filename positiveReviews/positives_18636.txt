The title says it.  I love this ketchup.  For years after using one sugar laden  and, I'm trying to cut down on the sugar in foods.  I use agave nectar as my sweetner for alot of things so was really surprised to see this ketchup.  It tastes great and I'm kind of a ketchup snob.  In our family we used to get teased "like a little hamburger with your ketchup" so you know I had to find one that tasted as good as the popular  and I was using.  Thanks for the product.
