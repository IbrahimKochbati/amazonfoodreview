Tried this for the first time this week and it is now my favorite coffee   with a hint of flavor (coconut). Full bodied, and no after taste, Jamaica Me Crazy is just what I love for an afternoon pick me up, or to wake up and have an immediate smile on my face. Seriously    It's Awesome! Highly Recommended.
