I like Japanese soups and just love the similar products from San J (also available from Amazon    get those, they're 5 star!).          This Miso cup  and is terrible. I can't tell you more than this is just yicky. I wish there was a zero star rating!          I didn't finish the first cup even (but I'd already tried and re tried another Miso cup flavor and hated it). Therefore, I only used one envelope before giving away the rest. Oh, why did I stray from San J? Actually, I thought it might be worth trying Miso cup's different flavors to add variety to my afternoon  oth experience. It was this flavor, in particular, that I was most interested in trying for variety. But now I know that ALL the Miso cup  and are equally dreadful!!!          I gave these and the other Miso cup boxes to a Food Pantry BUT I told them first why to warn others it might not suit them. Get the San J  and!!!
