Our vet first introduced us to this very excellent chew for our three dogs.  Her price for a bag was (as far as we were concerned) too high.  But on Amazon we found the best price on the net, so our dogs have a treat they love (given to them after their meal), we pay a price we think is reasonable, and their teeth and mouths are better for it.
