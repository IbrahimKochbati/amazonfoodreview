I first bought the small, 100 calorie pack box in my local store.  They are a wonderful source of protein without the carbs, salt, and extra sugar that come with other snacks or with roasted nuts (e.g., especially honey roasted nuts).          These whole, raw almonds are great for anyone with a blood sugar issue.  The raw almonds won't make your blood sugar spike; are handy if your blood sugar has dropped and you need a quick source of food; and, the 1.5 ounce bags are sturdy and won't rip  or haven't yet in my overly packed and oft mangled bag.          As the previous reviewer mentioned, once you start eating these, you won't miss the added fat and salt of any distributor's "roasted" nuts.  Since eating these natural almonds, I haven't missed the traditional "roasted" nut taste.  I grew up on the usual nuts, but now I find I really look forward to this new, clean taste.  For all these reasons, I recommend Blue Diamond's raw almonds.          (However, if you still think that these almonds aren't crunchy enough for you  especially if you bought the canned nuts  you could always roast them yourself.  Put the raw almonds on a cookie sheet [you may want to line your sheet with foil or parchment paper] in a pre heated oven at 350 degree F.  Stir them a few times to ensure they don't scorch (I would check around 6 minutes  especially if your oven is a bit temperamental [like mine]; and stir and check again before 10 minutes [because it's amazing how fast nuts can go from 'almost done' to 'scorched'  or worse  'burnt'].  Roasting them yourself still has to be much healthier than any nuts that are cooked in oil.  Remember also, if you do roast the raw almonds in the oven, please cool them completely and then refrigerate them afterward.)
