I have been using this for awhile now. Unfortunately the local stores where I used to buy this stopped carring it and I was able to find this deal on Amazon. I love this tea. I think it tastes great (I do prefer to drink herbal tea without much additions maybe a little organic cane sugar here and there or some almond milk or rice milk).          When I was drinking one of these tea bags every day I felt great as I noticed a feeling of "well being" it was like many different body systems were working as they should be. I have been diagnosed with the genetic form of fatty liver and I have a lot of allergies. This tea really helps me. I take this tea in addition to the Himalaya Herbal Healthcare LiverCare for LIver Support (aka Liv.52). I take the LiverCare once daily by mouth. Between one of these tea bags daily and one pill by mouth of the LiverCare...I feel great.
