Perhaps not your Grandma's cup of Hot Chocolate, but for the Keurig, it's the best out there.  And what makes it a sweeter deal you get 3 packs for the typical price of 1 K Cup box, take note it's a Pack of 3, so a total of 36 k cups.          I suggest only using the small cup setting to prevent it from being watered down too much, but decide for yourself!
