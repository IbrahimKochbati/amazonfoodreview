Got a  and new Keurig machine for Christmas and immediately went to work finding the cheapest and best tasting K Cups on the market. I came across this when searching for some good Hot Cocoa and am amazed at how many K Cups you really get out of this. 48 K Cups for about $20 when I purchased was a great deal when most Hot Chocolate prices were 16 K Cups for $15~$19.          This is a great deal and you get to try out Peppermint, Dark Chocolate and Milk Chocolate. It's light on calories and most important of all taste GREAT!          Must have if your a Hot Chocolate lover or have family that wants a easy to make, great tasting Hot Chocolate for less!
