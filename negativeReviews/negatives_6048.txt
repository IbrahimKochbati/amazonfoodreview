Before I was vegetarian, there were few meat products that I even liked. Jerky was one of them, and I have had no luck finding a replacement.          This is NOTHING like real jerky. It is very chewy in a SOFT way, and the flavoring was overpowering to the point that I ended up with a stomachache.          It is OK. I wouldn't buy it again, but it's not disgustingly bad or anything. Just know if you're looking for an alternative to jerky that this fails both the taste and texture test.
