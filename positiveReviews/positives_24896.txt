I have a very fussy Yorksire terrier and a miniature schnauzer and both them absolutely love these treats.  I give them to them after they finish their  eakfast and they bark at me if I forget!  I like the fact that they have no fillers or artificial ingredients because my dogs have food allergies. These treats are the greatest!
