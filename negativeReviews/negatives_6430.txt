I eat the French Twist on a regular basis in most of the flavors.  For me, I wanted to taste more chocolate to satisfy my chocolate craving. Also, I thought it was a little pricey for the size of the bag and the quantity.  I'm not sure I'd order again unless there was a special promotion, specifcally for the Chocolate Chip Flavor.  I wish I could have bought it in a local store as I can with some of the other flavors, prior to my purchase from Amazon.
