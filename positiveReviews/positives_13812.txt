I've not used it for making the good ole PB&J sandwich yet, but I've used it for cooking, making a smoothie and in pudding...and it's great!  2 TBSP in a package of sugar free chocolate pudding, add a little Cool Whip and you've got a super easy lo cal dessert.          The people that make this have receipes on their site that sound very good as well.  This is a definite "will buy again"!
