After trying the strawberry kiwi flavor, I found it to be very light. I liked the taste, but I didn't think it tasted a lot like strawberry or kiwi. It kind of tasted like a carbonated light fruit punch. I just didn't like the after taste. The can is also very small for a drink to be so expensive. In all honesty, I don't think I would buy this, especially in this economy.
