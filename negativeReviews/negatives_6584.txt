Just finishing off a bowl (3 packets) of Quaker Instant Oatmeal Maple Brown Sugar. Its very quick to make, either using fat free milk or water and then microwaving it. Prep time is about 3 minutes. The taste is very good. It's very sweet about as sweet as the sweetest  eakfast cereal. It has a strong maple flavor.          I would not go so far as to call this a "wholesome"  eakfast. A cereal bowl serving an adult serving that is (3 packets), has about 33% (260mg) of your entire daily sodium intake and a ton of sugar. The sodium upper limit for persons under 51 years of age is 2500 mg per day and for those over 51 or have heart disease the upper limit is only 1500mg. That means that this product isn't quite the 'heart healthy' food Pepsico (Yes) claims it to be. None the less, it is a fairly good alternative to many of the  eakfast cereals available and probably healthier than a bacon and eggs  eakfast. It is however, no substitute for homemade oatmeal in flavor or sodium sugar content.
