I'm on my third one, the price has dropped over the years but I also fear the quality has too. Must be made in China.  I bought this new one only 3 months ago and while it was cheaper than the past 2 I owned it is now failing. I think the "Microprocessor Controlled Technology" that "maintains water at the perfect  ewing temperature " has failed? Who knows? it works 1 2 the time now, the other half it won't deliver any water. Next week I'll bet I'll be looking for a new one. Bottom line: If you only make 1 cup of coffee a day I'm sure they will last forever but apparently they are not built strong enough to withstand heavy use.
