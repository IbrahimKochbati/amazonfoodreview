These are really good. They crunch like crackers, and they are so rich and delicious. I have tried some of the other flavors also, and they are all good. I don't mind that there are only 15 in a package, and I don't mind paying a little more for this quality item. They are worth it, to me. Also, these are great if you are looking for something with a salty crunchy characteristic to replace starches like crackers. Instead of croutons, I crunched some of these up and put them in a salad. They go good with soup. When I first ordered these, I thought they'd probably be good. But they exceeded my expectations; they are great.
