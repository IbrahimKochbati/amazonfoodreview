I am a die hard soda pop fan. I will drink juice but normally only certain  ands or with a little soda (7up or Sprite) mixed in to kill the after taste and to sweeten it up a bit.          Well this is better that even that mix without the bad stuff from the soda. It has a crisp, clean orange taste with a nice tangerine undertone that continues through the after taste. It is effortless to drink and doesn't make you feel sluggish afterwords. It is hard to describe other than to say they got it right. No extra sugar, yet it is very sweet, but not too sweet.          I shared my can with my wife and she agreed with my comments 100%. We both we were sad that we only got the one little can to review and not the entire case!          While I am not sure it could replace my Coke, it sure could replace my juice and some of my coke intake. The only problem (there always seems to be something) is that it is about 4 times the cost of my coke per oz. I could justify twice the cost but four times is the only reason I haven't ordered more so far. I do expect to  eakdown and buy a case, but I still won't be happy over the cost difference.
