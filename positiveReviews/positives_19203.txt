Once the dogs figured out the "trick" to this one, they were able to get the cups out in no time to get to the treats. This would be a great tool though for using at feeding time if you have a dog that you need to slow down.  It is easily washable.  The cups will  eak if chewed on, but they're not intended to be chew toys.
