The cover was slightly off tilt and the syrup leaked onto the bubble packing.  Packing was wound tightly around the container but does little for the cap not being tightened enough.  Container should have a foil safety shield installed which would end the leaking problem.  If my second auto shipped one leaks, I will be cancelling the order.  Being opened enough to leak comprises quality, leaving it open to bacteria.
