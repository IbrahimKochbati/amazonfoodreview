We used to buy this coffee pretty often but the local supermarkets started cutting back on selections and raising prices and the Community whole bean coffees became expensive and not always available.  While the price of coffees seem to be rising recently, I found Amazon's price for this coffee to be a little lower than the local grocer's prices and the convenience of ordering it is unquestionable.          Community coffee was what almost everyone drank when I was growing up in Louisiana.  However, my parents were not Community coffee fans.  When we visited neighbors and relatives, Community coffee was always served.  It was almost always overly strong dark roast that had been warmed over several times and, frankly, I didn't care for it much either.  It was not until several decades later when Community began to market a better quality of coffee in whole bean form that I started drinking it and liking it.  The Private Reserve Louisiana Blend Dark Roast reviewed here is one of their better quality coffees and my personal favorite.  It's nothing like the burnt out tasting Community coffee I remember from my youth.  This coffee is balanced, smooth and rich.  When bought in whole bean form and ground fresh, it's a great morning cup of joe.          Now, Community Coffee Company has been located near Baton Rouge, Louisiana, since it began.  The roasting facilities, to my knowledge, never has been located in New Orleans as a previous poster stated.  Community did open the first of several coffee houses in New Orleans in the mid 1990s, however, the coffee is not roasted in New Orleans.  Since Community Coffee is considered the Official Coffee of Louisiana and is served all over the state  including New Orleans  those who are unfamiliar with the state outside New Orleans may be under the misconception that it's New Orleans based.
