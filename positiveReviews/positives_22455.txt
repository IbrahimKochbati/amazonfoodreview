This is the best tasting popcorn we have found, just the right seasoning. We tried many other  ands and this one taste the most like real theater popcorn. All our guest really like it also and ask me to make it when are here. Other reviews talk about unpopped kernels, but I think it is the popper. I watch kernels pop out when they start popping and don't see any when I empty the hopper.
