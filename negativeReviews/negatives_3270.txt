I ordered the ener g  and because that is the  and of  ead we had a Disney and the kids (and one adult celiac) were very excited about everything they had there.  These  ownies do not measure up to the  ead that ener g makes.  I've never met a  ownie I didn't like but I couldn't eat it (even with ice cream).  The clear sign was when I had to throw some away.  They will eat them if they are desperate for something gluten free.  Anyone who has been dealing with gluten free products probably already knows to freeze the items until you get ready to use them.  They mold quickly.
