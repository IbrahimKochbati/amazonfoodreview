I didn't care for Kiwi Berry Switch. It was very sweet and not refreshing at all. Also, at 135 calories in an 8.3 ounce can, it actually contains a lot more calories than regular soda. I know it is all natural and doesn't have HFC (High Fructose Corn Syrup), and I appreciate that, but it also doesn't have much actual kiwi or berry juices. The drink is VERY sweet, but sweeter than 100% fruit juice, sweeter even than your average can of soda. I can't say I would ever buy this product or recommend it to anyone else. There are better natural sodas on the market, as well as better 100% natural juices.
