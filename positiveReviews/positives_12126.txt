Some people like a strong cup of coffee that kicks them in the mouth first thing in the morning, but I don't, so I tried one classified light roast, which was a little too weak for me. I tried Nantucket Blend, and it is perfect! It's not weak at all and had a really delicious flavor to it, what I think a good cup of coffee should taste like. It is so smooth, not a single negative thing about it except that now I go through it so quickly!     This is my favorite one so far, and has become my morning drink every day!     If you like coffee and are looking for a not too strong, not too weak blend give this a try!
