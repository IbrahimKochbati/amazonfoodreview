This flavor sounded like it would be good, like ice creamy, and it seemed to get lots of positive reviews here on Amazon. So when I came across a small sample box at Lowe's of the stuff, I bought it. Unfortunately. This "coffee" tastes like old dishwater in which a pair of running shoes and a vanilla scented car air freshener were steeped for a week.
