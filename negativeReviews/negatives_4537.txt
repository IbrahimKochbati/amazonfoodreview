Was so disappointed to discover that HappyBaby changed Super Salmon!  My little girl LOVED the old formula, and it had more protein and calories than this new version.  The new version also has more sugar and sodium than the previous version, and it has a completely different taste and texture   she won't touch it.  We will not be buying it again.
