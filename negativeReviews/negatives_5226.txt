Not the sweet clam taste I was expecting. The product is sort of grayish and dirty looking, not fleshy pink as I expected. The average very small clam size is about 3 8" inch with many in pieces or crushed like mush. Occasional pieces of hard elements such as shell bits or something else that is hard. Somewhat of an off flavor, sort of fishy or sea weedy. A product of China which I was suspect of at the start as I think their quality control often suffers with many products and I was right. I would not recommend this product.
