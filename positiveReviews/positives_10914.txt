My test subject is a 100+ lb Black La ador and he gobbles these treats up happily with a wagging tail and a trot in his 11 year old step! They are large and rectangular in shape, very different from the usual treat that mimics 'bones', and thick but they go down just fine and I've not seen even so much as a crumb left behind. The resealable bag is nice as in the past other treats have come in from the store already infested with moths or their larva from poor packaging.
