I love this coffee!  It has been my regular morning  ew for many years, and everyone I have ever served it to also loves it.  I don't like dark roasted coffees, but that is pretty much all you can buy these days.  I also don't like South American coffees; I find them too light and acidic.  This medium roast mocha java is just right for me.  Robust and flavorful, but without the burned, oily taste of a dark roast.
