My baby is 7 months old and maybe wasn't as ready for these biscuits as I imagined. He's got 2 bottom teeth and is very able to get chunks off these biscuits! The pieces take a long time to dissolve  eak down in his mouth, but he handles it better than I would expect and he can't wait to dive in for more. He has tasted a wide variety of foods and I've never seen him get so excited about any of them. He LOVES Belle's Blueberry teething biscuits   especially after they've been in the freezer for a bit. Even though I have to watch him closely, they're exactly the cure for little man's teething pains!
