I gave this to the family cat for Christmas this year and he likes it. He's not a very picky eater for a cat, but he turns his nose up at some things occasionally  this food was not one of those things. The ingredients that are used in the food are surprisingly "sophisticated",and should draw in some of Amazon's more bourgeois pet owners.
