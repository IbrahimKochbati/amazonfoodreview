My pup loved these treats (and for the record still does) BUT the new version of this product is so loosely rolled and flimsy that my pup eats it up in less than 2 minutes. Not a real chew rawhide. It's now more like a treat (which you shouldn't give to them often because it is still rawhide, in my opinion.
