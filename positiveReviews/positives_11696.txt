I have seen several reviews, commenting about the high fat content, in these bars.  I just wanted to say, that most of the fat, in these bars, is the 'good' fat   so, it is actually healthy, for you!  The good fat, comes from the coconut, chia seeds, and I think almonds, also have some good fat in them.  You are getting the good stuff   the Omega 3 fatty acids.  I know there is a good amount in them, because I am always picking the leftover chia seeds, from between my teeth, afterward!          Well, that is what I wanted to say.  I love the bars   are they completely healthy?  Probably not, but I love that I can finally have a cookie, with oats in it, that are gluten free   that is a huge deal to me!  And, that agave syrup is used.  Well, thanks for listening!  JinJan.
