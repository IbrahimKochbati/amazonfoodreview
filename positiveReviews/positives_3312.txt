I have used Bisquick forever and now that I have Celiacs I use the GF Bisquick and I love it! There is little to no difference at all between the two. I have made biscuits, pot pie and pancakes and they are all awesome. I find most all other  ands have an after taste and Bisquick doesn't. Even my daughter who does not have a problem with gluten loves it and thinks its better than regular Bisquick and she is only 5. I will buy this product all the time its my #1 baking mix :)
