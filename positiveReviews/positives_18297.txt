Chips were fresh and securely packaged. It was not cost effective to pay retail and have to wait for delivery. Where was the advantage...other than to compensate for poor distribution throughout their stores? I like the chips (especially the cheese) and will continue to buy them. They are very pricy, so I will by them when I see them.
