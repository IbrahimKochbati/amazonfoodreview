howdy y'all,          this  ead is pretty good. the potato flavor is there, recognizable as potato  ead [if you've had it before] and not overwhelming. makes a good sandwich  ead with meats or an enjoyably different pseudo  uschetta base.          made it with vegetable oil and olive oil. as usual, the good olive oil makes for a somewhat better flavor.          rated a THREE cuz it's just exactly as expected   average with no surprises.          take care,     lee
