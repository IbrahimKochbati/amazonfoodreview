This seems like a pretty straightforward drink. It's coconut juice and it's pineapple juice, with a bit of sugar and not much else.          They claim it's a good source of potassium and electrolytes.          For me it was pretty tasty. Granted it was also very sweet. Is it a "health drink"? I don't know if I'd go that far. It has Vitamin C and trace amounts of Calcium   Iron, but not much else other than sugar.          For what it is (something sweet to sip), it's pretty good.
