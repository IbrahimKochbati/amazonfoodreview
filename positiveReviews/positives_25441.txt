I purchased these mainly to put into raw energy bars. When i received them and saw the packaging i understood what other reviews meant... Leaves you wondering just How Organic these are. I did a comparison taste with left over Gojis i had from Navitas, and i could barely tell a difference between the 2. I think for the price these are great. But am a little doubtful that they are organic.
