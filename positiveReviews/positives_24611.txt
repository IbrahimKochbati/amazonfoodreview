Like many others, I needed the pumpkin for my dogs and I needed it quickly.  I didn't have a problem with any dented cans so that problem seems to have been corrected.  My dogs absolutely loved this pumpkin! Even my pickiest dog was wanting more and that doesn't usually happen. I will continue to buy this  and even after the Libby's shortage is over.
