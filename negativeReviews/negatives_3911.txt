I like the concept of these natural, carbonated juice beverages and I really liked the black cherry flavor.  But the Kiwi Berry flavor was too sweet for me.  While the ingredients are only juice and carbonated water, I think that not enough water was added to reconstitute the juice to a good balance.  With 33 grams of sugar in the 8.3 ounce bottle, despite being natural, there is still a lot of sweetness here.
