My issue with instant coffees has always been that they are good when you first open the jar but in a couple of days the crystals acquire other tastes (stale).          Not an issue anymore with these individual packets. Fresh to open every time. I find them a much better value than Via and they are pure old time coffee (who knows what Starbucks is putting in their grounds).          This product has also solved one of my longstanding issues with General Foods International Coffees: not enough coffee flavor. Those little cans were $4.00 and it took half the can to get anything like a coffee flavor with the sugars    Cafe Vienna is my favourite.          Now, a heaping spoonful (or two, but instead of six) of Vienna with a packet of Taster's Choice and voila', I'm back in Europe!          Also works with instant coccoa to take the sugary edge off.          I'm defintely buying more when I run out.
