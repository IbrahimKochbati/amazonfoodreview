Some years ago I was introduced to chai tea. I started drinking Tazo but then tried Big Train at Nordstroms. I was definitely love, at first taste!. I was buying it from that department store but it became too expensive. When I discovered it on Amazon and that I could order through subscribe and save, there was no more deciding. I also have my sister drinking it as well and she has an account established through me. As I stated it before, it's the best ever and I drink it everyday!!!
