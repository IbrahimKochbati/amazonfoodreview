Green tea is good for you, loaded with antioxidants, boosts your metabolism, yadda, yadda, yadda, but I never quite warmed up to the taste.  Until now.  The lemon and the ginger give this a very nice flavor.  And it is SO great that I can just add a packet to my water bottle and go, without the bother of  ewing it.
