I take exception to the holes being poked in the bag prior to shipping.  Now I have 6 bags with holes in them.  A good entry for bugs.  Why can't they just fill the bags without air in them like other flour companies do?          The first attempt at making this  ead in my  ead machine was a failure.  I use a Zojirushi  ead machine, maybe that's the problem.  I'll have to research other machines that might be better for the gluten free products.          My second  ead attempt had better results.  Followed the directions for oven baking and it came out OK.  It looked fantastic when it came out, nice & high but it didn't take long to deflate.  The taste and texture is just OK so I still haven't found a delicious gluten free  ead mix that I can say I love.
