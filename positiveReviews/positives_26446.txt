We are trying to keep our dogs teeth as healthy as possible.  It costs appx $450 to have their teeth cleaned in our area.  Our vet recommended these chews.  We have a toy poodle and a miniature poodle.  We bought chews for LARGE dogs, which are quite big and we don't have to worry about our dogs choking because they are so big.  Our dogs love them and chew on them constantly.  Their teeth are definitely with less plaque and tartar, but then we use bully sticks and enzyme in their water.  Our dogs teeth are very white but not sure which product is working the most.  I think they love the bully sticks the most which we buy from Costco because they are a fraction of what they cost in a pet store or online(these dogs don't eat just anything and are very particular about what goes in their mouths).  We use them all to try to keep our dogs teeth healthy and save $450++.  So far it's working.  I would recommend these C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Chews but would get the largest possible even for toy dogs.  You don't have to worry so much about them choking when they are so big and you throw them away when they get small. Our dogs favorite are the bully sticks and they drink water with the enzyme material in it without any problem.
