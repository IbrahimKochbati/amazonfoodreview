One of my medical assistants always talks kids into giving a urine sample by telling them that we have to check to see if there are any green hoppy frogs in their urine.  Well, as you can imagine, many a reluctant preschooler is willing to pee in a cup with that in mind.  How wonderful to show them that there are green hoppy frogs!  We just put a couple in a (clean) Dixie cup and return it to the children.  I wish I could download the expressions on their faces when they see these little creatures!  Oh, by the way, 5 lb bag lasted over 6 months in my solo rural pediatric office  that is a lot of urine samples!  Many  siblings insists on giving a sample also just for a taste of these gummies!
