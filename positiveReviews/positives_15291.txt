I like my Keurig.  The only thing I have to say is that in my haste to purchase this product, I may not have investigated my purchase very thoroughly which is what I will do from here on out.  I learned a very valuable lesson.          This machine has a selection for two cup sizes, 5.25 or 7.25 oz, neither of which are very large.  And you can't really use a K cup twice.  Trust me, I tried.          Other than the small sizes I like my Keurig.  So I can't blame the machine because it is what it is.
