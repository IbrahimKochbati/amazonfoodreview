Disgusting, slimy, stinky!  I love jerky but have a weak jaw and have trouble chewing it. A diet website recommended this meatless jerky, so I ordered it to try it.  Absolutely horrible!  I recently gave the entire order (except for a small bite I tasted) to a friend to be donated to feed the homeless.  I hope someone may like it.  It comes from the package wet and slimy and has a clove like odor.  That's about all I can remember about it.
