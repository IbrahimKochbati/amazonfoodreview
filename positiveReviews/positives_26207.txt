After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita  and. I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.          UPDATE 3 28 2012:     I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around.
