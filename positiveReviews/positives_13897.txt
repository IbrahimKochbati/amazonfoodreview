Wow! i was pretty surprised at how well this actually turned out! i had my doubts about the texture mostly, but combining with water really works! i also tried with milk and cream(kinda defeats the purpose XD), and it only does a little for texture and taste. I wouldnt compare the taste to that of natural or organic PB though, as it tastes more like Skippy, Peter Pan, and Jiffy. My favorite is combining 2Tbsp PB2 with 1Tbsp of regular, but im so happy that i can finally snack on  peanut butter without worrying about the calories! Also doesnt sit in your stomach like regular peanut butter can. Over a great product and i will continue to get it!
