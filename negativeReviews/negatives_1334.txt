I was looking for another dinner to try and decided to spend the extra money on this one.  I thought.. my son loves chicken and mangos so why not this. He is not a fan. He will suffer through half a jar, but will not finish a whole one. I guess it was a little too exotic for his 9 month old taste buds.  We will keep trying.          He loves, loves, loves the beef and spinach and will almost cry when the jar is gone.
