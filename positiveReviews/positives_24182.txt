Great for long lasting chewing...good on teeth. My La adoodle, who is a very productive, super fast chewer(could compete nationally) takes about 3days to mostly diminish this treat. Many other pets(especially non chewers who don't get enough chewing d t non interest in chew treats(like my poor dental health bearded collie) take much, much longer(months). Does produce a bit of a non pleasant odor when thoroughly slimed by my voracious chewer La adoodle.
