At first my dog was unsure, but it didn't take long until he was chewing, biting, and scratching at the toy.  He played with it for HOURS over a two day period. He finally got tired of it, and I put it away for another time when it be "new" for him again.  Great toy!  (By the way, I bought size small and it is the right size for my 16 lb. dog.)
