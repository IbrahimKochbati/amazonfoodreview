I was recently given a gift of HealthWise Gourmet coffee, and I am delighted with the smooth, rich taste. It is a nice change from my usual popular gourmet coffee choice, and I have prepared a very refreshing iced coffee by strengthening the ratio of coffee to water. I do not have an acid reflux issue, but I certainly appreciate the low acid benefits of HeathWise and will recommend it to friends and family. I have a case of decaf on hand as I certainly don't want to run out!
