I wish I could give this product more than 5 stars!  I have been making my  ead from this every week  it slices well (I get 14 20 slices from a loaf) and is great days later, still soft and doesn't need toasting.  When I did the sweet  ead recipe on the loaf my family went crazy.  This is my go to  ead now and I just bake it slice it and ziploc it, leaving it on the counter just like glutened  ead.  And the recipes you can use it for!  Check out the Pamela's site for recipes.  Amazon subscribe and save has the best prices though.  I am very happy I purchased this and many more Pamela's products.
