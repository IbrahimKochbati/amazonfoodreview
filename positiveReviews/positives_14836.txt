A very rich flavor, I am biased as I like Earl Grey Tea.  It's great for an after dinner tea, a little too heavy (for me) to be used in the early morning.  I found Rishi Tea to be flavorful and robust.  I wasn't previously a loose leaf tea drinker, but I'm now looking for the perfect set so I can start  ewing the leaves at work.  It's also a perfect tea for the heavy coffee drinker who is looking for something different once in a while.  Highly recommended.
