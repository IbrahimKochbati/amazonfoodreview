I was feeding my pup the Science Diet Healthy Development dry dog food and she wasn't seeming to each as much as she use to. So I switched to Science Diet Lamb and Rice Meal dry dog food...still just as picky. I have heard great things about Blue Buffalo and decided to give it a shot   she loves it! I've been mixing it half half with the Science Diet food, but she eats only the Blue Buffalo and then comes back an hour or so later to finish up the Science Diet. She has had no digestion issues and eats the LifeSource bits mixed in with the food as well   I had heard some dogs are picky and won't eat the LifeSource bits, but so far she likes them!
