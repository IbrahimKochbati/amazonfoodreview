This turned out fantastic, a little sweeter than I expecting but still great. May even consider this a dessert wine. Its nice using Cornucopia kits as they come complete with all the supplies you need, corks,labels,toppers,etc. I only use distilled water in the making of the wine, dont want to chance it with anything else. They have always turned out great. Give it a try.....The Farmwiner
