Up until now, I believed I was feeding my dogs a healthful treat that was good for them. Of note: the glucosamine and chondroitin content in these jerky treats is of the highest I've seen in a treat that they actually "like" and look forward to having. I was feeding these as a daily joint supplement to my poodle in particular who, as of late, had been experiencing more joint issues after a traumatic hip injury years earlier.          Thanks to the savvy poster who  ought to light this product is now being produced in China. Costco sells jerky treats made in China as well, and I no longer purchase those and warn my clients about purchasing them too. Only made in the USA and USDA inspected, as far as I'm concerned.          Why oh why can't pet owners find a decently priced, trustworthy jerky treat for our pets that is A. High in glucosamine and B. Isn't manufactured in China? Being that China has shown little diligence with regards to creating a child's toy that isn't later involved in a recall, I'm certainly not about to give any credence to something that will be ingested by my pets. I'm tossing the rest of these treats in the trash!          No. Thank. You.
