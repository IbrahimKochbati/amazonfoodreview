There are at least two known  eeds of Spotted Dick (or Spotted Dog, as it was once called).  The one that was a staple of my childhood (English working class) diet is a steamed suet pudding.  It is made from suet, flour, sugar, currants and raisins, and is usually served with treacle.          The Heinz canned version is a very different animal, a member of the sponge pudding race, containing no suet.  It is nice enough, and is especially good with English style custard.  It is tasty, filling and easy to prepare, and its name makes it great fun.          But if you are a fan of the Au ey Maturin stories and want to eat like them, be warned that this is not the real thing.  The genuine Spotted Dick (or Dog), described in O'Brian's books, is the glorious suet pudding of my youth.     [PeterReeve]
