BOTTOM LINE     Schar makes the best gluten free  ead, bar none.  These are indistinguishable from normal  ead, except they taste better, especially when toasted          TASTE     I love to toast all my  ead before eating and, when toasted, these taste better than normal submarine rolls.  They are crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside.          SIZE     These rolls are somewhat thinner than the average submarine roll, but they work just fine for most sandwiches I would make.  I used these for some delicious lobster rolls!          PRICE     For gluten free  ead, these rolls are not even outrageously priced!
