I used to order kalamata olives in small containers by the case through a food co op.  Since retiring downsizing and moving to a large city I do not have the storage space for case orders even when they are available.  However, one small container won't last long here.  This large jug available through Amazon was a good buy for me.  This arrived in a large box with other ordered items.  However, it was securely wrapped in plastic.  This was a good thing since about a teaspoon of liquid had leaked.  The lid was on tight and there was no evidence of mishandling.  The liquid never went beyond the plastic wrapper.  The olives are fine.
