As in the words of Charles Dickens..."My dear, if you could give me a cup of tea to clear my muddle of a head I should better understand your affairs." I take that to heart!          Okay, this tea is a mix of black tea(contains caffeine) and spearmint. As many of you already know, drinking spearmint tea has many health benefits. Personally, I prefer spearmint tea over any other herbal tea and I drink this Bigelow one during the morning and afternoon time. I drink another spearmint tea  and(caffeine free) at night before bed.          The packaging is excellent. The individual tea bags are wrapped up in an individual packet(envelope) of their own..unlike some other  ands that have all the tea bags in one big packet. The packets are great for women to carry in their purses or men to carry in their pockets, making it convenient for a person to make a cup of tea elsewhere(e.g. the office)
