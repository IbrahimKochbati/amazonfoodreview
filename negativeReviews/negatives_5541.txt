I cook a lot, and I have a few ways of preparing pork chops that my teen boys like.  I picked up this Shake N Bake pouch with the hope that it could fill in on those really busy nights.  I didn't expect it to be as good as 'from scratch', but I expected it to be edible.          If you were alive in the 70's, you know that Shake n Bake is a pre made coating you put in a bag along with your meat.  As you may have guessed, you shake the bag, then bake your meat.  It's simple, and it's a low fat alternative to stovetop methods that need oil or butter. But the result is pretty pedestrian.  The coating doesn't crisp very well; it was downright mushy in spots, and the 'spices' in the mix were bland bland bland.          Pork is already low fat and bland.  It needs a little bit of fat for flavor.  I don't fry any meat, but I do sautee my pork chops (coated with Panko & my own spices)in a splash of olive oil , which makes them moister, tastier, and crunchier.  To me, the baking just didn't work well.  Maybe if the SnB coating was actually, you know, flavorful, it would have helped.  But between the baking and the coating, the pork chops were bland and mushy.          BOTTOM LINE:  My hungry teen boys picked at them and asked to never have them again.
