Love these crackers.  They're very satisfying without being too salty or sweet.  Unfortunately a large number of crackers were  oken in each package.  Based on the packaging.......crackers in a row in light cardstock box wrapped in cellophane.....it's probably not possible to ship without alot of  eakage. For this reason, I probably won't order this item online again.
