We bought this after reading about it on Dr. Sear's website. Our son has had no problems at all with the formula, we add  own rice syrup per our pediatricians recommendation (to add calories) Our son was a preemie, and was EBF for the first 7 months until stress from work affected milk production. Our son took to the goats milk right away, we mixed the first couple bottles with  eastmilk until we knew he had no digestive issues with it, then were able to give him goats milk by itself. The goats milk smells and tastes better when warm than cold. I grew up on goats milk myself, so the taste doesn't bother me, but my husband isn't crazy about. Good thing our son loves it, because that's what really counts! It's 1 3 the cost of convential (cow's milk based) formula and is easier for tiny tummies to digest. It's a win win all around!
