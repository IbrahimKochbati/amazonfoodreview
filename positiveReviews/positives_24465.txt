I also grew up eating Worthington and Loma Linda products, and these were my favorite too.  Try  eading them with Brewer's Yeast.  Very different taste, but sooo delicious.  Many other foods have been discontinued    I'm just glad these are still available.          Does anyone know why the 20 oz can of Skallops are $18, while the 50 oz can is $11.75??  In the store, a regular sized can costs about $3; it would make sense if this $18 price were for a pack of 6 cans of Skallops.  As it is, I don't dare to order it  $18 is way too much for one can of anything.
