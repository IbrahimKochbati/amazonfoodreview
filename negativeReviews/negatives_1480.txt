The item shipped in an unsealed plastic bag within a  own cardboard shipping sleeve. Arrived with product loose and falling out of the cardboard.  No effort had been made to seal the plastic bag or the shipping sleeve. Unbelievable.     The product itself is very foul tasting with a horrible lingering aftertaste. Could be the coating?          I am very disappointed in the purchase and would never buy again. Especially from this vendor. Stay away from these!
