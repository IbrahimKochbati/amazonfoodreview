I bought this tea in hopes it would lower my blood pressure.  I have not been to the doctor yet to see if it's helped.  I drink it without any sweetners.  Beautiful red color.  Packaging is good with a zip lock to keep it fresh.  I did find this same tea at my local Mexican market where it's sold as Jamaica at a lower price.  Will probably keep buying it there.
