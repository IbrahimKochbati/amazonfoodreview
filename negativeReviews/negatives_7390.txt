I will not be able to commit on the flavor, because beware this popcorn is not packaged in a safe manner. It come in a plastic bag that is opened at the top, they closed it with a twist tie and nothing else to ensure a sealed closure of the popcorn, anyone can open it at anytime and then reclose it and you would never know it. I tossed it because I would worry if I let my 3 little one eat it that it was contaminated tampered with.
