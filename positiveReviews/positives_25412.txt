My dogs LOVE these. I've got 2 big pups, and one of these can keep them busy for about 10 minutes (for blissful silence!). They smell terrible (we call them Stinky Chews), but the the dogs go crazy for them. According to the package, they are great for the dog's teeth, and our vet supports them. Our dogs also have had a GREAT dental history and have no plaque... even though we don't  ush their teeth regularly. These are expensive, but worth it. I've bought at least 40 packages and will continue to do so. I can't beat Amazon's price anywhere IF I buy 2 packages at a time for the free shipping.
