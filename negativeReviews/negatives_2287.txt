I bought these for my vegan father who LOVES the curry kale chips by Rhythm Superfoods (my 22 month old daughter, husband and I also like them)!          Thought I would give him a new kale chip flavor  BBQ  as part of his Christmas gift. Although a different  and than we typically eat, they sounded good. First, I was disappointed to see these chips are not kale in its natural curly form but pressed into round, dog snack looking discs. Luckily I tried them before giving them. I spit it right out! Was it just me? My husband also tried one and couldn't finish even one chip.          I have a pack of 4 that cannot be returned... what a waste of food and money!
