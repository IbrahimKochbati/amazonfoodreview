We have used Colavita olive oil now for many years and have always found it to be an excellent oil for use in cooking and on salads. It has an nice flavor and is far superior to other oils we have tried in the past. I am looking at a partially used bottle as I write this review; I will also add we have a new unopened bottle in the pantry in reserve.          Colavita Olive Oil is made in Italy by the Colavita family who has shipped this product to the USA for nearly 30 years according to the label. The label provides additional important information about this olive oil in that it is extra virgin and first cold pressed.          I have read in a number of publications that these qualities are important when one is selecting an olive oil. My wife is our nutritional expert and always specifies this  and of olive oil only.          As a husband and consumer of salads and various other assorted foods which benefit from olive oil I can testify that it has a great flavor as far as olive oils go.
