Imagine, GF  ead that is a time saver!  But in the big picture, I bake my own healthy flax seed  ead.  Very tasty, but very time consuming.  Pamela's is the best tasteing, best texture I've found that I don't have to measure 4 or 5 flours to make.  Just oopen the bag and mix.  I buy this stuff by the case.  I love to make rolls with it.  I just haven't found anything better.
