My 10 month old Golden Doodle had chewed through the rope within 30 minutes.  The "bottle" part is hard plastic and very loud when bounced around.  The knot on the rope (when we still had a rope) fit too tightly into the opening making getting treats out of the bottle close to impossible.  I had hoped this would be one of those toys to occupy her a bit more.  And for the price, think the rope would have been somewhat tougher to a chewer like mine.     If your dog is a chewer I can't recommend this.  Not what I expected or hoped for.....
