This food is organic, sure.  However, look at the ingredients, top 7 includes chicken meal.  Never feed your pet anything with chicken meal or chicken by product.  It's a cheap substitute, and really is bad for the dog.  I suggest a  and like Evo, Blue Buffalo, ect.  No ingredient should be meal or by product.
