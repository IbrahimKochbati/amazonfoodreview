Each package of mangos is like 25% full, pretty ridiculous if you ask me. Also, the mangos don't taste that good, at least in the package I got. They are not that sweet, and kind of hard to chew. If you want to get dried mangos, I would recommend going to a farmer's market. At least from my experience, the ones there tend to be much sweeter than these.
