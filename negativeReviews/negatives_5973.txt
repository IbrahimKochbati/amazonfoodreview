I admit I bought a box of these at an Organic Sensitive Aware Health food grocery store, so I expected it to be expensive. However, this one deserves to be an entry in Consumer Reports' last page, which unfortunately I can't remember the name of at the moment.  Each month, the last page of CR's magazine has pictures people send in of scandalously absurd ripoffs, ad goofs, typos, etc, such as a picture of a six inch tall pill bottle with the 1 2 cubic inch of actual pills that came in it   i.e. making the packaging look real big so the sucker customer will not realize the contents are so paltry.  Enjoy Life's marketing department did its job well; the box is 5 1 4"H x 6 1 2"W x 1 1 2" D: the actual food item, once you unwrap the (5 1 2" inch long) foil packet is just under 3" long, less than 1 2" wide, & 3 8" deep.  I was driving when I ripped open the packet, & almost drove off the road when I beheld the veritable rat poo dimensions of the bar.  Yes, it is sold by weight (5 oz; the things are dense), but the packaging is ridiculously misleading.          Oh, the taste.  It's okay; vaguely sunflower seed ish, merely the barest rumor of a whisper of sweetness or salt; as with most GF food manufacturers, Enjoy Life seems to feel that those of us who must forego gluten, or dairy or nuts or whatever also have no interest in flavor.  It does have a nice chewy mouth feel to it, which would have been nicer had there been more to feel.          In a (presumably) unconscious self satire, in big letters on the back of the box, it says "Still Hungry?"  Well yes, and I know several people who would answer same if they ate the entire box of bar lets, particularly if they'd been expecting something appropriate to the size of the box.
