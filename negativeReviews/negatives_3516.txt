Plus they would not accept returns after I opened them...BEWARE of these.  I was expecting something that resembled a chestnut but it tasted like moldy gunk.  If there were negative stars, this product would receive negative...     Make sure you purchase directly from Amazon because the other sellers don't allow returns.  I had to throw the whole case of 24 away.
