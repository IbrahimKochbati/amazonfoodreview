When you read Mexican Sweet Chili, you think hot! Well this tea while being tangy and hot also delivers alot of unique flavors. A great wake up or finish to a spicy meal.     Clove, Cardamon, Cinnamon then black Pepper and Red Chili flavors, a unique cup of tea. Would be excellent Iced or with milk. I will reorder & reorder, this one a keeper.
