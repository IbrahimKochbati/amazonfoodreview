Absolutely outstanding, if you like the aroma of Bergamot.  Despite the extemely strong aroma, the Bergamot flavor is not overwhelming (Taylor's aroma is milder, but its Bergamot flavor is completely overwhelming). Most Earl Grey is too subtile for me.          Bergamot is probably a learned appreciation.  It is from citrus like a cross between an orange and a lime, with a powerful aroma and flavor of its own (inedible as fruit).          You can still taste the tea, and it is great quality.  Add to this Fair Trade, Organic,and a great price, it can't be equaled.          So if you like Bergamot aroma, and want enough Bergamot flavor to tell it's there, don't bother looking at anything else.
