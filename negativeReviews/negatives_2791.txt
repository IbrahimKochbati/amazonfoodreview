I knew before buying that the ingredients weren't all that wholesome: evaporated cane juice, enriched wheat flour, what are those doing in a  eakfast? If a product is claiming to be a healthy  eakfast, it should really have 100% unadulterated ingredients. (I'll give the Erin Baker's  and its due for using aluminum free baking powder.) All that having been said, if you regard this as a cookie rather than a meal replacement, you'll be happy with it. It's healthy for a cookie, tastes decent, and fantastically convenient (take it out of the freezer in the morning and it's good to go in 2 hours without heating). But despite what other reviewers have said, it's a high calorie snack at best. I am a 115 lb female and this barely held me over for about 2 and a half hours before I was starving again. If you're someone with a small appetite, try packing it with a piece of fruit   Bottom line, it's a healthy cookie, not  eakfast, much less a healthy  eakfast.
