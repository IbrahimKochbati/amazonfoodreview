This is the perfect basket for a friend or co worker.  I ordered it for a co worker's birthday and was able to be there when she opened it.  All the items were really well packaged and beautifully presented.  I got to try a few items and everything was delicious (can you say chocolate peanut butter pretzel? yes please.)  Would absolutely order this basket again.  One more thing  usually you get a basket that you can't really use  this basket was great to have in the house for storage, or presentation...I loved the leather handles...Great great great overall.  Thank you!!
