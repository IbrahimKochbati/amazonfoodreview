My dogs, the 1st day I tried these, didn't really seem to like them. Now they practically climb up me to get to them. My older dog was having trouble with tarter and bad  eathe.  After 2 weeks of using the treats, her teeth looked a lot better and the nasty odor was gone.  The reason for the 4 stars is because of the expense, which for me is times 2.
