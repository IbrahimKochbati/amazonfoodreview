These tablets did work, but were not nearly as effective as I had expected.  I set up an entire spread of foods, cheeses, fruits, vegetables, liquids etc to try and when my friends and I allowed the tablets to dissolve, they only worked on a couple things and only for a very short period of time (maybe 5 10 min?)
