We were very excited to order the Blueberry Pancake mixes since we've loved many other Stonewall products. Unfortunately, we didn't like the pancake mix at all. We actually ended up throwing the pancakes away. The batter itself tasted terrible. It had this strong, almost sour taste and almost seemed carbonated fizzy? We thought it would be better after we cooked it, but it wasn't. Also the blueberries were like hard little rocks.          Too bad we bought the 3 pack, because now we have a lot of this product and won't be able to use it.
