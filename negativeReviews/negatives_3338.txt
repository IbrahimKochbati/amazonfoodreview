Got these free in the Newman's Own Dog Food bag. My dogs have been fans of the other Newman's treats in the past, but this is a whole other story. One dog played with hers for a few minutes and then abandoned it (eating it several hours later). The other one took a bite and decided she didn't like it. Nice to get free treats, but I would never buy them!
