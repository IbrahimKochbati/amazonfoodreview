My ten year old dachshund loves these! How much does he love them? Two weeks ago, he hid under the bed and whined. I took a packet of these treats and began opening the packet, he ran out from under the bed in anticipation and into the kitchen.          My miniature dachshund is fed the very best of homemade organic diet (a take on the Spot Stew diet). He is not a picky eater but will rarely go crazy for treats that are not home made.          The reason I like Newman's Organics is because finding organic lamb to incorporate in my dog's diet is impossible. Finding organic lamb meat is almost as hard as finding unicorn meat. These treats allow diversity in his food (he usually gets chicken, turkey, or tofu with oatmeal or  own rice and a variety of vegetables).          The ingredients listed on these treats are organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic apples, organic palm oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols, a source of vitamin E), organic molasses.          The analysis listed on these  eaks down as follows: crude protein   9.0% min, crude fat   4.0z% min, crude fiber   4.0% max, moisture   11% max.          I'd definitely say these are dog and owner approved!
