Just like theater popcorn and exactly what I was looking for! I love it and will order more in the future. Some folks in my family think it is salty. Sometimes before I pop a pack, I pour the packet into a paper plate and remove some of the salt.  by separating the kernels from the salt mixture. Then I pour the kernels back into the packet and wait for the popcorn machine.
