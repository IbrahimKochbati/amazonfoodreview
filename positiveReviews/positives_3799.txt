I purchased the Honey Stung Smokies and some of the reviews stated that they were mushy, I wouldn't go that far, but they are softer then most beef sticks but they still have a 'snap' to them. The taste is great, even the picky kids liked these smokies I think we will try some of the other flavors. plus order these again.
