I used to buy this sugar for years. I do not eat much sugar, but still. This sugar is called turbinado sugar, but is misleading. I picked this  and just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other  ands (in the local food store) that their sugar is  own because it is colored with caramel or something.          HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became  own and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.          I'm just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice.
