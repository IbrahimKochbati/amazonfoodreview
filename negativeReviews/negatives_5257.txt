The idea is great.  I am a big fan of soup so being able to make a quick hot bowl very fast is great.  The packaging could not be better.  The noodles are not dehydrated like you find in most other quick soups.  They are soft and neatly contained in a seperate bag inside the bowl.  There are also separate small bags for the liquid flavoring and dehydrated vegetables.  This is a high quality product but for my personal tastes, it was simply too bland and delicate.  I did not enjoy this soup but will definitely try the other flavors.  The Korean kimchi had much more flavor and thicker noodles.
