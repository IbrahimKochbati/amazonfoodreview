We love using this!  It's great mixed with a little vodka (you use a lot of dust for a small amount of vodka, be warned)and creates a very metallic looking color to your royal icing or fondant.  For royal icing make sure it's dried for 24 hours before you paint it, or it will pit.  One note, it doesn't work well on chocolate.  The silver luster dust covered nicely, but the gold just didn't look right.  You couldn't get it on thick enough to look like gold.
