I buy these for my neices, nephews, and grandsons. I've also been known to scarf one down on occasion. My only complaint is I've never received one of these in at least five or six shipments where the individual packets were  oken in less than several hundred pieces. It doesn't effect the taste, but for around three bucks apiece, I mean?  Are the ones that aren't shattered sold separately?
