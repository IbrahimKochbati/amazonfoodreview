To me, fruit juice in small cans are simply a staple   first example that comes to mind is good ol' Dole pineapple juice. The trend towards trendy little "health" beverages in overpriced little cans is nearly tragic.          There is nothing about this product that would compel me to buy it. If I want a soda, I'll just grab one. I don't drink enough of them to have much dietary impact and despite the claim of "100% What You Want", there is nothing in here for me. If I want 100% Of What I Want, I will buy a few oranges and some seltzer water. If I want "0% Of What You Don't Want", well, why buy it?          This is a time when we had better look pretty closely at what is an indulgent convenience and what is a necessity, and how to find a happy medium. I consider the likes of Pellegrino Aranciata, Orangina and Izze a luxury, and when I indulge it is a true delight.          "Switch" is a product that is not better tasting, proven healthier, or even less expensive than any of many other alternatives. Once again marketing is driving product creation and design, and that is a hateful concept.          If you want a similar taste experience for about the same price,  pick up some Alka Seltzer Cold Plus Nighttime  you'll stop sneezing and sniffling and get a great night's sleep.
