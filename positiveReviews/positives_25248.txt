I bought this Maple Syrup based on the reviews of this product and I am very pleased.          In the past I had always purchased Grade A Maple Syrup at the market. I was not even     aware of a Grade B. However, I have found the Grade B to be very robust and full     flavored on my Belgian Waffles for  eakfast.          A great way to start the day!
