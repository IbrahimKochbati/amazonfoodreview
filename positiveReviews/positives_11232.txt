I initially purchased a package of this  ownie mix from Walmart; it was on clearance. For years, I had no idea why I was always sick. One of the outstanding food problems was chocolate. Consequently, I did not eat it. I was not sad, but every now and again I would want to have a bite of it. It couldn't be too chocolately; it had to be more on the lines of a milk chocolate flavor. Anyway, I made these  ownies tonight. Since I like cake like  ownies (not such a concentrated chocolate flavor), I made some changes. I did not use the recipe on the package. In place of the listed 1 2 cup of water, I used 1 2 cup of milk. I also added 1 4 cup of water. I like cooked pecans, so I added slightly chopped pecans in the batter and some whole pecans on top. The result was really good  ownies. I like the melted chunks of chocolate in  ownies. My  ownies were no where close to gritty. This may be due to the fact that I used milk (lactose free) in place of the main water ingredient. Will buy again and use for events. It won't even be necessary to tell others it is gluten free until AFTER they've said how good they are. (smile)
