My boyfriend just got fired from his job b c he was required to do a drug test and it showed positive for cocaine.  He does not do cocaine.  The day of the test he did happen to have 2 cups of Delisse Mate De Coco and he didn't think anything about it.  It's actually sold in the US and being sold on sites like Amazon.com b c these distributors are outside of the U.S., people have  ought it back through customs with no issues (his mom  ought it from Ecuador) and he has found scientific journals supporting that the coca leaf or the coca leaf teas that are sold or  ought into the US are actually listed as "illegal" by the US Government.  Here is the link to the US Department of Justice CLEARLY stating that "coca leaf" is a schedule II substance and illegal.          [...]          DO NOT DRINK THIS TEA IF YOU ARE AT RISK FOR A DRUG TEST OR GETTING RANDOM DRUG TESTED AT WORK.  I've also seen reviews on other coca leaf teas where people have given warnings about losing a job opportunity.          If you did get fired, it's really hard to fight b c most will just see a positive drug test for cocaine. The only other ways to test positive for cocaine metabolites is if you actually did cocaine or have a major disease such as Kidney or Liver Disease.  If you never drank coca leaf, then I would suggest you go to a doctor to make sure you don't have liver or kidney disease.  It would really suck to get fired for having a disease and having a disease that created cocaine metabolites would be something you could really fight legally, in my opinion, b c at that point it's wrongful termination.  In Texas if you get fired for a drug test even if you had no previous disciplinary action you can not receive unemployment.  He's even spoken to an Employment Lawyer and they said it'll be hard for him to fight in court.
