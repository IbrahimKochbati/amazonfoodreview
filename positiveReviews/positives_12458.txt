I bought this in Montana on I90 at a gas station just to try ($.50 .99).  I believe this is the best soda out there.  If you can find it locally to save on shipping I would definitely give it a try and I will be looking for it locally also.          I am from Wisconsin (a cherry state) and we have real (natural) cherry sodas.
