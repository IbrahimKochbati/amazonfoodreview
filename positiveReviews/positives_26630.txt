We adopted a golden retriever at 15mo old, she came with a bad rash so the vet suggested this. Dog is not picky and she loves both the food and the same treat. It's been 10 months and we're also trying the duck and salom, which are less expensive. FYI, I contacted the company and found out the calories: 1 cup food 437, 1 large treat 37.5, 1 small treat 2. Happy eating!
