This is only the second time I have purchased pure maple syrup.  The first I bought at the grocery store; it was a grade A.  It lacked much maple flavor.  So I bought this grade B syrup, thinking the stronger flavor would be better liked.  We hate it.  It has a very bitter after taste.  I don't know what to do now becuase we don't like the grade B, but the grade A isn't strong enough in flavor.
