I like these Sesame Rice Thins because they are just the thing I need to fill between meals. Especially with a bit of cheese, Philly Cheese, tasty spread and other. Great to have separated packages, because I go through one so quickly and my husband loves to munch on these all the time. I recommend these to anyone who wants a different type of snack for a party or just for one's self.
