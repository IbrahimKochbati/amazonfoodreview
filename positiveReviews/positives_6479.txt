I have at least 4 dozen different k cups at my house right now because we love to experiment with different flavors.  My favorite is Timothy's Rainforest Espresso because I like a bold coffee.  But others that prefer something milder say that Breakfast in Bed is their favorite.  I like it to but only when made as a stronger  ew.  I have purchased maybe 15 boxes of this since it came out.
