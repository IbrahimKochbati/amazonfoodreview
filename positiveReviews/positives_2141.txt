For canned soup this is very good clam chowder.  Those who give it 1 or 2 stars are comparing it to homemade soup or restaurant style soup.  I would buy this any day over other  ands.  You can tell it is all natural and without loaded msg, salt and other nasty ingredients.  Pure and clean soup.  Those who rate it badly, some say it has no flavor or there aren't chunks in it.  The flavor is mild, but that is good  not overwhelmingly clammy and not over salted like conventional  and canned soup.  If I want to, next time I will add a potato cut up in chunks to boost it's contents  not a big deal to do.  I would prefer to do that than buy a conventional  and that doesn't care about healthy ingredients and sourcing of ingredients.  I will buy this again  good source of iron as well.
