My wife loves these biscuits so I thought I would surprise her and buy a Family Pack of 5. They arrived packed in a box with the other items I purchased which included a heavy can of syrup and a can of pectin, neither of which were fully secured inside the box. Although they tasted as good as usual, my wife was very disappointed since so many of the biscuits were  oken, probably around 20%. I doubt whether we will buy these on line again.
