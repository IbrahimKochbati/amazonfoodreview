I have used Premium Edge Lamb Formula dry dog food for years.  While many dog food manufacturers use real lamb   and not lamb meal   in their adult formulas, this is the ONLY manufacturer that uses real lamb in its Puppy Formula as well.  Hounds have sensitive stomaches and lamb digests best without upsetting their stomaches.  It also promotes a shiny, healthy coat while minimizing shedding and flakey skin conditions that are experienced by some  eeds.  The food nuggets are small in size and appropriate for all  eeds and sizes of dogs; the nutritional values are the highest or on level with that of many so called "premium"  ands   and better than that of some.  I have fed Premium Edge Lamb   both adult and puppy   to my Salukis for 12 years and heartily recommend it.  Read the order of ingredients in your pet's food; they are listed in the order of most to least included in the product.  "Lamb meal" contains ground bone and other waste as well as the meat itself; this manufacturer uses only the Meat.
