I have always been a fan of Annie's products, and since I'm overseas at the moment, I didn' have access to the products. That's where Amazon comes in! The price is very good almost the same as buying them in the store in the states and the product came in great shape and the expiration date is not soon either!     As for the product itself, I think the sauce can use less salt, but other wise I love it! Natural ingredients and it takes less than 10 minutes for me to make it  )
