I was introduced to this about 30 years ago as a child and I've loved it ever since.          I first had it on steaks,  i've put it on fish,  vegetables.  I love to sprinkle it over freash steamed  occli and mow...          it's really very good...there are a ton if ingredients in it....all natural...
