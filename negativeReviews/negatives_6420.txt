I bought this honey substitute and a bottle of Nature's Hollow Honey Substitue for a side by side comparison with Honey Tree Imitation Honey, which I have used for years. I believe this product has a slightly slimy texture and "mouth feel". It also lacked the pronounced honey flavor I find in the Honey Tree. Although it does not cause the gas "problem" that can occur with large comsumption of Honey Tree, I believe I will stay with Honey Tree. Note: I have used Honey Tree as a base for pecan pie (instead of Karo syrup) and it was just okay. Excess gas was a definite problem as I always eat a large slice of pecan pie. I intend to make a pie with the Natrazyle. If it is better than the Honey Tree I will report back.
