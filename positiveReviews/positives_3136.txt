I already have the Bluebird from Blue and was using it to record a friend's live performance. With only a laptop computer at my disposal, I was able to connect my XLR to USB directly into Garageband. The Icicle is small, portable, and so easy to use   plus, I didn't have to carry a huge A to D converter!
