Big fat beans roasted just right....easy to get out of bed for a mug of this coffee.     Much preferred to the Lively Up, the only other Marley Coffee I tried.     My friend who is a coffee snob even likes it.     Ordered the whole beans and I use my Aero Press to make it.     Have already reordered.
