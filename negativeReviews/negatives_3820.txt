I suppose the flavor of this carbonated juice could be satisfying to someone, just not me.  If I were thirsty and no other drink was available, I would drink it, but even if I were to like the taste, when I want a drink, I almost always want more than the 8.3 ounces contained in the can.  (Why 8.3 ounces?)  I wonder if the market for this drink is for those who must religiously consume liquids in extreme moderation.  It must be quite hard to come up with a successful new drink product. The Switch Kiwi Berry may be a perfect demonstration of how hard it is.  Better luck next time.
