I have tried many of the Lavazza blends as I MUST have my morning cappuccino and can't be without a good espresso blend.  My hubby only drinks decaf and we have found this blend to be just as good as the regular blend Lavazza.  Many times I blend it 1 2 and 1 2 for a late day pick me up.  Wouldn't be without it.
