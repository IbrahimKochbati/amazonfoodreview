These are supposed to help with dental health   I'm not sure about that, but they don't have added corn syrup or sugar, and they take a few minutes to chow down. Buffy, Princess of Goldens, loves these and takes each daily treat out to the front yard to roll on before consuming   high praise from her. My vet recommended them over the usual grain, fat, and corn syrup based treats. This is one of the few treats I'm comfortable with giving daily, it's not doggie junk food.
