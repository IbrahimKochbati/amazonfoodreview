These cookies were ok, just ok.  I may have been inclined to give them three stars had they arrived as whole cookies, every last cookies was  oken.  I understand this is probably due to poor packaging.  The consistency was a bit grainy and dry though.  And milk did not help.  Next time I'll purchase a chewy  and or Mrs. Fields.
