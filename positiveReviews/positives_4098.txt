This coffee, whether  ewed in the Keurig via eco cup or in a standard coffee pot tasted stale.  Not the award winning coffee that I expected to taste.  It didn't take me back to Hawaii, but instead took me to the Folger's coffee aisle in the grocery store.  Will not order again.  What a waste of money.          updated 2 3 12   The seller got in touch with me and offered to refund my money.  He apologized for the coffee not being up to standard.  The seller has good communication.  Maybe I just got a bad batch.  Who knows...  Thank you!
