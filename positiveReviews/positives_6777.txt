This is simply the best decaf for making espresso money can buy. At a fraction of the cost, this coffee beats everything else out there, including Illy. Try also the regular variety and "crema e gusto". They are all well worth the money. Note: this coffee should be used only for making espresso. Of course, you have to know what you are doing as well.
