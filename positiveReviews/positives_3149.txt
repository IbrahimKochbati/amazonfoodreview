ive heard mixed reviews of this.. yeah it feels cheap... but so what?! just take care of it like you would anything like that! and it sounds perfect! i use it to record vocals on logic studio (i get others to sing, i cannot; but they sound amazing) ive had no problems with it and im super happy with the purchase. well worth the money!
