In recent months I have become an Amazon.com Prime Fanatic.  Why? Because you can buy a lot of good stuff cheap (meaning "cost effective")and have it delivered in two days for free!  How can you hate that?  But, Beware!!          As President Reagan once said "Trust but Verify". I have actually corrected his intent because I think he was trying to be too Politically Correct; that is "Distrust and Verify". You must ALWAYS shop and reshop, internet and retail, to see what makes Price Sense.          To the point: I can buy the 40 Oz. (2 1 2 Lb.) bag of B&J Kona Blend coffee beans in the decorative bag for $16.99 (No Sales Tax in MA) at my local BJ's.  An aggressive Amazon.Com Marketplace Seller is offering the same item for $40.69 plus $8.24 shipping, $48.93 Total.  I will not dignify the sellers price by speculating what the profit margin might be or what the final Unit Price results in.  You be the judge. All I can say again is "Distrust and Verify".          P.S.  I defend the right of a company to gouge their customers.  That's what Capitalism and America are all about.  Flip side is that others will see the gouging and decide to sell the same product for less money  that's also Capitalism and what we're all about.          I would encourage readers to comment on my opinion.  Thank You.
