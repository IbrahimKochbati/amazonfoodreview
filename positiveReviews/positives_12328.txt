My three dogs love this food.  It is the only one I've found that seems to appeal very much to all of them.  My oldest pup (age @15 we think) has got more spring in his arthritic old self, and they all have beautiful, shiny coats and clear eyes.  I would recommend this to any dog lover and their beloved pet.
