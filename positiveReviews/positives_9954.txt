I have been on a quest to find the most nutritious dog food for the last year. After trying various  ands this one is the definite and obvious winner. My dogs are seniors but they prefer the puppy recipe to the senior recipe. The puppy one is loaded with protein and nutrients which make their coats shine. They love the food, and are in great health, spirits and have boundless energy.
