No flowery notes, thank god!  This is the most perfect k cup coffee I've tried.. It's my trusty ol faithful "go back to" coffee when I veer off and try another  and.  If you want a solid yummy true bold but not bitter cup of joe get this, u won't be sorry. It is yummy black or with creamer...! Leaves a true good coffee after taste and is AMAZING with dessert.
