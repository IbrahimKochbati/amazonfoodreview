They were the large candy bars.  I I'm not really sure what to say.  It tasted just like a Snickers.  They arrive by UPS during the middle of our Texas heat and not a one was melted.  I was really concern about them melting, but to my surprise they were not.  I watched the UPS tracking all the way from California to Texas so I know they didn't come Fast shipping, great packaging & good tasting product.
