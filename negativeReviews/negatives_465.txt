There should be an option for a 0 star rating because that is what I would rate this item.     First, the sampling was to include 9 varieties but included only 7.  It appears that the two flavors out of stock were not substituted with two other flavors but instead a few more of the remaining flavors were tossed in the box. I had expected that when a limited edition coffee flavor such as Island Coconut was out of stock, it would be replaced with a different limited edition coffee flavor.  Same thing for the Half and Half Lemonade.     Second, the order was not balanced.  Of the 7 flavors I did receive, only 2 were coffees, the remaining 5 were teas.     The concept of a summer sampler set is a good one but the execution here was an epic fail.  The order is being returned today.
