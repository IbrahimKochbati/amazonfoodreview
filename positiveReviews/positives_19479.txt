Butter Toffee is not a flavor I thought I would like   for some reason the name makes me think of an icky flavor. However, I became hooked at first bite. This flavor is much sweeter than the Honey Roasted. It certainly becomes my top "dessert almonds" when in need of that sweet replacement.          Absolutely great for those on a low carb or Keto diet   only 6 Net Carbs per serving. The bold, sweet flavor keeps you satisfied after only a small amount.          Highly recommended!
