By now I've eaten half the bag so I know what's in here. Sure, their beef jerky is pretty tender. But for some reason they decided to throw in an insane amount of salt. I've had store bought beef jerky and I've had quality Amazon beef jerky and this is definitely the saltiest by at least double. The first time I ate this, I could only handle 2 strips before I had to put it down again. My friend made a disgusted face and refused to have another bite. Luckily I am a salt lover so I can at least tolerate the extreme saltiness. But it's still too salty.          Next up is the gristle. Sometimes amidst the generally tender bites there will be a mat of unchewable mass that I pretty much have to spit out or swallow whole. It happens more often than other  ands and definitely more than I care for. Secondly, I don't know if it's the salt playing tricks on me, but the texture and taste is a bit worse than other  ands, like they use lower quality jerky.          Overall I believe that Wild Ride is less quality than most other  ands, even when you factor in the low price. There are similarly priced  ands that are of higher quality and lower sodium content. I don't know why they sell so well. Personally my next bulk order beef jerky will be with someone else.
