Don't be put off by the cartoon label: this is SERIOUS, EXCELLENT pizza sauce, the best I've ever tasted out of a can. My family has been eating it for years. Basically, there's no need for us to make homemade sauce anymore. But don't just believe me    google "Don Pepino pizza sauce" and read other people's rave reviews.          We can't find it in our local grocery stores so we usually buy a case or two at a time. The pop top cans are also a perfect size for a large pie or two.          The company's other tomato products, sold under the name "Sclafani", are also highly recommended.
