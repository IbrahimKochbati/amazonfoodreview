If you looking for a healthier ( in my opinion anyway : )  alternative to the white rice wraps, you've found it here in these wraps !  I've been making raw wraps like they're going out of style since I got them, and enjoy them for lunches AND dinners several times a week !  You can stuff just about anything that floats your boat inside !  I just placed my second order, and now I can't imagine how I ever got along with out them.  If you're a Veg head..or not..and just want something easy,  AND fun to make, where you can use your creativity to make wraps a hundred different ways..well, maybe not 100, that are yummy, low cal, and nutritious..look no further !!!  Give these a try, you won't be disappointed : ))
