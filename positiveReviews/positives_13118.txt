I could not wait to get my tea in the mail!  My favorite type of tea is Oolong for it's fruity, sweet flavor.  And then add peach to this?!  AWESOME!  What a great blend!  I think the peach may be a little too over powering of the Oolong, but I still love this tea.  Not to mention, it's fresh.  You can always tell if tea is too old.  This tea was really really fresh.          Loose leaf tea is usually pricey, and Oolong is even pricer.  I usually can only afford 2 or 4 oz at a time.  But this tea is a HUGE bargain!  I feel like I got a huge deal.  I opened the sealed bag (also comes with a resealable ziplock just inside) and was so surprised by how much tea is in here.  This is going to last me a long time   yay!  It says it's 8 ounces, but looking at it, it seems like it's more like 12 ounces.  Maybe it's my imagination?          This is my first time buying Boston Tea, but I don't think it will be my last.  I'm excited to try more teas by them.
