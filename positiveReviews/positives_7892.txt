Utz Honey Wheat Braided Pretzel Twists are a great snack to keep on hand for a little guilt free munching. They have a wonderful, mild sweet and salty crunch. With 0g trans fat, no saturated fat and no cholesterol, you'll want to keep them on hand.          I absolutely love the packaging. It's very convenient to put out when you have company over, keeps leftovers fresh (Leftovers? What leftovers?), and when you're all done, it's great for storing sewing supplies, little toys, or even a jar to save change for a rainy day!
