This tea was recommended to me by an Irish tenor    no joke at an Irish festival in Pittsburgh,PA about 10 years ago! If you want a rich full flavor, lovely golden amber color, and great hot or iced tea then this is your tea also. If you want flavor   add your own orange, mint, etc   but so good just like it is, I rarely do that. Try it and see   worth every penny you spend on this tea as it makes twice as much as most other black tea blends.
