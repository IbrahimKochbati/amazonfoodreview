I've only owned my Keurig for about 5 days, but my husband and I have gone through about 30 k cups. I am a "multiple times a day" coffee drinker. I like my coffee STRONG, smooth, and loaded with diabetes inducing sugar and cream, lol. And I am absolutely AMAZED by Caribou   Caribou Blend. It's sooo smooth, perfect strength, absolutely and utterly delicious! I use HALF the sugar and cream  that I normally do. It's really THAT GOOD. Haha, on a personal note, my hubby has been drinking this at work for a month. He made the cup for me, and waited anxiously to see what I thought... You know...the first thing out of my mouth was..."If GOD drank coffee, he would drink THIS coffee" hahaha...no joke. Deeelish!
