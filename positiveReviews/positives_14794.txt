   class "tiny"  Length:: 0:39 Mins              Earl Grey is one of my favorite teas. Rishi Earl Grey Tea is good, aromatic and flavorful. The tea is not that strong for an Earl Grey, definitely not bold, but it is strong enough (just add another tablespoon to make it stronger). I steeped this tea for a long time (forgot about it) and it never became that bitter (I never add anything to my tea). It never felt strong or bold for that matter. The taste is long lasting though. Borrowing from the wine world, it has a long finish. The tea has a faint yellow ring in the cup and a  ownish orangy color.          The tea is very aromatic and the container contains an extra lid to keep the aroma and freshness of the tea.          It is a bit overpriced but, at least you can reuse the leaves a few times. This is also a fair trade organic product.          Hope you enjoy the video. Please let me know if you want any more info.
