This is one of the most delicious teas I have ever tasted! It's so smooth, rich and flavorful. A perfect dessert tea. The best way to enjoy it, in my opinion, is plain black. That way, nothing interferes with the flavors and you can taste each one distinctly   the black tea, caramel and vanilla (despite the name, the caramel is stronger than the vanilla)   as well as experience how they interact and balance each other. It truly is a harmonious blend.          For an extra sweet, creamy treat, I sometimes like to add Half & Half and one sugar cube (about 35 calories total). It tastes amazing that way too, though the sweeteners do mute the caramel and vanilla a bit.          Whatever you do, please do NOT add honey to this tea. I did that twice and ended up with a bitter cup. (Honey  ings out a sharp burnt flavor in the caramel.)
