There really aren't any vegetarian jerkies that replace meat jerky.  Some vegetarian jerkies are so horrid, it is surprising they made it to market.          Even in their tiny packages, a lot of vegetarian jerkies are so bad I can't finish them.          But there are a lot of varieties of this  and that we like:  teriyaki, hickory, and thai peanut are our favorites.  This is seitan, which is a chewy gluten product.  It is stringy in texture, moist, and is a good match for the flavors.  There are some flavors I don't particularly like, such as the lime flavor, but even the ones I don't like seem like someone else would. (As in, I don't like barbecue potato chips, but I can see where someone else would.)
