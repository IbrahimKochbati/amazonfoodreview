Normally I buy the Fruztio Freeze Dried Apricots made by Crispy Green Co. and they are DELICIOUS  but the store I was getting them from was out of stock for a very long time. So, I decided to try the cantaloupe since I like fresh cantaloupe...how bad could they be?     My only choice was a large multi pack bag, so I forked up the money with high hopes.  I tore into the bag, appreciating the single serve sized bags inside. I opened one up and took a bite. Blech! yuck! These tasted like green, under ripe canteloupe! I was hoping for that super sweet I could eat this whole melon  sort of flavor....but no.     These were so bad that I threw the whole multi pack away, and that's saying A LOT, because I'm very frugal with my food purchases. I just knew I would NEVER eat the rest of them. Wish I could give a better review, but i can't.     But I do recommend the apricots that I mentioned....they are super flavorful and delicious if you love that tart apricot flavor!
