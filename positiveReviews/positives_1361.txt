I got these for $10 for the 24 pack, so a pretty good deal. They are about as healthy as the baked chips I usually buy.  They all taste great and Im officially a fan.          It's pretty much what it sounds like chips that are popped instead of baked.  So they do have some "air" in them.  .8 ounce bags is slightly more than the .75 ounches in baked lays bags I was buying.          Good buy if you can get a good deal like I did
