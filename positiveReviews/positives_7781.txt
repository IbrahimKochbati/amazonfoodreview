These are great snacks.  Being able to cook them fresh really makes them taste better than the average pre cooked store bought ones.  Great alternative to popcorn.  I ordered both the Hot & Spicy and the Original.  I prefer the Hot & Spicy, but I like spicy foods.  You can't go wrong with either one.
