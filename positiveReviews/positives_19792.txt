As soon as I removed the seal from this jar, I knew I'd be happy with it.  This is the perfect product to buy if you're not able to get traditional Turkish coffee ground with cardamom, but have to settle with a generic roast.  It's sweet, yet spicy (think ginger ead), and reminds me of my travels in the Middle East. The only problem was that it arrived with a  oken lid.
