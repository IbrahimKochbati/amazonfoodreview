I have begun purchasing all of my cereal in bulk from Amazon and have had great success so far. This 6 pack arrived padded and shrink wrapped, in great shape. I think the cereal itself is more delicate in nature to some other types of cereal and I suspect it may be ever so slightly more subject to settling that heartier cereals. The package I received all had an extremely good date.          As far as the taste, Cinnamon Life is fantastic and mild   not too heavy on the cinnamon. It has slightly more sugar than regular Life and I think I can taste that extra bit. One of my top picks.
