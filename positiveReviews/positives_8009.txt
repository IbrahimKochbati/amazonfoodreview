I bought Say Cheez on a whim   I am vegan and usually only use Road's End products to fulfil my Kraft kravings ... cravings.  It's definitely not like Kraft nor Road's End, but there's something distinctly cheese like about it and I found it to be delicious!  I added both peas and  occoli and was pleasantly suprised to find that the cheese sauce was plentiful enough for all of the pasta, peas, and  oc.  I also must say, as my first time trying to cook gluten free pasta on my own, this was painless and didn't crumble apart (like it could have).  I gave it 4 stars, not quite perfect, but definitely a great treat (every once in awhile, for those of us on a budget).
