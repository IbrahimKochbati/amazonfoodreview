I have actually stopped buying these because they are so hard to insert.  I had to use a screwdriver to get it into the toy!  Even my husband had problems getting it into the toy.  We have 2 of these toys a large one and a smaller one and the smaller one has already been chewed on by one of our dogs.  Our big dog lost interest after the first couple of times and I just gave up on them.  They do keep the dogs busy, but 20 minutes to insert one treat seems a little too time consuming.
