These were such a hit at my latest cocktail party. Everyone thought it was really edgy that they were shaped like dog bones. They all asked where I got them and I said, you know, man, PAUL NEWMAN MADE THESE, and the money goes to his charities, which is pretty righteous.          A little dry, but we loaded them up with pepperoni and cheese slices, and they go great with well drinks!          Aaaaa just kidding. The dog loved them. And the kids. Just kidding.
