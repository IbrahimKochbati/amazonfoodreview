I'm not huge on sugar free items sweetened with anything but Stevia, but I have to admit these syrups are really great tasting.. At the subscribe price, I got each of these really large bottles for about the same price I paid for a very small bottle at wally world, and they only carry a few sugar free flavors..          We're on Atkins, so we've really cut down on carbs, but we both like sweets, so these syrups let us still have sweets without the carbs..          The Hazlenut is not my favorite flavor, but I've used it in MiM's (muffin in a minute) and it tasted a lot better than I expected.. I know a lot of people use this flavor in coffee, but I don't personally like it in coffee. If you do, it'd be great for that.          The Classic Caramel is delicious.. I've used it in MiM's, Italian sodas, protein shakes and in coffee.. I've also mixed it with the chocolate sugar free syrup and the two together make another delicious taste treat.. The two combined make the best Italian soda ever! I've made chocolate MiM's with cream cheese frosting flavored with this flavor.. Love the taste.          I read some other feedback concerning the Classic Caramel, stating it isn't very good and to be sure to purchase the tradition Caramel.. I've never tasted the traditional, but have to say, I think the Classic is delicious.. Taste's like a piece of caramel candy to me.          The Chocolate is delicious. Works good in MiM's, italian soda's, coffee, cream cheese frostings, protein shakes, anything you want to add chocolate to without the carbs..          The Raspberry tastes exactly like raspberry's.. It's great.. We use it on home made yogurt with raspberry's on top.. pour a little syrup over it, and it's a delicious, low carb treat..Also great in a low carb protein shake mixed with raspberry's and a little syrup, mix in a blender and it's like a shake.. Delicious! I also used it in MiM's, or as cream cheese frosting on a chocolate MiM...YUMMY...Mixed it with chocolate in an italian soda.. Delicious..          The Irish Cream is delicious used in a MiM in both the muffin and mixed in softened cream cheese to frost it.. Also fantastic in Italian soda's.. Haven't tried it in a protein shake yet, but imagine it'll be great. Probably great in yogurt, too.. Very tasty!          I'm not a huge vanilla fan, but have to say, the vanilla is really good! Can be used in all kinds of things calling for vanilla, but really good when mixed with the chocolate in an italian soda or mixed in softened cream cheese to frost a chocolate MiM...          All in all, great variety of syrups.. The one I would change is the Hazlenut.. I've just never been a big Hazlenut fan, but I'm sure I'll find more uses for it eventually.
