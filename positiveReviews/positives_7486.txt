I love it. Tastes great and it is very convenient to use. My husband drinks that in the car instead of soda or juice &lt;just pour the powder to 32oz water bottle and shake well   directions on the box say to use 500ml(16.9oz) but the tea is really strong so we use 1L bottle)  my kids love it I love it. In Whole Food 1 box costs $20 + tax. Here you can get 2 boxes for the price if you use all promotions (currently 35% off) still quite expensive but well worth it!
