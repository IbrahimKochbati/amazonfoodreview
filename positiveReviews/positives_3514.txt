This is the best decaf my family and I have tried in a long time. It's smooth, not bitter and has enough flavor without being too strong like some other  ands I've tried. I like that it's decaffeinated using the natural swiss water process instead of chemicals. That's a big plus for me because many  ands don't tell you how they decaffeinate their coffee. I usually buy whole bean, but this ground is so nice and fine, and it saves me time having to grind it and get it just right. I'd suggest following the instructions given on the bag for the best taste, seal tightly and store in the refrigerator to keep the flavor. This is one I'll be buying again.
