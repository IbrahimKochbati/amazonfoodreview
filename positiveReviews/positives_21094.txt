I purchased this after doing research on burns. I was trying to heal a second degree and third degree burn   the antibiotic ointment wasn't working after almost two weeks. As a last resort, before possibly needing a skin graft, I purchased this item specifically because it is UMF certified by the UMF Association   THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT if you're going to try Munuka Honey for its healing properties. The item you buy must be on the list of certified companies which can be found on the UMF Association site. I paid for it to be overnighted so as not to loose one more day of possible healing   it came right on time and after only four full days the skin looks amazing! It's not only soft and smooth but the wound has filled in, no more deep crevasses, blistering or peeling. Will continue to use until the skin is completely healed   so glad it came in a two pack! This not only saved my skin, healed the burn but seems to be creating a field where almost no scarring, dare I say no scarring, will be visible! YAHOO!
