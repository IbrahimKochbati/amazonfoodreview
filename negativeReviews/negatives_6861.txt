We bought this for our Paramount 6 oz popper. We were disappointed by the taste. We've been using LouAna Coconut oil (~[..] from Walmart for 31.5 fl.oz.), Act II popcorn salt and O.R. kernels. After the first mouthfuls of Great Northern Popcorn, people were pushing their bowls aside   it tasted like salted cardboard. Never again   so disappointed.
