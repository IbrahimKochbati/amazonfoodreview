This is now my new favorite K cup flavor!  Anytime I see chocolate raspberry truffle flavored coffee beans I buy some since it is sometimes hard to find.  I was sooo excited to see a k cup with this flavor.  It did not disappoint!  You can definitely smell it when it  ews too.  I do add sweetener, which may not be everyone's taste, but to me it makes the coffee taste like I'm eating a real raspberry flavored chocolate truffle.  It is now my favorite afternoon treat pick me up.
