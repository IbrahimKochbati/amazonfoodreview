Monsters drinks are awesome but i can get it cheaper here in NYC Flushing for 1.99 each at the Chinese super market. (that's with tax included) i can get it faster and dont have to pay the shipping charges. It's an awesome product but the price are steep. only good if you're buying for someone else far away
