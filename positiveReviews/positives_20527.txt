These Marinade have been wonderful. We use this to disguise our dog's medicine.  She won't take the medicine any other way   not even in Pill Pockets. The only draw back, we can't find them anymore except online. We first purchased them at Sam's Club but they no longer carry them and neither does Pet Smart or Pet Co. Thank goodness for Amazon!
