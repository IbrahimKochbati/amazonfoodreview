I'm a good candidate for this coffee. Starbucks and Seattle's Best give me a stomach ache. This coffee smells really good, rich and robust. I think it was ground too fine, as in pulverized. I was disappointed in the taste. It has a strong, bitter aftertaste which I tried to mask with 2% milk. Sugar helped but I don't usually drink coffee with sugar. After one cup I had a stomach ache. This coffee is nothing special and doesn't live up to the low acid claim. I don't recommend it.
