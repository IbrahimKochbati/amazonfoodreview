I have tried so many kinds of popcorn, beginning with those for the microwave.  Then I went to an  electric popcorn maker and tried various popcorns.  When I got the Whirley, the Wabash Valley Farms was the first popcorn I tried for it.  I was immediately amazed. This pops larger than any one I've ever tried.  Much larger.  And the flavor cannot be beat.  It is truly an exceptional popcorn and I will never again use a different one.  I highly recommend it.
