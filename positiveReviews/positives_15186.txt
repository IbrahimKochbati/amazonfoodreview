This has been my baby's (now 21 months) favorite since he was 10 months old. He seemed to be bored of it after a couple of months. My husband then was going to claim the rest of pouches as his snacks and started to have it with an Avocado, my son reached for it. So now, we mashed, somewhat, an avocado in the Ratatouille and he would inhale it down in no time! It's also a go to meal when we are having spicy grown up food and I'm too lazy to cook him up something else. It also helps him "go" regularly.
