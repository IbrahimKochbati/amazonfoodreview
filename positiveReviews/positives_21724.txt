My husband and I drink about 3 pots of coffee per day and we both have a liking for French Vanilla Creamer.  I used to buy it in the powdered, but then the liquid came out and we used that.  Then now they have this concentrated creamer which is the best yet, we beleive it tastes better than the liquid and the powdered.  Also, it gives you more for your dollar.  The only downside is the pump.  Really cool idea if you could only remove it after putting it on.  I could understand at a business where you wouldn't want people tampering with it, but the pump leaves a  lot of creamer left in the bottom yet.  We leave it off and just pour it into the coffee, and when there is only a little left, we pour some coffee in it and get the rest out.  Also another plus, the container is recyclable in a lot of areas.  Go CoffeeMate!
