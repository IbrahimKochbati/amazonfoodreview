Finally, someone has created baked chips that have a crunchy texture and good flavor.          If you really attend to your health you want to avoid foods fried in oil, top 3 being french fries, donuts and potato chips. Your body has a tough time  eaking down the oil once it's fried.          So the Popchips are an excellent option for potato chip lovers. (though I prefer the Chili Lime flavor over the Sweet Potato).
