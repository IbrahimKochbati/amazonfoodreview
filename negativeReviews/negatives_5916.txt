I have a Fox JRT who knows what terrier mix who really enjoys puzzle toys, provided there is food in there to motivate him. I purchased both Kyjen's Triad and their Jigsaw Glider. My pooch went right for both, and my only (minor) complaint is that they're TOO easy.          Forrest has mastered other treat toys, including the Aikou (done in under two minutes), and Nina Ottosson's Dog Magic and Tornado. With the Triad, he had the "spin" and "flip" mechanisms figured out in a few minutes. Keeping the flip doors open long enough to detract the treat, however, seemed to require some skill and practice. Not generally a "cheater", he finally resorted to flipping the whole unit upside down, to discover that doesn't work very well either, unless he kept rolling it over and over repeatedly. He did (during the initial test drive) get the hang of flipping the flap and keeping it up long enough to get his hard fought reward. I may make mention that he has a long, narrow snout, and the patience of a saint once his tongue makes physical contact with food stuffs. A friend of mine has a young Border Collie Karelian Bear Dog cross who is still figuring out all the parts to the Magic, so these Kyjen toys would be appropriate for him, as well as any dog just becoming familiar to puzzle toys, and learning how they work. It's also worth a mention that if you're not willing to sacrifice peace and quiet for your dog's amusement, do not purchase. Nor if you have squeaky wheel neighbors living below your hard wood floors... unless they're out of town.          My terrier has a short attention  , in that if it's TOO hard, he loses interest after a while. Not one for extreme challenges. Nina Ottosson's Twister is still a "project in the works", and not one I would recommend for first timers and beginners. Kyjen's Triad and Glider are not in this category. For the money, I'm happy to add them to his collection. I just fill 'em all up at once, and let the racket commence!
