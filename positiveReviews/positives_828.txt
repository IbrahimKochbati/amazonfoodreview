Yes, these cubes are expensive; in fact, I almost gave them four stars for the expense.  Regardless, these sugar cubes are my favorite sugar product.  I've tried every  own sugar and cane sugar product you can find on Amazon and in your grocery store, and none of them compare to the rich, sweet, unique flavor of the  own sugar cubes by La Perruche.  Because I've tried so many  own sugar products, I believe the difference is the terroir, or the ground land, where this sugar is grown.  La Perruche sugar cubes are made from African grown sugar; more specifically, sugar grown in Swaziland and or the Congo.  Also, the cubes are denser than many sugar cubes.  I don't know from a scientific perspective how this is accomplished, but the cubes are not regularly sized, but are large and irregularly shaped, and heavier sturdier than "cut" cubes by other producers.          The flavor is a rich, distinct and more molasses y flavor than other  own sugar cubes, and is somewhat darker as well.  I wish I could describe the flavor better, but it has been several months since I was able to find a somewhat affordable supply.  BTW, now that this product is being sold with free shipping via Amazon Prime, I just purchased several boxes   it is a much better deal as of the date of this review than it was a few months ago.
