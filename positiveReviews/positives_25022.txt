First   The description is WRONG for ingredients. Stubbs does not use high fructose corn syrup in their products. They use all natural ingredients. All Stubb's products are Gluten Free. They are all amazing. We just put a pork roast in the crockpot and pour the pork marinade over it and let it cook all night. It's amazing. The prices on here are high. Walmart sells all Stubb's products for $2.50 each but if you can't find what you want I guess you have to pay these high prices. Still they are worth every penny. We also use the beef marinade all the time with beef short ribs in the crockpot and the herbal mustard rub. I use that on my tofu scramble with lots of curry powder. The mustard rub goes great with curry. The bbq sauces are great too!
