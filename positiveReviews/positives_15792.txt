These are the best sugar free coffee syrups on the planet. If you want a great intro pack, this mix works. They also work for Italian sodas.  My favorites are chocolate (not like a Hershey's at all, they stir in to the coffee), hazlenut (has a good, nutty flavor, can turn any trash cup of Maxwell House from an uncleaned urn into a gormet experience, and raspberry (also good on ice cream, of course).  Get the others, and your coffee station will look like a Barista's dream.
