I moved to Las Vegas from San Jose last year and have been missing my Peet's Coffee Jasmine Downey Pearls tea.  When I saw this product I bought a shipment right away. I was not disappointed.  I love the individual silken sachets of Jasmine Tea pearls.  It is fragrant and wonderful tea. I will be buying it again.
