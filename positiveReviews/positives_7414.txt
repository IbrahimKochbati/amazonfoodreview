I absolutely love this stuff!  My Dad used to give us each a can (or two) for Christmas every year, and it was always a favorite.  I've never been able to find it where I live now, I should of known to check Amazon! By the way, I've never tasted a variety I didn't like, but I've never tried the reduced fat kind, either.  I also like to make it with coffee instead of water when I need a little boost, it almost makes coffee taste good (sorry, but there's nothing out there that can do that).
