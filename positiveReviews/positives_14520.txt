I have been using La Tourangelle Avocado Oil in 'everything' since receiving my order couple weeks or so back. I like not strong olive oil (usually like the buttery kind from late ripe olives). I tasted some of this avocado oil alone and it is a bit stronger than "buttery" olive oil as it does have a bit of a 'bite'. I still do like it, though. I've used it for sauteing, on toast with onion or garlic powder, salads, rubbed some in my skin and a tiny bit on my chapped lips. I may get it again as I like to have a variety in my diet plus the avocado oil is good for moisturizing my skin. My fave oil is golden flax oil by Community Living Foods, except it should not be used for frying or heating.
