First, I agree with J. Bishop's (Houston, TX) review.          This is not only the best flavor of the Healthy Choice soup line, it is clearly among the best canned soup flavors of all time.          Healthy Choice is the only  and of canned soup I buy on any regular basis.  It's the only  and that has never used MSG  a sure sign that a recipe lacks imagination (not too mention sodium issues).          I really wish I could buy quantities of this in the microwave packaging (hard to find in stores)... a lifetime supply would do nicely.
