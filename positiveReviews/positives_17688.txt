I was interested in trying this coffee.  Although I don't have a problem with the acidity in most coffees, when we make a pot of coffee, we often tend to let it sit for several hours while we drink it over time, so we need a coffee whose flavor is able to be consistent for the duration.          I was a bit wary of trying a French Roast  my husband and I tend to prefer our coffee on the mild side, and thus we usually drink Breakfast Blend varieties.  Upon opening the package, however, this coffee did not smell overly strong, nor was the flavor overwhelming.  In fact, perhaps due to the low acid, I found it to be a relatively mild tasting coffee with just a hint of "roastiness" to it.  The flavor did remain fairly consistent over time.  I would not re purchase this coffee myself, as there are definitely other  ands that I prefer, but if you find the acid in coffee to be problematic, this may be worth a try.
