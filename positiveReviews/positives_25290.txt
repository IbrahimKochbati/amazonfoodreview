For a quick and truly different experience, cut up red potatoes into bite sized pieces; season lightly with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powders (all optional); microwave till tender; serve with a generous topping of Food & Wine Magazine Lemon Mustard Dill Sauce. This is a tasty, piquant sauce marinade exactly like the Lemon Dill Sauce Trader Joe's formerly sold under their own label. It's also excellent with  occoli, carrots, Dover sole, and schrod.  Yummy!
