I've tried every chai tea on the market and this is by far the best.     If you want the ultimate taste, add the vanilla chai with it, a little sweetener,and cream or     non dairy creamer.  Tastes better than a $3.00 chai from an espresso stand.     I have an automatic order sent every other month from Amazon and save $$$$$$     Donna
