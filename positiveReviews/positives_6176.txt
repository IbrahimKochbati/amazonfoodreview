I have 2 cats.  One will eat anything.  The other one is soooo picky.  She's had to have some of her teeth removed due to a mouth virus, so I needed to find some good soft treats.  She likes these more than anything I've tried.  They are really thing little tiny strips.  I like Wellness, all natural products.  Both cats like their  and cat food as well.
