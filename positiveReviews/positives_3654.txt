Yayy!!! Not feeling well today and dreading having to go to grocery store. But the one thing I cannot do without is dog food. (love my dogs). Low and behold, the door bell rang and it was like Santa heard me. I can't believe how quickly my order came. I was so happy I posted on facebook, and text to my mother. Thank you AMAZON : ) Thank you PRIME!!!
