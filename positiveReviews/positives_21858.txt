I tried this water in Utah were my family lives and it stuck!  I really would rather buy my water at the grocery store here like a normal person, but its worth it!! I've tried many other (easier to purchase) waters, but this one is truly different, I don't know why...but I feel better when I drink it.  I'm happy they at least have it now on Amazon!!  thanks!!
