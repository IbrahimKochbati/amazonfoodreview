When I coulnd't find Island Coconut K cups anywhere, I found this and decided to try it.  Although it is not exact, it is so close it puts a smile on face.  The coconut is not over powering, but you can taste the HINT of it certainly.  I love this and would order again and again...because THIS is available and Island coconut is not!!
