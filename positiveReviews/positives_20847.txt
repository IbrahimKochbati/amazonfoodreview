This is the best price I can find for a food which is a staple in our house....Our typical American diet is sorely deficient in many minerals   seaweed is one of the best sources, and arame is the most mild tasting of all the sea vegetables.  Incorporate this food generously into your diet, and watch the changes happen in your skin, hair, nails, and digestion!  Great company...     Linda Vinecour     CHC, AADP
