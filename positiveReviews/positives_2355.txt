My kids love  ownies, but I could no longer by the regular  ands in the grocery store with a good conscious.  I still wanted the convenience of a mix, though.  These fit the bill.  They first time I made them, they thought they tasted "funny" because they were so used to the processed crap.  Now they eat them up and have gotten used to the flax taste.  I think they are YUMMY!     These are in no way low calorie or low fat though.  Instructions call for a lot of oil, eggs, and butter (you can use Earth Balance and egg replacer if you're vegan).  Flax seeds also have a good amount of fat (although the healthy kind). I've made them with olive oil before and they were just as good.  I've also added extra organic cocoa powder to make them extra chocolatey, but they really don't need it.  I love the chewy texture of the flax seeds.  There are very few ingredients, I could probably make the same  ownies homemade, but it would be a pain to have to grind the flax seeds, etc.  These are easy and yummy.  Even though they are not necessarily "healthy" from a calorie and fat standpoint, I can feel good about giving my kids treats that aren't loaded with processed crap.
