I love a good cup of flavored coffee, but hesitate trying new flavors.  It's not because I don't want to do so, but because if I don't like a coffee I am too frugal to dispose of it.  However, since I love Magnum Coffee Roaster's Chocolate Fudge Brownie Coffee, I decided to give their Vanilla Nut Pumpkin Pie Coffee a try.  I was pleasantly surprised by how well I liked this flavored coffee.  The coffee is a nice medium roast.  It is smooth and leaves no acidic aftertaste.          I could not distinguish any vanilla flavor or any nut like flavor in the coffee.  Nor could I isolate any pumpkin pie taste; rather, the primary flavor was of cinnamon.  Since pumpkin pie has more complex spicing than simply a cinnamon flavor, I was puzzled by the choice of name for this otherwise very good product.          This is a very good choice for anyone who likes spiced beverages, and who wants a good cup of flavored coffee.  I think that you might enjoy this on a cold, winter day while sitting in front of a nice fire and reading a good book   perhaps on your Kindle!
