I agree with the others that say this is one of the best hemp shakes out there. I started off with the original Nutiva hemp powder and once I finished that I decided to try the chocolate. It is amazing! It is much easier for me to gulp this down in the morning. I mix it up in a Blender Bottle (also sold on Amazon) with a little water and some type of milk. I really like mixing it with vanilla hemp milk or whole grain rice milk but regular milk works fine, too!          Nutiva is the LEAST grainy hemp shake I have come across yet. I have tried several kinds and even though I can drink them I much prefer Nutiva over any other.
