I ordered this bouquet to be delivered on my daughter's birthday, August 17.  Instead it was delivered August 1   16 days early.  The package said "Keep Cool" and it was hot and the candy was melted.  There also were not any cookies as stated in the product description.  This was EXTREMELY disappointing.
