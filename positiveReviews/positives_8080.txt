I'm used to overly sweet granola bars, so when I first had these it seemed like they needed some sugar. But by the time I got through the first box, I adjusted to the lower sugar content and found myself thoroughly addicted. They have a lovely chewy texture with plenty of huge chunks of almond for added crunch. These are GOOD! I would love to buy them in bulk and have them shipped automatically, but I wouldn't pay more than the three dollars or so a box (of six) that Wal Mart or Target charges. So a box of 24 should really be about $12. Even at grocery store prices, we would be talking about $16...we'll see how they're priced when they come in!
