This salt is so good, you could almost eat it plain. I am telling you, sprinkling this with your fingers onto salads, chicken, fish, is amazing. Definitely don't waste this by cooking it, where you could use regular salt. This salt needs to be tasted as it really  ings out the flavour of food in a really beautiful way. This is meant to be sprinkled on foods after they have cooked    roasted chicken for example, or on raw vegetables like tomatoes or cucumbers. This is the Foodie's Salt!          Now, I have noticed this salt is easier to buy in the regular grocery stores, so if you can, buy it there where it is cheaper to do so.
