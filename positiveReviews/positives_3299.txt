It was recently suggested to me I try going gluten free to battle an autoimmune thyroid disorder.  I bought the Gluten Free Bisquick hoping the pancakes would at least be edible.  The Bisquick has far exceeded my expectations!  The pancakes are light, fluffy, and delicious!  I definitely recommend this product!
