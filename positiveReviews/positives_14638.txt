Every spring we get little black ants in the home.  It's like a mini invasion in a couple of locations around the house.  Our first invasion this year came to my bathroom, and it wasn't a huge problem.  I'd squish 30 50 ants per day, and really, my main complaint is that I don't like little insects crawling on my stuff.  They're small, but they aren't clean, and there are lots of 'em!          This product stopped the current invasion completely within three days.  When Hot Shot arrived on Wednesday, I placed a two inch bead of gel along the crack they seemed to be using, wiped up a little residue, and found that the following day I only squished three ants, the next day squished one or two, and today I haven't seen any.          The product may not work as well for all types of ant and insect problems, but for my situation, it's been perfect.  I hope the active ingredients are stable, because for my use, the amount of bait provided will last a lifetime.
