I used to buy Life Savers Cinnamon Mints, but they stopped making them years ago.  Once in a while I have been able to find a couple of other  ands in the cinnamon flavor, but they were not nearly as good, so I decided to do an Amazon search and found Newman's Own Cinnamon Mints.  These are excellent, and I sure do hope that they keep on making them.
