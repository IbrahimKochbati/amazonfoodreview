First of all, when I purchased this product it was listed as two 3 packs for the price.  I only received one 3 pack.  Amazon kindly refunded half of my money, but note that I would not have purchased the product at the current offer of one 3 pack for the same price.          Black sugar is reputed to be eaten in Japan as a candy.  This black sugar tastes very nice that way, a bit like the penuche that I made as a child that didn't get cooked long enough and was partially crystallized when it cooled.  Add molasses taste to that, and I think that is pretty close.          This black sugar is not uniformally dark throughout.  When you  eak the  ick, in cross section it is only dark for about one quarter of the way in from the surface top and bottom, and the same absolute distance on the sides.  The inner one half is the color of light  own sugar.  I don't know what to make of that.  I don't know if it is normal for black sugar to be light  own inside.  Presumably the darkness is from the molasses, but I don't know why the molasses would look like it had soaked in from the outside instead of being uniformally distributed in the sugar  ick.  The dark  own raw sugar from Africa, that I also bought, is uniformally dark but not as dark as the outside of this black sugar  ick.  I imagine that if I pulverized the inner and outer sections of this Okinawa black sugar together I might get the same color as the dark  own sugar from Africa.  I haven't tried the experiment because the black sugar  ick is not easily pulverized, although it is not too hard to bite.          In summary, the taste is quite nice but I'm not at all sure that it is novel enough for the price I paid, let alone twice that much.  However, it is a taste of food from a place that I have never been and never will go, so I gave it four stars.
