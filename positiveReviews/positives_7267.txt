best coco water   plz  ing back.     i've been drinking it for the last 3 4 years and this ONE [only 1 liter pack] is really the best.     unfortunatley, the manf. seems to have discontinued it   what a shame!     the small size product is not at all good   only this one.     hope this company gets some common sense and continues this product which was so good.
