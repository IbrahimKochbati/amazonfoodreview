Almost all the teas in this line from Lipton are such careless mixtures of white+green, green+black, rooibos+green etc that there is no way to buy and know how much caffeine you're getting.  That's the first problem.  The name of each of these pyramid teas says you're getting 1 tea, when in fact you are getting at least 2, and then a mountain of other ingredients    most of which are not even hinted at by the name.          It's true, white tea is the first ingredient listed.  Then green tea.  Then apple pieces.  Then a litany of all the cheap add ins available to fill a tea bag.  The pom    is barely there at all, in the form of juice concentrated and then powdered into bits.  And blueberry is so far down the list that it's barely there at all.          Of 15 listed ingredients, all the fruit (except the apple) are listed AFTER cornstarch and "natural flavor".          What kind of tea is this that has blueberry and pom in the name    yet has more cornstarch and the mysterious "natural flavor" than the microscopic bits of fruit and juice?          CORNSTARCH?  In tea?  forget this stuff and find some Numi, or Republic of Tea, or Stash, or Celestial Seasonings tea that has the actual tea (white? green? black? rooibos? mint? chamomile?) in the name    and then only minimal anything else.  No fillers.  No thickeners.  No crap.  Almost any of the name companies in this price range give you more actual tea (and identifiable other ingredients) than this.          And it tastes bad. The "white tea" they are using tastes astringent and peppery.          Go for full leaf from a reputable tea merchant to be sure you're not getting a dainty little bag full of straw and leftovers    which this is.
