I usually drink Gevalia medium roast or Dunkin' Donuts  and coffee. I have a 4 cup coffee maker and I use about 2 tablespoons of coffee per 4 cup pot.          I used slightly less with this Puroast coffee because it's a French roast but even using slightly less, it was just too dark tasting for me. The second pot I made, I used even less   maybe a scant tablespoon and a half and it was still not for me. Even adding a good sized dollop of fat free half and half didn't make me want to finish the cup.          However, I have lots of relatives and friends who like their coffee VERY "full bodied" and I think they'd like this. I just ordered some logo imprinted, insulated travel coffee mugs for my husband's business and I'm strongly considering ordering some of this to include with the mugs at Christmas time when we give them out to those my hubs has done business with.          I see this  and comes in lighter roasts and I wouldn't mind having some of that on hand for friends relatives who come to visit who I know have acid reflux heartburn issues. For myself though, I think I'll stick to my favorites.
