The thickness is just as described. They are not thin as straws like some other reviews had stated. My 2 pet chihuahuas love them very much. It usually takes them an hour or so to finish chewing so it's a great time passer for them. One negative thing I'd complain is the strong smell of the bag, though. I have to tuck it away in a corner in order not to smell it often when pass by. This might not apply to everyone, since my nose is a bit more sensitive than most normal people. Over all, I'd had given 5 star if it wasn't for the smell, I have to give 4 stars for now.
