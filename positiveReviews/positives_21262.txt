I love love love tart cherry preserves, and these are among the best I've ever tasted. The ingredients are: sour cherries, pure cane sugar. As such, they have a texture and color that is much more like homemade than even "gourmet" store bought. The color is a deep deep red purple, almost black. The taste is very tart and delicious cherry, and is a nice contrast to almost anything that is savory or sweet.          My only regret is buying the pack of 6 10 oz. jars; the price of 3 18 ox. jars is a much better value. However, without preservatives, I'm not sure how long they'll stay fresh in the fridge, so maybe smaller jars are the way to go.
