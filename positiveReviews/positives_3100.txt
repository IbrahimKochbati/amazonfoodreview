I was looking for a low calorie cocktail and mixed a Rose wine with the Fresca Peach and it was delicious and I am not a regualar soda drinker and don't normally drink Rose wine. Make sure to get a Rose that is not sweet or you might as well drink Kool aid. Look for off dry or bone dry Rose's, maybe made with a Syrah, Cabernet, Merlot, Tempranillo, Sangiovese. Zinfandels tend to be too sweet for my taste, but you might like it. A sparkling rose would be great too. You can serve this with ice in a cocktail glass  or without ice in a martini glass.
