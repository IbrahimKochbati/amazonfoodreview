This French Roast coffee blend from Puroast is very deep and smooth. Definitely full flavored, and no tummy torture involved! I love my coffee, and I refuse to give it up even though I sometimes have stress related stomach problems. I would love to try a house blend or medium roast coffee from Puroast coffee. I visited their website, and they offer a wide variety of coffees, including some very delicious sounding flavored blends like "Nutcracker Sweet" and "Brazilian Sunset"! Don't give up on coffee until you try Puroast!
