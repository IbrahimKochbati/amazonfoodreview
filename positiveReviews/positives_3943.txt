Growing up with wheat, I had an aversion to gluten free (GF) products but when my daughter exhibited sensitivities to gluten we thought we'd give this a try.  Both my wife and I were amazed at the waffles.  I typically made waffles from scratch but using this mix also saves a lot of time   just add eggs, water, & oil.  The subscribe and save 25 pound bag is the best value (with free shipping), we will store unused product sealed in the freezer.
