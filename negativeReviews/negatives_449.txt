The best thing about this pancake and waffle mix is the can in which it comes.  I really like the convenience of the can and the fact that it reseals easily.     The batter cooked up nicely and the texture was OK.  However I was very disappointed in the flavor.  There were stong overtones of chemical flavors.     I will be experimenting with my own recipes in the future.
