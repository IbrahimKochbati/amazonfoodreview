This is the second Thanksgiving Christmas holiday season I have ordered these.  Came quick, good price, taste is excellent and very fresh. The metal box arrived in perfect shape.  One thing to look for is the shape of the cookies changed from last year or from one box size to the other; I don't know which.  Last year I ordered the next smaller box and the cookie shapes were fancier.  In this larger box two of the four "varieties" of cookie are just plain discs.  One of them has a touch more crispness and more sugar according to the literature but it is very subtle.  On the smaller box the illustrations on the side are of snowy scenes by the way.  I would order these again.
