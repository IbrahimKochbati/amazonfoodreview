Now the thought of a sweet potato chip might not initially appeal to everyone but I gave these a try and I am glad I did.  They are the right mix of sweet and salty so all those cravings get satisfied in one bite.  They are light and crispy.  If you have ever had a Muncho chip, they are similar in texture to those but not so salty like a Muncho.  You really don't get a strong sweet potato flavor and I at two small bags in one setting with ease.  They are low fat, low calorie (100 calories per bag which is a serving).  They contain natural ingredients like sunflower and safflower oil, sea salt, and organic yellow corn flour.  They are very very good.
