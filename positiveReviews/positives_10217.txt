I was so relieved when I found this product. Our doberman was having serious skin allergies and had to take antibiotics and steroids in pill form. He was so crafty with the pills   we would hide them in wet dog food, only to find the food eaten and the pills spit out. We hid them in salami, raw meat, pastrami, turkey, soft cheese, hard boiled egg, anything that you could think of that is appetizing to a dog and he would eat the food and spit out the pills. It got so bad that he actually stopped eating and drinking. He was so sick. Our vet put him on IV fluids and steroids and antibiotics and these wreaked havoc on his liver. We were so worried. He was going down the drain. Then I found this product. Simple as that, we put the medicine in the treat and he wolfed it down. He actually got to the point that when the 6 hour time was coming around to "get the treat" he would start whining and staring at the refrigerator where I had prepared the whole dosage plan ahead of time and put them into a plastic box with big lettering, "THIS IS ALEX'S MEDICINE   NOT CHOCOLATE!" We had a close call with my little sister   they looked appetizing to her as well! :) Now I use these for his vitamins and for anything that he has to take that is not appetizing. Really a life saver!
