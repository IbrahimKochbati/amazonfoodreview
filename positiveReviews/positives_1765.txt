I buy these through the ship and save program because they are a staple of my  eakfast and midday snack routine.     Light, flavorful, and full of vitamins, these only take 20 25 minutes to bake with minimal extras. I am vegan so I use egg substitutes  (3 tbsps flax seed in place of the eggs with 9 Tbs water) and they still bake perfectly.
