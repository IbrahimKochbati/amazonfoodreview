After becoming more and more a "coffee person", I've been trying various  ands and flavors in an attempt to figure out which one I prefer. I've tried other  ands such as Dunkin', Kirkland, and various other store  ands. I came across a great deal on a 3 pack of Community Coffee so I decided to try it. The packaging isn't the best once you open it, but I have separate air tight containers which I use (as I imagine most coffee drinkers would own).          I prefer dark bolder roasts, and I found that Community Coffee definitely fit the bill. My girlfriend didn't like it, claiming it was too strong, which further reinforced my belief that it was at the right level for me. I  ew the coffee the traditional way (coffee pot), but also via cold  ewing. I've found that the cold  ewed version of Community Coffee far surpasses the traditional, heat  ewing product. I'm not quite sure if this is the case for almost all coffees, but it seems even more pronounced with Community coffee.
