I love this tea!  I have tried at least 40  ands of Earl Grey including British Imports, boutique tea shops, special blends, and variations on the traditional bergamot black tea blend.     The flavor is so well balanced with a real bergamot taste.  This is not the typical weak flavor in many off the shelf blends.  This is the real deal and can only be compared with the best that this traditional blend has to offer.
