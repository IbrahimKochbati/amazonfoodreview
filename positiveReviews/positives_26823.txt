I am drinking two cups of this a day.  Tastes good.  It would be nice if it came without the string and stapple.  I like the automatic shipment then I do not run out unexpectedly.  My only point of note, would do not over  ew it.  I have forgotten about my cup waiting for me and the taste gets a little off when it has sat for an hour!  My bad really, not the teas problem.
