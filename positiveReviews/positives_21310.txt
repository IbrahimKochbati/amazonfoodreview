The puppy food falls clean, right out of the carton, into the feed dish and you wont need a fork or utensil to dig anything out.  Quick and easy with no mess.  You wont need your teeth or can openers to open the package.  Top pulls right off.  My dachshund puppy looks forward to it along with his Science Diet Puppy Dry free choice.
