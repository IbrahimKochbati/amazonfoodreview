...so you know I am serious. I would give it a 0, were it an option. I love Amazon   they have never let me down, so I am hoping they come through for me when I file a claim with them.          The product was rock hard, so I followed the enclosed instructions and heated it even less than the recommended time in the microwave. It kneaded easily enough and smelled  tasted good. When it came to rolling, I could tell immediately that this was going to be a challenge. Sure enough, it tore all over the place. Redo. I used cornstarch, the way I was taught, and it still stuck to every surface as if it were too warm or wet, yet cracked as if it were too dry. Nothing made it cooperate, so I lowered my standards and draped it anyway. Durring the two foot trip from the rolling surface to the cake, it ripped in several places and the application to the cake ended in absolute disaster. No, I did not roll it too thin. Yes, I used cornstarch (even though the packaging specifically claims it is unnecessary.) It sucks. The end.
