Love it...Very very nice...Great flavor......One of my favorites for sure, although I do have quite a few favs I really like....Which is cool...Something awesome and different every cup I make....          I see some reviews talk about the kcups either arriving damaged or bursting open when used leaving grinds everywhere....I have yet to have 1 single kcup come apart during use....no grinds to clean..no grinds in cup...makes a great cup every  ew...          Oddly, I have had a few issues with opening a new box in this 'type of packaging' with 50 kcups all loose in the box and finding 1 or 2 damaged with grinds in the box...no biggie at all...a 3 minute call to amzn and they ship you another box right away while letting you keep the original box (they should since it cant be re sold and it does take time cleaning the grinds off the rest of the kcups)....but oddly, i've not had a problem with tullys italian getting damaged in this type of packaging.....          anyway, a really great coffee....wonderful flavor, perfect balance....drinking a cup right now.....
