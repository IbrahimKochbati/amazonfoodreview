Diet Pepsi is the best soda available, anywhere!!!  When traveling outside the U.S. I always ask for it and if it's not available,I prefer to have plain carbonated water rather than the "other" cola.  My refrigerator always, and I mean always, has at least five or six bottles on the shelf and my pantry holds another 12 or so bottles.  I can only hope that it will always be manufactured.
