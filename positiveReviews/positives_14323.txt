This is not my favorite Peet's coffee blend, but it is my favorite of the offerings here at Amazon.  It is also my favorite of those blends offered at retail grocery stores.          What I like most about it is its versatility.  We used this blend to experiment with our new single serve coffee maker, the Jura Ena Micro 1.  This is basically an espresso maker, but it can make several strengths, and besides espresso shots, it makes ristretto and lungo cups also. We found the Major Dickason's Blend to taste rich and full flavored made as an intense shot and also as a milder 12 oz. regular cup of coffee. Can't get much better than that!  For a coffee to provide a great  ew at many different strengths is a real plus.          Be aware that this coffee is offered in both 12 and 16 ounce bags  and the bags look alike, so do your math before asssuming one bag is cheaper than another.  I'm so glad to see Peet's products offered here at Amazon.  Peet's products are always top notch and very fresh.  Their coffee and tea buyers really know what they are doing.
