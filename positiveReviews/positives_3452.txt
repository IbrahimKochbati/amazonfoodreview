As an ex Brit. steeped (pun intended!) in strong black tea, I wasn't sure about this, but Revolution White Pomegranate tea is absolutely delicious, light yet flavorful.  The low caffeine content makes it ideal for an evening pot of tea and of course,iced tea. I hesitated to recommend it in case you run out of it!
