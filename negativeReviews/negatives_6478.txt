This tea is rather cheap and you get what you pay for. It is a low quality white peony tea and you should  ew it for longer to get the typical strength and taste. I would say 4 5 minutes instead of the more typical 2 3 minutes. Even then there is some quirky chocolaty flavor.          Finish your newly purchased tea quickly or, better, put it into your own spare tin boxes because this type of packaging will not keep it fresh for long.          Next time I will probably pay more and buy some silver needle white tea (higher quality than white peony). Or I will buy my white peony in a  ick and mortar store, where I can taste it first. This tea is not bad, but is not very good either. I cannot really recommend it.
