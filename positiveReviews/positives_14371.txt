My dogs love the flavor of these.  I have tried both the chicken and peanut butter and they go nuts.  Though I will admit the peanut butter has a less intense smell than the chicken for human noses.  I can see the difference in the dogs' coats almost immediately!  I highly recommend any Zuke's products.
