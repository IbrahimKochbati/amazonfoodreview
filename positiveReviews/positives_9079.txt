I am giving this 5 stars, not because it fits the way it "should" but because I love it where I put it.  First, this does not fit under my Keurig properly, my lid to the Keurig will not open all the way if this sits UNDER the machine.  This is a quality piece it does not feel flimsy or a crappy build.  The drawer works smooth with no problems.  The K Cups fit perfectly!  The reason I love it is I had my husband drill a few holes and mounted it under my counter (in the corner where the cupboards meet).  (I uploaded two pictures under images for you to see what I mean).  This works GREAT as an under the counter holder.  I warn you, measure your cupboards first, some of my cupboards were not deep enough to install this as an "under counter" product.  However, the "corner" where my cupboards meet worked super.  I love that it's "off" my counter but it actuallly looks nice and keeps all the cups in a space that is easy to use and does not take up precious counter space in my small kitchen!
