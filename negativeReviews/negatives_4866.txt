From a taste perspective, your dog will probably love this product; however, I do not recommend that you buy it for your dog.  As with any dental treat, the purpose is for the dog to chew it and work the toothpaste that is in the treat around the teeth to get them nice and clean.  The problem with this treat is that dogs will literally eat them in three bites, which means that the treat is not working on the teeth.  Also, because the dog eats them in three bites, this product is much more likely to put your dog at risk of choking on them.  This product is very expensive and, from my opinion, I just don't recommend them.
