Wow, my cats just love these, especially the Chicken Pot Pie variety.  They also gobble up the Chinese Chicken (now renamed to Sesame Chicken), but the Chicken Pot Pie is their all time fave.  I enjoy feeding my cats food that they like as long as it's healthy, and Petite Cuisine is.  It's "real" food (no meat by products) and there aren't any added dyes or preservatives.
