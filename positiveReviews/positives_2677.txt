This is very good hot chocolate, creamy and tasty.  All of the flavors are good, my favorite is the peppermint.  I wish the peppermint was available on its own, not in the variety pack.  My son and I also like to add peppermint flavored marshmallows, for an extra shot of peppermint taste.  In my opinion, better than the Swiss Miss K cups.
