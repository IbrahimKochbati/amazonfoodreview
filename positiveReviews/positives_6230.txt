I bought this Baking Soda to clean my teeth 3 times a week.  They say that teeth become noticeably whiter.     But you've to to be very gentle while  ushing and use "soft" type tooth  ush.  I did notice a difference.          Also, I noticed that when Baking Soda was mixed with water, the PH indicator showed the highest level (almost 8.5 9 on the chart).     This may explain why Baking Soda is so effective to fight germs.          It's a good product.
