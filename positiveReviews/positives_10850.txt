Of course my fat dog loved these treats! It's always good to feed your pooch something that might be good for her, rather than something that might cause allergies or other issues. I'm hoping the "organic" part of these treats are good for sensitive dogs.          My dog absolutely scarfed these down. But then, my dog will also pick up a discarded pizza crust in a gutter (try and get THAT out of her mouth.)          Verdict: probably good, can't hurt the dog. Might hurt your wallet. These are not Milk Bone priced.
