Like "Kitten Kisser", I must warn others to do the math and not order this item from Amazon.  Today I received the email notice that my Subscribe and Save order had been shipped and that the charge for this item was $16.10.  Since that is $0.67 per can (and I can get it locally for $0.40 per can), I wondered why I would have signed up for Subscribe and Save at that price.  I checked my account and discovered that my original (on Fe uary 3rd) Subscribe and Save order had cost $8.49; a good deal at $0.35 per can and no sales tax.  The Amazon price has now almost doubled.  Now I've learned to check the prices of my Subscribe & "Save" items more often and cancel when necessary.  Regular checking is essential because Amazon doesn't include the current Amazon price of the order in the "Order Shipping Soon" email.  Most incredibly,  the "regular" Amazon price has ballooned to about $0.79 per can, which is almost TWICE the price of the same item at my local pet store.  No, this is not a good deal.
