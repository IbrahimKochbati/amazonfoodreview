I originally purchased the plain Rooibos from Davidson.  It had an odor I didn't really like.  To mask the odor, I began using it mixed with some Earl Grey from Stash.  This worked well and I really enjoy the mix.  However, when I found that Davidson had a Rooibos with a Chai mix, I decided to try that.  I found I liked it very much and didn't notice any unusual odor.     Others have commented on the tea being very finely ground and that is true.  I make a lot of ice tea using a West Bend 68303 machine.  It has a very fine screen that should handle Rooibos very well.  However, coffee filters are cheap.  I put in a coffee filter in the tea holder before filling it with tea and that works very well.  Also, it's a snap to clean later for you just dump the filter and grounds all at once.     I'm not very good at describing the taste.  I drink about 2 quarts a day of ice tea and can only say I really love the flavor of Masala Chai Rooibos.  I also love Davidson's packaging.  I find myself using this tea every day.  Sometimes I mix a bag or two of something else with it, but it is always the foundation of whatever I  ew.  I also sometimes add a flavored sweetener like vanilla or caramel.  All in all this is an excellent and economical tea.  I recommend it highly.
