This is a staple in my kitchen cupboard. I use it on chops and also on pork patties. My taste buds are not able to pick out the flavors that make up the coating mix, but I do like it and that is what's important. I like using this to bake chops and patties, thus not having that additional fat in my family's diet. It's somewhat easier and less messy then coating the meat in the traditional manner and frying it in a pan. Over the years I have played with this Shake n'Bake by adding a little oil to the tray when putting it in the oven, just to improve the flavor and make the meat have a little more flavor and the coating to have a flavor more like pan fried without too much oil. I'm sure they wouldn't recommend it, but you can also add more spices to the mix to suit your own taste buds. Don't be afraid to experiment with this type of product. Also remember that you can open a second package if you need more coating mix for more meat.
