I liked most all of these except for the cheddar ones.  These are packed with flavor and are a great alternative to regular potato chips as well as being just 80% just as good.          The best way to describe these is that they are like rice cakes except make from potatoes.  I hate rice hates but loved these (just the texture is compared to rice cakes not the flavor)and I will definitely purchase them again in the future.          I recommend giving these a chance, they are a great healthy and quick snack.
