I bought Avocado Oil specifically for two reasons: one, because it is very similar to olive oil in texture and smell, yet  ings a new flavor component to my cooking, and secondly and most importantly for me . . . it has a much higher smoke burn point than extra virgin olive oil  even higher than Canola oil, grapeseed oil and yes, even safflower oil. I've also read that it's just as healthy. The smoke point of avocado oil is somewhere north of 500F! Roughly 520F in fact. That's amazing, and gives me the versatility I need to quick fire or sear virtually anything under high heat. La Tourangelle's Avocado Oil, one of the few I've tried, tastes great! Fresh and subtly aromatic.          Basically, this has been the cure to my burned olive oil blues. That's an especially nice thing, since I have a hyper sensitive smoke detector and have little room for error when it comes to smoke. To sum it up, though I don't always cook with it (I still use olive oil for low and medium temperature cooking), I love having avocado oil close at hand, for those times when I need it. It actually won't replace your olive oil though, because it has a somewhat different flavor, but it is a flavor I love. Avocado oil is ingenious (and a somewhat new discovery), and La Tourangelle is a trusted producer of the finest of fine edible oils. I trust their  and for some other less well known oils as well.          Highly and enthusiastically recommended  to the point that I'm trying to persuade my family and friends to start cooking with Avocado oil.
