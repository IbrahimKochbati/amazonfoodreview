This is one of the best tasting black raspberry preserves that actually  have seeds. it is so hard to find real black raspberry preserves that have not been stripped down to a watery seedless jam that seems to be so prevalent nowadays. even some of the so called preserves that state whole fruit on amazon site are seedless and do not state it. Preserves have the whole fruit and seeds in general. otherwise it is a jam or jelly. so if your looking for the real taste of how black raspberry preserves should taste with seeds in it. this is a great tasty product. If you want seedless I recommend Clear ook Farms on Amazon. But the best is Blue Ridge or St. Dalfour all available on amazon.
