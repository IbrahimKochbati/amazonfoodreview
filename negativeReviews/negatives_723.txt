I love, love, love dark roasted coffee and don't like a acid taste so I thought this would be great,          I was pleased with the 'no acid taste," but...I had to use twice as much to get the same flavor I usually like. That wouldn't be a big deal  but it meant I went through the coffee faster than I should have and that can get expensive.          This blend was ground very finely so would not be good with a french press. I was able to use it with a pour over.
