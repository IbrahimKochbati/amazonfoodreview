Looks can be deceiving, especially with this product:  The cute, tiny can looks great, but don't fall for it!  This little guy packs an amazing 140 calories per 8.3 oz can.  My favorite 24 oz Arizona Iced Tea(black white tea with sugar) has almost just as many calories(150) and almost 3 times the size of Switch.  Also, do not be tempted with "100% Vitamin C and 20% Vitamin E" pitch either.  Most of us consume 100% of daily Vitamin C without even trying through foods and anything extra get eliminated.          The taste however does feel a bit more natural than other artificial orange sodas though, so that's the only plus.  Also, if you do not worry about gaining weight, I guess this is a good way to get a sugar rush in a tiny can.          Overall, a good tasting product, but there are many other low caloric alternatives out there.  A can of Diet Coke and a multivitamin anyone?
