I ordered these to stay awake during some late study sessions.  They have done the job well, without the 'crash' an energy drink leaves you with.  They are very strong and bold. I do 2  ews with one cup  one on large the large setting and one on small setting.  This fills a travel mug and it is not watered down with the two  ews, still very strong.  Flavor is excellant, better than some of the other k kups I have tried.
