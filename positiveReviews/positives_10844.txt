These were a little bigger then my owner expected them to be, each treat can be  oken in half.     I really enjoyed the taste, and spent a good five minutes snuffling the ground after being given the treat to make sure I had not missed any crumbs.          My owner wishes that organic items like this could be made in the United States, but understands that the treats had to be made in New Zealand because New Zealand does not allow GMO crops to be grown in their country.     Since my owner is opposed to GMO in the food supply, she was happy that she could give me a treat that was healthy, safe, and tasty, that contains no GMO ingredients.
