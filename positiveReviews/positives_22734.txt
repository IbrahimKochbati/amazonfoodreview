I'm happy to say that in this case a pretty package equals yummy popcorn. The freshness is just what you would hope to receive and it is easy to use. It's a little salty if you pour in the entire seasoning packet (I guess it is better to have too much than not enough).          The popcorn has a slighly sweet taste with an acceptable amount of "old maids".  It is definately better than the popcorn I had before and I'd purchase this again.  Finally, this review is for the 4oz package.
