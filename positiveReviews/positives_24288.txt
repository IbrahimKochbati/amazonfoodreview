There's a Chai place I usually go to,  but that can get expensive so I started looking around for powders I could use at home.  I tried two other powders before this,  one from WalMart and one from Trader Joes,  can't remember the names,  but this one beats both.  It has a pleasant soft chai taste without being overly spiced or spicy.
