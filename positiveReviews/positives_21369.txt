My doberman went nuts over this bone.  He tried to devour it rather quickly.  My only complaint about this bone is that it left a mess on the floor; the red color of the bone rubs onto the floor.  It did wipe up fairly easily.  Just make sure when you give the bone to your dog he's not eating it on a carpeted floor.
