I never used white flour much prior to becoming gluten free but there are some recipes that simply don't turn out as well with any other type of flour. One of those is dutch babies which turns out light and fluffy made with this flour blend:     4 EGGS, 1 cup MILK, 1 cup MAMA'S FLOUR BLEND with 1 2 tsp XANTHAN GUM (always add xanthan when using a GF flour). Add ingredients one by one (in order) to a blender until blended well then pour slowly into the middle of a 10 12 inch iron skillet pre heated in 425 oven until 1 4 1 2 cube BUTTER is (just) melted in it then swirled to cover sides. Bake for 18 20 minutes and serve immediately. Good with sauteed apples and cinnamon topped with sour cream or yogurt with a sprinkle of  own sugar or (my favorite and the easiest) LEMON WEDGES squeezed over with a sprinkle of POWERED SUGAR.
