LOVE this VIA product. After a pregnancy filled with morning sickness I wasn't sure I'd ever get my taste back for coffee, but my baby wasn't too old before that old craving came back. But I didn't want to drink high octane stuff as a nursing mom so was mainly drinking decaf hot tea. When I found these on sale I decided to give it a try ... I'm glad I did. I've moved on to making pots of Dunkin Decaf at home for everyday drinking, but I love these VIA for travel or just an afternoon cuppa. I do wish there were more options in decaf flavors.
