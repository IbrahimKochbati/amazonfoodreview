I gave these treats to my chihuahua mix and he developed renal failure.  I then found out the FDA had issued a warning about these treats causing renal failure.  I'm amazed Amazon is still selling them.  My dog just spent 2 days getting IV fluids at the vets and may still not survive.  Yes, he absolutely loved these treats.  But please, at the very least, read about the warnings and what's happened to other animals before thinking about giving them to your pet.
