I have tried about 75% of the available T Discs, and the Kona Blend is one of the best regular unflavored coffees for Tassimo. It has a nice smooth flavor that is not overpowering, and has a pleasant aroma. Personally, I would enjoy it more if it were stronger bolder. However, being a bit mild, it goes well with  eakfast and or (gluten free) baked goodies. I find it mildly perplexing that this product is not available from tassimodirect, nor is a subscription service available. Originally found this at (Dead Bats from) Beyond, used a 20% coupon, and was happy with the final price.
