I am pretty tolerant towards taste as far as convenience food goes because i take it like it says, it is convenient so no high expectations. Even on that front, the older version of hemp shake took some getting used to but mixing it with bananas and honey made it tolerable. But the new version of the hemp shake....arrrrggghhhh, lets be kind and say it was undrinkable (and i am being unkind, i would say i would not even give this to my enemy).     Seriously Nutiva, i implore you to go back to your older formula. It tasted much better.
