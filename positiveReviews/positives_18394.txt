I love this product. I like some of the other flavors, but this one is the very best. Like mashed potatoes in a chip...and it's hard not to eat the whole bag. And let me tell you, if you do that at least they are healthier than the other options. I couldn't find my favorite flavor in my area though. I found the other flavors (sour cream & onion, cheddar, barbeque & original), but not my favorite. So I went this route & couldn't be happier. Yum! But these are MY chips...get your own. : )
