I ordered this back in October through subscribe and save, and it arrived promptly and in good shape.  I then wrapped it up and    two months later    drove it nine hours north to Wisconsin as part of a Christmas gift basket for my parents in Waukesha, not having noticed that it's actually made by a family owned business further north in this state.  Not only was this a good price for pure maple syrup (grade B, with strong maple flavor that goes a long way on a stack of pancakes), but it was a nice surprise to find that Wisconsin maple syrup is just as flavorful as that from New England.
