I microwave it for 70 seconds to cook it then splash it with a little milk to cool it off enough to eat. The taste isn't horrible, but it isn't fantastic, either. I also got the cinnamon spice one and I think that one tastes a tad better (but still not great). I threw some table sugar on it and that made a world of difference in the taste though I had to sacrifice some nutritional value in order to make it so.          One thing I did like is that one serving keeps me full, which is actually something I find difficult in most foods. It holds me over for 4 5 hours while I'm usually hungry after eating most meals in a couple of hours. I've lost three pounds since starting this ten days ago without much of a change to my workout routine. I'm thinking it is the oatmeal.          If the taste got better, this product would be GOLDEN!!!
