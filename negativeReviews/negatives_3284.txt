I purchased this product based on the great reviews, with one reviewer even saying that it's perfect for stuffing bleu cheese olives.  Great!  That's what I wanted it for.  I figured I'd be able to load this thing up with cheese and fill the olives quickly.  It turns out that that big green body on this tool is just filled with a spring and a rod, and you can't load it with cheese.  You can only fit enough cheese into a very small chamber for about one olive.  So you have to fill this little chamber with cheese by hand, and then it presses it into the olive.  Then you have to do it all over for your next olive.  You might as well just stuff the olive my hand instead of stuffing the stuffer.  It's kind of a weird concept.  It just doubles the time it would take you to get your olives ready.  If they could make one of these with a big chamber that could hold lots of cheese, we'd be in business!
