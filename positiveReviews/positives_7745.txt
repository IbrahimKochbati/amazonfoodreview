Microwave pork rinds?  Figured it was just a bag of the guilty pleasures heated up to add taste appeal.  So I popped a bag into the microwave and surprise!  The bag popped back!  It even puffed up like Orville Reddenbacher's best.  All that in less than 90 seconds.          Turns out the little treats are bagged raw and freeze dried and they actually cook and puff up in the microwave.  The difference between these guys and an off the shelf bag is the difference between bagged and freshly popped pop corn.  And since they're cooked without frying or oil they are    dare we say    healthy?  Well, maybe not raw carrots, but a third of a bag total out at 60 calories and 2 grams of fat.          Not so guilty a pleasure after all.
