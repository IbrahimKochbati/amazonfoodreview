I guess I've never had roasted pecans before.  My experience has been whatever is on the shelf at the grocery store, which have been raw.          Roasting imparts a distinctly different flavor and texture.  These pecans are kinda dry and  ittle (not like raw pecans, which are a little bit oily and chewy).  And I prefer the flavor of raw pecans   the roasting imparts a kinda smokey flavor that doesn't work (for me) with pecans (almonds are a different matter).          I have bought other products from Azar   always top quality.  No doubt these pecans would be top rated by people who prefer roasted pecans.  If that's what you like, buy these nuts!          But if you are looking for typical grocery store raw pecans, look elsewhere.  I didn't think that roasting would matter very much   but it makes a HUGE difference.
