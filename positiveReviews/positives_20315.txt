I absolutely love this cereal.  Smells soooo good!  Almost has a banana y smell to it in my opinion.  I mix it into whatever food my son is eating just for some added health benefits. I also really like the packaging.  A canister is so much better than a non sealable box like another organic  and (and non organic  ands) comes in.  I've tried the rice and multi grain cereals too but prefer the consistency of the oatmeal better than the multi grain (which is a good cereal too but was more flakey and "soft".  Will continue to buy this product for some time.
