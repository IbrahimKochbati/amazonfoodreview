I like "regular" Oreo cookies.  I could just about eat an entire bag in one sitting .  .. I saw these new "Berry Burst Ice Cream" Oreos and thought that I would give them a try.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but they are WAY too sweet.  On top of this they have a fake, overpowering "berry burst" flavor that's just not good.  I'm trying to eat a couple at a time, so I don't have to throw them away. . . but I really don't think I'm going to be able to finish the bag.  I've had them a week, and that's VERY unusual for me to have a bag of cookies that long.
