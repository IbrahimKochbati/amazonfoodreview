"Uh oh," I thought when I saw "Product of Thailand" on the box, with the recent contaminated Chinese wheat gluten scandal reverberating in my memory, however unfairly. (I'm wary of food imports from Third World countries in general now.) Then I saw "People food for cats" and "No gluten" on the outside and figured I'd at least open a can or two to see how the food played with the target audience. We have three cats, two of whom have health problems and are sometimes picky about what they'll eat. From the first can, they have all scarfed this up  even the one with digestive problems who would generally prefer dry food and sometimes needs coaxing to eat. I've never seen her gobble canned food with such gusto, finishing everything down to the last shred and then checking out the others' bowls for remaining scraps (in vain because they like it as much as she does). The food looks like canned fish for humans in sauce  no prefab "morsels." The flavor with shrimp actually has little whole shrimp along with the fish chunks. My only concern now is that they'll dig in their heels when I go back to feeding them the more conventional food that's still filling the cupboard.
