I have thought about ordering this product for 2 years and finally did.     I had 11 inches of my colon removed 3 years ago due to diverticulosis.  I LOVE popcorn, but since my surgery I had been advised to not eat it, or eat it rarely due to the hulls.  I was NEVER more excited after I ordered this product.          What I can honestly tell you is this products has is the same amount of hulls as the popcorn I buy at the grocery store for 1 4 the price.  The small white popcorn is tender, but the hulls are still there in high volume.  So I will NOT be eating it.          Order at your own discretion.
