I can't get enough of this tea.  It fills my go mug every morning on the way to work, and warms me in those early winter meetings.          This is a great alternative for people who can't drink camellia based tea (green, black, white, conventional or decaf) or want a caffeine free alternative.  It lacks the sharp bite of oxidized rooibos, but still has its fruity tones.  It's not so exotic that you'd get sick of it quickly; it's not so unremarkable that you don't care if you finish your mug.  It's just right.
