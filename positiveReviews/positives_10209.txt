I have three dogs, two who have allergies and one also has to take big herb pills to help with her acupuncture treatments. These pill pockets are wonderful for giving them their meds everyday. I buy the capsule  size ones and  eak them in half, which is plenty enough to hide a pill in. My dogs love the taste and gulp them right down. I really love the ease of using these. So much better than the struggle we used to have getting their meds down!
