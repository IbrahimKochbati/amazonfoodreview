I love this rice, and store.  I ordered this rice and it came on time and was packaged well.  I had no problem with it sticking to everything, if it clumps up and sticks to everything then it probably wasn't cooked properly, and shipping to Alaska is always expensive, which is why everything is expensive there.          I lived in Thailand for 2 years and this taste just like the rice my mother in law would make all the time.  I like it very much, it reminds me of my time in Thailand. Cook the rice properly, you can watch a video at the venders site ([...])and you will enjoy the sticky rice just like I do. There are also many other Thai recipe videos at this site also.
