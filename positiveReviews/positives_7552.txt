Great for making tapioca like pudding with none of the carbs! I like to make chia gel and add that to iced teas and smoothies  the texture kind of reminds me of boba. It is a good source of omega 3s, magnesium, and calcium. Also, the combination of fiber and fat slows digestion and blunts blood sugar spikes. I will be buying this in bulk when I run out  )
