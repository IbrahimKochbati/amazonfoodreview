I really wanted to like these since I try to support smaller companies as much as possible. They are ok if you eat them by the handful, other wise the cheese flavoring just doesn't come through. Personally I like them, they just need more cheese flavoring. I gave one of the bags in my case to a friend of mine who has been dieting and sticking to less processed and chemical laden foods. I figured that maybe my taste buds were a bit out of whack since I often eat foods that are strongly flavored, but she confirmed my own impressions above. Her kids didn't like them either. That really surprised me because usually they really go for junk food like this.
