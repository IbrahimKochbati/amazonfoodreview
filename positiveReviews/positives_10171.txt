We have two dogs who have to take pills once in a while. I don't know what we would do without these pill pockets...!! Before we found them we always felt so bad, stuffing bitter pills down our dog's throat. But not anymore... Giving medication is a treat now..!!! It is awesome!! They are a bit stinky but I guess that is just how dogs like it... LOL     Great product we will keep buying for ever...
