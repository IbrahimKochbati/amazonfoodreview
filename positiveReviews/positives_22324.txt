IN A NUTSHELL: Recently I have begun using this  and exclusively. Here's why.          "COLAVITA   EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL" has an impressive list of credentials that clearly set it apart from other makers of Olive Oil. This particular product boasts the following:               *  Certification from the "I.S.O."   "International Standardization Organization"               *  "Certified Authentic Product of Italy", where the best olives for olive oil are grown under the best conditions               *  Natural product, just olive oil   nothing added               *  Excellent full bodied taste          What are the nutritional components?          A tablespoon of olive oil contains 120 calories, 14 grams of fat, and no cholesterol. Seventy seven percent (77%) of the fat in olive oil is monounsaturated and nine percent (9%) is polyunsaturated fat; fourteen percent (14%) is vegetable derived saturated fat. Virgin olive oils also contain the antioxidants beta carotene and Vitamin E, as well as the phenolic compounds tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol.          WHAT EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE IS USED FOR:          That being said, this is not an oil for cooking, as it has a very low smoke point. It is excellent for salads and for marinating and boasts a pretty low acid level. For cooking try their "Extra Light" product as it has a much higher smoke point.          HEALTH BENEFITS:          PROVEN PROTECTION AGAINST ATHEROSCLEROSIS:          Eating foods high in alpha linolenic acid (ALA) [found in Olive, canola & flaxseed oil] will increase the blood levels of omega 3 fatty acids. ALA has been shown to confer a large measure of protection against atherosclerosis. As part of the "Mediterranean" diet, researchers used products high in ALA, and found that the ALA reduced the risk of dying from heart disease by 70% over the first 27 months.          Canola and Peanut oil also contain large amounts of ALA and are similarly cardio protective. The presence of a larger proportion of "mono saturated fats" is central to the cardio protective properties of the oil.               *  NO Cholesterol     *  No Trans Fat          WHICH SIZE IS BEST FOR YOU?          This and most of their conventional oils are available at most groceries and this exact product sells for about $7.00 for 17 ounces [.5 liter]. Bear in mind, that Olive Oil will become rancid if you store it for prolonged periods. You can, however, extend this period by keeping the oil in a cool and dry place, preferably dark. Also, don't buy the largest containers unless you can finish them within 1 2 months. Stored correctly, Olive Oil will stay fresh for up to 2 years. Smaller containers like this 17 ounce bottle may be more costly per volume than the gallon, but the oil will be fresh when you use it and that is ultimately what its all about.
