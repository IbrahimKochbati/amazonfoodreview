This coffee has a taste I can't identify, nor describe, but I wouldn't buy this coffee again.  Perhaps if I had to use low acid coffee I'd buy more.          I added cream (something I don't usually use) and sugar and it wasn't that bad, but I'd rather have a coffee I can drink black   the way I like it.
