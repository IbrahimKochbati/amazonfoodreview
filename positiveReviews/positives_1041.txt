Wow  this was the first licorice I'd had in two years after being diagnosed with Celiac disease.  That was one of the hardest things to give up!  These are nice  not exactly like the real thing, but close enough.  There are many companies that call their product "licorice," but they are merely rip offs of "Dots" candy: i.e. nothing like real licorice  very gooey and stick to your teeth.  These are quite firm, more like older licorice, but still a great chew.  It satisfied me and my craving for "real" licorice.
