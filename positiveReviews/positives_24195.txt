I bought this product on a whim (I don't remember where) and fell in love with it. It is absolutely the best balsamic vinegar I've ever had. I use it on salads, vegetables, as a dipping sauce with olive oil, just about anything you can think of. It has a thicker consistency that most other balsamics and a very unique taste. With the closing of  Tavern on the Green, I was worried I would not be able to find it. Now that I've found it, I plan to order more!
