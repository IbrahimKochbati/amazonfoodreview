My 4 month old American Eskimo started eating this  and about two weeks ago and in the last several days I've noticed her stool very loose and smelly. Not only that, she farts! She does like the food. I give her 1 4 cup in a cloth pouch she likes to eat out of instead of a bowl. On occasion, I've mixed some of the Avoderm canned food with her dry kibble. I'm a little disappointed with the gas and loose stool. Before Avoderm, she didn't care for Iams Puppy, Wellness SuperMix Puppy, or Halo Spot Puppy... she would eventually eat those when she was starving but the Avoderm she likes! When she finishes this 4.4 lb bag, I'm going to start her on a different  and that might be better for her to digest. Or maybe her stomach will adjust??
