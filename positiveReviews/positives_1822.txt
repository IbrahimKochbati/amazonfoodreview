With the departure of Starbucks coffees, I reluctantly switched back to the other t discs carried by local stores. I tried, I really did. But, it seemed like every other one I tried, which was basically every other one made, including the European t discs, were not rich enough to satisfy me. I finally gave up and went back to an old fashioned drip coffeemaker so that I could make a nice, rich cup. I was still frustrated by the waste, since I'm the only coffee drinker in my home. Plus, being a basically lazy person, I didn't enjoy filling the reservoir every time I wanted to  ew a pot, washing the pot out afterwards, or cleaning out the grounds from the filter.Recently, Tassimo Gevalia came out with a dark house blend. The front of the package noted: "New! If you like Starbucks House Blend, try this!" As a last shot attempt before packing up my Tassimo for storage, I purchased this new t disc coffee. Tasting my first sip, I was so HAPPY. Really really HAPPY! My coffee is so important to me, and the Gevalia Dark House Blend is AMAZING!!!! It's a rich, full bodied cup of coffee, and as I drink this day after day, I'm starting to think it's even better than my old favorite Starbucks flavors. It's as bold as Starbucks with no bitterness at all. I'd love to hear what others think of this. I am very pleased with it, and I'm so glad that I am able to go back to the simplicity of using my Tassimo  ewer, because they make a great t disc again!
