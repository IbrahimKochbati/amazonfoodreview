My dogs MUST HAVE a daily Greenie 1st thing in the morning.  If I run out, there is hell to pay. If they wake before me, they start licking my face so bad that I have to wash it!  I have 2 Maltese and they literally start dancing when I  ing out the box. Last order I made a mistake and bought 6 boxes. So I should be set for a while.     27 ounce 96 count teenie tub pack          I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN SELL USED GREENIES.  PLEASE EXPLAIN.          I also purchased a Kindle.  I LOVE IT. I have optic neuritis from Multiple Sclerosis and I am now able to read by adjusting the font.     I am dissapointed  that the letters are wearing off and the covers are so expensive.  My cousin made me a beautiful one out of quilt. Much nicer than the $50+++ ones from Amazon. I TOLD HER SHE SHOULD SELL THEM.
