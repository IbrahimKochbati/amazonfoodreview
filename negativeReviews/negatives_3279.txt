This is a good idea in theory but doesn't work well in practical application.  The things do not all cook property.  About half of them are puffed, some are partially puffed and the rest won't puff no matter how much you cook them.  I follow instructions, measure and have a good microwave.  I usually have to cook twice as long as stated to get any puffing at all.  The flavor is ok but just awful compared to commercial pork rinds purchased in the grocery store.  I also end up with very little that I can eat out of a batch.          They also taste just awful.
