I did not find this drink special in terms of taste; it is kiwi juice infused with carbonation, and a burst of strawberry. Carbonation makes the juice acidic and produces stronger effect on taste buds than the fruit juice.  It does not have any preservatives and it is gluten free, no sugar and no artificial flavors. I hope other reviewers find this drink a little more interesting.          1.    "
