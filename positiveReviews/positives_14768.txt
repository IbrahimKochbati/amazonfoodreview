For you Yanks who don't know, a cheese & pickle sandwich is a staple of the British pub scene.  Good cheddar cheese on farmhouse  ead with a nice layer of Branston pickle, maybe add some ham and lettuce, cannot be beaten.  Living back in the USA after a long stint in the UK, we were pining for pickle.  This is not your usual Nalley's or Vlasic stuff   Branston Pickle is it's own animal.          We found this large jar available through Amazon Marketplace.  It arrived nicely packaged, no damage.  We have had it with our cheese sandwiches, alongside pork roast and roast grilled chicken.  It is one of those great sweet tangy flavors with lots of vegetable pieces.  You really should try it   it is a taste sensation!  Don't be put off by the dark color, just think of it as being like a chutney made with good balsamic vinegar.  The taste is very similar to balsamic in dressings.
