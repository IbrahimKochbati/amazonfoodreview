I like BOLD coffee, so I was a bit disappointed, but it was didn't bother my stomach at all!  I did like it, but it just didn't have the oopf like a nice bold cup of coffee.  If you can't drink coffee at all because it bothers you too much, this is a pretty good substitute for regular.  It was smooth, just a little weak.
