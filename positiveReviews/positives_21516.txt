This is the most impressive, right down to the soul, just almost like your Mama used to make! Makes you want to eat more! The Richness of the Maple is there but yet is not overwhelming and likewise the sweetness of that Brown Sugar compliments it fully; it just cannot be beat! Had given this to my grandchildren who HATES oatmeal, without even saying what it was   and they wanted MORE not even knowing what it was. This is all good for you, with genuine Oats, added additional dietry needs with just a touch of sweetness and all the home goodness makes it all irresitable!
