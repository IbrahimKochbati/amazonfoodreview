This syrup is delicious, 100% natural and organic, and a great deal, even when compared against Costco or other warehouse stores.  Most importantly, this is Vermont maple syrup, which is required by Vermont law to be produced with a higher level of purity and less water than maple syrup from elsewhere in the US (e.g., New York) or Canada.  Vermont maple syrup is as good as maple syrup gets, and this  and is good Vermont maple syrup.  When comparing this product against other syrups from New York or Canada, keep in mind that you're getting more syrup and less water, since Vermont maple farmers boil it down more to give you a more concentrated flavor.          It's worth pointing out that Grade A dark amber is probably your best bet for pancakes, waffles and the like, having more flavor than the lighter Grade A syrups (light amber, fancy), and being a cleaner taste than grade B syrup.  The difference in grades and colors is based on which part of the short maple harvesting season the syrup is gathered in: Grade A dark amber comes in the heart of the season, later than the early season lighter syrups, and before the trees are really warming up, when the baking quality Grade B is harvested.
