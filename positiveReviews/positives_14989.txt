First the delivery service was great and arrived a few days before the estimated time. The package was in good condition and my children liked the taste. I think it is one of the best alternatives to peanut butter with added nutritional benefits and allergen safe. Unlike regular peanut butter exerted to high roasting temperatures producing unwanted free radicals, this  and is sure stand the test if they continue upholding their manufacturing principles. One thing you may need to do is to thoroughly mix the butter before use since at the bottom it's too hard and the top too light. Some may need to put a little salt but my kids liked it unsalted.
