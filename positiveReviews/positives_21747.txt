I rarely review, but I had to extend kudos to Green Mountain for this wonderful hazelnut flavor.  I make mostly iced coffees, and wanted to stop spending so much money at Starbucks.  This coffee is better than Starbucks, Coffee Bean, or any other shop I've tried.  It is light, sweet, and you almost don't need any extra sugar if you add a little milk.  I should note that I like my coffee pretty light.  I also love that this is available in decaf.  I hope they make more decaf flavors available over time.  I adore my Breville single cup coffee maker as well!
