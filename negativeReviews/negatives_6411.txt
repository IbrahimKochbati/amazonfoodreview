I enjoyed the vanilla flavor of this shake.  It was smooth, not gritty.  Although I am not sure I would be a regular user of this.  After a workout I am not concerned with replenishing calories.  If I am I will have a piece of chicken.  Usually I am more concerned with hydration.  I am not knocking this product for its lack of hydration (it is not meant to be used for that), I am just explaining why I would not use it regularly.  I could see that it would be nice if I know I have to run off somewhere and I can having anything to eat.          That said, I did not find this shake very filling.  Within the hour I was looking for something else to eat.
