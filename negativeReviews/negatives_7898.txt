I was relieved to see that another reviewer felt the same way I did when they described this product as tasting like "dust."     The word I had in mind was "ash."          Even when doctored with cheese, it's just very ashy.  You can drop your pasta or dip your  ead in an used ash tray if you want to get an idea of the flavor this product provides.  Which is too bad, because the concept of pesto in a tube is great.  It gets bumped from 1 star to 2 for the concept alone.          The formula needs serious work, if not a complete overhaul.
