We eat yogurt regularly and I have found the yogourmet  and to be very reliable,resulting in a good food product.  This particular item has additional probiotics so I got some of this to add to the regulart yogurt starter from yogourmet.  I used one packet of this, one packet of the regular as well as one packet of another  and that I bought on Amazon (some little green packets) and made up a new batch of yogurt.  I used a little over two quarts of fresh farm milk, added a packet of each of the above mentioned starters, along with a little powdered milk to make a little thicker product (this is optional) and the resulting yogurt was so delicious and a good consistency! I take out a sample and put it in the freezer and use it for the next batch.  This way I don't use up my packets of starter very fast.  They keep indefinitely in the freezer.  The only time I use a new packet from the box is if for some reason my starter that I take out of each new batch starts to develop an off flavor from some stray bacteria that got in.  This rarely happens as long as I keep my sample in the freezer.  What a delicious, healthy food.  It's so good for you.
