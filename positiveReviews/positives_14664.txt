I was looking for interesting tea to include in gift packages and nearly didn't order this because of a negative review.  I'm so glad I took the chance on this tea    it's delicious, and extremely pretty in the tin, with the bits of orange and blue cornflower petals in the tea leaves.  Wonderfully fragrant, thanks to the orange.  Generally, I like gutsy, black, full bodied tea, medium strong to strong, but I'm delighted with this refreshing change of pace.  It's not wimpy.  Am ordering more for Christmas gifts.
