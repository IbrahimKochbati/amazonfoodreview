We've been using this  ead mix for about a year, as it's the best gluten free  ead mix I've found.  I usually make the sweet  ead and it's very good, although it would make a great savory  ead with herbs as well.  I didn't even think to try to make pizza crust with it, as we were using a mix specifically for pizza crust from another popular gluten free  and, which I didn't really like (too light and thick like a deep dish, but without flavor).  I just tried Pamela's  ead mix for pizza crust and it was amazing.  Not too thick and a bit chewy just like "real" pizza crust.  I did add the italian spices which are optional but suggested in the directions, and it was wonderful.  The first decent pizza we've had since we've been gluten free!
