I love Dr. McDougall's products, and this is my favorite instant oatmeal (compared to his other flavors and the Nature's Path oatmeal I eat at work). The large size makes is a hearty meal and it fits perfectly into my cup holder. So, when I get to college in the morning at 7am, I can eat this wholesome  eakfast and feel full most of the morning until class ends at 12:30 pm. Not too much sugar yet still flavorful. Good texture, too.          I prefer this over the other flavors.
