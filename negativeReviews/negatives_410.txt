With no clear instructions on how to open and close the unit, the first few times are an act of frustration.  When I finally realized that if I grip with my thumb and forefinger over the clear plastic shield, about one third from it's bottom and squeeze the sides, the bottom lip pops out nicely.     I will agree that this size is too small for most popular herbs like parsley, basil ect.  The company does now make a larger unit and it looks like it is more user friendly.     All in all I like it, I took away one star for the lack of instructions.          3 2012: After a few months I have thrown this thing away.  It became increasingly harder to open and the size was just too small for the herbs I use most.  I have seen some newer, larger units that don't have the issue with opening it like this one has...I'm going to order one of these.          I no longer recommend this unit and have lowered it to 2 stars.
