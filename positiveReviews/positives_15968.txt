I am still trying to find the perfect bean for making espresso. This is probably the closest I have come yet, at least to making espresso shots for lattes and cappuccinos. I have used the crema e aroma and the Supercrema. I like the Supercrema a lot, and this is very similar, but in my hands came out a little more smooth and a little less bitter. I grind with a LeLit Pl53 and  ew on a Rancilio Silvia. My final verdict is that these shots are smooth enough to make milk based drinks that need little to no sweetener, as the shots (done properly) have very little or no bitterness. As far as drinking them as straight espresso, I would still like a little more body to each shot and maybe a little more complexity. However, as I am constantly refining my  ew methods, it would not surprise me at all if I was still not reaching the full potential of these beans. Delicious!
