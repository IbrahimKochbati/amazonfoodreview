I have tried several gluten free  ownie mixes that are super easy to make and really pretty darn good so my opinion of these  ownies is influenced by the fact that I have made some great mixes. These are really good and convenient because they are ready made but I would say that my ultimate favorite is the Gluten Free Pantry mix. I would compare these more with the Trader Joe's gluten free mix which is really good as well.
