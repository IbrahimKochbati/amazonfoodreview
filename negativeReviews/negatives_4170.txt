I love peanut butter, and I bought this product in an effort to save some fat, while keeping the protein.  Truthfully, I don't think it's that great on its own... I mixed a little with water to make a peanut butter like paste, like it said, and ate it on whole grain toast.  The flavor just isn't the same as regular peanut butter, and the texture was a little gritty.  For this, I'd rather just use a tablespoon of regular peanut butter   with such a small amount, it isn't much fat anyways.          However, the PB2 powder is MUCH better in a protein shake or smoothie because it mixes with the other ingredients and provides that hint of peanut butter flavor.  I think it also might be alright if you made it in to a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  Either way, it is a great substitute for peanut butter, if you can get past the fact that it doesn't taste exactly the same.  I'm going to try and get used to it!
