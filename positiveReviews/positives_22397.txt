Had to rescind my previous review, I finally figured out why the popcorn was not working properly.  I got the Paramount Entertainment popcorn maker with the 6 oz kettle.          Here's the right way to pop this corn in the 6 oz version, take exactly half of the three ingredients and put them in and THEN when they are done do the other half.  No more 60% old maids anymore, thing is the bag seems sized to the 8 0z hopper and its just too much for the 6oz at once so alot wasnt popping.  Doing half at a time changed everything, very good popcorn!
