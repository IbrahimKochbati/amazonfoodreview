This is a quality basic moist cat food.  I only ordered from Amazon because cannot find this flavor withing 100 m. of me and like to give the critters a bit of variety.  Case arrived in good condition.  More expensive by 20 30% than can purchase Friskies 5.5 oz cans locally even with no sales tax and free Amazon Prime shipping, but selection locally is so limited.          If you can get locally, check price and you can probably save $3 $4 per case.
