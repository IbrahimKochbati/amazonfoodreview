I was excited about these and had organized a whole event for my fiancee's birthday around these tablets.     Placed an order well in advance, namely 3 weeks in advance.          After two weeks of waiting, I received a notification that my order was being cancelled for some mysterious as yet to be determined problem. The email attempted to spread the blame between Amazon, its supplier and some mysterious unknown factor, ultimately taking no real responsibility for the blunder.          Color me frustrated and confused because while they said they are stopping all orders for the time being, their company website still shows the product in stock and ready for orders.          This to say the least was very disappointing and more so because the company's response was very wishy washy and lame. In my experience, when a company screws up (mind you it wasn't just my order, it was a whole slew of orders that got cancelled)     they should own up and take responsibility thereby showing some integrity, rather than mutter some indecipherable mumbo jumbo that does nothing to explain nor solve the customers problem.
