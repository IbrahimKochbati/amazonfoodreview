At the age of about 4 months, my little boy stopped gaining weight and dropped from the 55th percentile to the 2nd very quickly.  I am SO GLAD that I found Nurturme at the time I did.  It allowed me to start introducing him to solid foods, while mixing it with  eastmilk or formula, so not only was he getting the calories from the food, but from the milk as well.  After several months on Nurturme, he is gaining weight at a steady rate and we no longer have to be concerned about his growth.     I also have a SUPER picky 3 year old who won't touch a vegetable if I cover it in chocolate and call it a Twinkie.  I am able to add a packet or two of the Nurturme veggies to her mac & cheese or other foods to sneak her in some nutrition.  Now to try that on my husband...
