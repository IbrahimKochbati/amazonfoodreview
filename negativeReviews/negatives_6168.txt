Looking for a product that taste good and has the fiber.  Well, let me tell you.......this product doesn't fit my needs. The taste was decent, but, there's something in it that is disgusting and you can't chew it.  I would imagine that if you know what hay taste and chews like, well that's it.  I even bought the chocolate thinking it would be different, but it wasn't.  That same disgusting ingredient was there.  Would not buy again.
