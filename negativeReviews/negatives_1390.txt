I have tried all of the RICEWORKS chips except for the sesame soy which i plan to try soon i have a un opened bag still so far prefer the sweet chile chips. These chips are pretty healthy as far as chips go made from  own rice and pop when chewed on. I bought them @Top Food's here in WASHINGTON State Costco has the larger 16oz BAG in the sweet chile flavor only. Price was $2.99 at Top Foods for 5.5oz size $2.88 on Amazon for same size.     Costco was $4.99 for the 16oz size...
