I've taken the gluten free baking classes from the CIA and, although you're taught to make good gluten free  ead, this is much better.  Simply because it is so quick & easy.  You don't have to worry about the  ead rising.          Make sure you use a mixer.  If you try to mix it by hand, the  ead won't rise properly.  Additionally, the pizza dough is great with diced olives, homemade roasted red peppers, basil & garlic   all in the dough.          Finally, I'm also allergic to corn, soy, beans, nuts, and a ton of other stuff. So, unless I make it myself, this is my only choice (other than some of the Namaste products).
