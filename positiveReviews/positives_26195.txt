My mother in law recommended this tea to me to help me naturally alleviate my menstrual cramps. I have to warn that the tea doesn't "kick in" for a couple of cycles, so don't drink this expecting a magic cure all within the first cup. I used to be very dependent on Advil, Tylenol, etc. so this tea was a lifesaver.          It's a very mild tea and you don't need a lot of sugar or honey in it. I recommend it.
