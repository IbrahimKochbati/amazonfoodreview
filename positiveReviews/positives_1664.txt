My daughter will start school this fall and i was concerned about lunches and fruit to go choices. We've bought several different fruit pouches at a local organic store and she and I loved these the most. It it not overly sweet (and a strawberry variation as well), tastes really good. She can easily eat 2 of these every day.     I really like the fact that it has no sugar and color added + it is organic. Just fruit puree.          I, personally, don't like banana variation, but it's just because of my own personal preferences (i like fresh bananas more than cooked), other than that, my daughter approved all of flavors to 10 stars.
