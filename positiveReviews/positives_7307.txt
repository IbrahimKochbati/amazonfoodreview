I've tried Wilton's fondant before, which tasted horrible and wasn't that easy to work with. Fondarific fondant is amazing! It takes color very nicely, I use Wilton's gel colors, and is very easy to work with. It's a little hard when you take it out of the container, but I just pop it in the microwave for 10seconds and it becomes soft enough for me to work with.     This fondant tastes soooo good! Like cotton candy. Delicious!!     I made a 3 tier birthday cake using this stuff and I still have some fondant left over.     My tiers were 10", 8" and 6". The first two tiers were 4" tall and the 6" tier was 8" tall. I also used this for decorations.     Everyone at the party loved it!
