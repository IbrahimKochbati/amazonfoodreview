I really like the flavor of Jodhpur Lentils. It is soupy but if you let it sit for a few minutes after removing the pouch from the boiling water, it thickens nicely. I serve it over Casbah Couscous. This is something I crave at times and nothing else will do. Our fav Tasty Bite is Jaipur Vegetables, but we also stock this Lentil one as well as the Peas Paneer and Paneer Makhani. I love that the ingredients in Tasty Bite are healthy, and it is great to have Indian cuisine in a convenience food. Amazon sells out of many of these, but you check tastybite for singles and cases, they also have free shipping with $50, which is fine if you buy cases of several varieties.
