I really like the taste of this ketchup and I'm glad I found a ketchup that isn't made with corn syrup. My only problem was one bottle was damaged during shipping and leaked. Amazon issued a prompt refund for the damaged bottle, though. Amazon really needs to work on shipping methods. I order bottled products from other sites and have never had a problem because they take simple steps to ensure products are delivered intact, such as taping lids to bottles to prevent cap unscrewing and wrapping items in bubble wrap.
