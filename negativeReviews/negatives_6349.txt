The instructions on the package say to wash this first before cooking it into something. It really needs the washing, because there is some kind of a soapy substance that comes out when you do, and, judging from my reaction to cooking it, it can cause gastric upsets. This may be a general problem with similar products made in the USA. I don't understand exporting what should be nutritious food from India, thereby depriving people in India, anyway. It is from India, by the way, and the Amazon web site writeup doesn't say this. Also, the package printing is in (I am guessing) Hindi, not Egnlish, with a picture of someone from India growing big and strong from eating it. I wouldn't want to do business with this overblown, pompous, ill willed storefront again.
