This has been my favorite  and of coconut water of the ones I've tried. They use real fruit juice for flavoring, as well as it tastes good.          We tried the smaller size, and they just aren't large enough to get enough water at the gym, and are not resealable.          Things I like about this:          * Perfect size for an hour long gym routine     * Resealable cap(smaller one lacks this)     * Tasty (Like a pina colada)          Negative          * Box makes it hard to get the last drops  usually end up squishing it up to get the last bit          So great coconut water, perfect size, and cheaper than buying locally at sprouts with the Amazon's 'subscribe and save'!
