Based on my local source for this tea, the Amazon price is a bargain   almost 1 3 rd less.  I am a daily tea drinker and this is my tea of choice.  I like it strong.  With the Rishi Earl Grey loose tea, I can  ew it as strong as I like and it is never bitter or metallic.  No chemical flavors here either.  The tins are a useful bonus around the house, too.  Highly recommended.
