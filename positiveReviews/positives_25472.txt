IN A NUTSHELL:          This Goya "EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL" is one of the smartest buys one can make. This is "Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Imported from Spain and is stated to be "All Natural & Cold Pressed". Bear in mind that "All Natural" is not "Certified Organic".          WHAT EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE IS USED FOR:          That being said, this is not an oil for cooking, as it has a very low smoke point. It is excellent for salads and for marinating and boasts a pretty low acid level. For cooking try their "Extra Light" product as it has a much higher smoke point.          HEALTH BENEFITS:          PROVEN PROTECTION AGAINST ATHEROSCLEROSIS:          Eating foods high in alpha linolenic acid (ALA), [found in Olive, canola & flaxseed oil] will increase the blood levels of omega 3 fatty acids. ALA has been shown to confer a large measure of protection against atherosclerosis. As part of the "Mediterranean" diet, researchers used products high in ALA, and found that the ALA reduced the risk of dying from heart disease by 70% over the first 27 months.          Canola and Peanut oil also contain large amounts of ALA and are similarly cardio protective. The presence of a larger proportion of "mono saturated fats" is central to the cardio protective properties of the oil.               *  NO Cholesterol     *  No Trans Fat          WHICH SIZE IS BEST FOR YOU?          This and most of their conventional oils are available at most groceries and this exact product sells for about $3. for 8 ounces. However, it does vary regional and depending on the packaging [bottle or tin] may cost somewhat less by volume. Bear in mind, that Olive will become rancid if you store it for prolonged periods. You can, however, extend this period by keeping the oil in a cool and dry place, preferably dark. Also, don't buy the largest containers unless you can finish them within 1 2 months. Smaller containers like this 8 ounce bottle may be more costly per volume than the liter or gallon size containers, but the oil will be fresh when you use it and that is critical.
