My wife and I tried so many different types of cereal, and every time my daughter would give us this "what in the world is this stuff" face. She would then not eat no matter how hard we tried. Our friend recommended this rice cereal, and we have never looked back. My daughter loves this, and gets it three times a day. We love it because not only is it organic, but it has other vitamins and nutrients vital to the development of any child. Whats even better is that with this pack of 6 we are able to have plenty and not have to worry for weeks, and the subscription makes it even cheaper than if you were to buy it in any retail store.
