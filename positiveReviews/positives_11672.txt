I am really pleased with these bars.  Too often, in my experience, Gluten Free bars are either cardboard like or have odd tastes.  Not so with these.  They are rich and the flavors are really nice. It's almost like eating a candy bar. They arent' huge bars, but they are quite satisfying.          The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that they are a bit high in calories for the size   180 with 9g of fat.  So it's not a 100 calorie snack bar.  They do, however, provide 4% of daily iron, which is a nice plus with a snack bar.
