Both of my chihuahua mutts love these inserts. I use the treat in a bendo ball for one and she's busy for hours! The other pooch doesnt like the bendo ball but loves this treat.  He eats it in about 10 minutes.          Def will stock up on these. Especially seeing as the dog that likes the treat in the ball is the more demanding of entertainment than the other   who is contented by just sitting next to me and snugglling.          I just wish they were a bit less expensive, however, it's worth the price for a happy (ie. not bored) dog.
