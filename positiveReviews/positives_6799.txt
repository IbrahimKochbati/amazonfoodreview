My tiny Maltese loves these biscuts.He is always ready for his cookie.He goes to the place I keep them in and stands there looking at the door untill he gets 2 of them.They are easy for his small mouth to chew and he loves them.I tried the flavored ones but he did not like them as much as these and I didn't like them either because of the colors.Amazon why did you take these off Subscribe and Save? My furbaby is not happy about that,nor am I! Please put these back on Subscribe and Save.
