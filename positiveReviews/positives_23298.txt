This is by far the best GF  ead we've found for our 8 year old who has Celiacs.  Super easy to bake in our West End Hi Rise  ead maker   simply follow directions and the loaf comes out perfectly.  It has a very child friendly taste   I disagree with other reviewers that say it is too sweet, it is similar in taste to a "normal" honey wheat loaf   and MOST IMPORTANTLY NO HORRIBLE SOUR AFTER TASTE like we have found to be the case in some of the other mixes and store bought loaves we've tried.  The texture is denser than "normal"  ead similar to other GF  eads   almost cake like   BUT it is tasty, moist and NOT CRUMBLY like other GF  eads. The slices kept perfectly in a vacuum sealed Ziploc bag in the fridge for 5 days.  I took two slices out of the fridge and put them in the microwave for 10 seconds on each side to get it back to room temperature since my son has never liked to eat cold  ead.  Also, we have had NO STOMACH ISSUES as a small minority of reviewers claim the get when they eat this  ead.  Hope this helps:)
