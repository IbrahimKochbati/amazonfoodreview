You can't go wrong with these flavorful wafers for a snack.  They make many flavors, but these are the dark chocolate kind, which can make you feel healthy.  After all, dark chocolate is especially good for you with antioxidants and stuff, right?  Well, we'll at least pretend that they are. While these aren't the best cookie in the world, they are good enough to make you eat half a can in one sitting as I can attest to.          They would be great dipped in milk but I don't even need that to start an eating binge. The filling is nice and creamy chocolate while the wafers are crunchy and go together fantastically.  I suppose they would go nice with coffee, but I don't like coffee so I can't attest to that.          They come in a metal tin (recyclable!)that is sealed and has an additional sealed bag on the inside for freshness. The serving size suggests 2 sticks per serving and that comes to about 100 calories with 4g being the total fat.  Good news is, there's no trans fat in these. Ingredients include: wheat flour, sugar, vegetable oil (palm kernel oil, coconut oil, peanut oil), reduced fat cocoa powder, soy flour, malted barley flour, rice flour, cornstarch, whey (milk), soy lecithin, salt, vanilla, caramel color, natural flavors.  Allergy advisory is that this product contains wheat, soy, milk, and peanuts.          Review by M. Reynard 2011
