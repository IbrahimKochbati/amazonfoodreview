This is a very good ginger ead mix. Lots of flavor and easy to make. It's probably a bit overpriced but I was having alot of difficulty finding any ginger ead mix in the grocery store. I use this mix to make ginger ead muffins with diced pears and dried cranberries. I'll purchase another six boxes when I run out of mix. A good buy and good product.
