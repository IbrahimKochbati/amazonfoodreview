I had been searching for the coffee syrup pumps for a few months so was happy to se them on Amazon.  I bought the two pack and they fit very well on my DaVinci flavoring bottles.  The prices was extremely reasonable and I was suprised when they showed up on my doorstep 5 days before expected!  I will certainly be buying another set soon!
