I just switched my 11 and a half year old Boxer to this food and it is awesome! She switched over no problems with no weaning off her old food. It has cut her gas down and has been so easy on her stomach. It also tastes so good to her that she will eat it without wet food mixed in. I wish I had found this food 11 years ago. It is great and we will switch our Boxer puppy to it when it is time. Also...very affordable:)
