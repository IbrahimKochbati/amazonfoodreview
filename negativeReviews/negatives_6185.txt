Madhave blonde coconut sugar:  put in my tea and black specks floated to the top. not bugs, just unidentified black specks     of something. not very appealing. tried it again in a cup of coffee. got a sliver of something that looked like a hair thin     toothpick. realized it must be one of the stringy hair like parts of the OUTSIDE of the coconut. then I got another, spit it     out and dumped the coffee. I'm back to Xyletol, and I'm throwing out $27 worth of coconut sugar. this was one BAD buy!!!
