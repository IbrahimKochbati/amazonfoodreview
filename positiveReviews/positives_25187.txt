I started subscribing to this syrup this summer as a replacement for my usual Nature's Promise syrup.  I'll admit it took me a little while to get used to because the taste and consistency are very different form the Nature's Promise (NP).          Consistency     Coombs is thicker than NP which allows me to pour a thin and controlled stream onto my waffles. I don't like to drown my waffles. I do tend to lose a small amount of syrup onto the edge of the container but I think that must happen with all syrups.          Flavor     I think the flavor is a little stronger than Nature's Promise. Maybe more than a little stronger.  I'll admit at first I liked Nature's Promise better but I just had to get used to the stronger flavor of Coombs.  Now that I have I can't go back.  And I even tried just out of curiosity.  NP is tasteless when compared to Coombs.  Coombs is a perfect compliment to my whole grain waffles.  Just the right amount of maple flavor and sweetness which allows me to also taste the waffles.          Bottle     I like the bottle.  The extra unopened bottle sits on a small wooden kitchen cart with some other things and it looks good. Seems to fit in.  Of course you have to refrigerate the opened bottle.  It's easy to use. It has a small handle that I think can fit most people's index finger comfortably. Then you grab the skinny neck with your thumb and middle finger.  It really seems to be very ergonomic.  Very easy to pour.          Value     When subscribing it's like getting a free bottle of Nature's Promise for every two 32 oz bottles I get.  And because I can easily control the pour I can make one bottle last about two months and that is using it almost every day.          Great product.  I highly recommend.
