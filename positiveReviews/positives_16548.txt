My dog likes to chew it but it's "heavy weight" even for this petite size. It's almost like 1 2 of her lunch. But it's very safe to use  my dog got choked often when she was chewing the rawhides or pig ears but never had problem with this one. Howwever, it's quite thick and dense. Wish they could make the shape flat and thin, that way, it will provide longer chewing and more fun. My 50lb dog consumes it in less than 20 seconds. She got a pack of Trixie Dentafun Kauchips 100g made in Germany from my best friend. The Trixie Chews are superior than ANY existing dog dental chews in the US market. But unfortunately, we don't have it here.
