What do fruit,  ownies, and meat have in common? Yep the answer is they all go amazingly well with this chile lime seasoning. Sprinkling this stuff on top of wip cream is also a surprizing treat. Its great in a  ownie batter, and is a wonderfull marinade for grillables. Its also perfect if you need to add a tart zing to a dish without adding any liquid. Toss french fries, chips, or any other fried foods immediately in this seasoning, after it comes out of the oil. It adds the acid that fried foods so desperately need, while still keeping them crispy. Who wants to mush up the batter with lime juice, well I use to, but not anymore?          This seasoning will make you explore the boundaries of savory and sweet combinations (since it labeled itself a fruit seasoning), some will be delightful and others will be horrible failures. However, the experiences you will gain and the palette lessons you will learn from this magical seasoning are priceless.I liked the 8 pack because I saved on shipping with the amazon prime discount and also got to hand out 6 of them as gifts party favors.
