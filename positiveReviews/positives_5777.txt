These are perfect for portion control.  I like the stand up bag too, great for putting the candy in the fridge as opposed to the flat bags.  My husband and I are both trying to lost weight, and to be able to grab one of these 70 90 calorie chocolate packs from M&M are great.     I was also very pleased with how they were shipped.  You have to pay a little for 2 freezie packs, but that's fine and then it came in a styrofoam box to keep the chocolate from melting.     I'll definitely order these from amazon again.
