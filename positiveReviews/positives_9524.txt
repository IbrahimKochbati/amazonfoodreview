I don't have many vices or bad habits, but when I first tasted the Kona Coffee Glazed Macadamia Nut I was not only hooked but I found myself thinking about them when my stash ran out. This is something that makes me salivate, and once I start eating them I don't want to stop. These should be on every shelf in every grocery store, but sadly, the only way I can find them outside of Hawaii is via mail order.
