I'm in love with this gum.  I was looking for something to freshen and moisten my mouth between  ushings.  I have chronic dry mouth. The best thing of all, it helps prevent cavities as xylitol is antibacterial. I love the flavor and it lasts. My only complaint is that the gum becomes teensy as you chew it and then, of course, you need to add 2 or 3 more to the one already in your mouth haha. Oh, and one other thing, as other reviewers may have noted, the flavor is real licorice, not anise or some lab created flavor. Enjoy.
