On one of my "we've got to start eating more healthy" days, I saw this product.  I, personally like  own rice, etc., but I have a family that for the most part thinks anything healthy doesn't taste good.  I ordered it and served it and everyone liked it.  Even my most staunch "I hate healthy food" critic, my teenaged son admitted he liked it.  My only complaint would be the price which I think is too high and when you add shipping it becomes a luxury item. Healthy, complete grains that haven't been processed should be cheaper than their processed counterparts, or at least closer in price.  It's so much cheaper to eat unhealthy.  Still if you want something good for you and tastes good, try this.
