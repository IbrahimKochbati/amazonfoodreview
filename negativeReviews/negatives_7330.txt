Well, I hope this pumpkin will taste good when I make a pumpkin pie next week.  However, I don't think I would order from them again since 5 of the cans were really badly dented.  Not just a little ding here or there.  Bad dents to the point of being afraid to eat it. They had to be dented BEFORE they were packed because they were inside cans.
