It appears Amazon may have gotten a bad batch, or they are very old.  I was excited to find these as my Husky Shepard has allergies to Beef & Chicken and these did not contain either.  They are expensive, but I decided to try them.  When I opened them they have all sorts of holes (looks like air holes) in them and the dog (66#) had a hard time chewing through them.  I think she liked the flavor, but biscuits shouldn't be so difficult to eat. I saw several other people with the same comments, so I believe either Amazon or the manufacturer needs to figure out what is happening with these.  Had they been $1.00 a bag I would figure I got what I paid for.
