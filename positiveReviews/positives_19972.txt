These are the best potato chips I've ever tasted.  It's easy to go through half of a bag without stopping.  The texture crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination.  I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do.  And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  They're somewhat fi ous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.          And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great.
