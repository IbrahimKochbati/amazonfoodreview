On Oct 9 I ordered from a different vendor the same product 1.2 oz  6 pack.  That order was 6 packs of 1.2 oz ea.  When I saw this item I decided to order it.  it read the same as my first order 1.2 oz  6 pack & the price was approximately the same.  I received the order today & what is it but 1 large bag of small packs totaling 1.2 oz.  I call this deceptive not curious as another reviewer put it. I think the descriptions should be more specfic. The 1 star rating I gave is because of the description not the product itself.  The chips are actually very good.
