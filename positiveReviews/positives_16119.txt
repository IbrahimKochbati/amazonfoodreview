This is such a delicious snack.. My kids and I LOVE them.. White Cheddar is our favorite. I went to Costco today hoping to find them again as that is where I originally purchased them.  Unfortunately, it was one of those fly by night items that is in and out too quickly..  I am planning on purchasing them thru Amazon as my girls are dying for another bag... The best part is that it is a relatively healthy snack... Two thumbs up from this mom.!!!
