We buy the organic spelt pretzels by Newman's Own. This company sends them fast and so nicely   packed and separated in individual slots so they don't  eak or pop open. The pretzels themselves are yummy. Lately we've been dipping into different mustard flavors   a great snack! A good variety of non salted ones mixed with some salty ones, a good balance. They taste better than your average pretzel on the market and they are healthier for you. I recommend the spelt pretzels!
