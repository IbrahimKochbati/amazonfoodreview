Pb2 adds tons of flavor and protein to my Herbalife protein shakes without all the fat of regular peanut butter. It's a great product. I started buying it by the case because others in my family also like it!          Pros:     85% less fat than regular peanut butter...yes 85% less! I know that's amazing!     Great taste!     Easy for me to take along when I travel (which I do a lot)     A good source of extra protein without a lot of extra fat     Love it!          Cons:     I can't think of any!
