Coffee is smooth not overly robust like starbucks. On the bag, it says"store in airtight container".  I haven't done this at all.  I kept the beans in the bag and used a vacum seal on it to keep it fresh...and wahla!!  It stayed fresh for over 8mos and continues to make a fresh blend when grinding the beans.  I have used other gourmet coffee beans and I must say that this Kirkland Signature House Blend coffee is absolutely delicious.  Currently, my bag is getting very low.  Since I live less than 8 miles from Costco, I will go to Costco to purchase.
