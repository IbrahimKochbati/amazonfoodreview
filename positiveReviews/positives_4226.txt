I am loving Earth's Best  and overall.  I set out with the goal of making all of our son's food.  However, when I returned to work full time the puree time was less.  So my go to backup is Earth's Best Baby Food.  We're on stage two now, almost stage 3, and he loves them.  I appreciate the no added sugars   preservatives and that it's mostly organic.  He loves the taste and combos.  Good stuff, great product, LOVE IT!
