Like other reviewers, I had high expectations when I baked this  ead in my Zojirushi  ead machine and was not disappointed. My first experience, however, was not positive. The first loaf collapsed   due to the fact that I mistakenly added too much liquid. Fortunately, all subsequent loaves have baked perfectly. The texture of this  ead is soft and does not crumble. The taste is a bit on the sweet side, but it is still delicious. My non GF son loves this  ead (especially when it is fresh) and prefers it over his gluten wheat  ead. Definitely worth a try.
