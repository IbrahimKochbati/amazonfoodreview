My one dog who has allergies has been on this food now for a year and is doing so great   his improvement is amazing!  No more red skin, itching, and his energy is so much better.  I think going with a grain free dog food with a lean meat (venison) was extremely beneficial. Only the best ingredients inside, and apparently the taste is great too!  This food improved the quality of my dog's life.
