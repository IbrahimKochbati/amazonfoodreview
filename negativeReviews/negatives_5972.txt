If you love mayo and a touch of black pepper then this is not for you. You are better off with just your regular mayo and adding your own sprinkle of pepper. This stuff is downright hot. There is so much pepper that you can not taste the mayo. The mayo flavor is lost even if you only use a little bit of it. However some like it hot, so they may fall in love with it. It was too strong for me.
