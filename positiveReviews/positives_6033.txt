I switched to sea salt a couple of years ago and have found these McCormick grinders very handy ways of dispensing. My attraction was the price. This deal is better than any I have found in local grocery stores... even with shipping handling. Well worth the price. Shipment was fast, no  eaking or damage. This is one of those 'more bang for your buck' deals.... worth it!
