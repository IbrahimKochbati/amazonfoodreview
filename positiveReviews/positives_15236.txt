My daughter loves Gobble Gobble.  I was a little surprised to see the reviews that said it is dry and tastes bad.  I wonder if those were bad packets.  The ones we've had have always been moist.  The food is a little bit bland, but it is not recommended to feed babies salt or spices, so it's about what I'd expect.  I like this better than the Chick Chick because it has a firmer texture.  To me, the Chick Chick is runny.  I normally spoon feed this to our baby, but if I don't mind cleaning up a mess I sometimes allow her to eat it with her hands.  We've never had any problems with gagging or choking.  When the packet is empty she's still looking for more.  I make most of my daughter's baby food and am very particular about what packaged foods I give to her.  I feel okay about this one because there are no weird preservatives and I can identify all of the ingredients.
