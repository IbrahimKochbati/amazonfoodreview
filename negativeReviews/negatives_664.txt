This product doesn't have the greatest taste. I like Jamba coconut water, but it's hard product to find. I purchased this to try out and I'm not liking it, but it's tolerable when it's cold; really cold (reason why I gave it two stars).  I tried the coconut water when it was warm to see if it really tastes bad like some of the reviews said and sure enough, they were right.
