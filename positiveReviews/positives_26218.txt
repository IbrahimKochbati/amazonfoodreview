I used a higher priced senna for several years and out of the need to economize I tried alvita. Works just as well and is not individually wrapped as the others are and for me it's just one less thing I have to do considering I fix this every evening for me and hubby... I have medical problems so anything that saves me extra step I'm happy for it...
