This is really good tuna! I like tuna & I like lemon pepper flavor. In this product they are both together. I eat tuna 2 3 times a week & most often with lemon pepper seasoning added if I can't find this. It is really good on buttered toast right from the can. I am always buying it because I love it. This.tuna has the best flavor out there of the others I have tried.
