I typed "Made in USA" healthy dog treats in search box. These treats were first in list.  I understand they are Made in China!  Is this true?  if it is,     this is completely false advertising.            I add this comment a few months later, I may have been a bit harsh with my comment about this product. I was frustrated with not being able to find quality American made dog food or treats. My dog had become sick by eating a dog treat (not this one) that was made in China. I did not nor did my dog try this product named and should not have left a review. That is what this site is for, but that said... I do believe the company is misleading consumers with their advertising. What happened to ethics in this country? It seems there are ways to get around having to tell the truth. It has become a way of life and is pervasive in all areas of society  even in dog treat advertising.            In the meantime,  I have found dog treats that are wholesome, fresh and even made in the USA.  You just have to look around but there are some good new products out there.
