I regularly purchase the power to put in my shakes. That's not the greatest tasting, but it's masked by the other stuff I throw in. But the Chocolate Whole Food Energy Bar is so discusting! Because I bought it and didn't want to waste it, I did eat the entire bar. It will perk you up and give you energy, but I don't think it's worth the horrible taste. I will NOT be purchasing this product EVER again.
