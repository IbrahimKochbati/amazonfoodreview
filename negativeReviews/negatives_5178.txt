So the version of the toy I got had a rope and not the rubber 'rope'.  It's a bit misleading because there are pictures of both versions.  I had seen the toys in the store and had only seen the rubber ropes so figured that was the current version...I figured wrong...and within 10 minutes my dog had untied and completely frayed the rope, thus ending the whole point of the toy.  They have a 'helpful hint' of what to do when the dog has destroyed the rope of putting different sized balls in the toy to get a 'similar' effect...that's great, but it's not the toy I bought.  AND now, I have to go out and buy the balls to put in it so I don't completely waste my money on what became a useless toy in 10 minutes.  It's a good idea but I wouldn't recommend this toy...they need to work out some kinks first and or up the quality of this product.
