We have used this product for a very long time, however our most recent bag almost choked our dogs.  The pieces seem to fragment easily and the dogs will try to eat the chunks as they  eak off, leading to choking gagging.  We have never had a problem with our dogs with these dental chews before, so it makes me question the recent quality.  It is possible that these came from  a bad batch as the company manufactures these in MEXICO.  Buyer beware.
