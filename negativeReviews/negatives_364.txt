Purchased the 0.8oz bag (Seemed the same size as the other bags when purchased), but didn't realize it was 0.8 ounces as compared to other bags.  Just be aware   might be perfect for some, but not for us.  Having a bag with 10 potato chips in it doesn't cut it for me.  Might be perfect for kids   but just a heads up.
