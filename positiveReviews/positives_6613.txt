I'm not a coffee snob. If I was, I doubt I'd own a Keurig. I just want a decent tasting cup of coffee with little cleanup.          I've tried many of the flavored coffees, but they're too gimmicky for me. Starbucks  and tastes burnt to me, even their blonde roast    in stores I mean, I have not tried the Starbucks  and kcups.          I like this  eakfast blend because it's not too dark, not too light. It tastes like what no frills coffee should taste like. I order the biggest size to get the best value.          Update: I just tried to create a review for the "Jamaica Me Crazy" coconut flavor, which I thought was terrible. (And I *love* coconut.) I should specify that the original review was for "Breakfast in Bed."
