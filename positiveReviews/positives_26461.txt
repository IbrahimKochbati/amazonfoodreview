My Shetland Sheepdog, Baird, has some dirty teeth. He's also... weird... for a dog. He doesn't chew on ANYTHING really. I mean, as a puppy he chewed the wall once, but we sprayed that with some of that nasty tasting spray stuff and since then, no problem.          He used to love to chew on cow hooves, but for some reason he just seems to enjoy licking them now (maybe he likes the pasture flavorings). He doesn't chew any of his chew toys.          So how do you clean a dog's teeth if they don't chew on anything? The answer is  ushing (which is always good regardless of whether your dog chews or not!) and not much else.          While at the vet I saw the CET Enzymatic HEXTRA Premium chews. $30 a bag for 30 chews. It seemed excessive, but to keep from having to put Baird through the scary procedure of a full teeth cleaning, it seems a small price to pay. My fear was he wouldn't chew on them. Turns out... he LOVES them!          The thing is, the $30 price tag really got me, so I decided to try to find something a little cheaper, when I happened upon Amazon and found the "one step down from top of the line" Virbac (makers of the CET chews), "C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews for Large Dogs, 30 Chews." It's not completely clear what the exact differences between these and the HEXTRA Premiums, but the chews do smell different (I think this has to do with the chicken flavoring on these which the Premiums don't have).          And it turns out Baird loves these as well.          One thing to remember is that if your dog has yellowed teeth, simple chews won't fix that. All you can do is get those teeth deep cleaned... however, this is just generally surface staining, so  ushing and providing chews like these will actually clear the plaque. And the plaque is the part you are worried about, given that's what can cause health problems with your dogs.          Over all, I'm happy that Baird's happy with these chews. If you can't  ush your dog's teeth all the time, these make an OK alternative to  ushing.    "
