My son loves this cereal.  After trying multiple  ands, this is the cereal he loves the best.  It makes a perfect puree with no lumps, which is his general probelm with other  ands.  I feel good giving it to him as a mom because it does not contain soy, dairy, wheat or gluten.  It is also made without many of the fancy preservatives that are found in other more conventional  ands.  We can't wait to try the other varieties!
