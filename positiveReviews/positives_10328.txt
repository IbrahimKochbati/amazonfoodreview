These seeds grow perfectly in my easy sprouter. 1 4 cup of seeds in 5 days. make 2 full cups without fluffing. They give me energy but I don't like radishes and the radishes overwhelm the more suttle flavors. I would like it without the radish or with just a touch of radish. This is the perfect food for someone who loves radishes. I tried them in salads, stews, spaghetti sauce,great in eggs and on pimento cheese sandwiches even with the radish taste.
