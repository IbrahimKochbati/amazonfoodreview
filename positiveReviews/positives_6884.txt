I wasn't expecting this one to be so rich or full!  Yet it has a smoky finish that is typical of a French roast but doesn't taste burnt.  I think alot of times a French roast tastes thin and yet bitter instead of full and smoky, but not this one! Very pleased with it and will definitely order again.  If you like a stronger cup in the morning, without being bitter, give this one a try.
