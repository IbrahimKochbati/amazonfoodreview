Pamela's Bread mix is one of the best that have tasted since becoming Gluten Free.     I went through a few Brands and could not even finish a Loaf of  ead it was so tasteless.     When I tried Pamela's Bread mix I made the sweet  ead recipe on the back, and I was in Heaven!! I shared it with a friend that is also Gluten free and she is in Heaven too!     Very happy with her products...........
