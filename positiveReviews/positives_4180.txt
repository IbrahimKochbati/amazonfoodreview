This is a nice variety of flavors  two are meat based (chicken and turkey) and two are vegetable based (summer veggie and rice lentil).  My 9 month old daughter eats all these flavors and particularly likes the meat flavors.  I've had difficulty getting her to eat other meat foods, so I'm happy to have found two meat meals that she loves.  As with other Earth's Best varieties, these varieties include only organic ingredients without any of those funky preservatives.
