I read a few reviews on here that mention Quaker reformulated its maple  own sugar instant oatmeal. I've been eating it for thirty years and can't tell the difference, LOL. It is what it is, I guess? You're not getting top of the line, steel cut oats. You're getting a basic instant oatmeal. A fast, hot  eakfast that doesn't take 20 minutes to freakin' cook.
