In my own tastebud opinion:     This wonderful cup of joe has similar characteristics as the ML Crema which is also awesome. It has some earthy and chocolaty undertones, I would venture to say even fruity. This is not marketed as a crema, but yet it delivers a nice layer of crema that lasts to the last sip.          I do not find this coffee very acidic; it is not a true bold coffee, but yet it does deliver a very smooth full bodied flavor. If you like the Verona   Kitamu or the ML Crema, you are going to enjoy this great cup of jeaux.          If you are expecting a venti size cup, be forewarned this serves about 4oz of pure caffeine Stardome!
