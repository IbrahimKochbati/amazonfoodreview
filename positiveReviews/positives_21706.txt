If you like authentic pad thai, satay, or chutney, you need tamarind paste.  Some people even make a beverage out of it and I'm told that, in sufficient quantities it is a good laxative.  I've not explored that possibility.          Anyway, this product is fresh and tasty.  Eight ounces will last you a long time.  This  and is cheap, too, and that is always nice.
