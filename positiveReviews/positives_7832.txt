We really love this product.  Many times we have bought pork rinds from the store and have had to toss them out because they were no longer fresh.  But Lowrey's Microwave Pork Rinds are made fresh each time you microwave a bag. It's amazing how much the 1.75 ounce bag makes   more than enough to share.  If I have a complaint, it's that they are a bit salty.  My husband & I have remedied that by adding them to our popcorn (we pop on the stove), then the salt is dispersed into the popcorn.    "
