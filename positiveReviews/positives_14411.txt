These are great dog treats that are made with natural ingredients and my dogs love them.  I give them these treats to provide the Glucosamine needed especially for my larger dogs.  They get a very good grain free dog food but it does not contain glucosamine and my older dog needs it. Zuke's Hip Action really seems to help her. I have  ought this item for several years and highly recommend it.
