I heard Maldon was supposed to have a wonderful taste. After using it for a while, my husband and I don't care for the tast so much. As far as the use of it, I was under the impression it was to be used in cooking, but heard later it was for garnishing on a finished plate. When added to a pan to saute, it takes alot longer to melt than kosher salt. Some of the thicker flakes never melt completely, so we get a mouthful of large salt flakes with some bites of our meal (which I don't like). Used as a garnish, it looks cool but again, it's way to salty and thick for me to eat. The flavor is a very clean, super salty taste  more salty than the other sea and kosher salts we use. I know it is very popular so I am probably one of the few that doesn't care for it.
