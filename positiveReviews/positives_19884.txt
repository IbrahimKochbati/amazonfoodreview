Pocket coffee's are delicious!  Just make sure you put the whole thing in your mouth before biting down!  The center squirts into your mouth and you get to enjoy both the espresso center and chocolate in one fantastic bite!  They make a great gift for non coffee drinkers too!  I don't drink coffee, but love Pocket Coffee's!
