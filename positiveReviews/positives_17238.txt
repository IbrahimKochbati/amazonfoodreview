I have used this in coffee, oatmeal and yogurt and it has a good toffee flavor.  However, it is not as sweet as other stevia products; I find myself using a squirt of it instead of "just a few drops" as it says in the description.  I would still recommend it though because it is a lot less expensive than other stevia flavorings I have found.
