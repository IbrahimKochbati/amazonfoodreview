I have been giving these chews to my Mini Pincher and Mini Dauchand for the past 3 years to help support their joints and hips.  The last batch I bought is darker in color to the point of almost being burnt and smells a lot more.  It made my Mini Pincher sick to the point of vomiting and liquid stools.  I am going to shop for a better product that is made here in the US . . . I have been looking at GNC products for Dogs and that is probably the route I will take.
