I ordered from east coast supplier before and even when shipped with a bag of frozen water the dark chocolate coating turned very light. I live on the west coast and this seller is in CA, so I got the Snickers in just a couple of days, instead of 10.     And their shipping costs were less, they shipped via post for under $5, instead of via UPS.     Lowest price I have paid for this candy and best quality.
