We love this variety box in our house, we subscribe to ensure we never run out.  I use the 'Dark' to make Mocha, my wife loves the 'Peppermint' and i drink the 'Milk' whenever i fancy a hot chocolate.          The Dark makes a great mocha, just do half a cup of the Dark Cocoa and half a cup of your favorite coffee, add whipped cream on top, delicious.  Also worth noting, you can try some of the flavored coffees in your Mocha and rustle up some great combos. I am not a fan of flavored coffee, i struggle to drink a cup but as a Mocha, delightful.          Drinking the Peppermint or Milk as a hot chocolate, we add a little milk and whipped cream on top, delicious.          I highly recommend this variety box if you are considering buying it. : )
