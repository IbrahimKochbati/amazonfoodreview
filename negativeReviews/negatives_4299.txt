The oil seems to be of good quality, but when I received the package, one of the cans was so badly dented that I just threw it away. There were plenty of airbags packed around the cans and the box wasn't dented or creased, so I think one of the cans was already dented before it was shipped. When a can is dented, heavy metal leaches into the product. I feel a bit cheated.
