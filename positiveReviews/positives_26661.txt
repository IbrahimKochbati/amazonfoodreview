I got a taste of these in a 2 oz bag and was told they weren't being made anymore. Imagine my surprise when I found them here!  I purchased the 5 oz bags and shared them with co workers.          From the first bite you get a nice smokey flavor and then the heat starts to kick in. After a few more chips you just can't stop crunching while beads of sweat pop out on your  ow and your sinuses start clearning out.          Love these chips!
