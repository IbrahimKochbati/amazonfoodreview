The beans are medium roasted, not too bitter or too light. The  ew comes out with a nice kick to it, and only once or twice has it tasted burnt. I'm actually drinking it right now: the aroma is quite strong, the coffee is full bodied, rich, and goes down nicely. The beans by themselves are also quite tasty.          Overall, it's a good  ew at a good price.
