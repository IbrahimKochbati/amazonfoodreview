I have never prepared anything so disgusting.  The taste was a mix of sour milk and cardboard, the smell just as bad.  I had to take the trash out because the whole room was beginning to smell.  I bake often, so I know it's not a kitchen error and I'm not that picky, but I could not stop gagging. I would recommend Pamela's  ownies  add extra dark chocolate and they're delicious as " ownie bite" cookies (side recipe on the bag).  I even make them super healthy and use 1 2C applesause instead of oil!
