I first tried Rose Preserves at an Algerian restaurant and I was hooked. They are absolutely amazing and so delicious. I knew I had to get a jar of my own.          This is now a staple in my household. I use Rose Preserves on all sorts of things but crepes are probably my favorite. Rose Preserves go wonderfully with both sweet and savory foods. Try it with goat cheese or Brie, you will not be disappointed. It's also divine over ice cream. And do not get me started on how great it is for baking...          These preserves are quite sweet, so a little really does goes a long way (which is nice, the jar lasts quite a while even when I use it often). They're high quality and the flavor cannot be beat. I highly recommend these!
