These are super tasty treats for days when you want something crunchy and salty.  I didn't find them overly salty as some commented.  They are very good and I would buy them again and again if the price were lower.  I got them as a special (24 single serve bags for $14) and would buy again at that price just to keep around as snacks.  Each bag is 100 cals and you actually feel like you are getting a real bag of potato chips.  Yummy.
