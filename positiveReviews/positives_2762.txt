They taste good and give you a lot for what you pay. The meat was of high quality. I was however expecting each tin to contain one medium sized fillet. Rather, these are about 6 small fillet in a can, much more like sardines are packaged (but these are just fillets). Was a bit disappointing for that, and the info could have been more clear.
