I love it! I received a Keurig coffee maker for Christmas and have been trying all the different flavors. While I enjoy a flavored coffee, I like my first cup of the day to be just "coffee". I've found the perfect one with Nantcket Blend. It's not too strong, not too weak. And the twin pack is a great value. Haven't found it at the grocery store so I'm very pleased to see it offered at Amazon. While I have a supply of various flavors, Nantucket Blend is my "go to" first thing in the morning. Best way to describe it? Smoooooooth.
