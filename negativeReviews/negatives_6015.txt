Well, I wish this mix was as good as reflected in the other reviews.     Tried the waffle recipe from the package. I guess we're not used to the "healthy" ingredients. Not such an appetizing taste or texture and the cooking waffles make a decidedly unpleasant smell. Funky, burned corn and whole wheat aroma? Lingered for hours.     In addition the waffle recipe calls for 1 cup of mix and does not make even 2 whole waffles in a standard sized maker. Not the usual waffle expansion or fluffiness but hey it's "healthy."          Will need to come up with suitable additions or this stuff will go unused or well maybe the birds will get a treat.     Or not...
