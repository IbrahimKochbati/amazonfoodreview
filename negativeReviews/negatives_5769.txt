I ordered a case of Merrick wet cat food, actually I ordered two different flavors, and the case of Surf and Turf was badly damaged before it was sent.     Almost every can was dented, one was missing from the case , one was so dented it had spilled the contents. The cans would not have been for sale on the shelf. The other case was fine and this was not the fault of Amazons's packaging, the case was full of damaged cans to begin with. Whoever put this order together should have caught this. Smelly, too! I am afraid to give my pets most the cans as they are so dented as to be almost  oken open.     Expensive and disappointing as I live a long way from any pet store that carrys Merrick.
