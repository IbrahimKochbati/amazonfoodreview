The Switch in Kiwi Berry is quite tasty   it's very berry but not quite kiwi...The kiwi is very subdued, seems like it enhances the tartness of the berry but doesn't quite warrant "kiwi" in the flavor title....          The Switch is a good replacement for traditional sugar corn syrup laden sodas...It is not necessarily lower in carbs, as the sweetness comes from the juices...For me, as a diabetic, I would use these instead of coke or juice boxes when treating a hypoglycemic episode... My child does not like anything "sparkling" but if I had kids who liked soda, I would probably try to move them over to something like this (actually, probably to water or sparkling water with a splash of juice) for special occasions...          The flavor is very sweet (even though it is "natural" from the juices) and very tasty... The carbonation is light and sparkling  the flavor and carbonation reminded me of Martinelli's Sparkling Apple Cider, but a little more fun...
