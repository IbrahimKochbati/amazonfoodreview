I have been using this coffee since my  other introduced it to me, about two years ago.  So     when I got my Kuerg, the first thing I did was order the Green Mountain Natucket Blend.  I am not a really big coffee drinker so I don't like coffee that is really bold.  This is just right to get me started in the mornings.     "
