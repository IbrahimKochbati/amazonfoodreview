I set down one of the Newman's Own treats next to a strip of Science Diet "jerky" and let my beagle choose.  He first sniffed the Newman's Own, then ate the "jerky", then came back for the Newman's Own.          The Newman's Own treats are dry hard biscuits, but my beagle had no problem eating them.  They do create a lot of crumbs, so be ready if your dog wouldn't eat the crumbs also.          Though second place, Newman's Own is probably a healthier treat.  Either way, they were enjoyed.
