Its my understanding (based on discussions with material scientists!) that nylon releases toxins when put into hot water..so..whats the deal with the nylon tea bags?  This wasn't stated anywhere or I wouldn't have bought them.  The company told me they wee FDA approved, but the FDA is only worried about things that will kill you in the short run, or that have very high levels of dangerous chemicals.  Trace amounts are permitted.  Considering how much tea I drink, I'd rather not add toxins to my body every single time.          In contrast Might Leaf, while they have similar looking tea bags, theirs are not nylon and are biodegradable in addition to not being dangerous.          Very disappointed in this product.  They should at least have been upfront about the nylon bags so concerned people can avoid buying them.
