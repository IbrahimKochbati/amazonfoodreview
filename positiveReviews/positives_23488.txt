It's not the 7 buck deal I got in March 2012 and at over 13 bucks now it's actually much cheaper in the stores. I purchased the 20oz. pack of 3 so that was about 2.34 a box and close to what I was paying in stores so I went for the free shipping and bought two. I'm in a rural area and it's a long trip to the store so we go about once a month and having this deal meant I didn't have to look at several stores to find the best price. However, over 4 bucks a box is no deal. I gave this 5 stars because I like Raisin Bran; I could not see where it was made so no complaints about Mexico, the use by dates are mid 2013; the price was right and I was a happy camper. I would not purchase this again at this price for any reasons that I can possibly fathom. As a side note, check prices carefully in the food stores because I find that the larger boxes are often more per ounce than the smaller boxes and at one store the store  and in a bag was more per ounce than the Kellogg's.
