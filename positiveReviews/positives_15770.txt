I've tried a few different flavors but this flavor is by far my favorite.  It produces a strong, solid, slightly spicy flavor with a minimal amount of tea.  Sugar is almost unnecessary.  The leaves are re usable up to about 3 times.  I'd order this over and over if the number of flavors available wasn't as enticing as it is!
