These bars taste great and are good for you. They aren't loaded with sugars and preservatives like the ones on the grocery shelves. Instead, they're loaded with healthy stuff that I appreciate, but for my 5 year old it's all about the yummy factor. (I have trouble getting him to eat  eakfast before school, but he happily devours one of these in the morning.) Just out of the package is great, but heat in the microwave for a few seconds to make it even better. Crumble in yogurt (or ice cream!) or eat it on the run. Looking forward to trying the other flavors. FYI   The smaller, square bars are also quite good, but the planks get my top rating.
