Classic Assam Estate tea, malty, full bodied, medium strength organic black tea with a slightly sweet aroma and aftertaste (clearly a second flush offering; the first flush pickings have a Darjeeling like astringency).  Very drinkable by as is, but does very nicely with a spot of milk.  I will purchase this tea again.  Highly recommended.
