I am an avid tea drinker, hell, I even own a often visited tea reviewing blog. I am obsessed with chai tea.          That all being said, I was disappointed in the flavor of this chai tea. It honestly tastes like a hot chocolate with a tiny bit of spice added. I can taste a hint of clove, ginger and some cinnamon. The sugar in this mix is ridiculous. I tried to make it with half the directed amount and am left with little flavor, I tried to make it with double the amount and I am accosted with sweetness.          Maybe next time I will try the spicy chai by Big Train. If that's a bust, I will never try this  and again.
