I have a 4yr old 30lb male beagle mix who absolutely LOVES these chews. I had originally bought them for the sole purpose of promoting good dental health, thinking my dog might chew on them if he got bored or if it was the only chew I gave him. You see, he's usually very picky  he won't chew antlers or bones, unflavored rawhide, nylabones, and though he'll lick peanut butter out of a kong, he doesn't do much if I put a treat in there.  To my surprise, as soon as my dog smells these chews, he can hardly control himself, he get so excited! They smell a little funky (meaty), but I think that's all part of what makes my dog love these chews.          This is great for us, since it means he gets an after dinner treat he loves, they have helped keep his teeth relatively plaque free, and they help keep his  eath from smelling bad. Of course, his mouth doesn't exactly smell like your favorite flower (unless your favorite flower smells like dog  eath), but I have noticed that the distance at which I start to smell my dog's stinky dog  eath has shortened significantly, and his  eath no longer causes people distress from a distance. Also nice is that these chews last a little while. For my dog, they will keep him occupied for around 15 minutes. This is great compared to the Kong  and fresh  eath treats, which my dog chewed through right away, and they did very little for his teeth.          To address other reviewers' comments, I should caution that my dog is somewhat small at 30lbs, and he is an incredibly patient chewer (though he will chew for very long periods of time). He will calmly chew his rawhides, etc, until he gets nice small pieces to swallow, and he avoids pieces that are too big to swallow, so these treats present little choking hazard for him. I understand the issue though, and I'd recommend that you treat these like any other thin rawhide squares, which is to say that they are a pretty big hazard for choking or for your dog swallowing large un chewed pieces (which can cause an upset tummy). As with any rawhide type treat, you should supervise your dog when you give these to them, especially the first few times. My biggest complaint of these chews is that I think they would last longer and be less of a choking hazard if they came as twists or rolls, instead of flat pieces, since the flat pieces are pretty easy to  eak.          Since too much of a good thing is usually a bad thing, I also try to limit the number of these chews I give to my dog, since they appear to very similar to beef hide, and I don't want to give him too many hide chews. So, I give him one of these every other day, depending on the other treats he has had that day, and I alternate with greenies or other dental type chews, so he has a variety of chews, but he gets some sort of dental health chew every day.
