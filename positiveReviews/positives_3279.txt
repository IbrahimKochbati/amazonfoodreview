I usually make my own gluten free stuff from scratch and I love it, but the days when i feel lazy i feel like using a mix, and this one has to be the best one yet. Their mix tastes closely like the real (wheat) thing. I have made the pancakes, waffles, oven baked chicken, and strawberry shortcakes... absolutely delicious
