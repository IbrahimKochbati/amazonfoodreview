Shake 'N Bake pouches are a quick and easy way to get a crispy crunchy coating on pork chops, without the added fat and calories that can accompany traditional dredging and frying.          It is lightly seasoned and will appeal to the palette of toddlers (at least mine).  Speaking of kids, this is a great meal to get them involved in, because they love shaking up the  eadcrumbs all over the pork.          Quick and easy, though you do pay a little more for the convenience than just normal  eadcrumbs.
