I should know better than to ignore a disclaimer indicating that what is in the can may NOT be what is described in the product description. But what really embarrasses me is that the product is CLEARLY called "Morning Moo's Low Fat Milk Alternative." why did I expect it to be dried milk? Well, I'll see if my husband likes it.  Four stars for their being up front. Dang, I hope hubby likes it!
