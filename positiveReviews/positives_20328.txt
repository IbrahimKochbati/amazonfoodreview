We fed our youngest all three of the HappyBellies   starting with the Brown Rice then MultiGrain and ended with the Oatmeal which I think was her favorite. I love the DHA & probiotics. And that it is organic   which no one else made. This cereal is great because you add your own liquid   she liked apple juice with it   and we didn't even heat it up. She liked it cold. As she got older I would mash up some bananas it in too.
