Not only is this a pretty tea it's deliciously fruit like flavor is just the  ink of this healthy tea. If you are looking to lower your blood pressure, this is the wonder tea. I like to make it in my glass teapot with an infuser. I add fresh lemon slices, fresh mint, fresh stevia and slices of fresh ginger. Yum!!
