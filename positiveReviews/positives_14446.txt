This peach raspberry instant oatmeal is excellent. It's pleasantly, not overwhelmingly, sweet. It has wonderful grains and textures. The peach and raspberry bits taste natural, not artificial. A hit with my 14 year old son and my college age niece, who took several cups back to school with her. Highly recommended for a fast, nutritious  eakfast.
