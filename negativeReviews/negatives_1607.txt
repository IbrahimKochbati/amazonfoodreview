This is not orange and tangerine juice; it's mainly apple and grape juice flavored with orange and tangerine. And I really don't care about the vitamin C content; vitamin C is easy to get.          What I do care about is that this is definitely the worst tasting soda of any type that I have ever tried. I couldn't pour it down the drain fast enough.
