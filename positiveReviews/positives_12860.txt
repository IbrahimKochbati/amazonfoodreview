I loved it! Good taste, pleasant carbonation, fun can.          If you don't like Kiwi or Berry, then you may not like the taste.  My wife didn't care for it, but I really liked it! Ok, so all it is is carbonated fruit juice.... big deal, right? But it actually is a big deal if you are a soda junky and want to cut down on the negative effects without losing all the experience. I hate diet soda because it just doesn't taste right and has way too many synthetic chemicals in it. However, this drink has no sugar, corn syrup, or preservatives. I suppose the CO2 may not be the best for you, but you gotta live a little.
