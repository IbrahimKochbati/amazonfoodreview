Avocado oil beats olive oil for dressings, anything with vegies or rice and a ton more.  I didn't care for using it for meat unless I was just using it as a light pan spray.  Don't know why   I suppose most folks would like their meat  owned in it too.          I don't use it for skin care though have tried it.  It is oily and I don't like sliding around in my clothes (or out of them either) so I use regular skin care stuff for that.          I am a proponet of alvacado oil and am introducing my friends to it along with instructions on where to find it.  Oh, by the way, it makes good gifts for the somebody who has everything or for the hostess.
