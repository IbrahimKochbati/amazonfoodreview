   class "tiny"  Length:: 1:19 Mins              Wild Ride Beef Jerky Cowboy Strips, Pepper, 16 Ounce Bag          Having a little fun today, did this review of the Wild Ride Jerky.          After searching through lots of Jerky  ands I found this to be one of the best around.          ONE POUND bags are the way to go, my grocery store keeps putting less and less in larger bags.          As with any beef Jerky it is really best to keep it sealed in your refrigerator.          Funny to see how many reviews say jerky became moldy!  good jerky that is not over seasoned with preservatives will not last long in open air or heat....          This is top quality US meat and seasoned lightly and marinated in a special formula to make it tender.          I hope this is entertaining and helpful.
