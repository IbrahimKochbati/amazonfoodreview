Ramen cups (or bowls, in this case) are a guilty pleasure. I enjoy a Nissin or a Maruchan from time to time, but I know before adding the water that I'm not going to get a healthful snack. For that reason, I don't assess any star penalty for the nutritional transgressions that will be committed when one of these is consumed. They are what they are. You want healthy, eat a salad.          Speaking of healthy, the Nongshim bowl proudly proclaims that it has 30% less sodium than their regular product and no MSG. But if you eat the whole thing you'll still be getting about 3 4 of your daily allotment of sodium (assuming a 2000 calorie diet) as well as artificial flavor and the usual cast of chemical names. As I mentioned, you would assume this much unless you just fell off a potato truck.          All that said, I just didn't care for the Nongshim very much. I like spicy but I didn't find it all that flavorful beyond the spice heat. My 3 star rating is based solely on that. If sodium and healthy eating are concerns, you can work your way down the star scale from there.
