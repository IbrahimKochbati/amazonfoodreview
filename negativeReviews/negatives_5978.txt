Be careful that you know what you are getting.  i have a bichon frise, and a 12" bull stick is a bit long for her to handle.  the written description says each bull stick is 6", which is what i wanted.  the package shows more than one, whereas i received one 12" stick for that price.  much too long for a smaller dog.
