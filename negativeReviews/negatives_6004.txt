Whenever I open the cabinet w  the catnip in it, my cat runs toward me like a bullet eager for her herbs.  I usually just buy it from the market   no fancy  and.  However, when I put Cosmic Catnip in her bowl, she came running as she usually does, but turned her nose at it and this was three days ago.  It is still sitting in her bowl untouched.  The store  and of catnip is gone in SECONDS. Clearly, Cosmic Catnip is not a favorite w  my Peesh.
