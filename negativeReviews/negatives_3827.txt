While the taste of this "carbonated juice", as the manufacturer puts it, is good, there isn't much else to say for this beverage.  One can has 8.3 ounces, which is a bit less than most Americans are used to for a canned drink, but would be a good serving size for kids.  It does have 135 calories, which is a lot, when I could just drink a diet cola for either no calories or one calorie.  Sure, there would be a lot more unnatural additives, but this drink isn't even organic, which many others on the market are.  If I were to spend more money on a healthy and tasty beverage, this would not be my choice.
