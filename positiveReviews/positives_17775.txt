This is delicious! Mine came in a nicely wrapped 3 pack. I read one review that said to be careful because a small portion is very high in calories, so I bought these knowing it may be dangerous. Turns out, they are!! I like to sprinkle some of this on top of my yogurt. Just don't let yourself sit on the couch with the bag, or it will all be gone!! It has a slight honey taste and is lovely to chew, therefore  DANGEROUS! So eat sparingly and like I said  don't let yourself be alone with the whole bag. :D
