I am a fan of Izze sodas. I don't and never have drank any other sodas.          They have natural fruit juice in them and carbonated water, that's it.          Considering all the artificial flavors, colors, preservatives and other chemicals, this soda is nearly in a class by themself.          I am glad other companies are also switching to more natural ingredients.          Especially for children and their health. Children will always love sweet soda and this one is the most harmless one to keep for them. It is the only soda I keep at home.          I have tried all the flavors, this one is delicious and not overly sweet.          I love this company and their sodas.Highly recommended.
