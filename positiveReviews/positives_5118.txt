I had gotten a box of Malher Hilachas style sauce from my mother and set it aside for a rainy day   well, today it rained. I mixed the package with water, added rice, some peppers, onion, chicken and potatoes and let it simmer. My entire family just loved it   even my picky grandson! Now, I want to find more!!!!
