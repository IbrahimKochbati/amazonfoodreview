This smelled great coming out of the microwave.  However, you can tell soon after that this is clearly a pre packaged meal.  The ingredients inside have all become quite blended together which is not really something I like.  I suppose this is part of what happens to foil packaged and preserved dishes so I should not be too hard on it but still, a disappointment.          Though I ate it all, in the end I won't be buying it again.          Hail Flavius!
