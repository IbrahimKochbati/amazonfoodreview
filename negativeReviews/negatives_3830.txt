This product label says that it is "the perfect balance between juice and carbonation", but I think the maunfacturer still needs to reduce the carbonation further. Also, I tried a couple of other flavors beside this kiwi berry, and they are all mostly apple, grape, and acerola with a hint of other things. This particular item is called "Kiwi Berry", but there is NO kiwi fruit even listed on the ingredient panel. It is true that no corn syrup has been added, but there are still high sugars. For only 8.3 ounces of liquid, we are drinking 135 empty calories;however, this is a high level of vitamin C. Also, children will probably like these really sweet flavors, so this could be an alternative to offer the little ones.
