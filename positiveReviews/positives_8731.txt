Fresh in the barrel and that's the way they stay. The screw top lid keeps them as fresh as the day they arrived. A very hearty pretzle. Not as thin as pretzel sticks, but not as thick as a pretzel rod. Just the right in between. Fresh tasting and not too much salt.          Unless you are having a party, one barrel will go a long way. I bought two barrels to save 10% and ended up sending one baarrel to my company's office. Really a lot of pretzels for the money. Will buy them again.
