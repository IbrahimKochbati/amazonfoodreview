I thought I was doing my kid a favor when I invested in a case of Earth's Best dinners.  Unfortunately, the second ingredient (after water) for all of these is....applesauce.  Or in the case of the "Sweet Potato & Chicken" variety, it's sweet potatoes, followed by apricot puree.          After getting used to the sweetness of these (try 'em   they're like jam), it's difficult for kids to adjust to "real" food.  From now on, I'm going to stick with just pureeing home cooked food.  It's a lot cheaper, too.
