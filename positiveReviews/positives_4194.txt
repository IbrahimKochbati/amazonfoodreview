So I have sampled and bought my fair share of Everidae sauce and I have to say without a doubt it is the next best thing to put on food.  I will start off by saying I do know the maker of this sauce, and although that may seem like this review is a bit biased, i wanted to be the first to formally state the flavorful blend of this sauce can literally go on everything.          I like spicy hotness, and unlike other condiments like Franks Red Hot, this doesn't mask the flavor of the food but adds to it.     I have used this sauce on hotdogs, hamburgers, chicken, tacos, and eggs.          The mild is a little bit sweeter than the medium and hot(the hot being the heat that I particularly enjoy).  But this stuff can be added to almost any sauce or family recipe to give it that extra kick of spicy sweetness that will make your mouth water.
