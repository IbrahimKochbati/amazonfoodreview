I really never thought I could find a PB substitute this amazing.  I have heard about this one for some time and found out that it was sold locally so I picked some up today.  I chose to try it first as the package suggests, 2 tbs of PB2 (45 cal) with 1 tbs of water.  I found it to be thick, creamy, and very good.  It has everything I enjoy about peanut butter except for the oil.  I just love it.  The possibilities for this stuff are endless.  You can put it in shakes, yogurt, mix it with jelly or honey, anything you like.  I have tried the Walden Farms Zero Calorie version and Better N' Butter in the past, but this really makes the cut.  It's great stuff.
