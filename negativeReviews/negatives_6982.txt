Normally, this are outstanding bars.  If you dont believe it, go to a local health food store and try one (Trader Joes sells them as well).  I subscribed via Amazon a few years ago, and for whatever reason the last 3 boxes have arrived damaged.  They have a awelfull tainted taste unlike ones that are found in local stores.  They had a yellowish color (normally off white), and looked like they had been melted several times over even though the expiration date was current.  The last box, Amazon said they would fix the issue but havent.  I cannot return them because of Amazons policy.  Also interesting, I wrote a review similar to this one regarding the same issue, but Amazon deleted it off the website.  In any event, I cancelled my subcription and will contact the makers of this good product to let them know that somewhwere in the shipment process it is being mishandeling.  I would venture to say that many of the one star reviews are from people who dont know what these bars should really taste like,
