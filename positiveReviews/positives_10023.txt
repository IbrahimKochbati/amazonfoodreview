I must admit that I had never tried any style of Melitta coffee before this Cafe Collection Classique Supreme.  I am an avid coffee drinker and have at leat 6 cups every morning.  It is just part of my regular routine.  I crave the cafeine and the taste just wakes me up and starts any day perfectly.  I always get a medium blend and find that with generic coffee be it Folgers, Maxwell House or any store  and I don't really notice a taste difference.          So it was a treat to try a coffee that is considered  a delicacy and not just a power boost.  This coffee is a pleasure from just opening the bag.  The aroma of just the beans is beautiful.  And when you go to make the coffee you will probably do the same as me and go to measure the amount equal to the water amount the same as when you make your standard coffee.  But you may have to toy with the measurement of coffee per ounces of water to be able to fully appreciate this coffee.  It was nice to have this coffee that is part of a specialty collection meet up to my expectations.  The beans are ground extra fine and though still providing a medium blend quality it far surpasses my regular coffee.  It definitely is smoother and the taste is rich and full providing a very satisfying coffee experience.  I found myself slowing down and enjoying each sip with absolute pleasure.          As I said I am not one to explore all the supposedly specialty roasts or flavored coffees but am very glad I came across this Melitta blend.  Very satisfying and will definitely become part of my coffee regime when a definite treat is needed.
