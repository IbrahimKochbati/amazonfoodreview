I was a bit skeptical buying a tinned fish product that is flavored or spiced. My thinking is that it must be so nasty and foul that it NEEDS to be pre spiced?  I was proven wrong. You get a nice firm boneless fillet that is devoid of heads, entrails and the like that is common in sardines. The Omega 3 and 6 rich flesh is not overly fishy like many sardine products. Pepper and lemon are MADE for oily fish, truly a perfect pairing, mild but gives a bit of kick.  On a nice soda cracker, I would eat this over any canned tuna that is higher on the food chain and has notably higher mercury levels than these small tasty low food chain fishes. Herring fillets, tastier and healthier than tuna but not as fishy as whole sardines.
