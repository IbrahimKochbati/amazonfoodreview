I have been drinking this tea for years and I am happy with the exquisite taste that comes from naturally grown Black Sea region tea. No pesticides chemicals have been used in growing this tea, it is pure, it is natural, it is rich in taste and above all it is healthy.          It is produced by CAYKUR (Rize,Black Sea Region,Turkey), Turkey's government enterprise for tea processing.          Caykur's Altinbas is usually priced higher than other Caykur  ands.          It is loose tea so you need to have a set of two teapots, one at the bottom for boiling water and one at the top for  ewing tea.
