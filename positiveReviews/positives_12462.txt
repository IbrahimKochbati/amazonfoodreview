It stinks, it's sticky gooey awful, and my cat loves it!          My vet recommended "baby food" for my cat when he was having trouble digesting his normal fare.  I tried several varieties but Gerber Beef & Gravy was the clear winner.  My cat likes it so much that he insists on a jar of it to start each day.          More expensive than "cat food", it beats the heck out of having to deal with kitty vomit!  Since Gerber doesn't vitaminize its foods for cats, I add 50 100mg of Taurine to every plate.          Amazon's prices are the best!
