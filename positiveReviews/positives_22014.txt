I like marshmallow that has a squishy pillowy texture, the marshmallow in this is a bit on the firm side and doesnt contribute much to the overall flavor.  But in saying that the overall treat is not sickly sweet, as always Old Naples chocolate is a treat by itself but a nice little twist with the marshmallow for those who like a little extra.  Although I like these and recommend them I prefer the caramels.          Shipment was fairly quick and included a cool pack to keep everything protected from the heat.
