I have enjoyed a cup of tea, preferably green tea, for  eakfast in the morning for over 50 years, and I'm here to say this is the very best of all. I never used to like bothering with loose tea but this is very manageable as it is rolled young tea leaves. It's actually fun to handle! You can make it as strong as you like it. For a green tea it is very robust, I'd call it the Irish  eakfast of green tea. I'm totally spoiled for other green teas now and am very happy to be able to buy the multi packs. Thanks Amazon!
