I love this tea. I've been drinking it for a couple of years and it's my favorite. It has eucalyptus and menthol and ginger, making it quite flavorful. You can drink it without sugar or with some honey. Best in the winter amd especially when you feel a cold coming on. My mom who has asthma loves it because it seems to have an expectorant ability. I ordered the six pack with a subcription because i use the tea at work. I drink a cup daily so that i feel the need to drink less coffee. Highly recommend it!
