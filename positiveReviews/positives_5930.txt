Thanks a lot for the Review Starflakes.  We haven't made ice cream with it yet, we will be trying it.  Our daughter is now 3, and is also allergic to cows milk and soy.  We found it works well in recipes that can support the heavy cream or buttermilk flavor, like pancakes and mashed potatoes.          To the person with the bad review, We had a lot of trouble transitioning to other milks.  We currently mix the whole can plus a quart of fresh milk to make a gallon and a half (weaker concentration than suggested).  Our daughter also demands that we heat it to at least lukewarm (45 sec in microwave).  I thank starflakes again for the explanation that it does taste better warm.          We will also sometimes add in a pint of goat yogurt in our blend (usually to the half gallon portion).  We bought a few cans of the condensed for emergency use, when we tried to use the can on a trip, she wouldn't drink it (though we didn't have the normal to blend it with).          Even blending it with a quart of fresh milk, we go through 2 3 cans a week, and started buying it by the case when our local store couldn't keep up with our demand, even then we frequently buy them out waiting for the next case.  Hopefully the online supply is more reliable in addition to costing less.
