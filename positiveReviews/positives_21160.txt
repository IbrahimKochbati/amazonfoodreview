This is an instant ginger drink in granular form. It is delicious hot or cold, and the the little sachets make it convenient to carry anywhere. I think it would be good sprinkled on hot buttered toast,or as a last minute garnish on a frosted cake. Its a wonderful comfort for someone with a cold or flu, or an upset tummy. A real find!!!!!!!!
