My 11 dogs love this so I say it is great!  The tiny ones (toy poodles) get the almost straight food. The others  get this mixed with their Bil Jac. I am impressed with the ingredients.  Not full of corn! Another thing I noticed...  Every time I have fed my dogs  any  and of straight canned dog food, with the exception of Science Diet, they had diarrhea. Not with this one. Not even one of them had it. That's a good thing. I ordered two more cases and will continue. The price is reasonable too and free shipping with Amazon Prime or free shipping with purchase over 25.00.
