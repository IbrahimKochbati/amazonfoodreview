I used to get these instore and found a cheaper deal on Amazon. I recently realize when you open the bag, there's a strong smell (like plastic or chemicals). I tried a little bit myself and the smell is just so strong that I can't bear it. I tossed everything everything away and would not buy this again.     It's made in China. You don't know what they put in the chicken strips to get them addicted or .... sick.     AVOID!
