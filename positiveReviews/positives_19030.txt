I bought this mix to help curb some of my cravings for "regular"  eads.  I tried the simplist recipe on the box   drop biscuits, just add water and bake.  My biscuits didn't rise as much as those in the picture on the box, but they tasted so delicious! Even my kids devoured them.  A great staple for the carb conscious person. I recommend highly.
