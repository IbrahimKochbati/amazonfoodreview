I discovered these nuts by accident. They were on clearance ay my local CVS for $1. I wish I had bought them all!     The cinnamon and  own sugar flavor is perfect together with the roasted almond flavor. It is not candy coated like other cinnamon almonds (making it a much healthier treat). Everyone that I have shared them with think that they are     phenomenal! I highly recommend this product. It is one of the most tasty and healthy snacks you can find. I only wish Amazon would put them on their subscribe and save program.
