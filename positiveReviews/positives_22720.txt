I have a Pasadena popcorn machine from The Great Northern Popcorn company, so I though I'd try their pre measured popcorn packets. Previously, I have used Vogel's pre measured packs and compared to Vogels, this stuff is a bit saltier. It's very good, but Vogels is identical to movie theater popcorn in flavor; sweet, buttery, and more of the true corn taste then this.          You can always reduce the amount of butter salt, or not add any at all from the packet. For my comparison, I used the entire packet contents which to me, produced popcorn with a bit to much saltiness.          If you find this popcorn to be to salty, try Vogel's pre measured packets.
