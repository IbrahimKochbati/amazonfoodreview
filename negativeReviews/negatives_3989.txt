I've been enjoying BTT for 50 years since I was a little kid!     Loved Vanilla and Banana best!  Great stuff frig and smash!!!     Just got some in Los Angeles last year, and Guess What!  It Tastes like PLASTIC!!!     Excuse me!!! Plastic tastes WAY better!     So...if I want the Real Deal, I'll enjoy Charleston Chew which is...a million times better and more Natural than your Plastic!!!     Wretched!!! Congrats on ruining a memory! You and Broadway Strawberry Rolls ABsolute Crap!!!!!!!  REAL Crap!!!!!          iRa
