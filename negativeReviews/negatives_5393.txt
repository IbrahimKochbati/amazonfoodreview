Coffee is one of my favorite things in life.  The decaf variety is usually as flavorful and fragrant as regular caffeinated coffee, so I pretty much expected a coffee with low acid to be at least comparable with decaffeinated.  Not exactly, but it might have been my fault.  After checking the package carefully I could find nothing that indicated how much water to use with the packet contents.  So, I made a regular 8 cup  ew.  Upon opening the package I did not get the burst of wonderful coffee fragrance.  No coffee fragrance while  ewing either.  It tasted like coffee but, for me, it was just so so... nothing to get excited about.  There again, I'll take the blame    I probably had too much water.  That's why I picked 3 stars or "middle of the road."  If I have an opportunity to try it again with the right amount of coffee grounds for the water, I will surely update this review.  I hope they will indicate on their future packages how much water is recommended.
