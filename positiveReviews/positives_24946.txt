My dogs love this product.  Finally, someone who cares about my dogs as much as I do.  The product is not only loved by my precious babies, but it does not smell bad, it is easy to store and handle, and makes a difference in the way they feel.  One of my dogs has some hip problems, I have noticed a difference in the way he gets around.  Truly a WONDERFUL product. I will continue to buy these products and try more of the other things made by Dogswell!
