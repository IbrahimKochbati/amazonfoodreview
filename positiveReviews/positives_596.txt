I recently acquired a bottle of this and was immediately impressed.  It has good flavor without all the excessive saltiness of supermarket  ands.  I've used it for marinades and dipping sauces in addition to straight use and in all cases it has added a little something extra.  Quite a surprise to find an American made soy sauce that tastes this good!
