From my wife Sarah: Being fairly new to the gluten free diet, I was happy to find a cracker that satisfies those cracker cravings. While they're not as light or buttery as ritz crackers, they're flavorful and crunchy. I eat them with a variety of toppings and these crackers compliment anything I put them with.          I do wish there were more crackers in the box. There are two separate foil bags in each box, which is great for maintaining freshness. However for the size of the box, there are less crackers than you'd expect. When you buy alternative health oriented foods, this is often the case so it's not unusual.          With the fine taste and texture, I'd certainly recommend these crackers!
