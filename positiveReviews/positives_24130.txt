It's Halloween and I have been eating these all weekend.  They're so good, I've pretty much kept them all for myself.  Kids who visit my door get something else!!  Ok, just kidding about that.  We have been giving these out and gotten a lot of great comments about them, so I'm not the only one who feels this way. :)          Love the sweet salty combination of pretzels, peanut butter, and chocolate.  One of my top candy choices.
