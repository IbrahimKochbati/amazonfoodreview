I am pretty particular about what I give my dog for treats. She has always had a funny tummy. If she gets something not right with her she vomits and gets some digestive issues going. My sister has long been a fan of these treats so I decided to give them a try.          After giving my dog one treat a day for a couple of days they seemed to agree with her stomach and she moved up to a couple a day. She responded well to them so they get the thumbs up there. She is also fairly motivated do things for them as well.          They don't have any odd odor and there isn't any residue left in my pocket from carrying them around for awhile when she is out and about with me.          Overall, they are a high quality treat with a decent treat value (in dog terms). I'm not sure how often I will purchase them, but from what I have experienced with them right now I would certainly consider it.
