I expected any canned stuffed grape leaves to be oily & they are [6 oz oil, 4 lbs stuffed grape leaves].  What I  DID  NOT  expect was for the cans to come from China.  Like most other Americans I get many things that are made in China, but I draw the line at food.  Their safety standards are low at best.
