Hello. My name is Maggie, and I'm a finicky eater. I'm one of three furry beings that share a dwelling with our friend Two Legs, and the food that is usually served is gross. Fancy Feast! Ugh. I refuse. Poached salmon I grudgingly nibble on because of the omega oil (makes my fur shiny). I do like sirloin steak when it is cooked precisely medium rare...but wait!          Two Legs is opening up something new!     It smells wonderful. Enticing.     Looks good too.     WOW. What a flavor.     Tuna and Shrimp. Tuna and Sole! Yellowfin! And the Snapper is the cat's pajamas.     I'm in heaven.     Thank you Two Legs. From now on, only buy Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (the Chinese Chicken and Chicken Pot Pie is delectable too).
