I'm very picky about my cookies, especially oatmeal and chocolate chip. I greatly prefer homemade over store bought, and I will frequently turn down a store bought cookie.          I would have a hard time turning down Quaker's chocolate almond oatmeal cookie!          These do not have the over processed taste of many boxed chocolate chip or oatmeal cookies. The texture is perfect, and they are pretty close to home baked goodness! My only complaint about the taste of the cookie is that the chocolate and almonds are sparse. The size of the bits as shown on the box is pretty accurate, but more numerous than what we found to actually be in each cookie. Some cookies only had two or three bits each of chocolate and almond. For a cookie that is rather large like this one, I would increase the nuts and chocolate by at least 50%, but preferably a whole lot more.          In all honestly, six large cookies in each box makes this a rather impractical packaging for our family of five. But, the cookies are good, so they will definitely go on our list for times when we are out and about and can't just whip up a batch of homemade chocolate chunk oatmeal cookies.
