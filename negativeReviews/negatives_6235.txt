I fed this to my baby, but now regret it in light of Cornucopia research report showing the crap DHA supplementation added to this product. Now that we have our second, I'm going to seek out an iron fortified rice cereal that DOES NOT have DHA crap added in. We're  eastfeeding, so why jam in more synthetically derived, solvent extracted DHA? The manufacturer has been suspiciously silent on this issue, so I'm not convinced they are "above board" on their product's purity.
