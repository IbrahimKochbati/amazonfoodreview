Tonight I had a light lettuce based salad for dinner and, to go with it, I opened up an 18.6 ounce can of Campbell's Chunky Chicken Noodle Soup (Healthy Request Variety). I thought it to be a rather bland tasting chicken noodle  soup, but that's because most chicken soups have such a high sodium content. This one is relatively low and, in fact, the potassium content is higher than the sodium content, which is almost unheard of in Campbell's soups. It's fairly low in calories also so a whole can (two servings) only amounted to 220 calories. Also, the fat content is low and the protein content is fairly high. I'm surprised they don't label this a "diet soup." Both the spiral noodles and the vegetables (carrots and celery) are fairly large and "chunky" and all seem bland and overcooked. I would not regard this soup as a particularly good one, but if you want to open a can of soup for a meal, the mix of nutrients is superior to most.          Gary Peterson
