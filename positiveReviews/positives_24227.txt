I ordered this product after I became addicted to the vanilla chai at Dunkin Donuts.  It's pretty good.  I was expecting a little bit more spice, but it's fine.  The chai at Dunkin Donuts is a little spicier than this one.  Since this was my first chia mix purchase I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  Next time I am going to order the spicy chai.
