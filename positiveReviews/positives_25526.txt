I'm not a huge fan of herbal tea, but the taste of this tea is OK, and it is a great value and easy to  ew.  What I really love about it, however, is that after drinking it for a couple of weeks, it has noticeably reduced my blood pressure.  I try to drink two cups a day, and am hoping it will  ing my numbers down even more with a little bit of time.  Very happy to have found this natural remedy!
