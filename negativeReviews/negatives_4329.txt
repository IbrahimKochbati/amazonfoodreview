Not impressed with this stuff at all.  Even though it's a tad expensive, I figured I would be getting my money's worth.  Nope!  You get a lot of clear gel bait in one tube and that's about the only good thing I can say.  The gel comes out insanely fast and sloppy and I could never manage to moderate it to a slow and steady release.  Once set, the ants barely even noticed it was there.  If I had to guess, I'd say that maybe 5 10% of the ants coming in and out of my house ever fell for the trap.  Some would just go near it and then walk away.  It managed to kill off a few, but not the colony.  Not even close.  The guy who gave it a 5 star review must not have heard of Combat.  MUCH better bait.  On the plus side, Hot Shot still makes great killing sprays.  But their bait is very disappointing.
