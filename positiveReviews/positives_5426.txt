My husband recently bought me a Keurig Brewer.  I was excited for my new toy but my joy quickly turned into dismay when I saw how expensive the little "cups" cost.  I love coffee and have always bought beans to grind.  I was DELIGHTED when I found these wonderful little disposable filters to use with my Brewer.  Now I have the best of both worlds!     I placed my order and to my surprise they showed up 3 days later!
