I have bought "Farmer's Market Organic Pumpkin(100%)" for years from coops, health natural groceries, but now Amazon Subscribe and Save is my supplier for cost and free shipping.  Pumpkin is a great source of Vit.A(380%), Fiber(16%), Iron(10%), Phytocytes, etc per 50cal serving, but this  and TASTES good, as well as, provides nutrition.  I generally eat it right from the can for an evening snack; the product is that good.
