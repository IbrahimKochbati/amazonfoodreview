One my standards for judging a gluten free item is that I can serve it at a party and my gluten eating guests enjoy it.  These crackers reach that standard.  I have served these crackers several times to a gluten eating crowd and there has always been at least one guest who unsuspectingly eats them, then at some point remembers that I am gluten intolerant, and comes over to me and asks, "These are gluten free?  Really?"     This is so predictable and it tickles me every time.  The only giveaway that they are gluten free is that the word "Glutino" is pressed on each and every cracker.  I would prefer maybe an elegant cursive "g" on the cracker because I don't think "Glutino" sounds particularly appetizing but that is just my humble opinion.          I would compare these crackers to the no salt saltine crackers I used to eat years ago.  They are not quite as crunchy, but they still have crunch.  They are plain but that's why I buy them.  I serve them with different cheeses, hummus, tapenades and smoked trout dip.  I generally don't want anything but a plain cracker for these purposes.          I have also crushed these up and used them successfully in place of dry  ead crumbs or panko crumbs.          The only down side to this product is that there can be more than a few  oken crackers in each box.  I would buy an extra box if you are using these for a party and food presentation is an issue.          So many of the good gluten free items are quite expensive and these crackers are no exception.  I have learned to eat less and appreciate everything more.
