I've purchased the Golden Malted Natural Pancake and Waffle flour in the past and was excited to see the Blueberry on Amazon.  I received the mixes yesterday and am very disappointed. It  has little flavor and waffles are not as light as the regular mix, possibly due to the expiration date being 2 weeks from today.
