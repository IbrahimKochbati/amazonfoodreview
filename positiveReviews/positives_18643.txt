I bought this ketchup at my local health food store since I've started a "Whole Foods" diet. I was afraid that it wasn't going to taste anything like our beloved Heinz ketchup since a lot of natural  organic products don't taste as good as the stuff we're used to. Well luckily this tastes the same, maybe even better! I'm very happy I found it & have even shared it on my blog I like it so much. If you're looking for an alternative to the HFCS laden ketchup (which has HFCS & regular corn syrup!) this is it.
