Kombu is a wonderful energizer, especially during the summer and in the cold and flu season.          Drop one strip into boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes, remove and cut into smaller pieces.  Add to 6 cups of water, then add 12 teaspoons of shiro Miso (mild white miso), heat and stir until miso dissolves.  Avoid boiling the ingredients. Add cubed tofu (soft is best), spinach or swiss chard cut into thin strips, shiitake mushrooms cut in thin strips and scallions thinly cut including the green part (reserve half for soup garnish). Heat, but do not boil, for about 10 minutes.  Servie with a splash of soy sauce for a little extra flavor.          The Kombu has a very mild flavor and best if not overcooked or over softened.  Great for vegans and better than chicken soup!          Enjoy !
