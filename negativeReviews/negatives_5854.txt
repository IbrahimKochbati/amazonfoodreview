These K cups arrived in a timely fashion but when I've tried using them at all 3 size settings none of them are strong enough. It seems there is not enough coffee in them. I wrote a complaint to Van Houtte and they did not respond...So I've got nearly 50 cups that when  ewed smell like chocolate raspberry but taste like water. Not happy.
