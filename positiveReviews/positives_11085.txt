I recently discovered this tea as I had developed Leaky Gut Syndrome and just saw it on the shelves at Whole Foods.  I can't believe how fast it worked!  I would say within 15 minutes I was feeling wonderful.  And this morning at 4am I awoke with the worst cramping so I immediately made a cup and within half an hour I was fine.  This stuff is a miracle I tell you!
