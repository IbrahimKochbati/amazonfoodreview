I love the color of this shirt and the material is very lightweight.  The sized run about a size small.  The shirt sort of shapes easily to pulls.  If I pull at my shirt a little bit in one spot, I get a "bubble" kind of where I pulled at it.  It's a stretchy ish material and I think that causes it, but it sometimes ends up looking funny because of it.
