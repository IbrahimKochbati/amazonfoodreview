Well I havent actually ordered this product, and frankly Im not going to, I know that in some cases that flat rate shipping is standard, but paying MORE to ship it than to buy it is well just stupid! it weighs 1.5 lbs and costs $9.75 to ship when the product is only $8.50 in the first place!     Shipping rates need to come back down I know that people need to make money somewhere but do you really have to make money on the shipping?
