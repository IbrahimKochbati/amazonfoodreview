My dog is very smart, he got the idea of what he needed to do real quickly but it's just to hard for the treats to come out of the jar, even when we help him... the rope pretty much closes the jar hole and the treats wont come out. This toy made my puppy real nervous and unfortunately I'm returning it, even though I was super excited about it! :(
