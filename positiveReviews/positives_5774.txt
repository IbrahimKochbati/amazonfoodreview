pure and organic. no salt, no sugar, no poison :)  what more can you ask for?  i keep mine in the fridge and it stays soft and easily spoonable.  i use it in my banana cacao smoothies and it tastes good.  warning: not as good as peanut butter for THIS recipe, but it's better for you so i can accept the difference in taste. i admit, peanutbutter and chocholate is a better combo... and change is never easy... but what's your health worth to you?  this is all im buying from now on.
