Wow, these chips are delicious!          They're low in calorie and carb count. I can actually have a salty snack without feeling guilty about it and the taste is better then unhealthy oil smothered grocery store chips.          The sour cream & onion, salt & vinegar, and cheddar are my favorites!          If you're weight conscience, want something healthy, or just want something that tastes good, buy these chips! You won't be disappointed!
