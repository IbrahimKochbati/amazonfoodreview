I love this peanut butter. It has 25% of the calories of regular peanut butter and tastes great with a good texture. Don't make it up ahead unless you put it in the fridge.  It will spoil but lasts days if refrigerated. I buy it from netrition for less than 6 dollars a jar with a six dollar shipping fee for my order.  Also very fast shipping.     With most things amazon is a better deal but not in the case of some of these less common food items.
