I'm a Type 2 diabetic and wanted to try the tablet form of Equal since it doesn't have the "fillers" as the packets, thus raising blood sugar levels. I did notice a few points difference in my readings before and after my first cup of coffee. Also, the sweetness level is not as advertised (1 tablet   1 teaspoon sugar). I have to use 3 tablets and 1 packet of Equal to get the right sweetness that 2 packets give me. The "fillers" in the packets include a form of sugar and therefore make the packets' sweetness more intense. So, I can solve the whole problem by not using sweetener in my coffee, but I swear, I've tried that and just can't do it. My solution is: since I drink only 2 cups of coffee per day, I'll continue to use 2 packets of Equal per cup and get the taste I want, while searching for other alternatives. Note: some of the alternatives are expensive and, to me, have an unacceptable after taste.          That said, I will agree with some of the other folks who complained about the ejection mechanism grinding up the tablets into a powder form. So, I have to take the top off and get them out that way.
