I've been using this cereal for the past 4 5 months.          My son always enjoyed eating his cereal.  However, my last order (after the item being out of stock practically everywhere) of this product was different.  I'm not sure if the issue was a production problem or not.  However, the cereal now seems like shredded cardboard.  It tastes and smells differently.  Where initially is was a creamy color and nice consistency, it is now gray.          I can no longer recommend this product.
