This is my absolute favorite gluten free baking mix. You "must" add in the suggested "extras" to make the best  ownies: 1 2 c sour cream, 1 2 c chocolate chips or chunks. Sometimes takes longer to bake also, so dont overbake, but worth the time wait! Those who can eat gluten fight over these  ownies with me! : )
