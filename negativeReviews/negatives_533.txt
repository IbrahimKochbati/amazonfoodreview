I bought 2 bottles of this Tart Cherry Juice because they were cheaper than TART IS SMART. They may be providing the Anti Oxidents that they say but they completely failed me in helping to sleep better at night. I returned 1 bottle to Amazon & went back to TART IS SMART. I used to wake up 3 4 times a night & have trouble getting back to sleep. Being nearly 80 & retired, I can sleep in if I choose. With my TIS formula, I get to sleep fairly quick, wake up 7 hours later & get anothert hour or two after visiting the bathroom. This product may work much better for you but I found one that works for me & will stick with it forever. I hope to read YOUR opinion of this product soon?
