This product is great! I would recommend purchasing xanthan gum as well, because it isn't as stable as Bisquick in the dough holding together, just a tiny bit works wonders. As mentioned before, it can be purchased for less than half the price from Netrition. The blueberry muffins are delicious, and I use regular Bisquick recipes substituting Carbquik and sugar substitute and have had no bad results.
