I really enjoyed the Switch Kiwi Berry.  I was looking for an alternative to soda and this really filled that niche for me.  This flavor was very pleasant in my opinion, but that is a personal thing that everyone will have to decide on their own.  The Switch is 100% juice so you can feel good about giving it to your family and it is carbonated so the kids will think they are getting soda, a win win situation! Although it may be a little high in sugar, that is because it is fruit juice, not because it is loaded with corn syrup etc etc.     I would recommend this product and feel very comfortable giving it to my grandaughter.
