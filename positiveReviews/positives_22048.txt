I always keep a box of these around to add to soups and well, just about everything.  Great taste (actually a little stronger than fresh), excellent storage, great value.  they don't replace fresh mushrooms in everthing, but will in a lot of things. How many time have you tried a new recipe to find out that the stated 2 3 servings will only barely feed two people?  Bulk it up with delicious mushrooms!  You've always got some on hand and they aren't the two week old slimey ones in the drawer in the fridge!  I've bought from this vendor a number of times and I've always had good service and really good 'shrooms!  Oh yea!, I almost forgot DO NOT throw away the crumbs and dust in the bottom of the bag, that my friends is concentrated flavor.  Also, if you are making a  oth based gravy add the soak water (flecks and all) to the dish as part of the  oth or if you are cooking pasta, use the soak water as part of the pasta boil water.  This adds a lot of really great 'shroomy flavor.  Buy some NOW, you'll be glad you did.
