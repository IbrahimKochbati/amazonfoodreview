I really like the idea of variety packs like this as you can sample all the flavors without buying a case and also it's a great idea so you don't get tired of the same flavor. Inside the box are 3 wintermints, 3 peppermints, 3 sweetmints, 3 spearmints and 3 bubblemints. In my opinion the Orbit gum is not too tough, tastes great, when cold it's not hard as a rock and it lasts a long time. I love this pack, I can't find it locally and am happy that Amazon carries it at a great price and free shipping... I can highly recommned this gum.
