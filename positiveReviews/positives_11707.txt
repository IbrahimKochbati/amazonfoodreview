I tried these and had my kids try them.  The kids thought they were okay   I was really surprised they weren't more enthusiastic to try out a chocolate chip cookie bar.  They actually didn't even finish what I gave them.  I, on the other hand, really liked them.  Bummer that I couldn't finish mine either, because I was put off by the fat content.  Admittedly, I do not eat like a completely normal person   I'm always mindful of fat content, which these bars contain 9 grams and 2 grams of saturated fat.  So even though I loved the coconut, almonds, dark chocolate chips, and the grainy, chewy texture, I really wish I could find these in a lower fat version so I could actually eat and enjoy them!
