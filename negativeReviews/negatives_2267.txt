Although it sounded delicious, I was very disappointed in this coffee. The coffee has a strange, chemical aftertaste ... cup after cup, not just once.  Even when it  ews, it creates a chemical sort of aroma.  In fact, because our single serve pod coffee  ewer was new, I started thinking the problem was the  ewer.  We assumed it was a left over manufacturing plastic or metal aftertaste coming through in the water.  I even e mailed the coffee machine maker (Bunn) to see how to remove the aftertaste.  Imagine our surprise when a month later we opened a new pack of pods (regular Colombian, not flavored) and were delighted that our machine makes great coffee.  When we made a cup of the Senseo Vanilla again    back came the off taste and aroma.  Perhaps it's the "artificial flavors" used?  Be forewarned!
