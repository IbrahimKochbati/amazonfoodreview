Had I not seen this being placed in the oven, I would have sworn that this was freshly made. The naan is extremely soft and tastes great.     The directions aren't right though. I feel it tastes best when you keep it in the oven preheated to 400' for about 5 minutes. Anything less than that, you will have cold spots in between.     Try this with the 'Chicken Tikka Masala' (also from Tandoor). They make the perfect pair.
