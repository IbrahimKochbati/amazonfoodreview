I love Chunky candy bars they remind me of being a kid and sharing them with my dad!  When this package arrived the outer card board box was sealed but the actual silver box of candy was not. The box was missing 3 candy bars not a big deal when you have ordered 24 except I now wonder  what other tampering could have been done.  I would go with a seller directly and not try to save by using Amazon Prime for this one!
