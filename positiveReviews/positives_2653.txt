The price is wonderful! The Hot cocoa tastes great in 6 and 8 oz but 10oz was a bit watery to me.     Dark Chocolate: YUM     Milk Chocolate: Is very yummy     Peppermint: For me wasn't enough peppermint but I just add a candy cane to mine.       I would recommend this again and plan on ordering more soon!
