Let me start by saying that I am not a sweet potato fan, however, my daughter and husband are, and since we are always looking for healthier snacks, this looked like a good option. There are only 3 grams of fat in a .8 oz snack bag, so they are much better for you then regular chips and if I remember correctly, are even healthier than the regular potato popchips. Personally, I thought the chips were just OK, but my daughter and husband love them, so I averaged out our reviews to end up with 4 stars.          When I first bit into a chip I found it intensely sweet but then quickly I tasted the salt and it formed a nice balance, though after eating several I did find them more sweet than salty overall. They are really very light and not at all greasy. If you are a fan of sweet potatoes, you will probably like these chips. If sweet potatoes aren't your thing, these probably won't sway you (they didn't for me).
