I've tried most of the Popchips flavors, and the barbecue flavor is my favorite. It has a sweet spiciness, but nothing is overpowering; just the right balance of smoke, sweet, and spice, they're all good, but the barbecue has the most robust flavor.          Popchips are a good choice for those who are trying to trim a few pounds. They're tasty and filling, but relatively low in calories compared to traditional chips. I parcel mine out into sandwich size reclosable bags to help with portion control, and still manage to have a satisfying snack that fits in my program.
