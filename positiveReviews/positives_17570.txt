I think Puroast does a pretty good job with low acid coffee. Low acid coffee is a very small market and there are very few coffee roasters who are willing to make a low acid coffee. In Los Angeles, Puroast and Trader Joe's Low Acid French Roast are the only  ands I have ever come across in my travels.          I gave Puroast four stars because it does not come in whole bean form. I personally prefer fresh ground coffee and think the pre ground versions so not stay fresh for as long. I think the flavor, which is pretty good, would be much improved with whole beans. But for those who need a low acid coffee, and don't mind that it is pre ground, Puroast is a good choice... especially considering how few choices there are.
