My dogs love Greenies. They are a healthy chewing snack for dogs. I was pleased to purchase Greenies at such a great price. I paid under $23.00 for a tub of 96 tiny Greenies. The same package sells for at least $10 to $15 more for the same product. I will continue to purchase this product from Amazon.com.
