I have tried lots of different  ead recipes (GF), you could build a house with most of the results.          My first batch of this was a disaster!  Heavy, greasy, I actually threw it away.  Second time around I used extra virgin olive oil, half a cup of rice milk and an extra tsp of egg replacer.  I could not believe it when I looked through the window, I had to move the oven shelf up because the  ead had risen 2"!!  If I hadn't have baked the first batch myself I would not believe that it was the same product.          I guess it is a good thing I bought a box of 6 because I would definitely not have bothered again.          I don't think it is as good as 'proper'  ead though, my toddler is allergic to wheat, dairy and eggs, as she is still  eastfeeding I have had to give up the good stuff too, hopefully I will be able to manage a bit better with this mix.
