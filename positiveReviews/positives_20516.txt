I've recently been diagnosed with celiac disease, which was horrible for an Italian food lover like me. But these g f penne noodles are wonderful! They're bland on their own, but with some mushrooms, Parmesan cheese, a little seasoning and a good sauce, they taste as perfect as anything I ever got at an Italian restaurant. De Boles gluten free products have played a huge role in how easily I've been able to give up my favorite wheat y foods and acquire a taste for their gluten free substitutions. These noodles took me a few tries to become accustomed to, and playing around a bit to get the right sauce and seasoning, but now I absolutely love them! SO happy to have these!
