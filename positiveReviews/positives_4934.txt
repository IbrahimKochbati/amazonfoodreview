There are literally hundreds of jerky type products out there.  This is simply my favorite.  Real strips of beef, not ground up hamberger, that tastes like meat instead of preservatives without teriyaki or any other flavoring or sauce.  Good price, good product and great taste.  You'll be happy with this one.  When I'm looking for a non sugary snack, I reach for this first.
