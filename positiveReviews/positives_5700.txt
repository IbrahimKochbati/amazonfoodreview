I've tried every one of this line of products and I have to say, I'm blown away by just how satisfying they all are. Not too much, not too little, every recipe falls within my personal taste parameters, as well as everyone I know who has tried 'em, for that matter.  The ratio of carbs to protein, the low sodium, etc., makes this a VERY attractive snack to me because I'm diabetic.  It's why I'm compelled to write a review. It's REALLY hard satisfying some of the cravings a diabetic gets. We LOVE our carbs, but it's SO hard finding low carb snacks that give the same satisfaction as, say, a loaf of  ead, or crunchy sweets, etc. The Grandpa Po line literally saves my a** because too often I "cheat" on stuff that drives up my blood glucose, and that is VERY bad. So, a handful of this stuff LITERALLY is a benefit to my health. Fellow diabetics, TAKE NOTE!
