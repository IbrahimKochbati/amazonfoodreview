I used the 4oz size which is just perfect for me and my wife.  My wife loves popcorn and can eat a whole large tub all by herself...but this 4 ozsize packet could easily feed 3 4 people for movie night and completely fills my Stir Crazy popper.  I dont melt the oil like some reviewers said to do since it arrived solid...I just pour all of the popcorn first spread out over my popper and then squeeze out little blobs of the oil here and there over the popcorn.  Worked perfectly and I had maybe 2 unpopped kernels.  The popcorn was very large and fuffy just like you get at the movies.  When the popcorn is done I sprinkle a little of the salt then shake the popcorn around, sprinkle a little more, toss again then put the rest on...turned out perfectly and I am not sure why some people say it tasty overly salty?  Perhaps they are just dumping it all on?  This is fine salt made for popcorn and it sticks to the popcorn very well so I would do what I did and just pour a little on to the top of the popcorn, shake the bowl, put some more, shake again and so on so your popcorn is unformely covered.  The popcorn is spot on like the movie popcorn and I love the taste.  I would stick with the 4oz size and get a Stir Crazy popper...they are great and cook pretty much all of the kernels thanks to the little arm that slowly moves around on the service to keep the kernels spread evenly and to help coat all of the kernels with oil so they pop perfectly.  Oh..and the popcorn is just as light and fluffy the next day...I didn't even cover it.  I would highly recommend trying this popcorn and I will continue to buy this  and only from now on.  I have tried all of the gourmet  ands at the local stores and this beats it by far...and the ease of use makes this a winner.  Cut the popcorn and oil pouches and put in your popper...when popcorn is done, cut the salt pouch and sprinkle, toss, sprinkle, toss...enjoy :)
