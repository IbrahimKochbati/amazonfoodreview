I was not expecting to like these cookies as much as I do. I like chocolate chip cookies well enough, but I really prefer a soft cookie to crisp ones. I have to say these Famous Amos cookies have pertty much turned me around. The cookies are rich and have that depth of flavor that comes from quality ingredients. The chips are real chocolate and melt redilly in your mouth creating a moist experience while chewing. These are truly great cookies.
