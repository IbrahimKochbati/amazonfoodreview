I was looking for something that would keep my dog busy, but also wasn't food that he would just eat and be done with.  This treat, combined with the Everlasting Treat Ball is such a great solution.  My dog (about 60 lbs, Dalmation) has so much fun trying to get this out of the ball, and he seems to love the taste of the Vanilla Mint more than any others.  This takes him a while to eat, but also isn't a lot of food.  it's a pretty decent sized treat.  When I first got it, it took him a while to get the treat all the way out, even days!  Now he can do it in an hour so so, but I still think it's a great buy.          Just make sure to get the right size for your dog! Too small and they will rip it apart.
