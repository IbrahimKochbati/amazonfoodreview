Popchips are really a great snack and not just an alternative to regular chips but a full on replacement as far as I'm concerned. The taste and texture are great for the Jalapeno ones. I hate greasy fried chips and often switch the baked version of any chips. Now I have another choice...POPPED! If you like flavored chips and you want something crunchy with a great taste then you owe it to your self to try a bag of Potato Popchips!
