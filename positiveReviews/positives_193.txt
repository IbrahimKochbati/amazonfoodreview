If you like the Ceylon tea variety, you will certainly enjoy and appreciate this tea.          I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here (thanks Amazon!) and very surprised at the negative review from 2009 because in the 20+ years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed. The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years.          The current deal for the pack of 4 is very good (cheaper than I can find locally).          Highly recommended.          NOTE: This listing's description is confusing. Each packet of tea weighs 500 grams, which equals 1.1 pounds or 17.6 ounces.
