I first came into contact with this gum from a Bzzz Campaign for which I am a Bzzz Agent.  This gum really surprised me.  What are the qualities that you want in a gum?          1. Great flavor     2. Retains its softness     3. Does not promote dental caries     4. Long lasting flavor     5. Not to sticky on bubble popping     6. Good elasticity rebound on bitedown          This gum holds all these qualities.  I think it is well worth your trying this product if those 6 points matter to you.  You accomplish all those 6 in one gum.  Not a common thing.
