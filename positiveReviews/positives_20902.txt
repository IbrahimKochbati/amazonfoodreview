These are our favorite canned lentils. Some of the other canned lentils we have tried have had larger than expected beans, but these are a much smaller bean. We originally found these at our local Whole Foods, but they were often sold out or in low supply. Needless to say, we were very happy to find that Amazon also stocks these lentils, although they are often in low supply here as well. These lentils make a great substitute for using dried lentils and are awesome for anyone following a Slow Carb diet, such as the diet described by Tim Ferriss in his book Four Hour Body. This product is imported from Italy.
