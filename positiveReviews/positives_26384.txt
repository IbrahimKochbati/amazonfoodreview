This is one of the most affordable dental chews I found. Greenies are good but a bit too expensive (less tasty as well). My dutch shepherd 55LB also got choked while chewing it, exactly like the previous reviewer's Lab. Maybe it's too tasty that they try to swallow the whole thing. I found a good remedy for it  I usually soak a piece in water for 5 10 minutes. It gets softened but not that soft. This will eliminate the choking. It works at least for my dog.
