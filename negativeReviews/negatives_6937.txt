I tried many gluten free  eads. Flavor wise, this  ead is good. But the real issue I had with this  ead is that it caused me quite a lot of discomfort because of bloating and gas. Yes, it's awkward to admit that, but I wanted to warn others from potential painful symptoms.          I have celiac as well as ulcerative colitis, so my digestive system is sensitive. I bought the 6 pack from amazon, and with the first loaf I baked I thought the symptoms might be related to something else I ate. By the second loaf my suspicion grew stronger. With the third, I decided to do a little experiment and just eat the  ead by itself and see if it's really the source of the discomfort gas. The answer is yes.          I should note that I did not have these symptoms with Bob's red mill     gluten free  ead (which is also tasty). There is definitely something in Pam's  ead mix that the digestive system of some people might disagree with.          Hope it help,
