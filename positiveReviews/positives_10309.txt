I absolutely love these Beaba Multiportion Freezer Trays!!! They are wonderful for children, grandchildren of several age levels. My daughter and I are using them for her 3 mo. old for home made food. We prepare food, portion out, and chill or freeze and needed. We can mix multiple items in one tray and it is ready for the babysitter to use.          I love the soft bottoms because we can pop out the frozen portions we need. I love the close fitting top which keeps in freshness. I wish I'd had these when my girls were little          We also use these as carry along snack trays for the 3 1 2 year old. She gets to choose and portion her snacks for the day. Wonderful!
