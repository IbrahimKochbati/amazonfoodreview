Greenies arrived promptly, are fresh with an expire date thirteen months from now.  Great price to keep my dogs favorite treat on hand for many months to  come.  Yes, she chewes through them quickly but she loves them so much, i dont care. This is the best price I've ever seen on Greenies so we stocked up!
