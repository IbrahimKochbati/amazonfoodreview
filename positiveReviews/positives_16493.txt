I have 3 90 pound dogs and I buy these in the 27 count boxes 2 at a time.     Each dog chews them as if they are munching on gold. It's like they are savoring each bite which is all the better for cleaning their teeth.     My veterinarian even noticed a difference in my dogs teeth after only 2 weeks. Like another contributor, I give them last thing at night before bed and I have don't know if the 2 are related but night time doggie gas has all but disappeared as well.......LOL
