Zatarains' beans and rice   they make a really quick and tasty side dish for those days you are in a big hurry!  Boil some water, toss the ingredients in, cover, turn on low and they are done in 30 minutes.  We have a boy living with us from Ecuador, so try to have some items that are similar to his diet at home.  We like them, too.
