We used to get this at a local grocery for our cat, who adores it. We moved cross country and now have to mail order it because the cat went on a hunger strike when his supply from before the move ran out. We acquired 2 more cats, and all 3 adore this stuff. Two of them especially like the "soupy" texture of it, sometimes we spoon it over their kibble and cats just snarf it up.          This isn't the primary food for cats, it is their "dessert"   served twice daily after morning and evening kibble. However, they think the stuff is the best thing ever, and prefer it to anything you can name in the way of people food.
