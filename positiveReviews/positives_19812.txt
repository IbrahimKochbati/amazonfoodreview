If you like pink grapefruit, you will love this product! I am a huge pink grapefruit lover and I really didn't expect a lot when I decided to buy these and give them a try...THEY ARE INCREDIBLE!!!!!          They look like a grapefruit section, and they are coated with sugar. These are delicious and would go great at any party or just to have as a little treat!          Other people have said that they are good in small doses, but I wouldn't want more than 5 6 pieces at a time anyway, or else I would weigh 600 pounds! These are perfect to have around for a little treat for the kids or friends. I will definitely purchase these again!
