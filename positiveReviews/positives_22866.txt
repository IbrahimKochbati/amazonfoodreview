It was a sad day when my elderly Maltese quit chomping regular greenies. . . He loved the taste, but he enjoys softer food, toys & treats now that he's older.  Senior Greenies saved the day!  He loves the taste.  I cut them into tiny slices so one treat lasts longer.  Keeping an older dog's teeth clean can be a challenge, especially if they aren't able to eat really crunchy food or gnaw on rawhides or bones.  Senior Greenies can help!
