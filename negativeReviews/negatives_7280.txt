Recenly purchased a 6 pack of these cookies because my 3 year old loves oreo's and had recently bought Country Choice at a local health food store and loved those.  Found Newman O's to be a few dollars cheaper and figured they would taste pretty much the same as the other organic  and.  Next time I'll pay the extra money for Country Choice Organic chocolate sandwich cookies.  I do like the fact that Newman's cookies are organic and have no trans fat, but they lack a bit when it comes to taste.  We'll finish our 6 pack but won't buy these again when there are other organic cookies out there.
