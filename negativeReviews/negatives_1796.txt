I ordered this item and was not pleased when it arrived, however the seller promptly contacted me to make things right. They refunded my purchase in full after requesting a photo of the item. Their response was quick and much appreciated. I will likely not purchase plants online any longer, however, if I do, I would not hesitate to consider this seller again mainly because of their customer service.
