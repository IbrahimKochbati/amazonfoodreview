Let's be honest. Nothing will compare to real peanut butter   more specifically, Smuckers All Natural (creamy or crunchy, they both go down smooth). I'll crush a 26oz jar in a week, so obviously I needed a better alternative. Definitely still has a peanuty taste, but... something is missing. I'd still recommend this to anyone who is curious about it. I need to try some of the recipes they have on their website.
