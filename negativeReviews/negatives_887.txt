My son would rather have no cookie than one of these cookies. The taste is okay. The texture is hard and weird even when microwaved. Short shelf life if you are buying in bulk. Not absolutely terrible but worse than average. Try Pamela's chocolate chip cookies they are wonderful, or try a baking mix.
