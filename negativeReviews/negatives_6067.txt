Beautiful pink and reddish color, exotic scent, very floral.  I bought this to make a chinese pickled cucumber dish, but 8 oz. of this product is a LOT of product.  I ground them in my mortar and pestle as per the recipe, but the peppercorn shells stuck in my throat and made me cough.  Next time I will take the time to remove the shells afater grinding.
