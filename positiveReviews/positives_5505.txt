I have been snacking on the crackers from this line, for a long time now, and someone suggested that I try these Sticks & Twigs. I love everything about them! I love the crunch and the texture of them, and, of course, I love the taste of them, especially with the curry flavor! They are not only delicious, but they are also very nutricious, with lots of protein and fiber in them. They make the PERFECT snack!
