Altoids wintergreen mints were once my favorite flavor of altoids. They had a clean, refreshing, decidedly strong rush of pure mint flavor. For years I enjoyed the intense, clean sweet flavor, as I bit into them. Unfortunately, Wrigleys (the new owners) have altered the flavor (more artificial ingredients?) and added blue artificial color to them. The mints now taste like cheap toothpaste, that leaves an unpleasant chemical aftertaste in your mouth. These once delightful mints are now ghastly! Let's hope the Wrigley's people with the uneducated palates don't mess with the Peppermint Altoids!  I will not buy these wintergreen mints again, unless they change back to the old style, which was full of natural mint flavor, and artifical color free.  If you are lucky enough to find a tin that does not list "color (blue 1)" in the ingredients list, you've found some of the old style wintergreen mints (the good ones).  The full ingredients list on the original good wintergreen altoids was (sugar, natural and artificial flavors, gum arabic, gelatin).  Since I wrote this review I've been fortunate to find about a dozen boxes of the good, old mints.  These were at small out of the way grocery drug stores that tend to charge a little more for their products.          July, 2012: Well, it's been a year since I've been able to find a box of the good, old mints.  I  oke down and bought a box of the new version today.  Wrigley's has added some of the natural flavor back to these mints, and they do taste slightly better.  However, they have left in the artificial color "blue 1", which negatively affects the flavor, and leaves  a bit of bitter aftertaste.  I won't buy them again.  I did buy 6 boxes of the Peppermint Altoids.  Thankfully, they are still the original formula, and as good as ever!
