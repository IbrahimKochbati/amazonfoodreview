Attention Low Carbers and Diabetics!!!          Yeah, I know.  You've tried other Low Carb products and most SUCK right?  I've been doing this for 12 years    I lost 160 pounds the first 2 years and then slowly slipped and gained back about 50 pounds over the last 8 years. Believe me, it doesn't take much to put it back on.  I never went back to eating full blown carbs    just more desserts, maybe a hamburger and fries here and there.  I am now back to strict low carb and the first thing I did was buy my wonderful Carbquik!!  Everything positive everyone said on these Amazon reviews is TRUE!!  I swear!  And the few negatives have got to be from people who are not EXCLUSIVELY low carb.  Is it expensive?  Not when you can finally have delicious biscuits or pancakes and a ton of other previously forbidden foods.          I've tried every low carb packaged food around.  It's actually a lot of fun experimenting but I remember some DOOSIES!!  I remember the Atkins Macaroni and Cheese product (10 or 12 years ago)  OH MY GOD!!  Soooooo GROSS.  I literally gagged and choked from just a taste.  That was the worst product I've tried and the rest of just not very good.  CARBQUIK IS AWESOME.  Buy it right now!!  Netrition has it for 11.99 plus 5.95 shipping so it is a much better deal.  Which is unusual for Amazon    they are usually the cheapest place.  I adore Amazon by the way!!!          If anyone out there reading this is hesitant to try low carb, please do yourself a favor and read Gary Taubes "Why We Get Fat and What To Do About It".  It will change your life!          Happy Low Carbing....
