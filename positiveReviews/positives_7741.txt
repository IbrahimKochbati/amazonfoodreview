1 and 1 2 minutes and the smell will make you run for a cold drink.  Open the bag and you are in bacon rind nervona.  Albite a bit salty...just cut down on something else because these things are excellent as is... If you rated these less than 4 stars you didn't follow the directions, that's all there is to it.  10 minutes later and they are STILL popping in the bag...in most cases they won't last that long.  PUT MORE IN THE BAG...
