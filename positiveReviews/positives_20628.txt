I started Weight Watchers in September, and one night while shopping I got to looking at soups and came across this. It is just one point per serving, so I figured I would give it a try.          Oh mercy.          I love (LOVE) this chili!! I have never added to it, I just stick to the tomato paste, water and mix. Sometimes I add a bit of shredded cheese (if I feel like spending the points ; ) ) and it's just delicious.          It's got lots of fiber, is just the right amount of spicy, and every bite is full of yum. Even though I'm watching what I eat for weight loss, to be honest sometimes I just want to stuff my face, and this fits the bill. It's tasty, it's good for me, and it's filling. I hope my grocery stores never stop carrying it!          The best, pure and simple.          Time for seconds!
