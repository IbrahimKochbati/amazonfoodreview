I bought Lucy's cookies because I saw them on Dr. Oz as a guilt free cookie.  I bought the oatmeal and I love them.  I am on Weight Watchers and I calculated them at 1 point plus each!  Wow! A 1 point COOKIE!  Needless to say I am eating them    but I am eating cookies and losing weight!!!  My husband is not on Weight Watchers and loves them too!  I want to try the other flavors so I will order them, but I will definitely re order the oatmeal this week!
