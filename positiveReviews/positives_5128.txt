I drink too much soda. I've started looking for alternatives and one of the things I've tried is switch. I first tried it because while it's like an orange soda, it's really carbonated juice.          I like:      The carbonation      The flavor      all juice      no added sugar, no high fructose corn syrup      no artificial flavors or colors          I don't like:      The small can (8oz)      The flavor took a can to get used to it. It's a mixture of orange, apple, tangarene, grape, and Acerola juice. (Acerola is a fruit high in vitamin C, so I assume that's why it's used.) If you don't expect exactly orange soda, the flavor grows on you quickly.          If I really want a cola, Switch isn't good enough to be my replacement. But it's a very easy replacement for an orange soda. I can't wait to try some of the other flavors. I usually really like black cherry drinks and I'm interested in seeing what fruit juices they use in that one!
