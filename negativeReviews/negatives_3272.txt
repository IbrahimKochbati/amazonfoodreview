The only reason for the 3 stars was the packets the individual teas were in.  I love this tea, I have the ones in the tin on auto delivery.  I was taking a trip, and ordered these so I could take some with me on my trip.  Prior to leaving home I took some out of the box and put them in my suitcase.  I got to the hotel and tried to open the little packages.  Impossible to open the individual packages.  No knife with me, I ended up using a toe nail clipper to open the individual packages of each tea.          Hopefully this was just a problem with the first box, but I would not recommend buying this tea in the boxes, go for the cannisters.  If you do buy the boxes have something near by to open each and every packet of tea.
