I'm not usually a drinker of flavored tea, in fact this is the only one I really drink.  I bought this Mango Ceylon tea several years ago at my local nature food store on a whim and I fell in love with it...(and so did my kids).  Since then the store told me that the flavor was discontinued, but I believe it was only discontinued by their supplier, not the manufacturer (thank goodness!).  I have bought this tea from other online retailers, but this 6 box package was the cheapest I could find this time around.  I'm glad its still available.  It's not overly fruity and the vanilla is a nice touch.          For your regular tea drinking I urge you to try Barry's tea from Ireland, the one in the red box (Barry's Gold) I believe is the best.          Enjoy your cuppa!
