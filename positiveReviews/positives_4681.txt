I recently gave up my major 20 year Diet Coke addiction.  I did it for a number of reasons.  I typically wake VERY early to hit the gym before work & needed something to help me wake up at 4:30 AM.  This product is GREAT.  No over stimulation as it only has the caffeine equivalent of 1 cup of jo. It is also SUGAR FREE and has 0 Net Carbs!! I do feel the energy quickly & it lasts the 5 hours it claims.  The berry flavor is pleasant, but tart so I drink some water as a "chaser" (no pun intended).  I drink water the rest of the day & only use 1 in the morning unless I have a "late" meeting scheduled.
