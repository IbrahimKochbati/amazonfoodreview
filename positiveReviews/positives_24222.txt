This Chai is so good.  It reminds me of powdered hot cocoa but I could also see paying 4.00 for something just like this in a coffee house!!  I love the flavor   it is a mild chai flavor.  Even though I watch my calories, I try to fit in one drink a day.  The value on amazon is outstanding!  I am on subscription and can tell I will need to move it up to a more frequent delivery increment!
