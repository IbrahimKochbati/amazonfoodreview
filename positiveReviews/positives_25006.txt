This product is a good tea substitute for someone watching the calories and cutting out sugar in their diet. Taste is close enough to  ewed tea if you can give up the real satisfying taste of sugar in fresh  ewed. I bought these mainly because the local grocery stores stopped carrying the tea flavor of Crystal Light. I'm not a fan of the peach taste but it is better than the lemon flavored.
