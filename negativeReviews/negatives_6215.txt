I cannot rate the product because I did not open the jar.  My problem was with negotiating the Amazon purchase.  Although I tried to get it sent to another address along with several other items, it ended up coming to me instead.  The shipping is killer.  So I want to warn those out there to read the email Amazon sends you carefully, or the same thing may happen to you next time you ship something to an address other than your own.  Next time I will buy directly from the merchant instead of going through Amazon.  The shipping was killer.  The 2 stars are for Amazon's shipping pages.
