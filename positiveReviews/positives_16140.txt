I want a decaffinated green tea and this is by far the best I have found.  The tea is blended to make it less bitter; I don't have to use any sweetner with this. Unfortunately, our local supermarkets seem to always be out of stock.  So, I was happy to find it here on Amazon, and at a signficantly lower price too!
