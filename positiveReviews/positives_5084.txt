They're not as compact as gels like "Gu," but these are great for marathoners.  I empty 2 bags into a small plastic baggy. I carry the baggy in a neoprene pouch.          I try to eat about 2 chews every 1.5 2 miles, beginning at mile 4.  Water to wash them down helps, but isn't a necessity.  Easy to eat on the run.  Good consistent and natural energy and electrolytes.  No stomach upset, which I always got w  Gu.
