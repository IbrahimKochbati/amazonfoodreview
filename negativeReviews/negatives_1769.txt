This is the worst flavored coffee I have ever tried.  There is no aroma or flavor of Chocolate Raspberry to this coffee bean at all.  In fact the coffee tastes sour.  I too am sorry I couldn't buy just 1 lb. to try it first    Now I am stuck with this awful coffee I cannot return.  SO, BUYER BEWARE    NO RETURNS!
