I bought this "flavor" and the raspberry pom and while they are consistent, it's useless.          If you plan on making a pitcher of tea, forget it, it takes 4 packs for 64 oz and is still very, very weak in flavor, and it must be consumed in 12 hours (so they say) so you're much better off  ewing your own.          However, if you're idea is to "stash" this in your purse (for the ladies) or pocket (for men, which would be weird) it's still misses the mark. One packet does very little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you'd have to use two, and WHO drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature? Also, with only 8 to 12 packets in a box (depends on flavor, who knows why?), that gives you 4 to 6, 16 oz drinks for $3. Not sure it's worth it at all, I'd rather drink lemon water when out than this.
