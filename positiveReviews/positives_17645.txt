This little bag of coffee was surprisingly good. Strong and earthy, it packed the good wake up punch I hoped for with none of the acidic feel in the following half hour.          The coffee is very finely ground, so less is needed for the drip percolators.          It tastes like it is prepared roasted with care  none of the lackadaisical flavors of cheap coffee in this  and.
