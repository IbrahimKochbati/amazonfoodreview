My new friend arrived with quite a bit of damange and only 2 heads, one crushed, I was so upset, but I put the moss back into the pot snuggly around the base of the plant gave it bottled water and plenty of sun and now, I have 12 heads and a very strong plant! He bounced back so well! Eats flys and is now  ight red and green!
