I LOVE the taste of ginger in any form, and have never before had an adverse reaction to a non sugared sweetener. That said, this is the worst tasting ginger ale known to humankind.     There is no ginger taste whatsoever. The only taste, initially, is that of smoked meat    similar to that of bacon. To add insult to injury, a split second later, an overpowering bitterness invades one's mouth, tongue, and any other digestive body part that comes in contact with this vile concoction.
