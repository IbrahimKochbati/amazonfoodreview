So glad I was able to find these on Amazon at a good price. My local store stopped selling these in this molasses flavor & these are the healtiest biscuits around due to the limited ingredients (only 5).  My dog loves them and I know they're not filled with a bunch of fat or salt. I will be re ordering when I'm low again. Everyone's dog should be eating these for a treat instead of the grocery store junk.  Petco sells Buddy Biscuits, but not this flavor and they are REALLY expensive there & Trader Joe's used to sell these, but now has replaced them with their own store  and of buscuits in which you can SMELL the fat & salt (too bad).
