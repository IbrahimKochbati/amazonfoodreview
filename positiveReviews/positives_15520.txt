The local places want around $40 for a small bonsai like this, so this was a great deal. I wasn't sure how they would ship it to me and have it survive, but it did. It was packaged nicely and arrived before the estimated delivery date! I would recommend paying the few extra dollars for expedited shipping, just in case. It is a great starter tree, and I will get others in the future to make a collection.
