In fairness to the product itself, I did taste it and it does taste good. However, I couldn't get over the fact that there was no safety seal or tamper evident seal. I know I'm probably too paranoid, but in this day and age I like to see some type of safety seal on products I'm going to consume. I think that there should at least be a button that pops up when you open the bottle. But that's just me. The order came in 6 bottles. I didn't return them, because the next buyer would have absolutely no evidence that I opened one of the bottles. So it's a loss to me. Oh well, I guess it's one of the risks of ordering from the internet, not being able to inspect the packaging before purchase.
