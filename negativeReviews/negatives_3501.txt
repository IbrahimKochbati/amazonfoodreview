Well, where to begin.          First, I have been drinking tea (green, black, oolong, white, etc.) for more than 15 years as either loose leaf (whole leaf) or bagged. My number one love is green tea ... specifically Japanese Sencha. I have consumed many grades and types of steaming (mild, medium and "deep"). I have also tried many of the products offered by "Two Leaves and a Bud" by way of Whole Foods (who do not offer this).          This is the first offering by Two Leaves that I sadly have to say is dreadful. Before you think I'm a jerk, let me say that they offer some awesome bagged teas. This just isn't one of them (IMHO).          The orange that they add KILLS all of the beauty that the Sencha could potentially offer. What's worse is they suggest a steeping time of 4 minutes. Ludicrous. Most mild steamed (which this is) or medium steamed Sencha's steep for no more than 3 minutes. Four minutes will produce an acrid bitter  ew unless the Sencha is a superior grade (which this doesn't appear to be).          Even after steeping this for about 3 minutes, the taste is still overwhelmingly sharp & "bitty" (just a weaker sharp). I can not believe that the people at Two Leaves have ever had a good cup of loose leaf Sencha. I can't. If they have, they wouldn't offer this.          I can only assume they add so much orange to it because the Sencha grade is poor. Otherwise, why not sell it without the orange flavor like the wonderful    "
