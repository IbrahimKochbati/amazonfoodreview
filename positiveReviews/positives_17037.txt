I have two friends who have gotten this for their dogs and the dogs absolutely love it.  The bottom unscrews making it easy to put treats in.  Small kibble works best.  My Rottweiler doesn't really play with it, but I think it's just because it bangs against the hardwood floor and the noise scares him.  I'm going to try it outside once the weather gets nice.
