Ingredients: carbonated wated, cane sugar, caramel color, caffeine, Brazilian guarana, sodium benzoate, citric acid, natural and artificial flavors, red # 40.          If you can get past the skull and swords on the label, this root beer will go down nicely. You will get a buzz out of the caffeine and guarana in the  ew, so it's a good substitute for your morning coffee. Plus: it's made with nice cane sugar, not nasty corn syrup. One caveat, sodium benzoate is used "to preserve freshness" on this and many soft drinks; I read that it should not be taken with citrus. Enjoy!
