I bought the subscription to save money, hoping that the popcorn would be good.  I bought the 4 oz. to use with the Whirly Popper.  The first shipment of popcorn came extremely fast, within a day or two and I quickly popped up a batch to try it out.  It was delicious, light and fluffy and very good flavor.  Perfect.  I would highly recommend.  I'll probably buy a subscription for my popcorn loving sister in law.     I was very pleasantly surprised both with the fast shipment and the yummyness.  We will definately continue with the subscription.
