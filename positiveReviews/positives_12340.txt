I first started using Cavenders when I was in my teens, living in the Midwest. When I first started cooking for myself, I experimented making fried rice; my parents had bought a container of Cavenders, so I tossed some into my rice and fell in love. I've been using it ever since, now going on forty years. My wife and I use it in a wide variety of dishes, from simple casseroles to more complex fish & meat dishes  and I still love it in my fried rice.          If you haven't tried it, do so  you'll be glad you did!
