My cat really enjoys these pet greens. We need to  eak them in half for him or he finds it impossible to chew them. No big deal there though as it makes the bag last longer. I was floored on the huge price increase on these. In september 2011, I ordered these for 3.99 a bag and now in November 2011, they are 7.07 a bag. (same size bag and everything) Wowsa! Hoping that the price comes back down soon. ^..^
