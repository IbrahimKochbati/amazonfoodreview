Its  hard to find this Gyro Meat loaf. Once I found it I was instanly hungry for a Gyro Sandwich. I went to place my order and was pleased with the item price and then was hit with the shipping!!! Wow shipping was a little high. I figured it was due to the special shipping of meat. I think it took a little long and was not  to pleased with the shipping time. Over all the meat was great and I got my Gyro sandwich just  let down on the shipping.
