I used to always go to Jamba Juice for the Match green tea shots...after trying this iced green tea powder I was hooked.  This flavor is lightly sweetend and the raspberry and pomegranate flavors are just subtle enough to not mask the true flavor of the green tea.  I don't mind the funny green color...after all it's green tea.
