I bought this on a whim at my local grocery store, and to my surprise it is the best alfredo sauce I have ever tried!  It has a great texture, a little thicker than common store  ands, and a big peppercorn kick.  I've also found a lot of store  ands are a bit too "cheesy" for my tastes; this sauce is robust and deep without making your pasta taste like Mac n' Cheese.  If you're not a peppercorn fan, this sauce may not be for you, but otherwise give it a try!
