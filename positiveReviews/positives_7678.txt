These chicharrones are delicious, and the packaging is very convenient.  Just like microwave popcorn, the pork rinds come in a bag with cellophane around it.  You shake the bag to distribute the pork rinds, pop it in the microwave, and set the cooking time.          The optimal time for my microwave is one minute 45 seconds, but the time will likely differ from one microwave to another.          The only reason I'm not giving this product five starts is due to the MSG listed as an ingredient.  While I don't react badly to MSG it still makes me a little nervous.          If you're on a low carb diet this is a great choice for snacking or even meal replacement.
