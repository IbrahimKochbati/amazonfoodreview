These dried strawberries do taste good   indeed, they're addictive.  When I eat one, I usually end up eating several more.  But they're too sweet.  The sugary taste and texture of this  and of dried strawberries makes me feel like I'm eating candied strawberries.  This wasn't what I expected from the description.  I should have paid more attention to the other review that complains of over sweetening.  Don't buy these, unless you want to eat strawberry candy; buy another  and which lets you enjoy the natural strawberry flavor and texture more.
