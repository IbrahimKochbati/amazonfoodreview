This is the best of the Ocean Spray sugar free flavors, in my opinion.  Of course, one of my all time favorite flavors is peach, so this fits the bill perfectly.  I usually make up a 32 oz Nalgene bottle of the stuff, using two of the sticks, and try to drink 2 or 3 bottles a day.  It's not overly sweet, and has a strong peach flavor that doesn't taste chemical or phony.          Amazon's price varies, so keep an eye on it.  So far, it has stayed a little below what I would pay in the local market for this, and since I can have it delivered (and with Amazon Prime, I can get it fast), it's worth it to me to purchase in bulk like this.
