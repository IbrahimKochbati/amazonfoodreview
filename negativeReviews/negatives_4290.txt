This was not a good drink! I drank half of a can. After 30 minutes my hands were shaking out of control and my heart rate was elevated. I felt I had to get up and exercise so I wouldn't feel terrible, not because I had more energy. I didn't feel hungry and I had to pee every few minutes. I can't imagine what would have happened if I drank the whole can. I might as well have taken some crazy illegal substance, because the experience was not good!
