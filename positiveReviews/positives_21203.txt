I used to buy theses little gems at my grocery store but they stopped carrying them when they changes hands.  I went without, until I thought to check Amazon, and there they were!  They are tiny tablets that add a wonderfully smooth flavor to your coffee, or hot chocolate.  They have no sugar or calories and come in a very handy little tin (about the size of a Tic Tac box), suitable for carrying in your purse.  I keep one at my children's homes where I visit often. The 6 tins arrive on cardboard cards which stand upright in a molded plastic tray perfect for storing on the pantry shelf. Our favorite is hazelnut, but I keep all of them on hand.
