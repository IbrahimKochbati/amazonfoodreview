With the additional of the barley, the texture of this product is really nice.  Much better than plain oatmeal.  I personally like the dried raspberries and peaches and don't find this too sweet.          I cannot think of any other oatmeal that I would give 5 stars and I have purchased this product (in 6 packs) more than once.
