I ordered this last week and they were promptly delivered.  The Nutmeg seeds were a little smaller than those that I've used in the past, which I think is better because I can store 2 or 3 in my microplane nutmeg grater.  I tried this on coffee only so far and it was great, I ended up using so little that I had a lot left over.  I probably could have just run it across the grater two times and had enough for the mug of coffee.  A little goes a long way with these seeds.  I attribute this to the good quality seeds and also the effectiveness of the grater.          You know you have a good quality product when you open the bag and the strong fragrance fills the house.  I'm telling everyone I know about these because it is such a waste to use pre ground store bought nutmeg with very little flavor.
