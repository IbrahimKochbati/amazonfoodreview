This is very good.  A nice berry flavor with just a hint of kiwi, and very sweet even with no added sugar. The fruit flavors are strong, but very natural, without the unpleasant mouthfeel and aftertaste some fruit beverages can leave you with.          The carbonation is nice   it's not too bubbly, but just pleasantly effervescent.          This is a product I would definitely buy at a convinence store instead of a soda, but I had to take away one star since I think it is a bit overpriced for what it is.
