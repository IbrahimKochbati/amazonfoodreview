These vine leaves were far better than was anticipated.     Remember,this can is actually 4 pounds and six ounce per each of the two pack sale,so you are going to end up buying 9 pounds.     On sale with Amazon Roland promo code is good,without the promotion,wait...     One very important suggestion for anyone not familiar with these rice filled leaves,after you open the can,make sure to drain them very well.     Excess place into tupperware and all will be much better.     Am beginning to believe it would have far better to have drained the can and placed all into some tupperware to use the following day.     I had opened the can using them the same time after draining them and the taste was awful.     Therefore,consider my advice and instead open can,drain well,put into tupperware and use the next day as the flavor was wonderful.     Lastly,make a point to buy all Roland items when on promotion.
