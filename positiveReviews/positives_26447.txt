I have purchased this product before as my dogs' vet highly recommends enzyme chews to maintain dental health. I have 2 older beagles. The male's gums are in worse shape and he doesn't like to chew anything, so I soak these chews for a few hours and then he will chew them. The female loves these chews and devours them. The chews aid in  eath freshening and tarter removal, but I also use an enzyme toothpaste periodically. As our pets live longer we must do more to help them maintain a healthier life style. My only negative comment is that the chews in the same bag come in many different sizes and thicknesses. (Neither of my dogs like the really thick pieces.) I would prefer a more uniform size as the prices and amounts for the same  and vary so much.
