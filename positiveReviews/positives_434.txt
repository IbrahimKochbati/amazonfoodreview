These chips are VERY GOOD!! I couldn't stop eating them. They didn't last very long.          The reason I gave them 4 stars, instead of 5, is because I think the bags are a little hard to open. I'm not sure why they need to make a potato chip bag that sturdy, you may need some scissors on hand to open them much easier.
