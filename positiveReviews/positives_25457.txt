My husband and I trialed this powder as adults, and we found it quite tasty when blended into smoothies. I highly recommend it as a nutrition "booster" for smoothies, particularly for picky kids. The ingredient profile is awesome.          There are just a few reasons why I would purchase the Berry version over this one. The chocolate has soymilk powder, and we try to keep soy consumption low (the berry version doesn't). I didn't really like the taste of the chocolate when simply added to water, it needed more. In general, we liked the flavor of the berry a bit better, and the berry version has both prebiotics and probiotics in the ingredients, but the chocolate doesn't.          Nonetheless, if you or your child is a chocolate fan, you really can't go wrong with this awesome superfood mix!
