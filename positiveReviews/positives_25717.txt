My son has an OCD thing about food texture, and he has always hated nuts, so I didn't expect him to like these cookies...even with the chocolate. I was shocked that he enjoyed them so much!          When it comes to something like cookies, I could care less about how "healthy" they might be; I just want a treat that everyone in the family will enjoy.          We'll definitely be having these again.
