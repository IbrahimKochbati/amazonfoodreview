I've been eating this for several months now. It has just enough sweetness. The protein and complex carbs make it a very healthy and lasting snack meal.  It's also great on toasted whole grain  ead.  I'm no oatmeal connoisseur, but among the three or four instant varieties I've tried, this blows the rest out of the water.
