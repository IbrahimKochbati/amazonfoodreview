I ordered and got this the next day. Planning to make vanilla for Christmas presents [...]). There were 70 beans in my package   THATSALOTTABEANS   I split it with a friend because I don't think I know 70 people who love to bake. . . On their own, they smell somewhat like raisins, but in the package, the smell is heavenly. Crossing fingers that the vanilla works out! but at what, 40 cents a bean, I haven't lost much and the price is so much better than the grocery store, where I looked at 2 beans for $12.
