I got these for a 3 month old 4 lb Havanese puppy because her  eeder had given us one (I thought) that has lasted a couple of weeks.  I just gave her the puppy chew and I was shocked when she had a 1 inch piece in her mouth  which I quickly took away as a choking hazard  in less than 10 minutes.  I now believe what the  eeder had given me was something else that looks just like these puppy chews.  Maybe it was an edible dog chew.  This chew is not long lasting by any stretch of the imagination!  I should add that my puppy really enjoyed it for the 10 minutes.
