This thing is actually tasty if you can afford it. Each bar costs more than 3billion people in the world's daily income (which is 2 dollars a day). So if you cool with that, which I am, I'm American I have to be. Get the bars. Otherwise your spending you hard earned money for processed food, which is behind that 2 dollar a day income. I haven't seen a superfood bar with better ingredients. Treat your body right for a change with snacks. Like i said, if you can afford it.
