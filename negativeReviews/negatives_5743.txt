The shipping was shabby. The gumballs were in a plastic bag that was stapled. There were LOTS of crumbs in the bag, too. I guess I expected something more professional. Looks like they were packaged in someones garage or back shed storage unit. These are TRULY MINI MINI gumballs. I was quite shocked. These are teeny tiny. Not what I expected. Finally, there are not 800 as described. This is not an item as outlined in the description. If it weren't such a hassle, I would return them and order from another vendor.
