The biscuits are delicious as expected. I was surprised by how poorly amazon packed the 6 packages of McVities in the box  they were just thrown in with 1 or 2 plastic air bubbles on top. The ends of each roll of biscuits are a bit bashed so some of the cookies are totally crumbled, but most are intact. Just don't expect careful packing and you won't be disappointed.
