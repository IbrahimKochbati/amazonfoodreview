I have a commercial type popcorn popper in my man cave garage. I entertain a lot. I have tried to measure out my own popcorn but tired of that, so started buying Northern Popcorn packs a number of years ago. It always pops perfect and tastes great. Its always a hit. I highly recommend. OH, And if you want less salt, just cut back on that portion. I tried other  ands of packets and they were way too salty. I personally like the recipe Great Northern uses. Keep poppin' my friends.
