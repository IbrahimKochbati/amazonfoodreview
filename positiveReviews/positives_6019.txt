My husband and I love these chips   they aren't very salty and the strip shape makes them great for dipping in salsa dips.  Two of my favorite things about these chips though: 1) when you open the bag, the bag still looks pretty full unlike many other  ands where the bag look half full at best when you open it 2) there aren't ever very many  oken chips.
