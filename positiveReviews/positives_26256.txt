These Kitchen of Indian meals are great for a quick and easy meal. They are not as good as going to a very good Indian restaurant, but they are close enough to give you a satisfying fix if you love Indian food and flavors as I do. Just make a few servings of rice to go along with this and you're all set.          One of my local grocery stores actually sells these a little cheaper, but they never have carried the Navratan Korma flavor, so that's why I get them from Amazon. I also really like the Rajma Masala (with the red kidney beans) and the Palek Paneer (with the spinach and cottage cheese) flavors.          Whether you already love Indian food or just want to try something new, spicy and flavorful, I can heartily recommend this  and.
