It came adequately packaged. Lots of padding to protect it during shipping. Getting it out of the box and setting it up for first time use was not a problem.          I've been wanting to get of these since I used one at a doctors lounge. It's very convenient and makes very good coffee.          I thought of getting the CBTL Contata or Kaldi because they had a 220 volt version but they are both "plasticky" compared to this. The selection of capsules was limited compared to the number of K cups.          If you're buying it for overseas use, please make sure you get a stepdown transformer appropriate for 2000 to 3000 watts even though the unit is rated at 1400 watts.          This is easy to clean, requires minimal maintenance and is easy to learn how to use. I have 2 of these, one in the office and at home.          I'm not sure if it's just me but I think the reservoir needs to be a bit bigger. I've been refilling it quite often.
