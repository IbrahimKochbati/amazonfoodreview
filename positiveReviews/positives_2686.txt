I'm really baffled by the great differences of opinion on this product. I've tried a couple of different  ands and the Grove Square was without doubt the best. I recently purchased a cup of hot cocoa at a local Joe Muggs (in a local BAM store) that was over $2  for the smallest size and really couldn't tell much difference. Obviously every person has different tastes and opinions but so many 1 and 5 star ratings for the exact same product? Oh well, I like it.     p.s. 11 27  I like this cocoa well enough that I have subscribed to momthly delivery with free shipping and reduced cost!
