I have this tea around all the time as a treat.  It is smooth and sweet and is great when you are having a craving for something sweet.  Several months ago I stopped seeing it in our local grocery stores and missed having it.  So I checked out Amazon and was happy to find it here.  I was worried about purchasing a 6 pack, but I do drink one everyday and I drink tea at work all year long so it will definitely be used.
