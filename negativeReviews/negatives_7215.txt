I ordered this item because I thought it was freeze dried kinda like dehydrated, but it's not!  They taste like they were pickled and rolled in sugar!  Yuck!  The original strawberry taste is gone.  The company sent them to me very promptly and in great packaging, but I really thought it was something else...  The page does not provide a good description of what the product really is.
