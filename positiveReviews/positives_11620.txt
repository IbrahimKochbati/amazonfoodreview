I bought this product as a result of all the great reviews it got.  Trust me (and them), you will not be disappointed.  We normally bought a similar type product (i.e. organic, grade A, dark amber) from Trader Joe's and Highland Sugarworks' syrup blows it away for basically the same price.  Definitely try this one out, you won't be sorry!
