This product has a strong after taste of Crayola crayons!          I am in the process of trying different  ands of coconut oils for cooking purposes.  Upon opening the plastic container, the aroma of crayons immediately fills the room, and this flavor permeates the food that is cooked in it.          I suspect the source of the problem is the plastic used in the plastic container as I have not experienced this with any of the other  ands purchased.          To date, my favorite coconut oil is distributed by Barleans.  The flavor is fantastic.  However, they do not supply a gallon sized tub,and Dr. Mercola has the best product in that size category.
