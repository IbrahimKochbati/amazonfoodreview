I give my dogs very wholesome food. So when I give the occasional treat, I want it to be enjoyed by my dogs. Meaning, I want the experience to be motivating and rewarding. After testing this product on all three of my dogs, I think this stuff is too organic and wholesome for me and my pooches.          CONS   When I opened the bag, I noticed these organic treats were very hard. I couldn't  eak them up with my hand to give in little pieces or use for training. I had to give the treat as a whole biscuit. Also they were very fi ous looking. Much like those unappealing high fiber diet bars that humans eat when they're on some sort of regimented weight loss program. Also, I prefer my dog treats to be in cute shapes...bones, hearts, rounds, rolls, etc. These were just regular squares. And since the cookies were so hard, I was afraid the corners would cut the mouths gums of my smaller dogs.          PROS   If you read the label, the ingredients are high quality. They're the stuff I look for when I buy their every day food.          Dog tested: My big German Shepard, who usually likes chicken jerky treats (and won't eat anything that has a smoky flavor like Beggin Strips), ate her biscuits. However, she wasn't terribly interested and definitely didn't think it was treat. It looked as if she just ate it because it smelled edible and it was there. She didn't even wolf it down like she normally does with her treats. My Cocker Spaniel, who usually begs me for everything and is highly food motivated, took a sniff and and a lick but ultimately was not interested in these wholesome treats. As for my little Pomeranian, well it was too hard and big of a biscuit for him.          Even thought these treats are supposed to be nutritious and healthy, I only gave them 1 star because my dogs and I didn't enjoy them.
