With pumpkin being so hard to get, I ordered this not really expecting it to be much, I just needed pumpkin to make my pumpkin rolls. I make alot and sell during holidays and my family looks forward to getting them so I tried this and was amazed at the product. It was received in 5 days of ordering and not one can was damaged!!!. Much better that I expected. I will continue to order this from now on. It taste great and pefect for my baking.
