The idea is basically a good one, however, my large Papillon (all 20 lbs of her) could not figure this one out no matter how hard she tried.  Food is a HUGE motivate her but unless I helped her, eventually she would just carry this toy around and just give up.  I will say that the Tug A Jug had ME trained!
