Sure it says 'Oat' bar, but make no mistake these are indulgent and amazing. Proabaly better for you than a candy bar though. Just not a health food really. But I dont care. When youre having a down day or have earned the extra sweets this is now what I crave. Theyre that good. The right amount of sweet, the right amount of chewy. I do really love Coconut though, and enjoy the oat taste so if you dont, your mileage could vary. I havent looked at any other reviews yet, but I cant imagine anyone not loving these, assuming the price isnt an issue for you.
