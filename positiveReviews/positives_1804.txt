My dog had been prone to ear infections and did a lot of paw chewing when his vet recommended changing his diet because his symptoms may be due to a food allergy. She specifically recommended the salmon and rice formula. Unfortunately, my dog hated the salmon and rice and it smelt extremely fishy. I tried the lamb and rice formula and he likes it much better. I've heard numerous good things about Wellness from my dog trainer, as well as other pet owners and pet store employees. My dog is adjusting to the new food well. However, I can tell he doesn't consider it the most tasty of choices  probably because it doesn't have the artificial flavoring in it. But I'd rather him eat something much healthier even if we have to sacrifice a little on the taste.
