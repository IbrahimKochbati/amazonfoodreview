I love Quaker oatmeal and this is by far my favorite flavor.  I am a sweet food junkie and this meets my need for some sweetness without being overly sweet.  Plus it is done in two minutes in the microwave.  Typically I used skim milk and water mixed together to make it, but recently started making it with almond milk, just to boost the positive benefits.  It sure taste great.  I have always loved oatmeal and the convenience of these packs makes it faster for me to enjoy.
