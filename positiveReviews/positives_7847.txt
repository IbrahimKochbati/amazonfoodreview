I love these things.  I used to be able to get them at Wal Mart and a couple local grocery stores.  Now I have a hard time finding them  but they are available through Amazon.  I like all kinds of Pork Rinds  but most of the ones you buy in the store  already made  have a high fat content.  People on a low carb diet can eat any kind  but if you are watching your fat intake, these are an excellent alternative.  I always include them in my diet  they are not the most filling snack  however, a bag usually satisfies your craving for a salty snack.  I buy boxes of them at a time from Amazon so I never run out.
