We are a small company that does BBQ 6 days a week. We were purchasing BBQ sauce monthly for the buisness. We bought about 24 bottles a month. Two months ago I found it on Amazon.com for ALOT less expensive. I have now ordered it 2 months in a row. I logged back on this month to do my monthly purchase and I went onto my previous purchases and clicked onto the link...I than found the BBQ sauce went up quite a bit and the shipping is now almost doubled. Same seller as before. I dont get it. How is it the pricing goes up so much from one month to another. Last month I paid $50.40 with shipping and handling, this month I am expected to pay $84.10. How did that happen?
