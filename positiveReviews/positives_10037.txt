This coffee produced a dark and rich cup of coffee that tasted great.  I found this stuff to be ground a bit fine    more along the lines of espresso than something I would put into my regular coffee maker, and way too fine for my press. I'd give it five stars except for the packaging: I've opened hundreds of bags of coffee in my time, but this is the first one that I pretty much destroyed.  The bag is sealed along each of the corners to make a seam at each edge and those seams don't like to come apart.  Unfortunately, the remaining opening was too small to get my tablespoon inside to get the coffee out, so I had to rip the sides out a bit.
