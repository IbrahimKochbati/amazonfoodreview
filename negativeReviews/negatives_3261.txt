I ordered these without having tried them before  I tried a similar product made by a different  and (possibly a slightly different flavor?) and loved them, so when I saw these I thought "yes!" and ordered the bulk pack.     When I tasted them, however, my stomach said, "no!"  These are disgusting.  I repeat: disgusting.  They taste like ketchup, mustard, LOTS of sugar and EGG.  Which mixed together tastes like vomit.  Say, what you might expect after eating cotton candy and a corn dog and an omelet and then riding the tilt a whirl.  I have tried them several times to see if it is "an acquired taste" but, for me, it is not.  These make me nauseous every time.  Too bad.  I really wanted to like them.  Anyone want 4 and a half bags of this?
