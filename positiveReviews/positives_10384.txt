Tea samples came with the Keureg  ewer, and when I tried them I was pleasantly surprised.     They surpass anything in a tea bag and when I want a warm drink at night, the decaf tastes excellent too.          I just bought a new box...I'm really a coffee drinker but this tea is converting me to a tea drinker!     Diane     Ohio
