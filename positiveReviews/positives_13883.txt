Excellent, mixes well in a protein shake and tastes just like a jar of peanut butter!     The only problem with ordering it from Amazon is they have an obvious pricing mistake, I can get this from other websites for $3.99 a jar, even if your an amazon prime member and get free shipping here, you will still save a lot ordering it elsewhere.     You can even get it from the manufactures website for much cheaper.     I called the company and the suggested retail price is approx. $4.00 per jar.
