i have two medium sized mutts and buy the extra large chews to cut up into smaller pieces (some can be cut with scissors but some are too thick and must be sawed). the dogs love them and they each get a piece as their nighttime snack. they still do get plaque and tartar but i imagine without these chews the buildup would be much faster. also, one of my dogs eats these a little too eagerly and tends to choke a little on them, but she is always able to get it back up to chew it more, so this does not worry me too much.
