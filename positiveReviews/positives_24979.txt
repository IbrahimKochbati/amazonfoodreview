My dog is a picky eater, and this is the only glucosomine product that he likes.  And he is always begging for more.  (But I am careful to limit to his daily allowance.)  It really seems to help his hips.  I have been buying Happy Hips for a long time, but I am so glad to find it on Amazon, as it is much less expensive to buy it in the 3 pack!
