This agave nectar is great for so many uses, and it imparts practically no flavor of its own, just sweetness.  I add a teaspoon to my coffee every day.  I also use it heavily in baking vegan and sometimes gluten free.  Another nice feature of agave nectar is that it dissolves into cold drinks as well as hot, unlike honey and maple syrup.  I like to buy it here because it is a LOT cheaper than my local grocery store.
