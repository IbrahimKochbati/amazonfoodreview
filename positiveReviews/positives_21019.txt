The taste is good. The calorie and other information on the side of the can is encouraging. I would have to try this for more then one draught to truly gauge its value but so far so good. No price point on this yet but if it is at about $2.00 per can or so it would be a good value and purchase in my opinion. I plan on trying this for a week or so later to determine if it will be part of my long term plan.
