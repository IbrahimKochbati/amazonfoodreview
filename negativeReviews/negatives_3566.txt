There are many other reviews that go into great detail regarding calories, ingredients etc.  I will not repeat that info here, but will limit my comments to taste value "worth it" factor.     I thought these tasted just ok.  They would never be my first or second tier pick for a snack.  They are too small for meal substitute and contain too many calories for a snack for anyone watching weight.  I found the mouth feel of these to be unpleasant.  The taste is ok...none of the individual ingredients shine.     p.s. Someone with a chip on their shoulder has gone through the reviews for this product and given almost everyone of them an unhelpful feedback  and this includes a huge variety of detailed reviews.  I like to believe this is not someone from Pamelas as they are a good and reputable copany.  But, in all my reviews and looking at other reviews I rarely see this happen...weird...and if this person has the energy I feel sure tney will slam this one also.
