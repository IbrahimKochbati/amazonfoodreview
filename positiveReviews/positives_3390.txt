Ghirardelli isn't the finest chocolate you can buy, but it's pretty good, and the Intense Dark Assortment is both inexpensive, and provides you a few possibilities.          I've lately taken to unwrapping a 60%, 72% and 86% cacao square for each dinner guest and setting them on an individual saucer, to serve as an after dinner sampler with red wine or Scotch. That's been a pretty popular approach. A similar approach also works "therapeutically"   if someone's having a bad day, sitting them down with a small assortment of increasingly intense chocolate isn't a bad path to feeling a little better.          I do wish that there were the same number of each in the bag; that's the only downside. Of course, if you really want the sets of three to serve to guests, you'll have to go through the tiresome task of somehow eating the extras. Darn.
