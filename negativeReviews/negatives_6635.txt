I so wanted to like this product as we drink alot of coffee, and the French Vanilla is our favorite. Despite this being a huge bottle, and thinking it would last a long time, and being that it had less calories, I wasn't impressed.  You had to use 3 4 pumps to get the creamy texture, and that old vi ant French Vanilla flavor the refrigerated kind has, so you end up getting more calories and the product is used up faster, making this not a good value.  Still, this shelf stable product is a quick fix for those that have never tried the refrigerated kind. Give it a try, you might like it.  It's not bad, it's just not the refrigerated kind, which in my opinion is the best!
