Both my Maltese and Chiweenie pup really dig these greenie's. I  eak the teenies in half for the chiweenie to spare the money.  Just like the people food, the healthier, the more pricey. But they do like these and would rather the greenies than anything else. 2nd time purchasing from here and shipment is quick and easy.  I am a student prime member  FREE FOR A YEAR!
