I used Meyenberg Powdered Goat Milk with my first litter of pups five years ago, and was very pleased with it, so made sure to stock up before my second litter was born.  I supplement the mother's food with it, and mix it with ground puppy food to make a puppy gruel to transition the pups to puppy food.  The pups and their mother seem to love it, and have suffered no digestive problems at all.  It dissolves quickly in warm water and is convenient and easy to store.  I recommend it as a nutritional supplement for nursing mothers and pups both.
