Our dog gets pumpkin in every meal    if yours does too, you know why.  You also know that one can only stash so many cans of pumpkin, and that somewhere in the spring most supermarkets start running out of canned pumpkin and can't get more or stop ordering it (understandably).  So, I was happy to see this product on Amazon.          Unfortunately, as other reviewers experienced, many of the cans arrived dented. In fact ALL 12 CANS were dented, most severely so.  Thing is, unless Amazon wrapped the cans to the case flats, this was not an Amazon issue.  The case pack was well buffered in a larger box that was completely undamaged; neither the shrink wrap nor the flat were damaged; and even the inner cans in the case were bashed up.          This clearly indicates that the manufacturer    or whomever wrapped the cases    shipped already and obviously damaged cans.  I checked the product listing and there is no mention of these being seconds.  My message to manufacturer, distributor and or Amazon: check the product or change the description so people know they are taking their chances.          Thankfully, Amazon customer service came through with an offer to replace or refund.  I'm giving this one more shot for my dog's sake, and will hope for the best.
