Let me tell you that I was totally impressed with the ingredient list on these treats.  The first thing I always do is check out the crude fat content and the ingredients to see how good this will be for my baby.  I have a Toy Fox Terrier and the last thing I want to give her is something that might cause her to get sick.  These cookies are quite big so you will need  eak them up and they are a bit on the hard side but Max loves them.  Just in case you don't know, one of those little cheaper cookie treats is equivalent to a large Snicker's bar to a toy dog  eed.  That's far to much sugar.  They are pretty much all natural so I'm able to give her something I would not otherwise.  Newman's makes wholesome good for aniamls products and that should be your main concern when buying.  They are a bit more expensive but worth every bit when it comes to the health on our baby.  Better than having to worry about vet bills with using cheaper dog products.
