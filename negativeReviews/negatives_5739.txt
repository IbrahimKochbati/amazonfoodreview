I am a bit disappointed. If I had to choose again I would have purchased the Palacios  and. It has a better taste, and better consistency.     This one is Cantimpalo style, but not close to Cantimpalo at all. I would call it Chorizo Mediocre instead of Superior. I wish I could say something better, but I did not like it.
