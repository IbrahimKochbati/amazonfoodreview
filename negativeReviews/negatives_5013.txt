This is definitely more challenging than a tricky treat ball or a twist n treat saucer, and our 55 lb pit mix really enjoys it.  However, it should not be used on hard floors.  After only 3 weeks the entire top is completely cracked, and it's only a matter of time until the entire thing is going to be  oken.  Upon discovery of the cracks we started letting our dog play with this on the carpet, but it was too late; the damage was done.  We considered duct taping the top to keep it in place and all in one piece, but it was too difficult to try to get the kibble in to the little space on the rope end.  We will probably buy another one of these since it is so much for for our dog, but I wish that it was more durable so that he could play with it in the kitchen on the tile floor.  Allowing him to play with it on carpet   lots of vacuuming of the kibble crumbs!
