If you love Pop Tarts, the low fat option is a great choice, they taste just like the regular ones. I got these with one of Amazon's special offers and saved quite a bit. I ordered these in January of 2009. The expiration date on the bottom of the boxes was November 2008! I guess that would possibly explain why they were on sale.
