We usually give our dog regular Milk Bone treats.  He's a 6 yr old, 100 lb mutt who is quite set in his ways.  I wasn't sure he'd take to a new treat.  I was wrong.  LOL          I tried to give him the first one, he sniffed it and walked away.  I thought "well, I'm not suprised."  I DID get suprised, however, when he came back, picked up the treat off the floor and ate it.  Then he stood and stared at me until I got another one.  He took that one right from my hand.  He NEVER takes ANY treat from anyone's hand.          After he ate the 2nd one he waited for yet another!  I told him I'd give him another one after he goes outside.  He stood and waited for another 5 minutes before he finally went and laid down.  Then the cat stole one from the bag.  LMAO!
