My family drinks a lot of coffee and they also love french vanilla creamer.  We were paying about $3 a bottle, and had to buy them every couple of days.  We tried the concentrated pump and it is a lot cheaper in the end.  We buy a pack of two every couple of weeks.  I don't drink coffee, but I have actually used it in baking, and it works great. The pump does leave some in the bottom, but my son just cuts it off, and uses what's left. I only wish that they had Amaretto flavor.
