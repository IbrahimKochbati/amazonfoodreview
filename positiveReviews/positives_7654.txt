When I read the reviews, I noticed someone mentioned the box was light.  It is, but it holds a lot   these pork rinds are compact; they expand when cooked, so there's a lot more in the box than it looks like.          As snacks go, these are high in protein and low in carbohydrate.          I think this is a really good value, and these are very flavorful   I especially enjoy them with bean dip.          The only thing that I'd change is, I'd like a lightly salted version; I don't always want that much salt.
