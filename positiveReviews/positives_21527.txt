I always find the Maple & Brown Sugar more tasty than making plain oatmeal with maple syrup and  own sugar myself. Why is that? Regardless, these instant oatmeal packs have been a staple  eakfast for numerous camping trips    just add hot water and it's ready to eat. I tend to stick to the plain quick oats in the cardboard cylinder for most  eakfasts, but I occasionally splurge on these instant packs for normal weekday  eakfasts as well. It's fast to prepare and keeps me feeling full for a few hours.
