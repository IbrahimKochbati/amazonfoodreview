Both of my dogs, including the one that eats dirt off the floor, were unimpressed with these treats. The resealable bag is nice, but if the dogs don't eat the treat it isn't very helpful.          If your dog does like these treats, it is convenient that they come in large wafers that are prescored to  eak in half for smaller dogs.
