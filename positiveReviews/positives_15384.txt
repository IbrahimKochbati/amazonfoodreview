I have 2 "picky eater" cats. They aren't really fans of canned food, particularly my male cat, but they are on canned food through a recommendation from my vet. Picky as they are, both cats will actually eat this and appear to enjoy it. I have this on automatic shipping and it is so convenient not to have to go to the store and deal with the possibility of the store being out of stock or not having enough for me to stock up. This is a pate food. The smell isn't horrible either, which I am sensitive to when it comes to canned pet food. All around great product!
