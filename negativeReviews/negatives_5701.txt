Google "propylene glycol" to find out why.  I bought this product, along with several others, without running the ingredients by my wife first (a nurse of 30 years) she     was surprised when she noticed it.. we went a googling, and poured my $50 order down the drain afterwards.  There's "pure" and then there's "not so much".....
