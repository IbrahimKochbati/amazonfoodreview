I originally ordered two teas from Art of Tea   the Silver Needles and the Coconut Creme. When my package came in, they had shipped the Coconut Creme and mistakenly bundled it with this Mandarin Silk tea by accident. I contacted Amazon and they refunded the Silver Needles and told me I could "dispose of the Mandarin Silk Oolong as I saw fit." Well, since I'm never one to turn down tea, I chose to dispose of it by, well, drinking it.          This isn't a bad tea, first off. I don't have too much experience with oolongs, but I do like the flavor of this. However, I don't taste too much of the mandarin. It almost tastes sort of like a straight green tea, and it has a similar light green yellow color. I drink it with a little honey.          All in all, it's a decent tea. I don't think I'll order it again, but I'll certainly finish off this tin.
