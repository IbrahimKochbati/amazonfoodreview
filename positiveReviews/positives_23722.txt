I was sick of spending $1.25 per bag from our vending machine at work, and just don't have the self control to buy a big bag & ration it out.  I was thrilled I found these on Amazon as are so much cheaper to buy in bulk, and since individually wrapped keeps me in check for portion control. I love this flavor & now I'm stocked up for a few weeks, & will definately order more when I've eaten these.
