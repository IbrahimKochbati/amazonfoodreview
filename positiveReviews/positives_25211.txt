My family (myself, husband, toddler daughter) gobble this syrup up.  In the right syrup, we prefer Grade B over Grade A (which has nothing to do with the quality) because we like a more maple flavor (Granted, some syrups are bad no  matter what grade. This is not one of them).  This syrup has an amazing dark caramely aroma and a clean yet very full maple taste.  I am so glad that we don't need to use a lot for each pancake or waffle so that it lasts longer!  I also use this to make granola or add it to plain yogurt for a healthy snack.          Past reviews have compared this to table syrup, also known as imitation syrup, such as Mrs. Butterworth's or Aunt Jemima's.  Please know that these two products are nothing alike and therefore really can't be compared.  It's the ol' apples and oranges thing.          I hope you will try this syrup and enjoy it as much as we do!  We treat it like a bottle of liquid gold in the fridge.
