Of all the K Cups I have purchased so far, I like this French Roast the best. It has a really bold taste even used with the large cup button. I like other coffee selections too, but this one really stands out.          I consider myself an early adapter and the Keurig coffee machine is one of my best purchases. Although the coffee is somewhat expensive at $.40 .50 a cup, there is no waste, no pot cleanup, and, best of all, great coffee. I usually get up earlier than the rest of the household and can have my great coffee almost instantly without making a full pot that can go sour before all being drank.          I notice that regular retailers such as Target and grocery stores are now carrying K Cups, but buying online costs less and is more convenient. pjs
