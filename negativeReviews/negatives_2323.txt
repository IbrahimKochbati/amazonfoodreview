I've tried this with multiple foods, at different times, and with anywhere between one and three tablets, all held on different areas of the tongue. While I could swear there were minor changes at low quantities, this didn't change no matter how many were tried. I'm sure that the Miracle Berries are authentic, but my friend and I didn't experience anything as incredible as people say, or even anything noteworthy. I would go for the actual fruit next time.
