I've been using the Madhava organic blonde sugar now for about 2 weeks.  I don't use a lot of sugar on a daily basis but I have used it in my coffee and tea instead of my usual agave syrup and used it on some hot cereal.  I found that I needed to use a bit more of the coconut sugar to get the drink food up to the sweetness level I like, but all in all it tastes fine.  I don't know what the glycemic index is of the coconut sugars but that data would definitely determine whether I continued to use it more regularly (since I seem to need to use more).  I tried the darker coconut sugar too and will review that on the relevant page.)
