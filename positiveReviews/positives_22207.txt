I found this to be a little too doughy if I followed the actual directions. Here's what I did for a crispy, delicious crust every time:          Roll out as directed.     Place in oven (at temp on package) for ten minutes, without toppings. I used a pizza stone.     Flip the dough over    so that the top, slightly crispy side is now the bottom    and then put the toppings on.          Best gluten free pizza dough I have tasted yet!
