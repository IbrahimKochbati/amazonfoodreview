I ordered this product online because it's small and can easily fit into my backpack.  I use it as a substitute when I go out and there's no artificial sweetner substitute either in restaurants or when I go to friends' places.          This product is very handy to have in those times as I have diabetes and I have to be careful about my blood sugar.          Definitely recommend it highly.
