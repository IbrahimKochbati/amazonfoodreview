This is hands down the best tasting k cup hot chocolate available.  The Cafe Escapes or whatever the  and name is tastes very watered down and artificial, while this one tastes thicker and milkier.  I love the dark chocolate flavor, although if I didn't know it wasn't dark I probably couldn't have told the difference between it and a regular cup of cocoa.  I will stick with the flavor just because it will probably be richer than the milk chocolate option.  These are such a hit at my house when the weather is cool.  Everyone always wants hot chocolate!          Something to note on this is that these work much better when used with about 6 oz per k cup.  I use 2 k cups per mug and the flavor is much better than when I try one (too watery).
