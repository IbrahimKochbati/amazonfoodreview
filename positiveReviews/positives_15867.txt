My German Wirehaired Pointer had bad doggy BO.  It would return shortly after she was bathed.  My vet thought that it might be due to a food allergy, and suggested we try a food containing ingredients she had not been exposed to previously.  This Premium Edge food filled the bill, and it has reduced the doggy BO to normal levels.  The Amazon price for the food was friendly, and UPS delivered the heavy sack right to my door.  What's not to like?
