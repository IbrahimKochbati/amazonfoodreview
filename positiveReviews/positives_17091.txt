I love to challenge my dog with food cubes. The thing is great  most of them are way too easy and dispense the food too quickly. This one is perfect because it is a little bit more challenging, and there are ways to make it harder such as adding pieces into the jug to block the food from being dispensed (like a golf ball). Also, the bottom screws off so it is easy to load in the food. Many food cubes you have to load the food in little by little which is annoying when you are trying to feed your dog his entire meal in a puzzle cube~! I highly recommend this one ( i have 2 other puzzle cubes and this is by far the best).
