These treats are perfect for my little dog.  I tried the assorted flavors, and it was too much for his sensitive stomach.  The plan treats are perfect.  He's only 10 11 lbs, so these small treats are just right for his size.  I used to run out before I'd remember to buy more, so I am doing Amazon's subscribe and save.  No more worries about running out.
