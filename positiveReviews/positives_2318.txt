I haven't owned a portable fence for horses until now, but I am impressed and liking this product very much. Upon opening the package I was happy with the portability of the carrying bag, and shocked at how lightweight and compact this system is. It's a great accessory to throw in the trailer when taking the horses out, or just to have around in the event that we need a temporary corral for a couple horses. Once set up, it won't hold more than two of our horses comfortably. I don't think we'd ever try and manage to get 4 inside like the product advertises!          The instructions were surprisingly simple and it set up easily between myself and my husband working on it. I can see how this would be great to have for other animals as well (such as alpacas), but we only have need for it with the horses and have had success in containing them.  The step in posts are fantastically designed, the overall design makes the fence very versatile, setting up easily pretty much anywhere your horse an go.          We're very happy with it's design and portability and will get a lot of good use out of this system, I think!
