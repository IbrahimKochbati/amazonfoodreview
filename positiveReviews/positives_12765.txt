I'm pleased to see this oatmeal available on amazon since I can't find it anymore in my grocery store. It tastes great, and I have never been an oatmeal person. I like the quality  when I compare ingredients on this package to other quick oatmeal products, this  and has better quality ingredients. It is also vitamin fortified, which many other oatmeals are not. It would be even better if it had just a little less sugar  12 gr is kind of a lot, 2 1 2 teaspoons.
