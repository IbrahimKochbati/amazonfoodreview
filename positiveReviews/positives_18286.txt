OMG   these chips taste so good! I used to live in the UK and remember eating those delicious salt and vinegar chips. Flavor wise these aren't as tart and vinegary as those, but they have a really nice twang to them that's not overwhelming, with some sweet salty savory overtones. Texture wise these are light and airy. They are about 1 8 inch thick, like a mini rice cake though not as dense. They are great for dipping or eating all by themselves. The bag has just the right serving size. You don't feel too full afterward but they are definitely filling.          The only reason I gave them four stars instead of five is because even though they are natural, they aren't organic, and most non organic potatoes are GMO (genetically modified), so maybe not totally healthy, but definitely delicious!
