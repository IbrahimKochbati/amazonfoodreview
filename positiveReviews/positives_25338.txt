our vet dentist recommended these as part of a daily routine to help manage one of our dogs dental problem and mean we can spread out his frequently dental cleanings a little more.  He also said they are softer and won't  eak teeth.  I have 2 labs and they love these.  I don't let them eat them on carpet as I think they would stain.  So far they have really helped.
