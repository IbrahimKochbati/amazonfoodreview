I often find with decaf coffee to be somewhat on the weak side: not in this product.  The coffee had a strong grip, but not bitter, and had a smooth rounded experience when a creamer is used (note this coffee works well with a soy creamer).  You do not need to apply any extra heap of coffee to compensate for a 'decaf' option!  With such a strong grip, I would not recommend milk or low fat milk as you might as well drink it as is!
