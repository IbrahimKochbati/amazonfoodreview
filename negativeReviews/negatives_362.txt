I hate to type this, because there are so many people that really enjoy this product, but take a look at the ingredients in this so called "all natural" product.

Unfortunately, this is the new MSG.  Many people are still unaware of this fact and "natural" food companies are taking advantage.  It is a chemical flavor enhancer whose potential side effects are very scary.  Google "MSG yeast extract" for yourself, or check out [...].
