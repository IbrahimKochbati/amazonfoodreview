Got this for the office morning coffee gang, and it does the job. Its nothing exotic or special, but its a very balanced, relatively mild coffee that goes well with donuts and whatnot. And for the price that I got it for ($12 shipped for a 3 pack) it cant be beat. We used to have Peet's and various other coffee but most people prefer Starbucks; but whether it actually tastes better or its just the hype I dont know  P.
