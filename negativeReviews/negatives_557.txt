My top line advice: If you want coconut water with a touch of pineapple, get the Vita Coco, not this one.          Size: The size is 8.5 fl oz per package. I didn't pay close attention when ordering, and expected the larger, 11.5 oz size. Not a big deal, and was my fault, but it's a little too small to be useful.          Taste: Ick. I love coconut water. I love pineapple juice. I love lightly flavored coconut water. This tastes like none of the above. The flavor is sickly sweet (ingredients included added sugar), and with none of the nice mellow coconut flavor of other coconut waters I've tried. Might as well be a processed kids drink.          Alternatives: While I actually prefer O.N.E.'s regular, unflavored coconut water over other  ands, the Vita Coco coconut water with a splash of pineapple is far superior to this one. It comes in a larger package, doesn't have added sugar, has more vitamins and nutrients (this one is diluted with sugar water), and tastes like you're drinking it fresh on the beach. This one is just...not great.
