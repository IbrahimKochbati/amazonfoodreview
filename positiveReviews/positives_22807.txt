I used the artisan directions on the back of the box and was disappointed was it was pretty flat out of the oven, probably only an inch thick. I wasn't sure what to do with it, but then thought of crostini. Drizzled with olive oil, pepper, garlic salt and Parmesan cheese made it so delicious. I think I'll buy it again, just so I can make crostinis again.
