My Danish friend recommended this product, he said all kids in Scandinavia grew up with it.  Well, knowing the food quality and safty in Scandinavia, I ordered it right away. and I am happy with it, especially about the ingredient part: almond, wheat syrup, water, salt. great. no strange words, easy to understand, no chemical terms that makes you wonder.
