I like my coffee good and strong. I'll pay more for the good stuff. I got a sample of this for my husband.  We both tried it. The flavor is not so great, in my opinion.  My husband said it was ok.  He didn't mention that he felt better after drinking this coffee compared with other coffee.  I'm giving it a couple of stars for the possibility that it would help people that find coffee too acidic. I don' think we will try this again.
