This is good coffee, but nothing to write home about.  I like the grind, which is finer than most ground coffee, although I prefer grinding the beans myself.  It has a bold, but not bitter, taste.  Even though I'll stick to Eight O'Clock as my coffee of choice, this one certainly isn't objectionable and is better than most cups you'll get at the diner.  And it's certainly better than Folgers, MH, and other grocery store  ands.
