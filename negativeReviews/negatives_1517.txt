I didn't read the label before I tried the drink, so I was a little surprised by the carbonation.  It had a tangy flavor which was possibly enhanced somewhat by the carbonation.  However, I've been a long time drinker of the Tropicana Orange Tangerine juice and Switch is simply not as good, IMHO.  If I wasn't already a Tropicana drinker, I might be interested in the Switch version of Orange Tangerine, but I'm not going to "switch".  Sorry for the pun.
