The only reason I purchased Van Houtte's Creme Brulee was as a gift for my daughter in law.  I had tried another flavored coffee by V.H. and wasn't impressed. But with the Creme Brulee they out did themselves.  Not only do my daughter in law and I love it, my husband and son who usually make fun of our 'sissy' coffees like it too.
