Honey Stinger Peanut Butter 'N Honey are THE best tasting energy bars out on the market!  I use them on 70 80 miles bike rides and they provide enough fuel to power me through my long rides.  The taste is awesome...almost like a candybar (think Butterfinger)...and they sit well in my tummy. I wish more stores carried them locally, but to be honest...Amazon was the best price that I found online, for a box of them.
