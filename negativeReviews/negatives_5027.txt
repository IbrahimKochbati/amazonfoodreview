My parents have a Carolina Dog who is not a big chewer. She loves this toy, and it keeps her occupied for a while. Seeing how much she loved it, I decided to get one for my 1 year old beagle. Within an hour or so, he had the rope completely chewed up which takes away the real intention of the toy. He still plays with the bottle itself, but there's no point in putting treats in it because they just fall out. This toy is not for hardcore chewers.
