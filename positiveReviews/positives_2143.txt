I adore this chowder because it uses natural ingredients and not harmful fillers like MSG and partially hydrogenated oil. Most importantly, this chowder tastes MOUTH WATERING GOOD and is bursting with flavor. I use whole milk and add a pinch of pepper, and this aromatic chowder is devoured in minutes. If you have not already, definitely give it a try.
