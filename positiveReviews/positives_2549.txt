OK   this is not the finest European chocolate.  BUT, you can make it in your Keurig and all 3 flavors taste good.  I've joined the "club" and get the lowest possible cost.  No charge to join and no effort to quit.  Why not?  It's nice to have when you're dieting, because it's just enough chocolate to keep you on track.  Non dieters will like it for the convenience.
