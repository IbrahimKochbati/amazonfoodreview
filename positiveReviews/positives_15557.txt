I ordered the wild hibiscus flowers in syrup to give to a friend as an engagement present.  The shipping was so much that I figured if I wanted to try them too, I aught to get one for me as well.  They came well packaged and in a very timely manner.  I tried them and they were good tasting and had a good texture.  It didn't seem like the flower bloomed very much in the champagne, however.  But it still looked beautiful in the flute and was fun to look at.  I would recommend these as well as probably purchase them again at some point, I just wish the shipping didn't cost more than the item itself.
