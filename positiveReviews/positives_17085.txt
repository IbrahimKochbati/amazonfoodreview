I have three dogs.  A grouchy old schnauzer, and two English Springer Spaniels, one of whom is 10 month old puppy.  Our puppy is, lets say...going through a very distructive stage. Our vet suggested toys that keep her attention for long periods of time.  We already had several kongs, balls, bones, etc.  LOTS of toys.  So, I saw this one and thought we would give it a try.  IT ROCKS!!!!!  It keeps her attention for HOURS!!!!!!!  TOTALLY worth the money.  In fact, I am going to order two more, so each of the dogs have one.  I completely recommend this toy.
