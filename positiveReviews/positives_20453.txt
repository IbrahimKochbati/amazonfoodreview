My two La ador Retrievers give Cloud Star Buddy Biscuits five paws up.  Let's be fair   if you have dogs like mine, no treat is turned down.  But they get a little extra excited when I offer them a Buddy Biscuit.  I like the all natural ingredients and the variety of flavors that Buddy Biscuits offers in their line.  I also like that they are shaped like cute little ginger ead men and look cute in a clear cookie jar on the counter.  My dogs like the size, the crunch, and apparently the flavor.  When we get a new shipment of Buddy Biscuits using the Subscribe and Save feature on Amazon, they know immediately that it's for them and practically do flips until they get one.  These are definitely a staple in our dog pantry.
