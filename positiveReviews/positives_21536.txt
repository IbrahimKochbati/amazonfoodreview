Oatmeal is said to lower cholesterol and benefit the heart. That's one thing to like about Quaker Instant Oatmeal. This particular  and    Maple & Brown Sugar    also claims "whole grains" oats, no trans fats, and no high fructose corn syrup.          That's all good. It also tastes good, heats quickly, and has good consistency whether one uses milk or water.          Yet it's not perfect. It's not as healthful as pure oats (of whatever  and), by which I mean no ingredients other than oats.          This one contains various "artificial flavors" and chemicals. That includes caramel color. I heard a radio report claiming that some people now believe that caramel color may cause some cancers.          So check whatever you buy for caramel color. Lots of  ead and cereal products contain it. In this case, I suppose the caramel color is to help create the " own sugar" look for this product.          The ingredients actually list "sugar," but not " own sugar." Maybe it's all the same, but loses its  own color under certain conditions, hence, the use of caramel color.          This is still a mostly healthful, and tasty product. But look for oats with nothing other than oats if you want the oats' maximum health benefits.          If you still prefer buying one of Quaker's "flavored" instant oatmeals, I suggest one of the Cinnamon flavored ones. Cinnamon is said to stabilize blood sugar levels and help prevent adult onset diabetes. Cinnamon is more healthful than Brown Sugar.
