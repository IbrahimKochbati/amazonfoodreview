I gave these product 4 stars because our 2 schnauzers (med & small) loved it. However the snacks are extremely hard. Our med size schnauzer was able to finally  eak one up and he enjoyed it thoroughly.  But our smaller schnauzer couldn't even think about trying to eat it. My husband wet the snack and  oke it up for her    she loved it.          Since both my dogs responded positively with this dog snack, I highly recommend it    but for med to larger dogs.          The ingredients are organic and the humorous story on the back of the packet about Newman's dog is very funny.  I can't wait for Newman's dog's tell all book.
