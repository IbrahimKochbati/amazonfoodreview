Original Review: My favorite thing about this cat food (besides that it's good for my cats and they love it) is how you can actually tell that it is REAL chicken and REAL veggies. There is no second guessing, it doesn't even look like cat food. Love it!!          *Update: I have 4 cats and I have noticed that after switching to Fussie Cat food their fur seems to have lost the natural oils which give them the 'shiny' healthy look. I looked this up and it could be from poor nutrition. I'm a bit disappointed.          I found that adding some Omega 3 drops to their food helps. I tried switching but they really like their Fussie food. :P
