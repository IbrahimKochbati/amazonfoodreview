This tea rocks! I tried it first at work and before long, so did everyone else and they have YET to restock our shelves with this, thus, me coming to Amazon.com and buying in bulk for myself and everyone else who pitched in to ensure they had some too. Its a tasty flavor and very smooth. Only bad thing is that this particular flavor s NOT sold in stores. I add some creamer and some honey and it really boosts the flavor.
