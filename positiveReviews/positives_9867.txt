I love mangoes and I love matcha, so this is the perfect combo for me! However, this isn't your plain old mango tea taste. The mango aspect is quite interesting  it's not juicy mango flesh, but more like... you know, when you're cutting a mango and there's some flesh left after you peel it so you scrape your teeth on the rind to get it all? You get mango flesh, but also some rind y goodness as well that adds a woodsy, almost tangy taste. Well, that's what the mango is like here! Rind y. It's kind of nice, quite different from other mango teas I've tried.          There's also a hint of citrus, a lemon y quality. It goes well with the matcha, whose grassiness really adds to the mango lemon tastes. Refreshing, great iced!
