Oh, I really wanted to like this chocolate milk. I love white chocolate and I could not resist the idea of having this K cup as a special treat from time to time. Unfortunately, it is nothing like a chocolate milk. The colour is pale white and the taste is like pure sugar. If you like the really, really sweet stuff this is for you. But it is definitely not a chocolate milk. I prefer the Swiss Miss K cups, although they do not come in white chocolate...
