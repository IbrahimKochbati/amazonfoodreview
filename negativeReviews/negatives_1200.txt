I Wish They Hadn't Changed the Formula for the Yuban that was sold up until about 2 years ago. I even contacted General Foods and asked why they had reformulated their coffee and they told me they were going back to their "original" formula from many years ago. Why? They had a great product and now it is no better that any other dark roast coffee on the market. Yuban was a special treat. Now it is just ordinary. I still like it for everyday coffee, but it sure isn't what it used to be. Formerly, I even preferred it to Starbucks, but no more.
