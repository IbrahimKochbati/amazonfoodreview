After buying my Keurig, I've done a bit of experimenting with different varieties of coffees available.  I've enjoyed other Newman's Own products, so this one caught my eye.  I was disappointed.  I'm not sure how they came up with "Extra Bold" in the name, but I found it relatively weak.  I ended up drinking a couple, saving one or two for potential guests that might like weaker, smoother blends and gave the rest away.
