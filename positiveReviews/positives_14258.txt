If you've ever had a dark chocolate Kit Kat, you know how good they are and how horribly difficult they are to find. (If you've never had one and you like dark chocolate, you must try it!). So, I was quite pleased to see that I could get them even it if meant having some white and milk chocolate coming along for the ride.          But, if you're expecting an equal share of each variety in the bag, you'll be as disappointed as I was. Each bag has 50% milk chocolate, and only 25% dark and white chocolate varieties. Boo!          Still, it's an opportunity to satisfy the craving for a dark chocolate KitKat. Since these go in and out of stock quickly, if it's available, you will want to order it promptly.
