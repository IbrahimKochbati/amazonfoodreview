So fishy that our cat is all over this the moment I cut the packaging open.  The smell is very strong.  My baby did not take to it.  It is our cat's food now.          Their other products are much better, but this one is way too fishy.  It doesn't smell pleasant when you go out to a friend's house or restaurant.  If I just wipe the spoon and bowl without washing after feeding this and put it back in the backpack, after I get home the whole thing reeks.
