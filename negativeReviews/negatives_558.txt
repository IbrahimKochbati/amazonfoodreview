I wanted to try this juice as I'm a big fan of coconut flavoured products.  Given that it claims to have a "splash of pineapple", I was expecting a light pina colada flavour.          On opening the package, I could smell the hint of pineapple, and I'd say the taste of pineapple is a bit stronger than the coconut water.  Probably because I've mostly tasted coconut milk and not water, I'd say this was nothing like what I expected.  It's not bad for thirst quenching, but it wasn't my favourite drink in terms of taste.
