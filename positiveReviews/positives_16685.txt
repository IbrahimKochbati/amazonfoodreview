The fur kid loves these & vet has commented on how clean her teeth are for a seven year old.  They're pricey, but for a once a day treat I think they're worth it for keeping her teeth in good condition, not to mention seeing her big grin when we open the container.  We should've named her "Greenie" because that one word gets her attention like nothing else will.
