I am extremely happy with this product. I used it to add a little fire to my salsa and was not disappointed! Be careful if you get any of the undiluted extract on your skin as it does not easily wash off.  The oils are persistent and if you rub your eyes, etc. you will likely feel the burn.  If you want a  utally hot sauce, this is the one to use.
