In one of the reviews of the Yogourmet incubator someone wished for a yogurt maker that was more like a toaster.  They wanted to put the milk in and take yogurt out.  This can almost be done with the Yogourmet Machine and the CBA culture.  Here's how.  Purchase two quart boxes of Organic Valley Whole shelf stable milk.  You find these not in the Dairy case but out on store shelves.  Then purchase a package of Organic Valley Non Fat dry milk.  Are you good with this so far?  The only tricky part is warming the shelf stable boxed milk up to 77°.  I took a big cooking pot and put it in the sink and set the two closed boxes of milk in the pan and filled it with 80° tap water.  Around a half hour later the milk was the right temperature.  I ran some scalding water into my Yogourmet batch container for a mini sanitize and to warm it slightly.  Then I added the two boxes of shelf stable milk.  Into this I mixed around 3 ounces of powdered milk using a hand mixer.  Verify that your milk is the correct temperature and put 4 ounces of the milk into a cup and mix in the two packages of the CBA starter.  Now pour and stir this back into the batch container and put the container in the Yogourmet incubator and add sufficient 77° water around the batch container and plug in the unit.  In 12 hours you will have your yogurt the easy way.  No heating, no cooling just making Yogurt the easy "like toast" way.
