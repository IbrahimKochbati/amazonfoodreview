This is the best gluten free  ead mix I have found.  It is simple to make using a  ead machine,(it can also be made in the oven).  Although the  ead does not rise as much as I would like it to, the slices are more than large enough for an adult sized sandwich.  It holds together without toasting, no crumbling.  It stays fresh for several days, and freezes well. I found that using 1 less tablespoon of water than the recipe calls for improved the quality of the  ead.
