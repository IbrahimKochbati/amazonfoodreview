Having lost our German Shepard that we raised from a pup at age 12 to heart disease a couple of years ago we are always interested in products to help our new dog live a longer and healthy life.  When I saw this I was impressed with the healthy ingredients in this snack.  When it arrived I began to open the package and Bella, our black lab, was sitting ready and waiting for what morsel was coming her way.  She eagerly accepted the treat and carried over to her favorite spot to chow down.  We watched in anticipation as she inspected the treat.  Finally she decided it was worthy of her pallet and ate it in a few quick bites.  We were enthusiastic at her acceptance of the treat as she can be very finicky.  However, a few days later, after receiving a daily helping, we notice she was leaving the snacks unfinished.  Perhaps she quickly grew tired of them or maybe she just decided to be finicky, but whatever the reason I now have my doubts that this will become one of her favorite snacks.  But, iF you want your dog to live a long and health life it is certainly worth the price to see if your pet will like them.
