This tea actually tastes less 'spicy' than other chais, so the name is almost a bit misleading.  It could be described as more mellow than bold.  But, don't let this deter you if you favor bold teas. The complexity of this tea really works!! It has a wonderfully well balanced and pleasing flavor.  The additional herbs give it an added complexity not found in most chais and even a hint of sweetness. For maximum flavor I recommend steeping this for the full 6 minutes suggested. And, be sure to use two teabags if you're using an extra large mug. Love it!
