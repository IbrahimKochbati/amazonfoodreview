Bought these wondering how hot they'll be.. The habanero flavor is hands down the hottest potato chip I've eaten. I'm one who lives for the spice so ive grown madly in love with them.  Definitely would recommend if you like the spice. For those who thinks products like Tabasco or tapatio or siracha is hot, this product is not for you. Very nice blend of heat as its actually a bit sweet if you get through the bag.
