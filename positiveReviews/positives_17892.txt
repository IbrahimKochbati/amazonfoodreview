Okay, we're not talking "dining at the Ritz" quality here, with all kinds of subtle nuances being experienced during the course of eating your dinner.  But what you do get with Shake 'N Bake Original Pork coating is a way to turn a merely adequate dinner entree into something with a little zip.          My plain old pieces of boneless pork, with minimal preparation and cooking time, were turned into something crispy and tangy.  Pair this off with a simple sidedish, string beans maybe, and you have a perfectly satisfying and easy to fix weeknight dinner.  It also doesn't hurt that both calorie and carb counts for this product are minimal!          I definitely enjoyed my free sample of Shake 'N Bake Original Pork coating, and will certainly pick up more at my own expense in the near future.
