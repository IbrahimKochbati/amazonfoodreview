This is my favorite Kitchens of India product. As others have said, it's lacking in cottage cheese and cashews, but it's delicious nevertheless. If you're going to eat it over rice (which I recommend), Indian rice is obviously the best, but I've eaten it over instant  own rice cooked in chicken  oth and it came out surprisingly good.
