My cookies were in such tiny  oken pieces ,they were useless. Upon complaint, a second mailing arrived several weeks later. The cookies were again in crumbs. The cookies were packed in  a box with a pitiful single air bubble. I gave this feedback and expected some effort to improve on the packing. But no, same packaging, same useless cookies.  Having enjoyed these Highlanders in the past, it was both a disappointment and a big waste of money.
