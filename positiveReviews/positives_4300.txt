I needed something that would last a long time. My dog cannot stop chewing, she has to have something in her mouth. She eats anything that she can get in her mouth. rock, plants,wood chips, walnuts, apples, grasses. These work really good. I'm order somemore on line here, petsmart quit caring them. I also found out that pork in better for your dog. Instead of beef bone or anything with beef.
