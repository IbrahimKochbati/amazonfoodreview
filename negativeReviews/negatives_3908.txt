What is supposed to be the purpose of this soda? "100% juice"  but not 100% of what's on the front of the label. Kiwi, raspberry, and strawberry juice concentrates are lesser ingredients; apple and grape juice are in the majority. And so what if it has 100% of the RDA of Vitamin C. So do a lot of other things. Is it possible to OD on vitamin C?          The bottom line, though, is no matter what the combination of juices is, it tastes like cheap candy. Not pleasant at all.
