Pkg says soy free. Ingredients (and my stomach bladder) say otherwise!     Also, lots of fiber in this one. If you can handle fiber (and soy) this food will fill you up like crazy. If you have IBS and have trouble with fiber,or are eating a low residue diet be careful....     I'm going back to the  ead. Eating a sandwich on it grilled is a fair substitute for the dreaded wheat...
