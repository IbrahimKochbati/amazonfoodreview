I realize that it is not quite healthy to guzzle 12 16 oz. canisters of liquid at a sitting, but this Switch Orange Tangerine flavored drink was so light and refreshing, and tasted so natural, that I could easily have downed another 8.3 oz can   or two. And that is the only reason this drink did not receive five stars   I wanted more and the little can was just not enough! It is the perfect size for a child, however   so perhaps that who the drink is targeted for. As an aside for those who prefer their beverages more adult oriented, this Orange Tangerine Switch would make an awesome mixer with gin or vodka   cheers!
