Well upon reading reviews of how this taste like a chemical I was completely skeptical of buying this. How ever I really, really like ice tea so I thought let me give it a try. Shipping was fast and I was eager to try this. I was also tired of buying that starbuck's sweeten black tea lemonade. This is not sweetened so I added a little sugar in the glass with ice so that it would be easier to mix with the hot tea coming out and I was right! I like it. But there is one downfall.... I keep going to the restroom thanks a lot tea!
