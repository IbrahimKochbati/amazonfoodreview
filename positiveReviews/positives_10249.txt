I purchased this when I was planning to make and freeze baby food for my daughter. What I like about them is that they are easy to pop after food is frozen, unlike regular ice trays. After they freeze, I just put the baby food in freezer bags and it's working great. Gave it 4 stars because they are a little pricey.
