We fell in love with Gaufre Liege during our first trip to Belgium. Since then we have had to wait until a subsequent trip or until family members could send us some pearled sugar. Now we have enough to make our favorite Gaufre here at home. Not too often since they are very rich but often enough to sate that craving.
