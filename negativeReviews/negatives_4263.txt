It tastes the same as the first original "International Instant Coffee". With a little sugar, it tastes ok but it's not smooth enough to call it cappaccino. Mostly I taste the powdered creamer. It would be ok to use as a base flavor to add other flavors in; especially if you added the same spices you use to make chai latte. A grocer around here would charge about $3.50 a can for it. I have to say that it tastes better than the House Blend they make for single cup coffee makers. I wouldn't buy this again though, and I'm not interested in finishing the can.
