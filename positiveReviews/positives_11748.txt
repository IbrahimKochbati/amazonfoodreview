I don't need to eat gluten free products, but I like oatmeal, chocolate and coconut, so I figured I'd give them a try.          I have to say I'm happy that people on gluten free diets have such a delicious option. It has just the right amount of everything and is a good, satisfying size. Nice chunkiness too. I did find them a tad on the dry side, so I had them with coffee in the morning and did a quick dunk to make them just right. It was a good  eakfast that carried me until lunch.          I will definitely be interested in buying them in the future, and will check out other products by this company.
