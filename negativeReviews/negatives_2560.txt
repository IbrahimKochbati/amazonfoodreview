I enjoy a good cup of hot chocolate on a cold day. This is okay. You can't expect much when when all you use is water. I would say it is a bit better than the instant hot chocolate packets, but not by much. What I like the best is the easy factor. I can let my 9YO make her own cup without worrying about pulling hot water out of the micro and spilling it all over while trying to mix it like you do in the packets. So for that alone its a great deal. Price is not the best, but again the convienience is key.
