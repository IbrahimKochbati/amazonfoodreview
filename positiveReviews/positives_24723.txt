I wasn't sure about this tea at first because I had tried several other teas that contained licorice that were just too sweet for me. However, I'm pleasantly surprized by the light, tangy flavor of this tea. The sweetness is there, but it's not overwhelming. I'm not certain that it's done much for me in relation to "detox," but I certainly like the taste, especially after lunch. It seems to settle my stomach and help me digest.
