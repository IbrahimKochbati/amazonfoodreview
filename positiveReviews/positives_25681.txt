I buy these as often as I can at my supermarket, as they usually sell out ridiculously fast. If SoH sold the honey mustard they coated these pretzels in, they'd make so much money they wouldn't know what to do with it. These honey mustard pretzels are really that good. My only problem is that once I open the bag, all the pretzels are gone (I inhale them). Damn them for being so tasty!          And finding them on Amazon is a steal, as these sell for $3 plus; you can just subscribe and save, and then oh so slyly, unsubscribe. You save $9 doing this, rather than buying 12 of these at $3 a pop at the supermarket. That makes this snack all the more satisfying. &lt;3
