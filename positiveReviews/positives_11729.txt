This "whenever bar" contains organic ingredients and is wheat and dairy free. It does contain eggs and it is sweetened with agave nectar, which is really not so good for those sensitive to sugar. To me this item tasted like "health food" cookies I've had in the past   pretty tasty but not really that healthy for you since they are high in sugar content and contain cooked oils. I wouldn't use these regularly myself but I found this much better than products that are full of refined ingredients like hydrogenated oils and corn syrup.
