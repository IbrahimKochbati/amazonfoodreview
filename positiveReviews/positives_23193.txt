So far, I've used this mix to make  ead, buns, bagels, pound cake, piecrust, etc.  It's the most versatile GF mix I've found and the taste is so good, my co workers have asked me for some.  It doesn't taste stale if you can't heat it and it stays fairly good for a few days just sitting on the counter in a Ziploc.  It works just fine using my Kitchen Aid mixer and my oven, I didn't need a  ead machine.          The suggestion on the package to add 2 TBSP molasses for a whole wheat  ead taste makes a good GF  ead great.  Also, I've continued using a tip I picked up somewhere to substitute 1 4 cup of ground flaxseed + 1 4 cup water for 2 eggs (more fiber, less fat).  These two things turn out a good  own  ead that makes a great ham & Swiss w  stone ground mustard.          Amazon Subscribe & Save has the best price on this product that I've seen.
