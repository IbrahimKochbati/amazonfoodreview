So I haven't used this to make a Liege style belgian waffle yet, although I'm sure its the key ingredient I've been missing, but the pearl sugar came fast and as advertised and came with a small pack of Penguin Peppermint Gum for some reason.          I also wanted to leave the recipe that's on the box here for those that want to try out their recipe which I've heard (but haven't verified) is awesome for Liege belgian waffles:          Ingredients:     3 1 2 Cups Bread Flour     1 Packet Dry Yeast     3 4 Cup Lukewarm Milk (~105 F)     8 oz softened butter (2 sticks)     2 eggs     1 2 Teaspoon Salt     1 Teaspoon Vanilla     Cinnamon (optional)     1 Bag Lars' Own Belgian Pearl Sugar          Directions:     Dissolve yeast in lukewarm milk. Gradually add all ingredients and the flour into the yeast milk mix except for the pearl sugar. Let dough rise until it doubles in size (approx 30 minutes). Add pearl sugar and fold in. Divide dough into small patties about 3 to 4 ounces each (roughly an ice cream scoop). Bake in a heated and greased waffle iron.          Serve drizzled with chocolate, fruit, whipped cream.
