my 12 year old sheltie has chronic  ochotitis, been on meds for three years, these help with the coughing fits at night. so I like them!!!      one bite and both my dogs are addicted!!! be warned!!! 7 pm both shelties are on my lap howling for the drug fix! I am a dog trainer and have never seen  anything like it....          three weeks later,, the beloved sheltie got a bowel blockage from these, use with caution.     if the cat gets too many she has the runs....     sheltie did better when i upped her thryoid meds, and gave her doggie asthma meds.     so it worked better for the 18 year old cat, who also has asthma.
