This is a great tea. Loose leaf tea is to tea what whole bean is to coffee. The first thing I noticed upon opening the can was the aroma. It was rich and full. The tea is wonderfully dried with consistently large pieces with some white tips evenly dispersed.          The tea steeps nicely with wonderful, but not overpowering, flavor with only slight hints of bitterness often found in Earl Grey. The Bergamot was not too strong and added nicely to this great cup of tea.
