I use this in combination with Baby's Only formula for my daughter. Unfortunately, due to illness, my milk production took a plunge when she was 5 months old. Although, it  eaks my heart that I can only nurse a little, I feel better using goat's milk (easy for baby belly's to digest). I add Baby's Only so she gets the vital nutrients she needs. If you are looking to supplement your child, consider using raw local goat's milk (if you are lucky enough to have it around). This stuff is great.
