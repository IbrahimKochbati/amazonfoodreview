We couldn't wait and cut the loaf before it was completely cool. No problem! The loaf was moist and tasted like real  ead. Maybe the flaxseed and coconut oil helped. The  ead was fresh for days right up until the last crumb was gobbled up. Sliced thinly, it makes great toast too. I'm not a fan of those bean flours and this  ead was much better than the others I have tried. At last a really delicious  ead mix that tastes like real  ead. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and added 5 tablespoons of ground flaxseed. I don't have a  ead machine and it was a bit tricky to mix with my old hand mixer but it rose beautifully and baked up perfectly. The smell of freshly baked  ead was wonderful.
