We ordered the salt and pepper version since they were on sale and we really like PopChips.  They were AWFUL!  Honestly, we couldn't eat them because they were so hot.  I would not have thought that "salt and pepper" would have been so incredibly heavy on the pepper.  Our mouths were burning and it wasn't a good burn!  We will continue to buy Popchips but never the salt and pepper variety again.
