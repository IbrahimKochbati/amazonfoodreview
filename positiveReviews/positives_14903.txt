pack of 6. this is delicious when put on top of chocolate cake. but i wish they had the tall tubs instead. either way though, i end up using 2 tubs, but im also making 2 cake mixes at a time so it makes sense. good flavor and creamy texture. fresh taste as well. i will buy some more because i ran out.
