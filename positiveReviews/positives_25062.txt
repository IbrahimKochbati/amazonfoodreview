my puppy lab has sensitive stomach, and she can't digest any food treats that are made with animal products, so I always read the label and make sure there are no animal products. This treat doesn't contain any animal products... It's made with Pumpkin, Oatmeal, Ground Brown Rice, Tapioca Starch, Vegetable Glycerin, Ground Potatoes, Brown Sugar, Canola Oil, Ground Oats, Mangos, Gelatin, Cinnamon, Salt, Natural Mango Flavor, Phosphoric Acid, Sorbic Acid (a preservative), Mixed Tocopherols (a preservative), Rosemary Extract.)     I gave her some, and she hasn't had any accident (diarrhea or vomiting) yet. sensitive belly approved!!     Also the mango flavor smells really good.. I was really tempting to try one, but i didn't.. lol          But why 4 stars? 2 reasons that I give this 4 stars although my dogs and I really love it.     1. It's only 5 oz.. It's about $1.4 per 1 oz. I don't mind spending money on good stuff, it's a lil bit pricy for me..comparing to other comparable treats that sell for $9 12 per a pound. (it's just my opinion)     2. Not good for training. They're little bit chewy for small dogs.. My dogs chew one treat for a long time.(about 15 20 sec) They're good for snacking though..          Anyway, although I gave this product 4 stars, I really highly recommend this for the quailty and deliciousness..
