I don't make a habit of eating gelatinous fruit snacks, particularly in the shape of  ain dead cartoon characters, but despite the traces of beeswax, these chews are actually quite tasty. I am pleased that they offer the US FDA recommended daily allowance of vitamin C, which I suspect would make parents favor these over other snacks containing a higher number of "empty calories."          I honestly didn't expect to like these very much, as I thought they would taste far too artificial. General Mills did an excellent job getting the flavors right. The orange flavor in the shape of Velma and the blueberry flavored Scooby are the most realistic flavors, though all are quite good. I wouldn't exactly call this health food, but these chews are great tasting and have essentially no fat, making them a good choice for a quick, light snack.
