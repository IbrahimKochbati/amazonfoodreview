These were the first "non bear" gummi I tried from Haribo.          The quality, price, flavor   exceptional. Even my reluctant DH went crazy for these little froggies. The kids 4 and 3, also loved these little guys.          The only minor downfall is that after 4 pounds you start to look at them and get a little "flavored out"   so I suggest sharing the joy cause our family of 4 just got a little apple weary. (but finished the bag anyway LOL!)
