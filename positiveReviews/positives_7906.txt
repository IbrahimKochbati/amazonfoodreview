Thought I'd take a chance on this, as my grocery store does not know about maple syrup grades (light amber is best).  Price is beautiful    grocery store charged as much for two 8 ounce bottles as this whole quart.  Shipping time was amazing    super saver in 1.5 days    and yum!  Reminded me that it's been years since I bought a 3 pound box of maple sugar candy...  Time to search again... &lt;grin      Forgor to mention    definitely grade "A" Fancy    not grade "B" (the cooking grade).        "
