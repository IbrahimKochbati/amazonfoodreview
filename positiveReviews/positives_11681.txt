Overall, this product was fine.  It tasted ok   not GREAT   but ok, and I felt that I would probably give this another shot to see if it is something that I'd buy more regularly.          Note: This product says it contains 180 mg of Omega 3 Fatty Acids.  This is good, but not as good as you'd think.  180 mg is the amount you'd get by ingesting 1 3 of a single capsule of flaxseed oil.  You'd have to eat three bars to get the same amount as a single capsule of oil!)          PROS:     + HAS FIBER  two grams of fiber, to be exact.  This is the same amount of 2 3 of a slice of whole wheat  ead).     + ORGANIC  this is always a good thing     + NATURAL SWEETENERS.  I really like the idea of using an Agave sweetener, instead of something artificial such as Aspartame.          CONS:       9 grams of fat.  Not a big deal, as it really only is the calories, but if you are watching your fat, too, then it is good to know.       Not as crunchy as I'd like.  Very chewy, and not at all crisp... kind of gummy, even, but not gross.          Overall, as a healthy alternative to something like a chocolate bar, I think it is a step in the right direction. Worth a taste because they made a great effort, but it probably won't rock your world.  I give it four stars for what it is trying to be, and for being ok tasting   not chocolate chip granola bar good, but decent.  HOWEVER, if you need a gluten free product (which I didn't, and which this is) then I would REALLY give this a shot.
