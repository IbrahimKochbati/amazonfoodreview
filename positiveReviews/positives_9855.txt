I am 78 and have been drinking coffee all my life. Began drinking Espresso in Italy in the 1950's. Each morning I make a double Espresso.That is my coffee intake for the day. I seldom drink 'regular coffee' as it is far too weak. We all have different taste but for me this is one of the best coffee's on the market.
