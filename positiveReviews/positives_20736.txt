I'm not really sure why anyone, especially an avid sparkling water drinker, would claim that this is similar to medicine in flavor or texture.          This is a nice product and I would highly recommend it to anyone   even those that may be weary of drinking sparkling water.          Personally, I've been looking for alternatives to sugary soda products, but I can't live without carbonation. I really enjoy is product because it's not sweetened and it is a convenient size to take in a lunch. Overall, this is one of my favorite sparkling waters. I would definitely recommend trying their other flavors as well.
