My grandma buy these HUGE plastic bins full of Folders ground coffee. Puroast tastes like the very last pot she makes from a plastic bin   weak, stale and bitter. My daughter is coffee connoiseur, so I gave her a cup, she took a sip and asked me where I managed to find such low quality coffee.          Going wihout coffee is better than drinking this.
