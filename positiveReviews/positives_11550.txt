I wasn't sure when I ordered these if I would like them or not.  (Especially after reading the product description and being someone who is practically scared of the words "fiber, "wheat", etc., basically anything that could be considered "good" for me :).  I was pleasantly surprised.  They are not too sweet, just sweet enough, and they are delicious.  So many different flavors and textures all at the same time.  I would buy again.
