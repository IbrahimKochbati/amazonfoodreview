I really like this protein drink. I'm pregnant and trying to increase protein in my diet without adding a whole lot of extra calories or fat. This is the perfect solution. I usually mix it with a combination of 1 2 plain almond milk and half water. I also usually add a little more liquid than it says in the directions, otherwise I find it too sweet. The nice thing is that it is sweetened with stevia instead of a calorie filled sugar of some sort. I prefer egg protein to other proteins because soy is often GMO and not recommended in high doses in pregnancy (or for anyone actually), and whey protein is a dairy product, which I generally don't tolerate well. Egg protein is perfect for my needs.
