I made "from scratch" Almond cupcakes from a recipe in a well known cupcake book (Hello Cupcake) and inadvertently used twice as much almond paste as the recipe called for. I frosted them with almond frosting and topped them with coconut. I have had more compliments on these cupcakes than even I could imagine! People LOVED the taste and everyone wanted to know how I made them. Great product. I love using almond in lots of baking and this worked great!
