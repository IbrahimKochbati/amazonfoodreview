I thought I'd finally write a review for others, since I keep coming back to buy this again and again. This black and green chai is my go to tea, and I enjoy at least a cup or two every single day. I'm happy that Amazon offers it, so every couple of months I can replenish my stash conveniently and inexpensively. My favorite way to drink this tea is piping hot with a generous dollop of local honey. Enjoy!
