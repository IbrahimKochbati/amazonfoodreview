Due to our cooking habits we use a lot of avocados in preparing our meals.  From Mexican food to salads and sandwiches and of course Guacamole Dip, they are an important part of our dietary intake.  The Guacamole dip is a favorite in our household and my wife has at least six different recipes she prepares it with.  We do though use and try out various prepared mixes such as this McCormick  and...which by the way, is one of our favorites. This adds variety and we do love variety! I can tell you right now that if I were grading this product on quality and eating enjoyment I would give it five stars in a heartbeat.          Unfortunately, I am giving this particular one a one star review and if it were possible, I would give it less.  Did you read the price on this thing!  I must tell you that the first reviewer here saved me a bunch of coin and a major temper meltdown.  Thank you Dutch for pointing the price of this product out to me.  I was actually ready to hit the purchase button on this one after I had added it to my shopping cart.  Thank goodness I had second thoughts and went back and read the review.  This product, when we purchase it at or local store cost around one dollar.  This is a somewhat reasonable price.  Did you realize that these folks are selling ONE PACKAGE (ONE OZ) for a total of $6.00!  Either this seller is trying a big time rip off or there has been a major typographical error here.  In either case there is NO WAY I am going to plunk out that much money for this stuff...as good as it is!          Anyway, the mix itself is quite good.  We use a lot of McCormick products and have yet to find one we are dissatisfied with.  But the price here is absolutely outrageous to the point of being offensive.          End of review but as long as we are talking about saving money.....          Did you folks know you can freeze avocados?  Yup, for dip and spreads freezing these things works perfectly.  I am not sure how things are in your part of the country, but here in our little part of the world the price of avocados goes through wild fluctuations.  I have quite often seen them selling for $1.50 apiece!  No there is no way that I am going to pay that much for one of these things.  On the other hand, we often, for one reason or another, find these things relatively dirt cheap.  I just purchased a whole bunch of the things for .32 cents apiece.          When we find these on sale like this be buy a great number of them.  We take them home, let them ripen to our taste, wash and dry them and then stick them in freezer bags...usually three our four or our family.  When we want to whip up a batch of dip or spread, we simply take them out of the freeze, let them thaw and we are in business.  After they have been frozen the skins simply slip right off and you can mush them up quite easily.  This dose not work if you like sliced avocados for salads or sandwiches as they are too soft and mushy. On the other hand, it makes great dip and spread.  We cannot tell the difference in the flavor of the frozen ones over the fresh.          Don Blankenship     The Ozarks
