I love drinking green tea.  It is delicious hot or cold, but being able to take it with me anywhere was key.  So I searched long and hard for an alternative to canned and bottled green tea which can be cumbersome, expensive and hard to come by in most parts of the US.  In the beginning, what I found was either too expensive, had sugar in it (which defeats the purpose of drinking green tea in the first place) or did not get very good reviews.  Then I found this product and quickly ordered it at the great price and free shipping.  I was pleasantly surprised.          The product works as advertised.  It dissolves quickly in cold water making it great to carry anywhere and it tastes great too.  The instructions say to use one packet for 8 ounces of water, but actually it should be used with 16 ounces of water, otherwise it can be too bitter.          It not only saves money, but has replaced my canned green tea completely eliminating the number of cans that I need to recycle monthly.
