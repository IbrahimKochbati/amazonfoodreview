This is all that I needed to make my condensor mic work! I have an MLX 990 and it works great with it! without this I was going to need to buy a preamp, and something that converted XLR to USB and a phantom power generator. This little thing does it all. It does exactly what it says it does, nothing more and nothing less.     I am not a professional recorder by any means I just wanted to set up a small studio in my room and be able to have my mic go straight to my laptop without having to buy a small soundboard. This might not work for someone who has a fancier setup than mine, but for my basic stuff it works amazing.          The only thing I was surprised about was the size. in the picture it looks like its really small, but its really like 1 1 2" round and as long as my hand. It in no way effects the performance or anything I just thought it was noteworthy.          If this was helpful please take a few seconds to hit the helpful button above.
