Have been using it for a 2 months. I must say that my dog needed a dental clean up with the build up that was leading to sore gums. In a few months of using it my dog's problem was gone. My dog's vet also agreed and was much surprised.          I am continuing to give this to my 100 lbs lab who happily chews this down. This is now the only dental product my dog will get.
