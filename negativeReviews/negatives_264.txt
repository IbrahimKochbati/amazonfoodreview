Buying this product seems to be almost literally like rolling the dice in a game of craps!          My experience with this seems to be similar to the experience of "Peter R.", unfortunately.          The price was excellent.  I ordered mine after the date of " J. Robert Bois'" positive experience   review was written but before the date of "Cindy 2366's" positive experience   written review.  I bought these & gave them to my Dad, as he *LOVES* dates.  I noticed when I was visiting him, the dried fruit basket was hanging around in his 'fridge a lot longer than any other date basket I had ever ordered for him.          Finally I asked him about them.  He said that he did not want to be rude to me or hurt my feelings but....  the dates, well, he was wondering if he should try & eat the seeds in the center & see if they were soft, because the dates themselves were hard as a rock & tasted stale.  I was mortified to say the least...  Then he wanted to know (jokingly) if he had done something to make me mad & I bought these for him as his punishment.  (No, but I had to laugh when he asked about that.)     Me personally, I have not tried them.  I will take his word for it!  :)          I told him to throw it away or put it out for the squirrels.  After a week of offering the dates,  I picked them up out of his backyard and threw them away.  The squirrels, opossums, & raccoons declined to dine on the dates.          It seems to be hit or miss with the "Broadway Basketeers Irish St. Patrick's Dried Fruit Gift Basket" purchase.          I will not say flat out "NO!  Do Not Purchase This Item, It is Not Good!"  That is a choice you will have to make on your own.  I just wanted to pass along my experience with the gift basket.          Thank Goodness I caught it when it was on special & did not have the full current purchase price invested in the box!  I would have been really sad then!          Amazon, as usual, did a fabulous job with the shipping, packaging, and they arrived quickly, in the time frame advertised   promised.          Best of luck & I hope others have better experiences than my Dad   I had!             "
