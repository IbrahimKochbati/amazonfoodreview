This is a deeper, richer, more gingery and rooty tasting ginger ale than you might be used to.  Give it a try!  I love it and it makes other ginger ales seem tasteless and watery.  The diet version doesn't taste diet y.  Also, Vernors for some reason keeps its fizziness longer than other sodas even after you've put ice in it.  If you like ice cream, vanilla ice cream in Vernors makes a really awesome ice cream soda.  Now I want one and I don't have any more Vernors!
