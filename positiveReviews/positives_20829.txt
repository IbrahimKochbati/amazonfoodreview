First off, don't listen to those saying they were not individually wrapped. I have gotten two boxes of these and they come just as pictured. It's a convenient store type display box.          I got the Spicy ones and they were great. Some of my friends and family found them enjoyable but a little hot for them. I love spicy so they were perfect for me. I liked them so much I have a box coming once a month!
