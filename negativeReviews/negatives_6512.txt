My dogs LOVE the taste of this PB Stuff 'N Paste and I like and appreciate the convenience of being able to add PB to their Kongs with no mess whatsoever. That being said, I went through an entire can of this stuff way too fast. The label says it's concentrated and to use it sparingly, so I did. The problem is, if you have large dogs like I have, you will probably go through a can of this in less than two weeks. It's too expensive for me so I'm back to using real PB in their Kongs.
