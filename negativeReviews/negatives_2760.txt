I had a good experience with other Amazon grocery products and these were a good deal, so I bought a three pack. They weren't horrible but they don't taste the same as the ones you buy in the store. They taste like cheap generic chocolate chip cookies. Which is not necessarily bad, but not what I expected for the price and Chips Ahoy  and.          They are cheaper tasting, a little stale and much less chocolate chips. I haven't had store bought Chips Ahoy for a few months so maybe they changed the formula for all these cookies, but if not, then these seem to be cheap knock offs made with cheaper ingredients.
