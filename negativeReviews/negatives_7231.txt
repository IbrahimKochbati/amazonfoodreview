I wish I knew the expiration date on this product before I bought it.  I don't drink this everyday so I will never finish the first can before the product expires.  Therefore I will have wasted my money since I will be throwing away one entire can plus the leftover from the first can.  It's such a shame.  I thought the price was a great deal but now I realize the seller probably wanted to get rid of them asap because of them expiring soon.
