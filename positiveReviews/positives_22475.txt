As a lover of popcorn, over the course of my half century on this planet, I've pretty much run the gamut on the variety of ways to eat this delight    over the stove, the air popper and then by nuking it. All were fads that faded over time. Then, through the greatness of Amazon, I found the Whirley popper, and ordered their popcorn to go along with it. It was great, albeit a bit expensive. Then I discovered Great Northern's Great American popcorn.     Not only was the Great American popcorn cheaper in price, but by comparison, the six ounce package I ordered was larger than the similarly packaged Whirley Pop at 5.5 ounces. The taste was probably about the same, although psychologically it tasted better to me because of the better value.     I probably went a little overboard, but thanks to the special 99 cent shipping at the time, I purchased three 24 count cases.     Each of these packages produces a whole lotta popcorn, which if not eaten right away, is still really good a week to 10 days later.     Just a great value for middle aged people who could use a little great tasting ruffage in their systems!     Gotta go; feel another batch coming on!!!
