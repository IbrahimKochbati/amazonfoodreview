We have developed into loving Indian food and have found a lot of the  ands on site have some inconsistent quality or taste.  Sanskriti has a just a great taste and freshness that we haven't experienced in the other  ands.          What I really like was the quality was great and the prep time was less five minutes for a great side dish and base for other Indian meals.          Highly recommend
