While these aren't my first choice for beans (local roaster makes the best!), I decided to try these based upon (a) the Lavazza name   usually equated with good coffees and (b) my experience with another Lavazza coffee (caffinated) from Amazon. My expectations were high, and this offering did not disappoint. The beans, while smaller than I'm accustomed to using, resulted in a crema which is very good, although coloring is more  own than golden. Overall, this is a flavorful bean, and produced a smooth espresso.          BTW, my coffee snob barista son said he really liked these...and that's praise not easily garnered.          I'll try another few bags before making a final decision, but would think most espresso lovers will find the Lavazza Gran Filtro bean to be a good choice for most occasions.
