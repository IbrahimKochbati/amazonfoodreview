I did not purchase this but received it as a Christmas gift.  It was wonderful!  My husband actually made the soup.  He followed the directions, added some ham and it was soup!  He did say that the beans seemed to get done quicker that he thought.  He would not presoak them as suggested.  It's a great gift that not only gives to the recipient but helps women in need as well.  I would highly recommend it and will be purchasing some myself!
