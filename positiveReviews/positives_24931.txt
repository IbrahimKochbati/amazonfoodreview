My little Schipperke could hardly walk in the morning because her hips hurt so much.  Even though she is only two, we worried that she would need surgery to get around.  We started her on Happy Hips and in less than two weeks, she was a pup again... running around and enjoying life.  And, she runs to the kitchen in the morning to beg for her "treat" because she loves the taste.  What a great product.  Thank you so much.
