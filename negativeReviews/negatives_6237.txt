My twins love oatmeal mixed with their food.  I couldn't find organic at our local supermarket so I tried this  and online and they didn't care for the taste (we managed to choke it down with smaller amounts mixed in), but I then found organic gerber which they love!  I can mix the gerber with a little juice and water and they love it.  I would not purchase this  and of oatmeal or cereal again.  The only thing good about it is that it is organic.
