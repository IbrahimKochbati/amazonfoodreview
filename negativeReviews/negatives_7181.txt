This mix makes wonderful crispy on the outside tender on the inside waffles however they were so sweet that by the time you put syrup or any other topping on it they get so sickeningly sweet you can hardly eat them.  Its like they put in too much vanilla or something.  To me the whole point of a waffle or pancake is that they be more of a plain base that compliments whatever toppings you choose to put on them.  They shouldn't compete with the flavor of the toppings.  With these being so sweet already it was just way too much.  Seriously, you could just butter and eat them with no additional topping.  Will continue to look for something more akin to original waffles and pancakes.
