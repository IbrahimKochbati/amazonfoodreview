I first purchased Paula Deens House seasoning at Big Lots and loved ,loved,loved this seasoning. When looked for more to purchas I looked everywhere and was thrilled to find the best price on Amazon. So I ordered 4 bottles. I couldn't be more disappointed to find the spices are not the same. The taste is not the same ....Why ??? If you make a produce that is good don't change it..
