SO excited about this food find that i've already e mailed 100+ friends and family about it!          in the past i would buy a bag of chicharron when i craved a taste   and eat at most 1 4 of it .. then when i needed a bit to top a savory filipino dish (pancit palabok or monggo), i'd find the bag had gone stale so i'd toss the bag and buy a new one to begin another cycle of wastefulness.          Lowrey's Microwave Pork Rinds to the rescue!! .. in 2 minutes or less, each bag produces crisp, not greasy, tasty chicharron   about 3? cups at a time, the perfect amount for me .. oh, and the expiration date on these bags is june 2011 so i'm set for at least a year, for $13 (in the past i've thrown out maybe one $3 bag per month?).          my mr. science hubby is so amazed with this product he's taking a bag to work today to show his techie guys (one is south american and gives us those huge chicharrones fried in a vat of oil by his mother in law; the other is muslim and doesn't eat pork ; ).
