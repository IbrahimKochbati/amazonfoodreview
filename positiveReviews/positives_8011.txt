My daughter has a severe allergy to dairy, so we have tried a couple of products, trying to get close to macaroni and cheese.  This was very easy to prepare, and while there wasn't a creamy sauce, the spice packet was very tasty.  My picky but food allergic 5 year old, as well as my husband and I, really enjoyed this product.  I got online today specifically to order this product.
