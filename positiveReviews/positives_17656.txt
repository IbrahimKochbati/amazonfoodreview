All the samples I received for review were of the same flavor,Dark French Roast. It tastes like a slightly bitter espresso coffee. I filtered the coffee the first time I made it, but it is better suited to an espresso maker, whether a traditional Italian one that goes on the stovetop or an electric machine.          The coffee has a rich, strong, slightly bitter taste   it is not mild like Sanka or a decaffeinated coffee.  I would not describe the taste a smooth, but it's not incredibly rough.          It did not irritate my throat. I was unable to test the acidity myself and when I received my review packages the vendor's website showed links to Dr Taka Shibamoto's site at UC Davis, known for its food research, who had tested the coffee. On the Puroast website the link to the research paper is missing. This concerns me.  The vendor has their own documents, with detailed analyses, on its website   which needs updating so it looks less amateur. I am not a food scientist or chemist, so cannot comment on whether the coffee has unique characteristics.          I did visit a gourmet coffee shop that sold a wide range of coffees from all over the world who said they had encountered some less irritating coffees with low acidity.  So when Puroast claims that its coffee is lower in diCQA acid than other coffees it is being compared with well known  ands like Starbucks and Hills.          The individual foil packaging keeps the already ground coffee fresh, tasting like coffee ground freshly from beans.  It definitely had a kick and woke me up. I drank the coffee I'd made with a packet big enough for a 10 cup carafe at 2 pm and was awake until 5:00 am.          If you have a sore throat from drinking coffee and like drinks made with espresso coffee then this is worth trying.
