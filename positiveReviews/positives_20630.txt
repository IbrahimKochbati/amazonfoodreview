You can add ground turkey to this and it tastes wonderful! I wasn't a big ground turkey fan until I tried it with this mix. If you don't have ground turkey, you can boil a chicken  east with skin in the 7 cups of water, then discard the bone and skin and add the mix. I've made it both ways and they're both good. I also tried it with ground beef but like it with turkey the best.
