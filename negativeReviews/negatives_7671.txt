So far four of the people in my family who have tried these cookies have not liked them enough for me to buy them.  I'm really glad I got to try a sample before I was tempted in the grocery store because Quaker is one of my favorite  and names.          The fact that they are portion controlled in a single cookie pouch is a plus if you want to make it harder on yourself to *accidentally* overeat sweet cookies.  Each cookie is 180 calories.          If you want to have something to pack in a lunch box or stash in a drawer at the office, these will remain fresh for quite a while.  My box has an October 25, 2012 best used by date    about three months at least.          Of the six packets in the box, four cookies were whole and two were  oken.  The cookie is soft but very dry which was interesting because the chocolate chunks melt on contact with your fingers.  The chocolate was soft, the almond pieces were firm, and the whole oat grains were slightly tough.  My first impression was dry with a sawdust like texture.          Overall, I would suggest having this treat with something liquid   coffee, hot tea, milk.  It actually does look like a fresh home baked cookie so it is attractive to the eye.  The chocolate chunks and almond pieces were large enough to be easily identifiable and the cookie was not overly sweet, just enough to satisfy a craving for something to treat yourself with.  This product will not be a favorite with my family, but I can certainly see where they would be convenient for specific reasons and at specific times.
