I first bought this product at my local supermarket, but they hardly ever had them in stock so I came on here looking for them.  Not only are they delicious, but they did something I didn't expect.  I had heard that walnuts are good for cholesterol, but I was shocked at how good they are.  I've struggled with my LDL for years and I don't want to take medicine.  I did nothing at all to change my diet and exercise routine except to add a handful of these walnuts every day   and my cholesterol was better than ever.  My LDL went down.  This is no coincidence as I have my numbers checked every 3 months without fail and this was the best set of test results that I've ever had.  It's nice that something that tastes so great is also good for you!
