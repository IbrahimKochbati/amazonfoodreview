Here is the response I got to my emailed question about BPA in the lids of their glass jars:          While all of our Earth's Best Foods were and are safe; Earth's Best OrganicÂ® jarred baby food was converted to packaging that does not use BPA in October, 2011.          That satisfies my concerns. They include a 1 800 number if people have further questions: please feel free to contact us at 1 800 434 4246, Monday through Friday from 7AM   5PM Mountain Time.          I don't know why they don't advertise this on the packaging, website, etc. It would reassure a lot of parents!
