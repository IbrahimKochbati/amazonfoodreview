The first  and of GF pancake mix I attempted was Bob's Red Mill and I loved it. I went to the store to try to find it again and this was all they had so I tried it. It's... okay. I'm egg free too and used mushed banana instead, so maybe that contributed to the slight mushy texture but I made a batch of egg ones for my in laws and they said it was a bit mushy too.          It's not horrible, but I prefer BRM  and personally.
