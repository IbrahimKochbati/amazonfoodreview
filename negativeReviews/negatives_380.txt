So for a "healthier" snack it sure is salty. But then the salt is a way for them to make the chips taste better without additional calories. Each bag is 100 calories with 10% sodium intake for the day.          The chips are not bad, i just wouldn't get them again because most of the flavoring comes from the salt.
