My mother used to make pork with shake n bake quite a lot and I loved it then and rediscovered it here! It cooks in 15 minutes at 425 degrees in the oven, which is the quickest oven meal I've made.  Shake 'n Bake makes the pork crispy and stays pretty crispy as a left over.  If you haven't tried it please do, it will be on your regular menu for a long time.
