I don't know if some of the previous reviews were written about a different product, or what. Granted, this oatmeal does not have the hard lump of  own sugar in the corner of the packet, as I seem to remember from my childhood in the 1970's. But it hardly tastes so bad that I can't eat it. I thought it was fine. Maybe it is not as sweet as it was years ago, but I can't see any ingredient listed on the package that would in any case render the taste as bad as some have said. Add more  own sugar if you want to eat candy... and get over it!
