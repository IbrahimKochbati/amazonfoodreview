I didn't realize I was getting 20 packets of these chips but I was happy to see them when they arrived.  I love anything sweet potato so I opened the box eagerly and started chowing down.  They are delicious!  My only concern is that I don't really like the texture of anything "popped" but because the flavor is delicious I can overlook that.  These chips would work perfectly with many diet plans.  They are very crispy and although you won't confuse them with "real" chips they will satisfy that urge for something crunchy.  I'm going to buy them in several other flavors to keep on hand.
