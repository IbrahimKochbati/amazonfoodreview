To me it seems like too much sugar, not enough chocolate, a little heavy on the spice. Sugar is the first ingredient. But if not for the sugar problem I wouldn't complain about the spice. I tried adding 1 2 pound of powdered cocoa to the 3 pound bag and it was still too sweet. It's amazing to me how far this is from "the best hot chocolate ever" like other reviewers rated. Def try a small bag first to see who you agree with.
