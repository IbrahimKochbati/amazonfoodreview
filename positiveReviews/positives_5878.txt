I like this milk powder.  My boys cannot drink cow milk and fresh goat milk can be hard to get.  This does not get all clumpy in the can like some powdered milks and is easy to mix up IF you use WARM water per the directions.  It has a nice taste, much better than canned and just as good as fresh.  It has been very useful for traveling as you can mix up a cup or two at a time as needed.
