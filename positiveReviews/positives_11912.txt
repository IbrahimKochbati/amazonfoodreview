I wanted a treat that was accepted and well liked for my rescue animals.     This is the only treat that is healthy and loved by all 4 legged beings in my home!     It does not contain sugar or grains or silly vegetables which virtually all treats contain. Dogs, cats and ferrets are carnivores they are not cattle to eat grain or rabbits to eat vegetables, and WHYYYY do companies add sugar,beet pulp or corn syrup to carnivore foods? It is dangerous and can cause the death of an animal with diabetes.     It is pretty easy to  eak into smaller pieces for cats and kittens with weak jaws and its wonderful to use as an aid to gain the trust of an abused dog as it will not cause stomach upset when given in common sense amounts.     I like that it goes a long way as it costs alot to heal and maintain and train abused and rescued dogs.     NO minus to this product other then the price,I can not afford to use it as much as I would like.
