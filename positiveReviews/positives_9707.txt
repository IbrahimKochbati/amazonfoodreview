I love this product!  I'm a runner who is also into organic and vegetarian foods. I absolutely love this shake because as someone who works out frequently, I sometimes have bowel troubles.  The combination of fiber and protein is perfect for my lifestyle.  I mix it with chocolate soy milk and it tastes just like a normal chocolate shake   sooo yummy and full of good stuff!  Helps keep me regular, energized, and FEELING FULL.  It can serve as a meal replacement, or even as a snack.  Very low in calories compared to other protein shakes.
