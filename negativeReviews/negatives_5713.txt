I had never used Shake 'N' Bake before trying this out. It's incredibly simple, and it bakes up nicely with a crunchy exterior. The flavor, though, isn't the best. I normally use flour and a mix of spices as a coating for chicken, and that tastes better (and is cheaper) than buying Shake 'N' Bake. I did find a great use for the Shake 'N' Bake, though  I coated wedged potatoes with it, then drizzled them with olive oil and baked them for about an hour at 375 degrees. Delicious! (I don't know why it tasted so much better on the potatoes than on the chicken, but it did.) The Shake 'N' Bake comes in a pack of 12, and I'll be using the remaining packs to make more oven baked potato wedges.
