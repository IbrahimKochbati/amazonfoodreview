I am not sure if my cat loves Halo, but whenever I try to change  ands, my cat looks happier going back to Halo. Like other reviewers, the poop seems to be least smelly. Also, one noticeable difference when I feed Halo is that my cat seems to eat in a controlled manner  eats throughout the day. I guess that is a good thing? When I feed other  ands, my cat eats it uncontrollably all at once.
