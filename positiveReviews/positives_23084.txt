I just made this  ead for the first time, and it is awesome! Tastes just like the real thing! My 15 month old is gluten free and I wanted to make him a PB&J (well almond butter and jelly    peanut allergy as well!) he is allergic to eggs too so I used Ener G egg replacer and baked it in the oven. I didn't cook it long enough though, although I think my oven isn't as hot as it should be.  My 4 year old loved it as well, told me she wanted 2 slices in her lunch for school! I am so excited to have found a  ead mix!
