I've bought this product many times and this time (11 10) they are old or defective.  The bags don't puff up and rinds are flat, stale & burn when cooked.  I've tried different time settings and in different microwaves.          I'm very dissapointed as this is a product I've been ordering for years.  Guess I'll have to call them and complain.
