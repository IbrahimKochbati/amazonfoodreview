Good chips but I bought them because I was looking for chocolate chips with no soy. After reading the product ingredients on Amazon and assuming they were soy free since soy was not listed I was very disappointed to find soy listed on the package when I got my order. I have 3 bags of chips that I can't use. Again, they are good chips but they are NOT soy free.
