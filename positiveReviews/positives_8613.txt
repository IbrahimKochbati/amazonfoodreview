This is a great low carb high protein snack.  140 calories for a 34 gram(1.2 oz) package  about like a small bag o'chips from a vending machine   they are TASTY!!, filling and best of all provide a real CHRUNCH.  My wife and I are one of the popular low carb packaged diet plans that uses a lot of shakes and soups etc.  Plan works great ( 40 for me so far!!) but both of us really miss the CRUNCH of biting into something solid; like chips or a taco shell   well these pretzel sticks satisfy that craving and let us keep to the diet much better.  I will be ordering my second batch soon   they are really that good.
