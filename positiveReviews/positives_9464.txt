Kitty loves these a lot and demands them morning and night. She doesn't really like to eat anything else anymore, although I make her. I am sure they are very bad for her, and wonder what special poison Purina puts in them to make them irresistible. These are constantly out of stock, and I can't buy them in any store in town. They are crack for kitties.
