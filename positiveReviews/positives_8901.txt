Halfway through my first jar and even though this is only the 2nd  and of ghee I've ever used, I do much prefer it to the last one which had a strange flavor.  Grass fed is the way to go (the new buzz word for healthy,) and I am willing to pay extra for what I believe to be high quality, I just wished they offered their larger sizes via Amazon as well since that would be a better value.
