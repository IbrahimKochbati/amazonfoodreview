I would have given this 5 stars but took one off for the high cost. This product otherwise is just yummy! This is spoken from the perspective of a diabetic who hasn't had regular taffy for years but I think this would hold its own next to regular taffy pretty easily.     Its sweetened with sucralose, not maltitol so there isn't the worry of gastric upset which is the #1 reason I ordered it. I don't see why more companies don't forgo the maltitol and just use other sweetners that have less of an impact on digestion. The flavors are full and all different depending on color and yes even the dreaded bannana flavor tastes good.     Its soft and chewy and I feel like I am "cheating" when I am not at all.     I am glad I found this!
