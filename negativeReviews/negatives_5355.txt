The Vine program sends you a sample of this product that makes one pot of coffee, so perhaps the "low acid" benefits become more apparent with repeat use.  But as Missus 1rude remarked, "I'm sticking with Zantac".          The coffee produced by the Puroast grounds somehow managed to be both bitter and flat   for reference, I typically find Starbucks coffees to be bitter and Maxwell House ones to be flat.  If you're a heartburn sufferer and a coffee lover, it might be worth trying the Puroast to see if you find it more palatable than we did.  But it wasn't for us.
