great candy, just as you would get in the store, however they came shipped in a corrugated cardboard carton direct from jelly belly without a liner ( literally, the candy was just in the box with nothing else  no plastic bag, etc), which was a bit off putting. However, I assume that if this is how I get it, this is how most retailers get it, meaning I've been eating jelly beans direct from a cardboard box my entire life. I ordered four different flavors of jelly bellies and they all came this way. No one got sick, so I assume this was sanitary.
