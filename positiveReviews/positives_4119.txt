But I'll give it a shot.  Wow.  So far I have only tried (and intend to try) the Key Lime Pie and the Mint Chocolate Chip but they are both amazing.  They key lime pie is incredibly tart and delicious but unfortunately the flavor only lasts about 10 seconds.  The Mint Chocolate Chip is also incredible and the flavor seems to last much longer (or at least, the dulled post flavor gum is more appealing).  In any event, even for 5 seconds of flavor these gums are a gem.  Great idea by Wrigley.
