Love, love these pancakes.  The extra "something" with the chunks of granola put these over the top.  Great taste and texture and everyone in the family asks for them..nearly every morning!  We are already fans of granola so this was fun to try.  My only problem is the 1 pound cans are very small.  This only makes one batch of pancakes for our family.  If just two kids are making them then it will make approx. 2 1 2 batches but that's all.  No, my kids don't eat only one pancake, they eat several...they are just too good. :)  Highly recommend but we, personally, will only order on special or with coupons.
