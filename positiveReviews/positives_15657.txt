My cat, an 11 year old tabby who is not at all finicky, nonetheless went a bit wild when I opened up one of the cans of this "people food for cats" entree. It also contains flavors I have never seen on offer before, such as Yellowfin and Snapper. I am always a bit hesitant, after last years awful pet food poisonings, in trying something new, but all seems well. One thing   open the cans with care. They are packed full and can be quite messy if not opened over a sink or trash can.
