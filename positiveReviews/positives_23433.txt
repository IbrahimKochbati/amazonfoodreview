Popchips are great   so flavorful and better for you than regular chips.  I ordered the pack of (12) 3 oz (full size   same as in the grocery store) bags.  Below are the flavors I received:       Barbecue (2 bags)       Original (1 bag)       Thai Sweet Chili (1 bag)       Parmesan Garlic (1 bag)       Jalapeno (1 bag)       Cheddar (1 bag)       Sweet Potato (1 bag)       Sea Salt & Vinegar (1 bag)       Salt & Pepper (1 bag)       Chili Lime (1 bag)       Sour Cream & Onion (1 bag)          As far as ordering the (12) 3oz bags vs the (24) 0.8 oz bags, per ounce it is cheaper to get the 3oz bags and divide them into individual servings yourself.  The 0.8oz bags are more convenient, though, so it just depends on what you're going for!
