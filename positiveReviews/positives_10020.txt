Cold  ew coffee is a tradition here in New Orleans and we are always looking for good coffee to use.  This Melitta Classique Supreme Ground produced a rich, delicious cold  ew that we really enjoyed.  We will definitely order some more.          If you've never tried cold  ew coffee you really should.  This is the  ewing system we use.  We've had it for over 20 years!     "
