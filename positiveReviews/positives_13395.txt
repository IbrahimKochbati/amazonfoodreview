This coffee is good quality. It is a strong medium roast with slight acidity but not overwhelming acidity. The extra bold means that the K cup has more ground coffee in it. It does not refer to the type of roast but rather the amount of coffee in the k cup. The cups are almost completely full of coffee. It's a good wake up cup of coffee for the morning and it is organic too! I find that the 8 oz. setting on my  ewer makes just the right cup. Those who like their coffee weaker might like a 10 oz. setting. I would recommend this coffee if you can get it at a reasonable price.
