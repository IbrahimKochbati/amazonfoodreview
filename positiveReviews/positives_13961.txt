I was surprised at the taste of this powdered peanut butter.  It is very creamy and it you weren't told that it was powder mixed with water, you couldn't tell the difference.  The only draw back is that you have to eat it after its mixed.  I tried to make a little extra for later and the consistency changed.  Just prepare the amount you plan on consuming and it is very good.
