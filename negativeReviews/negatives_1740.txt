I enjoyed the dry roasted part, but the Onion Garlic combination was a little overwhelming for me.  I thought that they would be a little more "toasted" than they were.  The flavor was more of an after taste and my wife shied away from my kisses after I ate them    bummer!  I am looking for something else.
