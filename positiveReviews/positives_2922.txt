Just received these boxes rather than buying the bar type that I did before.EXCELLENT! They are small bite size pieces that are soft and flavorful. Really fresh. I did the subscribe and save and am happy that I did. My husband and I really enjoy this  and. The boxes are larger than I realized, But I still will carry this item in my purse for a pick me up and to have a handy snack available with me. The boxes have a open and close tab with a plastic seal over the product once you open the box. I can't find one bad thing to say. No dissapointments at all.
