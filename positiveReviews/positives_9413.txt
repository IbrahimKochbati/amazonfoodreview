I'm a long time fan of Lindt chocolate which I like the most among inexpensive and widely available  ands.     This mikl chocolate is very tasty. My only small complaint is that there are far fewer hazelnuts than the packaging makes you believe ... probably on average one nut per large quadrant (the picture on the packaging shows 4 nuts per quadrant)!
