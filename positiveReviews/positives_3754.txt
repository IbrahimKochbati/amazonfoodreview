We first discovered Community Coffee while on a visit to Lake Charles, LA. And until recently it was only available in LA or by mail.  We prefere the Hazelnut blend, it has a nice rich flavor without being overly strong.  This is very good coffee.  We like it and have a standing order with Amazon to have it shipped to us at convenient intervals.
