Our Lab puppy was able to figure out how to turn the red bar and left the dispenser lids, but the angle of the treat pod is such that she can't fit her snout, or manuvuer her tongue very well to get the food.  Even turning her snout sideways didn't help.  The idea has promise but unfortunately the design is lacking.  We'll keep trying but it doesnt really hold her interest since she can't get the reward.
