my little boy loves this meal, he has been able to eat it by him self since he was 11 12 months. it only takes 30 second to heat which is great. foil can be a bit hard to tear off.          today he is 20 months old and eats what everybody else eats, but he still gets these for lunch once in a while, and he really gets exited when he see's his choices in the cabinet, and promptly go for this one, we have 3 different ones as well, but this one is preferred....he loves food, and was it up to him he would be eating this all day long ; )
