These are so great!  My dog had to take medication after his neuter surgery, and I wasn't sure how I was going to accomplish this task given our previous experience with pills.  He always ate whatever the pill was stuck into, but left the pill...typical!  This time, he swallowed the pill stuffed "treat" in one gulp.  He never imagined something was inside.  Giving him his medications are a  eeze now!  The treats are very moist, soft and malleable...my dog loves them!!
