I love raspberry and chocolate.  I could live on Sees Raspberry chocolate truffles.  But this coffee, ugh.  Brewing it smells pretty nice, a bit fruity, not much chocolate.  In the mug  awful chemical processed cleaner air freshener flavor (not that I am in the habit of eating those) but hot it just tastes artificial. It does have some sweet taste to it, but even adding milk and sugar do not make it drinkable.          If I let it sit around (and really, I bought the Keurig so I could have coffee NOW when I wanted it, not in 10 minutes) and it cools, it becomes passable.  But only barely.  The chemical flavor dissipates and it is drinkable, but only because after spending that much on coffee, I feel obligated to.          Spare yourself the torture, skip this coffee, unless you like the taste of lysol, then it might be for you!
