Do not waste your money on this. I waited anxiously for the mail to deliver. Made a fresh 12 oz cup of coffee, dropped in two tablets. Nothing. I dropped in two more. Changed the flavor of the black coffee, but not for the better. I had wanted this so I didn't have to use cream for flavor with all the calories. Not even a hint of CHOCOLATE flavor.
