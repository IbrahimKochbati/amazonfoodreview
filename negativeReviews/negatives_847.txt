These arrived fresh and in a timely manner.  However, flavor wise our family is in agreement that Jelly Belly produces a richer plum flavor, slightly larger sugar plum in size, and a bit softer in texture for their sugar plums.  The price on the Albanese sugar plums is reasonable, the flavor is good and it's always nice to support a small, independent candymaker!
