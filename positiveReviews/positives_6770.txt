Finally a GREAT decaf. It has a really wonderful and complete flavor  not like a lot of the decafs on the market that are just missing the kick. I use a Jura Capresso super automatic to make my espresso  it works lovely in the bypass funnel on this machine (since it is pre ground). The flavor stands up nice to milk for capuccinos and lattes. This is my every day decaf espresso. I haven't found anything better and I've tried a lot. The Illy decaf is comperable in flavor  quality but at about double the price the Illy just isn't worth it.
