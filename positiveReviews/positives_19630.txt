This is good stuff. Easy to make, we add real vanilla and almond extract   completes the flavor.Healthy and very tasty.This product has past the picky eaters test in my house.To balance textures and flavor we like to mix it with B.R.M's      7 grain flour pancake & waffle mix. So you'll have a nice rise and some corn crunch at the same time  YUM.
