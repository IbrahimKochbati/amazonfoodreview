I am a huge fan of Genisoy Soy Crisps (Deep Sea Salted flavor).     I love the crunch and texture of this non greasy snack.  The flavor is subtle and very light.  No heavy salty taste or greasy lips or fingers after eating.  I also like that I can really indulge on these and not feel the regret of eating too many calories.  Soy Crisps are my fav crunchy treat.   ^,,^&lt;
