I have a 6.5 month old who eats #2 food all of the time. I bought this variety pack and noticed that the peach oatmeal is thick like a paste. Coincidentally, as I was thinking that as I was feeding him he started choking and gasping for air.  He couldn't  eathe and I had to give him the heimlich maneuver and luckily he started crying.  VERY SCARY and those jars went right in the garbage.
