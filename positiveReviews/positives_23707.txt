These chips are good. Not the best thing I've ever tasted, but pretty good. The first couple bites are confusing and strange but it gets better. They get really good after the first ten. I got my box of chips yesterday and I've already eaten two bags. They are yummy. Much better for you than regular chips. I don't feel guilty at all for eating so many. The bags are a little small though. I'm still debating on whether or not twelve small bags of chips are worth $25.
