Though not my favorite this is ok, great for those on diets where you need to limit Sodium, fat and etc. My recommendation though is you follow the instructions that were on a different flavor. After following the initial instructions instead of letting it sit after stirring, microwave at 20% power for an addt'l 5 mins. The flavors meld better and the pasta is a much better texture.
