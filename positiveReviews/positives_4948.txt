Of course, nobody can ever figure out what cats will like, but our experience is the opposite of the one star review.          Our two Bengal cats ate kibble for years, but after some serious teeth problems, they had to switch to canned food. We tried a few different  ands and flavors. They'd eat it for a few days, then turn up their noses. Even expensive food from the vet's did not please them.          So, we tried the Friskies Sea Captains Choice flavor, and they went nuts, gobbling it down like candy. We only bought a few cans at a time, figuring they would tire of it, but no, they have been eating it with gusto for a coupe of months now, so we buy it by the case.          I don't understand about it not smelling good; perhaps they got a bad batch, but it smells like other cat foods to us, and the pate is easy to dish out. As long as the cats love it, who are we to complain?
