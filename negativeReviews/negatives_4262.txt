I ordered this as a gift for my boyfriend's family in December. I was meeting them for the first time over New Year's. Presentation matters for things like that! I thought it would make an elegant, classical gift; the picture looks all elegant, prettily packed with a  bow.          Well, the box I received looked nothing like the box in the picture. It came in a cheap looking blue cardboard box with the same inside wrapping you'd find in a McDonald's toy. Worst of all, some of the candies had jack o lantern wrapping. That's fine in October, but by New Year's, it looks like old Halloween candy! I couldn't use it as a gift because I didn't want them to think I was giving them leftover Halloween candy.          If you're ordering the box for yourself, by all means, go for it. The quality of the candies is just fine. But if you're ordering it to give as a gift, watch out! I think they just ship you the oldest (sometimes out of season) box they have. Together with cheap packaging, it makes even this expensive gift look careless.
