Man I love this salt.  I swear even compared to other premium sea salts there's something special about this stuff.  I have been using it exclusively for a year or so now and have even given it as a gift along with good peppercorns and olive oil and my friends that aren't foodies were really surprised at what a difference good salt makes.          Not that this matters but I see this salt being used on Iron Chef America frequently.
