I drank this and could tell very little difference from a regular strawberry and kiwi flavored soda, which is quite impressive considering that this drink is made from 100% juice!  It has 135 calories and a great alternative to a regular soda.  I will definitely be purchasing these in the future!  I also tried their Orange Tangerine carbonated juice and enjoyed it as well.
