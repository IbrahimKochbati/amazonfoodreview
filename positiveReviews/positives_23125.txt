My son has celiac and I've tried many  ead products since his diagnosis 6 months ago.  I hated all of them except this one.  The  ead was good, but I tried the recipe on the bag for the bagels and they were great!!!! I was so pleased to have a decent bagel to pack in his lunch instead of those horrible smelling frozen ones.
