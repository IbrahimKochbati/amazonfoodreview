If you try to buy tea in one of our major cities and are approached by some limp wristed purveyor trying to sell you one of his "artisanal" blends packaged in a paper bag with an attractive or colorful label, do not scoff but leave the premises in as diplomatic, and polite manner you can muster.  Tea has been and always will be an expensive commodity, and with good reason; its irresistible flavor depends on volatile compounds either inherent in the tea or added to enhance its finished flavor. The operative word here is "volatile" which is synonymous with "fleeting" and in the world of tea quality, packaging is everything. With Twinings tea you are getting a tea with the maximum protection; a foil sealed metal can, for goodness sake.  Twinings delivers it to you with the understanding that you will enjoy the flavor that they meant for you to have so that you may return to them as a source of quality teas again and again.  Of course, once you've opened the can it's up to you to keep the can closed after use until the tea is all gone. I prefer loose tea and Twinings is my supplier of choice.  Twinings has so many varieties for you to choose from, there really is no reason to go elsewhere. We may have sent those Redcoats back to England with their tails between their legs but we still have a lot to learn from them when it comes to tea. Lady Grey is an especially tasty blend, you'll enjoy it.
