I've been using Pill Pockets for 4 years now. I dont know why the other person had such a problem with hers.......but sometimes a few of them come crumbled in the bag....so what. You just smoosh it around your pill and the dog gobbles it down.  Maybe your's got crushed by the post office. I dont know. All I know is that regardless of what it looks like out of the bag, you can still use it. It doesnt stick to your fingers, it doesnt require refridgeration and the dogs love then.  There is a difference in the consistancy of the dough between the beef and chicken however. The Chicken is more like play dough dough, with the Beef a little stiffer like pie dough.  Either way, these things are a god send if you need to give pills on a daily basis.  It's a win win product.
