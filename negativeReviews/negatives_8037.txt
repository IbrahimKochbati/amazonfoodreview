The Jerky had a nice, seasoned flavor to it, but I did not really enjoy the consistency and texture of it.  Rather than being chewy like other jerky I eat, it was much more crumbly.  Another reviewer mentioned it, but I thought that I would try it myself because I enjoy trying new things.  Not sure that I would recommend it to another jerky aficionado, but I have 3 more bags to eat and the flavor of the meat is good.
