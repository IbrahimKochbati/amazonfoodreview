gave these as a gift to my  other. we are both fans of hot sauces so i thought i'd give this a try.  the wooden packaging looked nice and was sturdy enough that it could be used for storage transport of the sauces.     my  other says that he liked the sauces, he would not share with me on chirstmas day so i never got a chance to try them.
