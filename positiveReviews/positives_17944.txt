I haven't had this for so many years I cant even guess how long its been. My self, I've never used this before for cooking so I don't have anything to compare it to. I used it a couple nights ago on some boneless pork country style ribs. I usually do these on the grill and like them because of they're nice thick chunks of meat. I had a package that was going to be grilled so I used them with this instead. Baked them in my Oster Convection Toaster Oven. Used a wire rack inside the  oiling pan that came with it and baked them. The coating kept all the juices in the meat! I couldn't believe that there wasn't one single drip from any of them! And I didn't trim the small amount of fat that was on them either. When grilling these they always drip grease and I have to watch that they don't burn when the grease catches on fire. They turned out very nice and juicy and the meat had a nice flavor to it too. It wasn't real spicy and it was like the coating hardly has any seasoning at all in it. Which is nice because next time I use it I can add my favorite seasonings without having a conflict of flavors making them taste weird. And I'm definitely going to be getting some more of this and start using it.
