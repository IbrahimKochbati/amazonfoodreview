Our two Golden Retrievers have been on Beneful Weight Control now for at least 3 years. We didn't see any out of the ordinary pooping problems that others mention.  They love it and both have lost considerable weight    both were considered "obese," but now one is normal weight and the other is only slightly overweight.  My only real complaint is they stopped selling it (at least around here) in the larger 40 50lb bags.  Now you can only find these 31lb bags but the price is the same.  We go through about 2 bags a month, so it's a little pricey.
