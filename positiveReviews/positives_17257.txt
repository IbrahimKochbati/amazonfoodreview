Only citric and ascorbic acid with Grape concentrate and water ! No sugar added ! And nothing else ! Delicious ? Consumed half a can before adding any water ! True Love ! Three times stronger then regular grape juice. And Welch's too !! According to " Miracle Food Cures from the Bible " (also Amazon) Grape sugar is really good for the heart. Not to mention all the antioxidants. In short, this is really overwhelming goodness !! Thank You !!!!
