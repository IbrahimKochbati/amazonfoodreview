I can't even GIVE these things away.  The best description I can come up with is "Sawdust surrounded by wax."  Does not taste like white chocolate (or ANY type of chocolate) in the least.  I've yet to know anyone who can actually swallow a bite of one of these.  I have a "HELP YOURSELF" sticky note on the box at the office and everyone who has tried it, has SPIT IT OUT and tossed it in the trash.  Save your money.
