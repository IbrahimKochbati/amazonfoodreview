Got this k cup in a selection that came with my new Keurig. I usually make the small, 6 oz. cup. The resulting  ew was so bitter and acrid that is was undrinkable... not just bad. Thinking that I must have done something wrong I tried again.....this time making a 12 ouncer......absolutely no difference. It tasted distinctly burnt! I was very disappointed as I like strong coffee and, usually, Italian style roast is my favorite. I would give this one a pass.......
