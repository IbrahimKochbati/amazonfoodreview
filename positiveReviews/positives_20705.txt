I'm not a big fan of the taste. I've tried mixing it with water (as instructed) and with soy milk. It just doesn't taste very good to me, but not bad. For an easy vegan meal replacement, it does the trick, and the price is good. I'll try the vanilla next, as that might mix well with some fruit in the blender.
