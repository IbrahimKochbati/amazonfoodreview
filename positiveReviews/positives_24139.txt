In an effort to lower my blood pressure, I've stopped eating  ead, and was happy to find a great alternative. The Rye & Oat an Crisp eads are very low in sodium. In addition, they have no fat and contain 2g fiber each. They are dry, so I recommend eating them alongside salads, or having a glass of water handy.  I love them.
