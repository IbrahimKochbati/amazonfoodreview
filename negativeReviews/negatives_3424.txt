EBEB is my favorite k cup coffee flavor.  It has great flavor and is my preference for a bold coffee taste without being bitter.          ...but...          I've had a lot of problems with the actual EBEB k cup.  There is some manufacturing defect with these particular ones.  About every 3rd k cup something gets clogged somewhere and it overpressures the cup resulting in coffee & grounds spilling out of the top of the cup holder on the machine.  I've purchased several different boxes of EBEB from different stores (including Amazon) and have had trouble with all of them.          I've run hundreds of other styles of k cup through our machine with no problems   this only happens with the EBEB.          I called Keurig to tell them about it and while they were nice and sent me a free box of another type of coffee, they didn't seem to interested in understanding that there is some manufacturing defect in this coffee flavor.          Bottom line is that I'm very sad   I won't buy EBEB anymore because of this continuing problem with the manufacturing.
