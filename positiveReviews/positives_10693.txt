My Malamutes aren't too picky, except one who hates peanut butter, so I decided to try these treats.  Very hard and crunchy biscuits of a decent size.  If I have one complaint, they're so hard I can't  eak them in two and have to give the whole treat to my dogs.  Beyond that, my dogs like them and think they're pretty good.  So, they would give it 5 stars and I would give them 4 stars, making it 4 1 2 stars.
