I've been on a ginger ale kick lately and switched to diet since every  and of regular ginger ale I can find sweetens their drinks with high fructose corn syrup instead of just regular sugar. Anything made with or from corn makes me ill, so I've been drinking. I've had the diet Canada Dry version, as well as various store  ands from Brookshire's, Albertson's, etc. I ran to the grocery store near work today to pick up something and grabbed a six pack of Vernors as there were no other options for diet ginger ale.          The after taste is almost like saccharine, even though it is sweetened with Aspertame. It is reminiscent of TAB soda. The taste of ginger ale is there, but there is a chemical esque taste as well   almost soapy.          I won't be getting this  and ever again.
