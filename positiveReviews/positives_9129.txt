I am surprised by how good this  eakfast cookie's flavor is; it has depth of spices and textures and is truly delicious.          300 calories seemed a bit high, but I ate one with a large glass of water and it has been 4 hours and my tummy is not growling yet, I even worked out too.          I love that it doesn't have any freaky ingredients and it was very soft and moist.  I gave a little pinch of it to my toddler daughter and she enjoyed it too.  I prefer to have actual oatmeal in the morning with fruit and yogurt, but these  eakfast cookies are great if the morning goes sideways and I don't have time or opportunity to fix something.          The problem I found with other protein bars and such is that in about 2 hours I was feeling peckish and looking for snacks until lunch.  I did not have that problem with this  eakfast cookie,  it may have more calories than I thought I wanted to "spend," but it is very worth it since it keeps me out of the kitchen until lunchtime.          Another nice thing: there are not any chips or icing on this cookie to melt in the mid day heat, so you can keep one of these in the purse or diaper bag without creating a big mess for yourself later ;)          I keep them in the freezer for freshness, they are really moist and chewy once you let them thaw or microwave.  I put one on a saucer and nuke for 20 30 seconds from frozen solid, it turns out like its warm from the oven.  I do not recommend keeping them in the fridge, baked goods and  ead will get dried out if kept there.          UPDATE:I have lost 35 pounds in the last year with very minimal changes and these cookies have helped me go from not eating  eakfast and snacking all morning, to eating  eakfast no matter how busy and not needing to snack or eat until lunchtime. They are very filling and are perfect for when you don't have time to make anything.
