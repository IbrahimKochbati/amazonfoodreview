This cat food is really special. It doesn't smell like cat food. It smells like canned chicken. The cans are easy to wash for recycling. It's a joy to serve.          My ditzy calico cat, Creampuff, loved the food. She scarfed it down immediately. The other, a new adoptee named Ophelia, said, "Thanks but no thanks." She's quite finicky but alas, I think her taste buds have become accustomed to the traditional, more pedestrian Friskies type food.          Seems like a good cat food, if you can get your cat(s) to eat it.I'm not qualified to evaluate the nutritional quality or the taste, bt appearance and smell are excellent.
