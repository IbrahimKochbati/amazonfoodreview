With all the reviews of this popcorn, I'm surprised not to find any mention of the horrible saturated fat content of this. Anyone with any concern about their cholesterol or saturated fat content really needs to look closely at the nutritional guide. I couldn't find it listed on their website so I asked them to email me a copy. Wow, 40g of saturated fats in one of these packets and they call it 5 servings. Daily limit of saturated fats for a 2,000 calorie day person is 16. You would have to eat 4 big macs to match the saturated content of this popcorn. The biggest concern I have with this is the company told me it has no plans to even offer a healthful alternative for pre packaged packets like this. The problem is entirely with the oil they are using. Coconut oil. They list on their packet no cholesterol and no trans fats, but there's conveniently no mention of the overwhelming amount of saturated fats due to the coconut oil. Most movie theaters have finally changed from coconut oil to canola or other good oils to address this major health concern and bad press over the years. I asked Great Northern to please follow suit, not even asking them to replace this oil with the good oils but to just offer an alternative. They refused. It tastes just as good to me at the movie theaters. In some cases the saturated fats have been reduced 15 times with the change from coconut to good oils. I love popcorn. But health is a concern to me. If you are concerned about saturated fats, look at the nutritional guide for these packets.
