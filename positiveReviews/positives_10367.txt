Our cat absolutely loves these "green" treats.  Esp since she's indoors and unable to eat plants grass they give her the greens she needs as part of her diet.  We've been giving them to her for years and have had no issue   We actually toss them down the hall to her to give her some exercise which she loves.  Just give them time to chew etc.  HIGHLY recommend!
