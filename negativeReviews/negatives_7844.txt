I ordered three types of popcorn to sample when I bought my Whirley Pop (which by the way is friggin awesome, get one, they are cheap and work so well!), all from Wabash. I got the baby white, the baby yellow, and the ladyfinger. Using 1 2 cup of corn and 2 tablespoons of oil in the whirley, both the ladyfinger and the baby yellow would pop up fluffy enough to fill the entire whirley. The white consistently only fills about halfway...it just doesn't taste as light and crisp either.  Recommend going for the ladyfinger (tastes the best and the least hulls by far, but it's so tiny it's almost hard to eat without dropping a lot) or yellow if you're trying this  and. Hope this helps.
