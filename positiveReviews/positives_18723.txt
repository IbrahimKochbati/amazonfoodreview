Very salty to my taste, but this is readily available in the grocery store and seems to be the best bet if you don't hit a market serving the Hi ic population. I never know what the do with the glassware after using up the mole. It's too small for a drinking glass (at least in my household) so some have been used for sorting small screws and nuts, and others for watercolor painting.
