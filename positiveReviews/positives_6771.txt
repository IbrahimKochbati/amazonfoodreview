Lavazza decaf espresso was the best tasting of the 6 leading  ands I tried in my Gaggia Classic machine, and this 4 pack was the least expensive per can that I found on the internet. The grind is not quite fine enough but 3 sec in a cheap non burr grinder produced the correct degree of fineness for a mouse's tail and perfect crema.
