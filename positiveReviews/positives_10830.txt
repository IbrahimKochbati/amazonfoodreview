Boy did I ever test this out.          Each morning after the kids get on the bus, the dogs get a quick walk around the neighborhood park.  They love this, and they especially love the dog moms who  ing treats.          My dog is a little weird.  She doesn't really like treats    or rather, she doesn't like a lot of treats.          So I thought between my dog and the 5 or 6 others that join the walk, I could give a good review of this product.          The consensus:  Every dog liked them!  So that's the main thing that you're looking for when you spend your money on dog treats.  If natural ingredients are important to you, then you can depend on Newman's Own.          The one thing that makes me hesitate in giving them 5 stars is that they are big and crumbly.  Crunchy dog treats are good for their teeth I think, but these are 2 x 1 inches big, with a scored line to  eak them into 2 1 x 1 inch treats.  I found that the scored area was easy to separate, but even so, they are kind of big.          So when my dog (a 40 lb mixed  eed) ate them, they made a big mess!          The other dogs on the walk are the same size or bigger, except for one tiny Shih Tzu.  She wasn't intimidate and tackled the treat with gusto as well.          There are about 10 to 15 bars per bag (scored in two, so 20 to 30 treats).  I didn't think to count them when they first arrived, but that's my best guess.
