I shared these with friends at work.  The consensus is that they taste good, if not quite what some people expected.  Those who enjoy sweet potato fries liked them better than those with no experience in that area.  Price would be a consideration for everyone who tasted these, but not necessarily the overriding issue.  I personally enjoy them.  I'd look for them in a larger bag over a snack size bag, mostly because I'm cheap that way.  Nobody said they were nasty or that it was something they'd never choose.
