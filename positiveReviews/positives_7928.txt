I was up visiting my family this week and was having the usual allergic reactions I get when I'm here. When we went out shopping, we happened upon the local health foods supermarket and went inside.          I thought I could find a milk thistle tea that could help me. None could be found. I saw the Triple Leaf Detox Tea and figured it couldn't hurt, so I bought.          I was amazed at how well it helped. My allergic reactions have nearly gone away. It has worked better than the any of the meds I've used to counter them previously.
