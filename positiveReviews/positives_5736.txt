I have no idea what a heat unit is, and I kind of doubt Frontier does either, but hey   the proof is in the spicy. And this works. One teaspoon makes four quarts of chili nice and toasty, and two tsp make it killer hot. My local Outpost co op food store carries Frontier  and spices, and Outpost doesn't sell crap, so I'm satisfied they operate responsibly.
