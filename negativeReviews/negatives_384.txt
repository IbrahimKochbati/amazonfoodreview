I first tried the BBQ flavor at a restaurant, which was good. Then, I was carried away with the 1 2 fat part, which made me pay without realizing my mistake!          The "Salt & Pepper" is OK! ONLY OK, after trying another one, I changed my mind!          The "BBQ" is good, but not that good!          The rest is pure trash! I did not like them, what so ever nor my other 4 friends!          The price is wayyyyyy high, and not worth it for a small single serving, as others such as Utz is WAYYYY better and cheaper!          3 starts is too much for this over marketed, less of flavor, and over priced snack!          AVOID!          2 stars off: bad flavors          1 star off: PRICY AS SH**!, and not worth it!
