This is great food and all my cats love it. It's the perfect size for an adult cat to eat. It looks like 'real' food and doesn't have all the junk normal cat food has. I have also found that it does not make my cats sick when they eat it. It's pricey, but when you consider how much better it is I think it's worth it for your pets.
