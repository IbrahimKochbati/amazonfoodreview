I purchased a 6 pack of this Ginger Ale at the local QFC grocery store (it's pretty expensive) to see if I would like it before I went and bought a 24 pack from Amazon.  I really like strong ginger ale's and while this isn't as strong as I'd like, it's definitely good... if you like ginger.          It's also better if you poor it into a glass so your full senses take part in enjoying this ale, similar to drinking a good beer.  You will notice a difference.          The price on Amazon is great, if you're not sure go pick up a 6 pack from your local store if they carry it and see if you like, that's what I did.
