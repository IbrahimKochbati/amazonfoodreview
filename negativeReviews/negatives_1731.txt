I would recommend not buying these nuts if you are looking for some really good tasting nuts.  These are just average quality, and the  azil nuts taste just plain awful.  The only good tasting nut in this lot is the almond and pecans.  There are barely any pecans, but tons of cashews.  Try another  and as I am sure there is something better out there.
