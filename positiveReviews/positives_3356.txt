I was happily surprised with this product. I read other negative reviews and was honestly disappointed in Betty Crocker gf cake mix so I didn't feel the need to try this. I finally bought it at a whim when I saw it at my local market and I am happy I did. I am a baker at heart and love to spoil my family with homemade deserts and pancakes on the weekends. I have adjusted my cooking and baking to primarily gf for the past year now and am happy when I find a gf alternative that cooks & tastes like "the real thing". Another plus is that I can buy this at my local market (which does not carry too many specialty foods) and don't have to make the extra trip to the higher end store.          I made pancakes today and they were a hit with everyone. Will definitely use it to try other recipes.     Only downside is the cost and size of box; very pricey and very small.
