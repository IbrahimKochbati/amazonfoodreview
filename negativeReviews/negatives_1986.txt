My hair dresser's salon bought a Keurig Machine, so I have been able to sample a variety of K Cups. K cups are about 10 times more expensive than a regularly  ewed cup of coffee so I have never considered buying one for myself, but having a Keurig Machine at a hair salon makes sense! People have a variety of tastes and K Cups can provide a nice variety and freshly made one at that.          The salon has a nice variety of K cups: Folders, Wolfgang Puck, Timothy's, and Green Mountain (that owns Keurig).          Everyone's taste vary, but here is my assessment of the ones that I have tried so far. Wolfgang Puck was my second favorite. So far, I like Folgers the best.          FOLGERS GOURMET     SELECTIONS LIVELY COLOMBIAN     Price per cup: 69 cents (package of 36 for $25)     Earthy flavor, fruity and nutty flavors come through.          WOLFGANG PUCK CHEFS RESERVE COLOMBIAN DARK ROAST     Price per cup: 69 cents (package of 48 for $32.98)     A dark roast with caramel and earthy notes, slight burnt     and papery flavors.          TIMOTHY'S DECAFFEINATED COLOMBIAN MEDIUM     Price per cup: 60 cents (package of 50 for $30)     A bit on the weak side, kind of papery, and less astringent than the others.          Ali Julia review
