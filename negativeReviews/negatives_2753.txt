I received this item and there was a tear in the packaging which had caused the dragees to spill all over the inside of the box they arrived in. This isn't very surprising due to the type of plastic it's packaged in  the sort which immediately rips open at the slightest puncture  but as such it should have been packaged for shipping more carefully. Perhaps wrapped it in small bubble wrap and taping it securely as I've seen done with other less fragile items I've ordered. I was especially annoyed however that there is NO way of returning it! That's just outrageous. Very very dissatisfied. I have now tried ordering similar pearl dagrees from Wilton    "
