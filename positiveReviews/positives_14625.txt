My husband and I absolutely love this tea! It tastes great especially with a drop of honey and it is very relaxing. I have asthma and allergies and sinus problems ... and this tea sort of calms my whole respiratory system. So, I highly recommend this tea, I am sick right now, and I drank this tea with 2 tea bags and honey and I did feel better, a little easier time  eathing. My husband uses it when he's stressed, and it does relax him and calm him. This tea is great througout the day and wonderful to relax with at night and really awesome if you are sick, to sit with and sip and just try and feel better.
