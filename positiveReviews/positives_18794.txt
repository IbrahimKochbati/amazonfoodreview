It's really hard to find healthy treats for my dog.  I have started feeding him an organic, homemade diet to help him with his kidneys and overall health.  He's 15 years old and has become quite picky.  I've looked around a lot for a healthy cookie for him that is crunchy and organic and not too high protein for his weaker kidneys.  These cookies fit the bill.  He loves them and I feel good about giving them to him.  My super picky boy practically snatches these out of my hand!
