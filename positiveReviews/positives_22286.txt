Keeping in mind that this is not a sweet sparkling beverage, this is very good.  It is sparkling mountain spring water with flavor; however, if you wish a sweet beverage, simple add one little packet of your favorite artificial sweetener (Sugar Twin, Equal, etc.) and it is a perfectly sweetened delight.  The berry favor comes out more with the sweetener. Warning, though, when you add the sweetener to this drink, it will fizz up a lot, so be prepared to put the screw lid on REAL fast or put the drink in a glass first.  I've gotten pretty good at putting the cap back on fast.  Anyway, this is good stuff.  They also make sweetened drinks with no salt or calories, if that is what you are looking for.  A+ in my book!
