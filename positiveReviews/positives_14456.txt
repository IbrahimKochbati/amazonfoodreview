I tried this based on other reviewer feedback. It is now one of my favorite foods. The barley ads texture an instant oatmeal lacks, while the real fruit ads a sweet and flavor that is pleasant and not too sweet or artificial. I'm trying not to burn out on these, but I crave them.  Even if I was not in a rush, I would eat them. Perfect size to make you feel pretty satisfied. "Cooking" time is long, but for the result, its very little effort. I'm subscribing to these!
