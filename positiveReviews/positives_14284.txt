I like the portion size on this one.  Son started eating this at 5 1 2 months.  No issue with feeding him cold or hot he eats it.  I like the benefits of DHA and I like the listed Vegetables Grains.          I like the pricing, no tax, and free shipping to my door.  Can't beat the price for pack of 8 in the stores.  we get this food delivered too.          The packs are easy to throw in diaper bag w spoon and feed him.  Less mess and fuss.          Our son's 11 months now and still eats this.
