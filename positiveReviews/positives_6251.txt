I have a lemongrass plant in my yard. I make tea from it but I wanted convenient tea bags to take to work or drink whenever I wanted. The tea from this box tastes exactly the same. It is some of the best tea I have ever tasted. I prefer to drink it hot but it can be made cold. It is such a relaxing beverage. I can drink it before bed because it has no caffeine. I highly recommend this tea.
