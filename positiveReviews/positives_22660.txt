I use the whirly popper. I bought the 4 oz package because the 5.5 oz packages from the competitors were always too much popcorn for one person. To my surprise, the 4 oz package from great northern popped MORE popcorn than their competitors and overflowed my popper!  If you only want popcorn for one, order the 2.5 oz size. The popcorn is delicious and almost every kernel popped. Tastes just like the movie theater popcorn. I paid less than $20 for 24 packs which is a bargain compared to what I would pay in the store for a box of 5.
