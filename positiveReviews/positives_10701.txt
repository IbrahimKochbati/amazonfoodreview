I have two dogs: a 5 year old Weimaraner who eats everything except parsley and the colored parts of citrus rinds...even rocks and especially sticks, and a 12 year old German Shepherd Dog who eats as little as I let her get away with  she doesn't even like fish, or beef dog food! Well, both dogs wolfed these down. They are flattish rectangular pieces of what looks like compressed sawdust, scored in half so you can give just a one inch square easily. Of course, being Newman's Own, they don't have added colors or flavorings that could trigger allergies in your pet, or make the biscuits smell off to humans. Not to worry, though   both dogs knew which bubble packed envelope was for them. A+++
