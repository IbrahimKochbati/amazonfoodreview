I have purchased this tea repeatedly this year.  My boss and I both drink it in the office just like coffee.  It is miraculous at dropping blood pressure. My boss is now off half his medication.  We love the taste and it is also really good cold with ice.  I haven't tried it with vodka yet, but that is next.  The tea always arrives in a timely manner.
