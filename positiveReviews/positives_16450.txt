Greenies are a healthy treat for dogs and they love them!  I first bought them while working at a hardware feed store to give them a try. We were so pleased to find them on Amazon at nearly half the price.  Every dog owner should try them, they come in all sizes for all dogs and really do keep their teeth in great condition.
