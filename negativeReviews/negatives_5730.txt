I purchased the 6 pack of these lemon tea cookies and waited with great anticipation for the melt in your mouth, powdered sugar covered short ead lemon tea cookies I was expecting; what I received was 6 boxes of cookies that tasted like chemicals. I don't know if they were old and had gone off or had been stored in some plastic container that had leached the plastic into the cookies or if the makers just used some sort of artificial lemon flavoring rather than actual lemon but any lemon flavor they might've had was nearly undetectable, overpowered by a medicinal chemical flavor. They kind of tasted like Bactine smells. Needless to say I would not recommend these cookies to anyone but if you really want to try them let me know, I still have 5 unopened boxes... (To be fair, I can't say for sure ALL the boxes tasted like this, just the one I happened to open. I will not, however, be trying any of the other boxes I still have.)
