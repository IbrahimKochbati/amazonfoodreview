We LOVE this product!!! Myself and three children have multiple food allergies and this mix is actually something everyone can and will eat (very rare). I make everything out of it from pizza crust to a loaf of  ead to hamburger buns, even cookies!  Go to their website and they have recipes available. This mix is so versatile I can get very creative and pretty much make anything from it.
