Put simply this is a  illiant piece of kit... does exactly what it says on the tin... converts any XLR mic to USB    including phantom power supply.          We have an Neuman professional condenser mic here at Blockhouse tv and I kid you not    it sounds amazing with this piece of kit.  Have plugged into our mac and thrown the signal into Audacity and or Final Cut pro and it sounds the business   no hum, noise, clicks or pop. We use it to voice the children's animation DVD series; Jack and Holly.  Both the actors and the tech staff find it a really easy and portable set up to use. OK   looks aren't great   and it's plastic   but I don't really give a monkey's about that   all I care about is the signal to noise ratio, the sound quality and can it power our very expensive mics?  The answer is   yes it can.  We say buy!              "
