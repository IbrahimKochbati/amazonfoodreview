Having made coffee drinks for a living a few years ago has turned me into more of a tea afficianado than I was already, therefore I must say that one of my favourite teas of all time has turned out to be Irish Breakfast   and Taylor's of Harrogate is the best I have tried.  This type of tea has bit of an edge to it and is fabulous with a bit of milk or cream.          I look forward to smpling more of the varieties T of H has to offer,
