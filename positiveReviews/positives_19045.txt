I was very dubious that this stuff would be any good when I bought it, but I just finished making the cheese biscuit recipe on the box and I am AMAZED.  Seriously, they are so good  even my kids like them; they couldn't tell they were low carb.  They were soft, light, and buttery like the cheddar biscuits at Red Lobster.  I wouldn't recommend using the plain ol' water and carbquick biscuit recipe.  Even if you use real Bisquick, those biscuits are NEVER going to be any good.  Anyone who has made biscuits from scratch knows they have to have a lot of fat in them  either butter or shortening  to be edible.  And you have to stop messing with the dough as soon as everything is moist enough to stick together  don't knead it at all or you'll wind up with hocky pucks.  Anyway,  follow the directions, measure accurately and don't cut corners  margarine?? yuck!  The recipe says to use butter, so don't complain if you don't follow directions and you wind up with a mess.          I'll be making the pancakes tomorrow  can't wait!! It's been probably at least a year since I had pancakes...          BTW  A couple of reviews on here have been bad because it's too pricey  but that's not really fair.  This price on Amazon is more than twice the price I got mine for elsewhere  that's not Carbquick's fault. As with anything, you have to shop around.
