It's not just THIS Walden Farms product, but every one I've tried. Syrups, marshmallow dip, Ketchup, Cocktail sauce.....!! You'd think after wasting so much money on them (not to mention the taste that leaves your mouth feeling like a chemical sewer!) I'd learn but kept hoping ONE item would be salvageable. No. They are so bad I almost considered gargling with bleach to erase the taste. There are no words for what these Walden products taste like: not any that can be printed on Amazon, at any rate. (shudder)
