I actually cook most of my twins' savory meals, but I always keep a package of these EB dinners on hand  for (1) feeding the girls on the go and (2) for those times when I just don't have the energy to cook or defrost whatever is in the freezer. The girls like most of the flavors, except for the peas. I wish EB had more variety packages with different flavor available.
