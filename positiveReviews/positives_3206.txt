We use this mix for pancakes and waffles and it's perfect. We have had a terrible time finding a good all purpose flour that is gluten free (the popular  ands taste terrible!) so we tend to use this pancake mix as a base for a lot of our recipes    including  eading for baked chicken and other things. It's definitely best as a pancake mix of course, but using it as a starting point for baking has helped us find "normal" tasting gluten free baked foods. :)
