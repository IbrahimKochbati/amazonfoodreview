This oil has a wonderful, mild, roasted walnut flavor that I found irresistible in a salad dressing (it will now be my go to oil for homemade dressings).  There is a recipe for vinaigrette right on the back of the can.  Bought it because it's omega 3 content is second only to flaxseed oil, plus, it's made in California!          Definitely buy it on Amazon, so much cheaper than the grocery store.
