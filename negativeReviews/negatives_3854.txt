I found this soda simultaneously sweet and tart, which is interesting, with no bitter aftertaste or the acidic feeling of regular dark soda. It was a bit too sweet for me, and I couldn't taste the kiwi nor was I wowed over by the taste of fresh strawberries. In fact, it was not that much different than Hanson's (although I like their taste better). It's 100% juice and carbonated   I figured it would either taste like sparkling cider or something similar orange soda, but neither is correct. It seems a bit heavier than cider and not as bubbly as orange soda. It does not really have a fresh fruit taste to it, and it is a bit heavy on the taste (e.g. not a subtle, light taste).          Being 100% juice this could be a better choice than soda for kids. But with 135 calories and 11% of your RDA of sugar in a small 8 oz can, you are only improving over the dyes and additives. If the sugars concern you, compare this to Soda Club's drinks and you will be much happier there. However, it does sport 100% of RDA of Vitamin C   so it might have a slight cold fighting benefit as well. For an adult, I would pass. The soda is sized for kids and that also means more waste generated. It would be too easy to chug 4 of these, and while being fat free, it is not easy on the calories.          Bottom line: I like it but don't love it; however it was too small, had too many calories, and is too pricey for everyday consumption.
