Twinings Lady Grey has long been my favorite in the Earl Grey family of teas. Lighter with more citrus and floral tones, it's great when you want the taste of earl grey but not as much heaviness. The 6 pack is a good price, so definitely to be recommended. A great loose leaf tea for tea parties too!
