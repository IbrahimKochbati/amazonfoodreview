The initial aroma upon opening the package was decent, though subtle. Unfortunately, it quickly dissipated   I really couldn't smell anything after a minute, which I assume is due to it being pre ground.          I  ewed this coffee in a French press as well as in a drip  ewer. Both results tasted flat and boring, although there was a decent amount of body   at least it was inoffensive. Perhaps a notch up from bad diner coffee. For about the same price, you could get better tasting fresher beans from a cafe or natural foods store.
