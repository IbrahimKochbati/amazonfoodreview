My latest purchase was the Honey Wheat variety, but I've had the Hi Protein and Spelt varieties in the past.  I have really enjoyed all three of them.          The Honey Wheat have a good taste and crunch.  It took me about five pretzels to get used to them as compared to "normal" pretzels, but then I really got into them.  I like the taste, but I also like the ingredients and nutrition.  The following can be found on the web, but I'm adding it here for convenience:          Ingredients:  Organic unbleached wheat flour, organic whole wheat flour, organic honey, organic sugar, organic sunflower oil, salt, yeast, soda.          Nutritional Facts:  Serving Size: 20 pretzels (30g), Calories per Serving: 110, Calories from fat: 10, Total Fat: 1g (saturated fat: 0g), Cholesterol: 0mg, Sodium: 180mg, Total Carbohydrates: 22g (dietary fiber: 3g, sugars: 2g), Protein: 2g          Some typical advice   watch for sales on these!  I got the Honey Wheat 7 oz bags, 12 pack for twelve dollars in October 2010 (the price is why I decided to try them).  As of this writing, they are almost sixty dollars.  At a dollar a bag, I'll recommend them to everyone.  At five dollars a bag...all I can say is that I wouldn't pay that much for these, or any pretzel in a 7 oz bag.
