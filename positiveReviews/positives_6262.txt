Tazo Sweet Cinnamon Spice Tea is a very tasteful tea with no unpleasant after taste. I am not sure what a person can say about tea, but this flavor is one of the best I have ever had. It makes great hot tea or iced tea. It's pleasant flavor is a treat all by itself and is excellent without any sweetener.          Some teas leave a bitter or strange after taste but this tea does not. Every cup is very special. Even if you leave the tea bag in your cup for a long time, it never gets bitter. Wonderful product!
