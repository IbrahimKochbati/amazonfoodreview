I saw these on sale at a local store and only bought one because I wasn't sure I'd like them. Wrong! They were GREAT and I loved them! Couldn't wait to get more. The portion could be small for some, but for me it isn't. And only 80 calories for all of it? I could not believe that. The tuna salad is slightly sweet with some little veggie chunks in it, really creamy, too. The can opens easy (like a foil on top) and the salad seems to match up to the 6 crackers nicely! I need to get more, only have 3 left! I highly recommend these, but I do know stuff like this is a taste preference, but I am very happy!
