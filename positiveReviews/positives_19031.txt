We tried this tonight for pizza crust. It really wasn't too bad, but there are some issues to be aware of if you are going to use it. The directions say add 1 3 cup of very hot water and mix to form a soft dough. No way does this happen. you have to get your hands in there and kind of work it all together and then it is pretty dry and crumbly. Kneading  ings it together somewhat. As far as getting it in the pan, just be patient. Flatten it out as best you can and then start working from the center and press outwards. It takes a lot of work, but you can cover a 12 inch pan with it. It will be very thin though. I didn't find the flavor all that objectionable if you have a lot of toppings on it. I think the trick to all this low carb stuff is desperation anyway. Once you are on the diet long enough even cardboard tastes good. :0)
