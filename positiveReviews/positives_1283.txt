I can't believe these are actually decent for you.  They taste awesome!  I love these chips, they have great crunch and a great amount of flavor.  I am addicted to these and so is my boyfriend (who hates anything that's healthy).  I recommend these to all my friends.  I'm on the auto refill program but keep having to reorder early since my bf keeps eating them all.
