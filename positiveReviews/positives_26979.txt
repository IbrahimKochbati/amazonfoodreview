The teriyaki jerky was very flavorful, not too sweet or salty; and pleasantly chewy too, as opposed to the dry stringy stuff I've tried elsewhere. The price was reasonable. My main problem is that several bags went moldy within weeks. Several other buyers have the same complaint. The first time I thought it came that way and it slipped by me. I checked as the other bags arrived, and saw them quickly turn fuzzy. I realized I'd have to eat it all within a week or two or throw it out once it starts to go bad. It may be moot, since it's been discontinued as of March 2011. I don't mind the additives so much, but would  appreciate if (assuming they  ing it back) the stuff could keep a bit longer.
