I am a coffee lover and mild heartburn sufferer so I was excited to try this coffee to see if it would make a difference .  I've never tried a low acid coffee. I just modify my diet to manage my heartburn and take the occasional antacid.  I made this coffee in the morning before work so I was sort of rushed and forgot to stop and smell it before I put it in the coffee maker.  But really, a good coffee with fill your nose with that delicious coffee aroma and one shouldn't have to make an effort to remember to smell it.  I'm glad I didn't though because as it was  ewing my kitchen was filled with a combination of woodiness, smoke, and campfire....from coffee!          Now I love my morning coffee so even the less than appetizing smell was not going to deter me (that and I had to get to work)!  As I usually do I poured a cup for myself and poured the rest into my huge thermos.  Drinking the coffee was slightly less unpleasent than the smell suggested it would be.  While sipping I was reminded of drinking a too heavily oaked Cabernet.  Yes, I enjoy red wine too, perhaps that's why I get heartburn? As this coffee cooled in my cup it actually tasted better...not good but better then the first couple of sips.  The manufactures claim this coffee is not bitter..I disagree.  In addition to wood, smoke, and campfire, bitter was the extra added layer of flavor.          I tried this coffee black first, then with cream, and then later in the day I took the rest and mixed half coffee with half skim milk on ice.  The overwhelming woodiness was present each time.  I'm giving this coffee two stars instead of one because I did have three cups instead of throwing it out after the first sip...hey sometimes caffeine is caffeine...but I would never buy this.  I usually buy my coffee from Dean's Beans online but I also enjoy the lower end coffees like Yuban and Kirkland (Costco  and).  So I'm definitely not a coffee snob.  Good coffee is good coffee.  This was not!
