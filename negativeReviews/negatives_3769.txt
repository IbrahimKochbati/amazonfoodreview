What I received today in shipment is a joke! I have the product on the desk in front of me. I see 4 packages of Green Mountain Coffee..Breakfast Blend. The 4 packages arrived NOT in an outer box! The packages are held together with yellow strapping tape. ALL 4 packages are ripped open in one way or another. One package has the bottom ripped off almost entirely and several coffee pods are missing. This disaster of shipping  was sitting out on my front porch in 95+ heat on a very humid Texas day. Mice, giant tree cockroaches, or kitties could have been prowling around inside the boxes. I can't believe UPS even accepted such a crappy packaging attempt. PLUS...I tried to find this Mike's Grocer online. The address on the return slip is 7 Prospect ST APT #4....an APARTMENT???? How do I even know where in the heck these pods originated? I LOVE Amazon and buy almost everything from them. This is my first REALLY horrible experience. Amazon....please get rid of this retailer!!!!!! Brenda Spurlin
