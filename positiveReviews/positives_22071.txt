These peas are fantastic!  Good deal for a good product.  I was hesitant to purchase after reading some reviews, but I made the right choice.  5 Lbs is a huge amount of peas, but I love them.  I'm through with about 1 5 of them now, about 3 weeks after they arrived.  I took a large container of them to work at the office, and they're a hit.  Everyone's asking to try them.  They're great for a quick pick me up if you're a little tired.  I sealed the rest of the peas in a Ziploc until I need them.          Would I purchase them again? Absolutely!
