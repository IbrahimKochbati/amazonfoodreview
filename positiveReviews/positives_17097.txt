My dog Cooper enjoys this toy as much as he loves his Kong toys.  He still hasn't figured out how to get the food out, but it keeps him occupied for a couple of hours as he tries to figure out how to get it.  Most of the time he chews on the rope.  He has a strong bite and so far the rope is still holding on strong    this is also why I bought him the medium large. I felt that if I got him a small he'd chew the rope right off.          The only con is that the toy is a little big for him to carry sometimes, and I didn't realize that the plastic bottle was going to be as hard as it is so it makes loud annoying sounds when it drops on the tile and hard wood when he tries to carry it on top of the sofa or bed. So other than the loud banging noises, I'd say this is a good toy. Highly recommend if you have carpet.
