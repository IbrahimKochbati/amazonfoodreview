I'd purchased these based on the reviews here and their reputation a oad. A delightful little tea time anytime snack, these little cookies do remind you of graham crackers in taste, but they're not as sweet and have a slight baking soda aftertaste that remind me of Violet Crumbles. The consistency is course grain but crumbly. In your mouth, the cookie falls apart into small crumbs like what you'd find on a graham cracker pie crust.          Amazon did a wonderful job in shipping. I know a lot of people have stated that theirs came in crumbled, but almost none of mine were  oken. Mine arrived as a box inside a box and had bubble wrap and tacky tape that tried to keep each roll stationary. But another reason for their good condition might have been that they didn't have to stay in transit long. It looks like mine came out of Florida, and they were delivered to South Georgia. Either way, I'm extremely satisifed with the quality and shipping of my purchase.
