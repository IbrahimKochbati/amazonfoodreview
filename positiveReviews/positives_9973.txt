so even though i did not like everything that was in the sampler (space food sticks are just like energy bars from the gym), the sampler was exactly what it said it would be, and then some. i was surprised by how much was in the sampler, you get a lot for your money. whats best is you get multiple ice cream bars, and those are great! just  eak off a piece and let it melt on your tongue and youll see it really is ice cream! took it to a backyard bbq and it was a hit! have not tried the peaches or apples yet, but the ice cream alone makes this a five star product!
