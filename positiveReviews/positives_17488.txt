My main use for almond, soy, or rice milk is to use in coffee or tea.  The best so far is Silk soymilk original but this Silk almond milk is very nearly as good.  Actually as far as taste goes I'd say the almond milk might be best but for using in coffee the soy edges out the almond for creaminess.  I totally enjoy them both and have been buying the almond milk from Amazon at a very fair price.  But now it's off the Subscribe and Save program so the cost will go up .  I intend to continue buying either Silk almond or Silk soy milk because they are the best for me.
