I originally bought this for my 3 year old who is very picky about textures in her food drinks and will go days without eating anything but milk. When I found this I thought it would be great because she loves chocolate milk and this is highly nutritious so I ordered it. When I made a cup of this with milk it seemed like it needed more chocolate flavor so I added ovaltine and it was delicious. So I hid it in a sippy cup so she wouldn't see the tiny green particles floating on top and I didn't tell her anything was different about it but as soon as she started drinking it she started gagging and cried "I don't like this seedy chocolate milk!"          Not wanting to waste it my husband and I have been drinking it. We have both noticed that when we drink it we feel really good all day! So if your child doesn't have a problem with textures then I think this product would be great for you!
