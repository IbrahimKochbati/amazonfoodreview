I have purchased this product in the past through Amazon for my twins and it was good. However, the last time I ordered the 6 pack in June, the cereal was stale and smelly. I opened a few cans and they were all the same. I called Amazon customer service and they were very helpful and gave me a refund. I don't think I will purchase this item again through Amazon, although I do purchase the majority of items for my twins(including diapers) at a great price from them.
