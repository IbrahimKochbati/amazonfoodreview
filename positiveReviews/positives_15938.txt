I have worked with 10 packets of the stuff over 3 months, different blenders, differnt types ice and I Cannot get it to the consistency flavor of what I had in the store. It's tasty and is the best I can do, as I MISS the real thing. One tip: If you put the amount of ice it says on package it is way too watered down. Next time in Vegas or NY I will go get dessert MANY times as the home package just doesn't do it.
