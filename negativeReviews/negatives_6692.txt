I LOVE this coffee.  Unfortunately, I have a box and a half that will never get used.  Why?  Because I bought them and 4 out of the first 10 cups used blew open inside my Keurig  ewer, blowing hot water and coffee grounds all over the inside of my  ewer and all over my countertop.          I can't say what the problem was   maybe I just got a bad batch of K Cups, but for there to be that many defective cups in one box was very odd.  I've never, ever had that happen with any other K Cups by Green Mountain or any other company.          Anyone wanna buy a box and a half of these?  : )
