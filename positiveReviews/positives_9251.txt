Aspen Mulling eggnog mix does not taste exactly like real eggnog, but pretty darn close. It is a bit sweeter and not as rich as real eggnog, unless you mix with cream and milk (the manufacturer recommends mixing with milk). I add a touch of vanilla and nutmeg to the mix, and use it to make eggnog lattes. Delicious, and now I enjoy eggnog lattes year round. I find that I can make an eggnog latte using this product that tastes more like eggnog than using real eggnog. When mixed with fat free half and half, you can enjoy the taste of eggnog with no cholesterol, no fat, and low carbohydrates. If you mix with regular half and half, even creamier. When mixing, let it stand for 10 to 15 minutes before using. No need to mix and let stand overnight, tends to separate out if left sitting overnight.
