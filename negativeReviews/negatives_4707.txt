The chicken pot pie variety was extremely runny, interestingly that seemed to be the only part my cats ate, the licked up the  oth.  But they literally nosed the potatoes and carrots right off their plates.  It was like watching picky toddlers.  I divided one can between three cats and I still had about a half a can left after they ate.  I also watched as they finished all three cats ran to the litter box. (apparently it comes out watery too)          One of my cats   the little vixen whose part siamese then went and did a protest in my laundry hamper.          So when they tried the seasame chicken I only gave it to the two critters who don't voice their displeasure so eloquently.  They still did not finish their meals, again the carrots hit the floor, and perhaps the most suprising, normally when I open a can of cat food they come a running, not so on either opening, and even though the company claims the food smells more appealing, I disagree, as did the cats.          So it's 3 stars because at least they ate some of it, but I'm very sorry to say they didn't appear to like it.
