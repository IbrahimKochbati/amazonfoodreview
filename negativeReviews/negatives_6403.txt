The price was right, and I like choosing USA made rawhides, but unfortunately the yellow  own color of the rawhides leaves stains on the carpet.  It comes up with a carpet cleaner, but I don't feel like having to do that after every rawhide for both my dogs.  My dogs did seem to like the rawhides, but they aren't the ones paying for the carpet cleaning.
