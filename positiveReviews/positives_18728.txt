Have tried it a few ways...including the traditional boneless chicken  east.  Instructions on the package were dead on...made a beautiful  east that had a nice crunchy exterior (fairly thin though...if you wanted thicker you might try egg?  If I try this I'll let you know if it works) and a lovely moist interior          The only reason I gave it 4 stars was one thing...I personally don't really care for celery as a seasoning and it's very strong in this packet.  For me at least that's not a great thing :(          Another great use is just to use it as a general seasoning...works in rice and my boyfriend's "veggie burgers" (made of oatmeal and onions)...gives a really nice flavor this way too.
