Only reason this isn't five stars is bc it doesn't exactly taste like authentic Pho. The huge BUT is that it is a REALLY good soup base and good noodles   kinda more spaghetti like then a rice noodle. You won't regret the purchase. Tip: cook it in a pot instead of the microwave whenever you can. The noodles come out better.
