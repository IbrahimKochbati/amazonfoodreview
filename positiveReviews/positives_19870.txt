As other reviewers have noted, this has disappeared from store shelves in the NYC area as well.  The only place I've been able to get it consistently is from the Borden online store.  My "trick", which I'll share for the first time, is to make it with apple cider instead of water. The additional flavor gives it an incredible kick. It adds some calories, of course, but for a treat you enjoy once or twice a year it's a small price to pay.  Hoping that Amazon will be successful in  inging back this beloved favorite.
