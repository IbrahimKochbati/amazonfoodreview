My dog just loves these chews and as a bonus, they have a coating that is good for keeping her teeth clean and healthy.  These are composite product as opposed to a rawhide chew.  They do not splinter and do not make a big sloppy mess, but they do have a pretty strong smell.  We give her one a day and if we forget, she asks for it.  The price through Amazon was about half what my vet charged.
