Taste is just Ok, a bit greasy compare to 94% fat free micro kettle pop corn bags (purchases here at better cost.) Coconut flavor is like coconut flakes flavoring.     Not a good value since you get 18 bags for $30. Purchased it because I wondered about it since I love Coconut.     Won't buy again because of the greasy feeling and high cost.
