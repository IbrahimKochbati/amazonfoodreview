I like to powder it to add to my lattes. I first discovered it when going to a local LA coffee house where they made Mexican Hot Chocolate and Mexican Mochas. Yummy! So I started making them at home with my espresso press and blending the chocolate in my milk and adding it to espresso. Whola, a homemade Mexican Mocha thanks to Abuelita!
