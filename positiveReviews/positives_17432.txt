YUM. Really, I can see how people use this as a replacement for coffee. I think it tastes similar, but not really just like coffee. It is incredibly tasty, though. I have only tried this flavor, as the spicy chocolate was right up my alley. It isn't all that spicy when prepared, though, unless you make it uber strong. I made the mistake of getting this package   didn't realize it was the espresso grind  it is pretty fine, and I was using a strainer at first and now a french press, neither of which removes all the tiniest particles. It works just fine in a drip coffee maker, though  I tested it with my mom's. I would get the coarse ground next time, though, since I don't have a drip coffee maker. Other than that user error issue, it's a great product. Sweet, nice collage of flavors, with a similar depth and viscosity to coffee.
