I have a four month old st Bernard puppy and have always fed him and my 6 year old German shep hill science.  I did some research and found out how awful that stuff is.  I always thought expensive meant good.  Even my picky gs eats this with no canned dog food or any other incentive.  Of course the puppy will eat anything, and everything, lol,but his coat is beautiful and I have not had any digestion problems.  I love that it is USDA grade meat and no corn.  Corn can kill st bernards.  All this for just a couple bucks more than hills science.  Love the fact that I can feed both dogs same food on the all stages kind.
