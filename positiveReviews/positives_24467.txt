This was my favorite meat substitute as a child and I still love them. My two vegetarian grandsons do also. They are good in casseroles as well as  eaded and pan fried. They are supposed to simulate seafood but can be used as a substitute for chicken as well. I prefer now to buy the lower fat variety but will buy the classic Worthington Skallops if that is all that is avialable.
