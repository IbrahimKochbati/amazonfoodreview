I don't have any real "issues" with this product.  The small packages are fine for a small batch, which of course is the reason for these small envelopes instead of a large can.  Sometimes you'll open a large can and if you don't use it, then it becomes "stale".  But on the other hand,  ead crumbs can be a lot less expensive.  Also, if you want to spice it up, then try adding a little extra seasoning. . . . For example, a little cayenne pepper or hot pepper flakes.  Perhaps a bit of Mrs. Dash.  How about a touch of garlic powder.  You might also try jerk seasoning. . . Cajon seasoning. .  .or other dry seasoning blend.
