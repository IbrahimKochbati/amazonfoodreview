My dog Zoe recently has had to take 7 pills a day!  Instead of struggling with her to get them down, she actually DROOLS when I get the pill pockets out. I do recommend giving your dog a couple of them without the pill beforehand, because my dog usually spits out any new treat the first time, sniffs it out, chews it, etc.  Now she just gobbles it up. They easily mold around the pill, and I do follow the directions (not touching the pill pocket with the fingers that touched the pill).  Anyways, it's been a week, so hopefully the success will continue. GO PILL POCKETS! (lol)          Edit: It's been 3 weeks, and still a success.  I don't even do the "not touching the pill pocket with the fingers that touched the pill" thing anymore.  Plus, I now  eak off pieces to fit around the small pills, and 1 large capsule pill pocket can be split to mold around 2 capsules, although this will vary in others.
