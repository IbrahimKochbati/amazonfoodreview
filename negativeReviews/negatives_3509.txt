I ordered these chestnuts on 8 20 2012 and received them on 8 24 2012.  The listed date of production on most of these packages is 10 29 2011 with an expiration date of 12 28 2012.  However, multiple packages contained molded, black chestnuts.  The insides of the molded packages were also very wet and sticky.          I've purchased Galil chestnuts from local stores in the past and the products SHOULD be dry when opened and the chestnuts should be a tan  own color.
