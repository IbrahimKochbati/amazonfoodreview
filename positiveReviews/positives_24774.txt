Beautiful popcorn when popped and when sitting on the shelf waiting. It popped both white and yellow making the bowl just look more appealing. The hulls did just explode! It was amazing, I've never had popcorn do that before. Great deal, I'm glad we bought the 6 pack. Worked out to about $2 lb. I think some people who gave a bad review must have gotten a bad batch because ours is awesome!
