We've had dogs and cats for years and always fed them Science Diet or Iams.  Our newest dog was an itcher and after research, I decided to try a new dog food.  I settled on Canidae for the same reason as the other reviewers; top notch ingredients at a reasonable price.          She loves it.  I alternate dry with dry wet every other day.  And, best of all, no more itching or hot spots.  Vet believes that she was allergic to corn products in Iams; a common allergy for dogs.          And the added benefits are about the poop; less poop to pick up, poop is solid, not runny, and like the other reviewer said, the poop is way less smelly.
