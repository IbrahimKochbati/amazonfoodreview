My wife had some coffee at the Cafe d'Arte coffee shop when visiting her mother last year. She raved about it so much that I contacted their web site to sample some. It was great. Some friends who own a local restaurant (which prides itself on its good coffee) agreed that it was the best they ever had. I reordered several times, before deciding to look up the price on Amazon.     Short version: Same coffee, much better price.
