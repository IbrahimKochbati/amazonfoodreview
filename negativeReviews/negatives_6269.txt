We have loved this product until the last few days.  As I was playing w my daughter who is 20 months, she said "mommy tummy hurts" and I heard it gurgling.  Her dad heard and said:  "...well I opened a new can of Oatmeal yesterday, and it smelled horrible, looks very different than past cans".  Sure enough, I opened it and it was horrible smelling and looked bad  (as noted in other reviews, dark grey flakes mixed in, much darker than normal).  There MUST be something wrong   I plan to contact the company tomorrow and would NOT recommend right now.
