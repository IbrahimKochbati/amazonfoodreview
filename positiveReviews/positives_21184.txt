It is really hard to find good vegetarian chili that has a nice balance of seasoning, beans, and textured protein. Worthington does it just right. We turned to this  and after Health Valley stopped making our favorite chili and went to weird flavors including Mango. Dennison's veggie chili was fine, but is also no longer sold. Thank goodness we found Worthington. From the first taste we were happy. This one is chunky enough to be spooned on veggie dogs or veggie burgers or be used for chili mac. These are large cans, so two of us split one for lunch.  Thank you Worthington!
