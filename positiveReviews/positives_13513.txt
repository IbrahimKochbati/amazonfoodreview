A couple years ago, my husband pointed this cocoa out to me.  He hadn't tried it, but he'd always been amused by the granny's mischievous smile.  Since he'd been trading smirks with Abuelita for so long, I insisted we try it, and we haven't looked back.  Made with milk, the cocoa has a full flavor complemented by a nice, spicy accent.  Everything else now tastes bland by comparison.
