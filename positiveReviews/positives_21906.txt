I always keep plenty of this tea on hand, as it's not only my favorite, but a favorite of everyone who stops over for some hot tea during the Fall and Winter.     (I always have to show off my Keurig at every opportunity   I love that machine and think everyone who drinks coffee or tea should have one!)          The flavor of the CS Mandarin Orange tea reminds me of the "Friendship Tea" (Tang, Nestea instant tea and Lemonade drink mixes, sugar, spices   sometimes called "Russian Tea"    that I remember from when I was a child. It's a bold, flavorful tea that is perfect for chilly nights. And it smells wonderful while it's  ewing. :o)
