Condiments add such vi ancy and depth to dishes and this mustard can stand alone!.  I had read about this mustard on a food blog written by a former Chez Panisse chef.  I knew I had to try it.  I'm hooked!  It is a sublime addition to vinaigrette but when spread on rye  ead with a few slices of ham ......love at first bite!
