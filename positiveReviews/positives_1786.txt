I am a long distance runner and a belly dancer.  My back objects to the dancing and my knees object to the running.  I was having a lot of trouble managing my pain and still doing my activities with ibuprofen alone.  I read about tart cherry juice in my running magazine, and I decided to give it a try after reading some of the other reviews here on Amazon.          I am simply blown away by the difference!  My body really reacts to this stuff.  My knee pain has disappeared, and my back only hurts during really deep back bends.  I had same day relief, too.  I can definitely tell the difference on days where I forget to take this!  As an added bonus, I have noted a marked decrease in how sore my muscles are, as well.  I wish I had heard about this sooner!          I follow what it says on the bottle, 1 once twice daily.  At first, I was just using a tablespoon and licking it out of the tablespoon (2TBS 1 oz.), which I still do in the mornings, but good lord this stuff is tart!  The first one isn't too bad, I think mostly because your taste buds are in shock.  The second one really gets me, though!  Lately, I've been mixing my ounce into a cup of orange juice at dinner, which looks disgusting but tastes, surprisingly, really good.          I really hope this product comes back in stock soon, I don't think I could go without it and I'm hesitant to switch to a different  and.
