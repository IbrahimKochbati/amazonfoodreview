I bought this olive oil because of the testing done by University California Davis in early 2010.  The results showed that this product passed for being extra virgin olive oil for all 3 samples, and it was the only imported oil to the United States of 14 tested that passed all 3 samples.  It seems to be more potent (because it's spicier) than the, Trader Joe's organic  and which cost 40% less.  You do know that about 80% of all extra virgin olive oil products are not 100% extra virgin olive oil.  Five stars because it's a decent price and I trust this product for being extra virgin more than other name  ands.     This oil is from Italy, which means this oil is milled in October or November or December, as with all northern hemisphere olive oils.  The southern hemisphere olive oils are milled in June and July.
