My pup loves it!! The minute I open my amazon package he smelled the bones! He instantly sat and waited patiently for me to open the pack of Smartbones.          I am so glad I finally found a better alternative to rawhide. I feel more ease at heart leaving the house with this treat in his paws.          The only reason I am giving it four stars it's because my pup was able to finish quite quickly. Otherwise I am very happy with this product and it actually smells yummy. The smell reminds me of sweet milk.
