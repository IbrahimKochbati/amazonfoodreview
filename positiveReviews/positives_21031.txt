I used to be a big fan of Jet Fuel but I found it to be a little bitter. I ordered revv as part of a promotion with Keurig and I am amazed at how good this coffee is.     It definitely has the same kick as Jet Fuel but it's sooo smooth. I didn't think a coffee this strong could be this smooth. I love it.     I was worried when I ordered 2 boxes  in a buy 2 get 2 deal. I thought "what if I don't like it?" But I went ahead to balance the order out. Now I'm sorry I didn't get 4 boxes of the stuff.     If you like your coffee with a kick, you've gotta' try this. If you want a bigger kick try the revv pulse. (My caffeine addiction hasn't escalated to pulse levels yet)          Kuerig Owners make sure to register your  ewer with [...] and become eligible for a buy 2 get 2 purchase. It's an excellent deal.
