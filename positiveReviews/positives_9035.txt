Where do you put your k cups? Right F'ing here. That's where.          This thing is solid and doesn't slide around on the counter top plus it's sturdy enough to handle the Platinum Keurig without issue and it looks saucey too.          I only gave it 4 stars as the slider tray was is a little bent. Only noticeable if you're right up next to it. Definitely not the packaging or shipping damage, looks like it came from the factory this way.          **also, since its of stock from this store, you can find it at Bed Bad Beyond for $25**
