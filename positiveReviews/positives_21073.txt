I bought this product to use with a stovetop espresso maker in making homemade Cuban coffee products. It is as authentic as you can get! I grew up in Miami and the Cuban coffee stands were a staple. I live in Jacksonville now and there is nothing authentic in the city. This takes me back and is an enjoyable  ew, but any other standards.
