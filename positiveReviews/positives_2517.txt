I was disappointed by the fact that all three boxes I received had already expired.  Luckily enough, the flavors had not yet degraded.          I specifically bought these in order to get the peppermint flavor.  I was hoping for more.  The peppermint hot chocolate does not have much peppermint flavor to it, but we will still enjoy it and both of the other flavors.
