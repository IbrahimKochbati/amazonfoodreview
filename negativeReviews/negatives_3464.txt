Everyone raves about Pamela's mixes, so I had high hopes. My kids seem to like them, so that's good. Perhaps if I had eaten them fresh from the oven I would have liked them more. I ate one the next day and found it to be the usual grainy, gritty texture I associate with gluten free products. After a few chews it was like a mouthful of mud. I will definitely be looking for something else.
