This was the first time I have made Mongolian Beef.  My son suggested it, he had it at a friend's house.  So with our next Chinese dinner (I like to make all my own foods) we made this.  It was a tad spicy for me, perhaps I needed to add more beef or a little water.  Will definitely make again.  By the way, you can buy the seasoning packet at Wal Mart.          Redd1295
