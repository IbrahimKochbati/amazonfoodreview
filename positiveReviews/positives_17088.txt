It took a little while (15 minutes or so) for Maya to get used to this and figure out how it worked, but now that she has it has become her favorite toy.  At first, it'd take her about 40 minutes or so to get all the food out (I put her kibble in it), but as she got the hang of it, it would only take her about 10 minutes.  I put a tennis ball inside the jar with the kibble to make it a little harder for her and now, on average, it takes her about 30 minutes.  She loves this toy and I love watching her toss around the jar and fiddling with the rope to get the kibble out.
