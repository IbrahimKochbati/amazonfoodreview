Newman's Own Organic Pretzels are far better than any other pretzel I've eaten. As most probably know, any product Newman's Own produces is superior to competitor  ands. My favorite Newman's Own pretzel however is their Organic Spelt Flour Pretzel. Once you eaten them, no other pretzel compares. Unfortunaly, very few retail outlets carry Newman's Own Organic Spelt Pretzels. The only stores I've been able to find them is at the Whole Foods Grocery Chain. There are not many Whole Foods around, but it worth the trip.
