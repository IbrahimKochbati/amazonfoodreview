This organic, grass fed ghee embodies everything that a modern, healthful food should be. It is tasty, healthful, fresh, and lovingly produced by hand in small batches and according to ages old methods and principles.          I began using this ghee as a part of a transition to eating more healthy, home cooked foods. More recently, I participated in an Ayurvedic cleanse that required that I take 1 4 cup of plain, warm ghee for several mornings straight! Though this can be an unpleasant experience with ghee of lower quality, the Pure Indian Foods ghee was truly delicious. The flavor is clean and sweet, without any of the harshness or overbearing unctuousness of other ghees (even those labelled as organic). And not a hint of rancidity, to which I'm very sensitive.          Only unhomogenized milk is used for this ghee, which is unusual and extremely beneficial. Homogenization alters the structure of milkfats and adversely impacts their bioavailability and handling in the blood. This attention to the quality of raw materials is just one example of this company's dedication to their customers' health.          Highly recommended.
