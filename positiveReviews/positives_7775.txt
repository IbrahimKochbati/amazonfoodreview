These microwave pork rinds are quite tasty for them to be cooked in the microwave!  My husband and I love the hot & spicy flavor better than the plain because it has more flavor.  The only drawback I see to these is that if you have an older microwave or one that is not as powerful (at least 1100 watts), the pork rinds do not cook as well.
