I discovered the use of this on Fried Zuccini at the Orange County California Swap meet. Lately I have used only this on Eggs, but I was suprised what it did for Sea Scalops. Experiment on the amount as you can put too much on. You can also use the same product, But it has MSG in it.     E L Smith Seaside,CA
