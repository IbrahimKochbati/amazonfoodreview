I haven't tried hibiscus tea before, so I can't compare it across the board, but this stuff is delicious.     Whole flowers, and when steeped it creates a sour, floral, really rich tea that's very drinkable.  I left the bag at work and came back only to find half of it gone!  All of my friends like it too.  Highly recommended.
