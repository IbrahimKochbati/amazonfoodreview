A lovely pink drink...the packaging is very cute and inviting, so I was already enticed into wanting to enjoy the drink. And it's actually quite good! Always best when chilled...the mix of kiwis and strawberries is a unique combination, slightly sour then sweet.          I like the carbonation, if it didn't have that it would just be a strange juice. I like that this is 100% juice and all natural, the fruit flavor is good without additional sugar or corn syrup...I would recommend giving it a try!
