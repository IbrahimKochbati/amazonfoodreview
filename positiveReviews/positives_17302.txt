Annie Chun's Vietnamese Pho Soup Bowl is filling and delicious. A mild scallion flavored  oth in soft noodles describes it best adding it has a very fresh taste. I, like another reviewer, prefer to take it up a notch with spice, and thought possibly I'd  be able to taste ginger or other mentioned spices in Annie's description of the soup bowl, but I could not. Nonetheless I would recommend and purchase it again, it was certainly tasty and even similar to restaurant Pho Soup I have eaten from a Vietnamese Restaurant. Added bonuses are the soup comes with an eco friendly bowl and Annie uses all natural and organic ingredients.
