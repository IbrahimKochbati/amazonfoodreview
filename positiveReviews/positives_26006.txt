I loaded my gluten free pancake with Brazil Nut Butter and Bibb lettuce, rolled it up and happily chewed.  So happily that I did two more.  Nice flavor.  Then when I was making dinner, I decided to add some Brazil Nut Butter to my gravy   which improved the flavor so much that I decided to reserve the rest on my Butter for future gravies.  Thanks.
