I have had many different versions of Earl Grey tea and I am a fan, so when I read such raving reviews as this tea has received I had to try it. I now have three canisters of this Rishi version of Earl Grey and perhaps I will be more impressed by the second or third canister; so far however, I am not impressed. As I suspect, perhaps I received a stale batch, but the product I have been drinking is definitely not superior to Trader Joe's "Earl Grey Tea" bags in terms of strength or flavor.
