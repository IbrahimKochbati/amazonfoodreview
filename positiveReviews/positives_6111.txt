Starbucks Via will not replace a well crafted hand  ewed cup of coffee from your favorite coffee shop, but it's a hell of a lot better than what you probably expect instant coffee to taste like.          If your experience with instant coffee stops at Taster's Choice or Folgers, be prepared to be wowed. Those products produce a result that tastes and looks like water with some coffee flavoring. Starbucks Via is much more like a "real" cup of coffee.          Another advantage of Via is that the packets are soluble in cold or tepid water, so it's possible to mix yourself a glass of iced coffee right away, rather than having to  ew and then cool coffee first.          At about $1 per cup, it's certainly less expensive than fresh  ewed Starbucks coffee, though it's still more expensive than  ewing coffee at home using a drip maker, french press or whatever other process you prefer. But for when you're on the run or on the road, it's quite a serviceable and enjoyable cup of coffee without too much muss and fuss. I  ing Via packets with me when I travel, for example, and keep them on hand for when I'm not in the mood or don't have the time to  ew a whole pot.
