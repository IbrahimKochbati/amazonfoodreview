a nice sour hint and rather pleasant. It's a unique mint that could evaporate in the mouth quickly and be most satisfying. No sugars, made with natural lime oil and Xylitol, natural fruit and vegge color, ciric acid   nothing else   made in the USA,  tin manufactured in China.  Now to keep my fingers out of the tin   has become a favorite addiction.
