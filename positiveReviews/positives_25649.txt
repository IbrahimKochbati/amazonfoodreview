I've been a daily drinker of Starbucks French Roast for quite some time. I want a bold coffee with great flavor and that delivered. So does Sumatra which is now my favorite in the X Bold line. The beans have a very unique smell to them and the coffee starts off with bold flavor and finishes with a nice herbal, but not overpowering, taste.
