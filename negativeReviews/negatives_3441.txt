I liked the coffee, it was bold but not bitter. I can't recommend though, due to at least 6 k cups "blowing up" in my Keurig.          The whole point of the Keurig is that it's quick, easy, and you get a decent cup of coffee out of it. When you're running late in the morning, and the seal around the K Cup  eaks and coffee   grounds go all over and you've got to clean it up, it's no longer a convenience and is a huge of a hassle.          I'm sticking with the Tully's, I've gone through 4 boxes (200 pcs) so far and not a single "blow up".
