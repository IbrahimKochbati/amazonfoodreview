I'd have given these four stars for flavor IF they had not been hard as rocks. To be fair, I DID buy them on clearance here and Warehouse Deals did give me a refund...if you suck on these for a very long time, they are tasty. It's just that you could  eak a tooth if you tried to chew on them right out of the package. I am thinking they are probably just old stock and fresh ones would be chewy and lovely. The flavor is good and they are adorable.
