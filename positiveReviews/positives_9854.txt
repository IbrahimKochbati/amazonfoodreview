I've consumed coffee ever since my youth in the 50s. Nowadays I will only use whole bean coffees and I've become somewhat fussy even there. Plus, there's the price to be considered. I've found that Trader Joe's and Kirkland Signature have some excellent selections of whole bean coffees at very reasonable prices. They can be very good values, as well as being excellent coffees. One of the latest I've discovered is Kirkland Signature Rwandan Whole Bean Dark Roast Coffee. I bought it at my local warehouse store in a three pound bag.          The Aroma is the first thing you'll notice. Boy, does this stuff smell good! The aroma is wonderful, perhaps even better than the coffee itself. Please don't take that as a negative statement. I'm just saying that if you want to impress guests, just open up a bag of this stuff and the comments will roll in. The coffee itself is quite excellent, as you would expect. It has a nice aroma and a rich dark taste. My own tastes might prefer a slightly lighter roast, but that's only my own tastes and not the fault of the coffee. If you prefer the rich, deep, strongly coffee flavored  ew, give this stuff a try. Wonderful! And it's at a reasonable cost.          Gary Peterson.
