Product arrived damaged and smashed up because packaging is cheap and inadequate to protect milk containers.  Milk was leaking out of box.  I tried to return it but found out that this stuff is non returnable.  So if it arrives all beat up and leaking your stuck with it.  Given how expensive it is, you think they would properly package it.
