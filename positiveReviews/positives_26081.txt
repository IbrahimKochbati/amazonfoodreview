Note: I wrote this review for the 6 lb. bag (which is cheaper per pound than this bag, for some odd reason).          I love this food. I knew the Purina One dry food I was feeding my one cat wasn't the best. After researching several different reputable websites for dry food reviews, I decided to purchase Natural Balance. Several different sites had included Natural Balance among the best dry food (especially for the money). I have been very, very happy!          My cat switched foods effortlessly. I didn't even gradually introduce it like I should have   one day she was eating Purina One, the next Natural Balance. The one major thing I've noticed after weeks on this food? Her coat is SO much SOFTER SHINIER! She's so silky and soft now! Holy cow! I know if it's doing such good things for her fur it's a good sign. Her bowel movements have always been nice and solid, and they look even better on this food. I also have to feed her less each day, which makes the 6 lb. bag last longer than 6 lbs. of the Purina One would have. All in all I'm a convert, and I will keep buying this food. Thanks, Natural Balance!
