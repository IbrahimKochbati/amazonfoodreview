These chips are my family's favorite.  They are absolutely fabulous with guacamole because they are not too salty.  They pick up salsa well too, especially fresh salsa because of their shape.  You get just the right amount of salsa.  These chips don't take over the dip, they compliment whatever you dip them in.  They're fine without dip also, but if you are used to a salty chip, you might find them a bit plain. Tortilla chips are a staple at our house and these are the best you can get except in an authentic Mexican restaurant.          Hope you enjoy them as much as we do.
