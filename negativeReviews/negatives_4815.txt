McVities digestive biscuits are great   not nearly as sweet as competitors. Biggest problem is how many are  oken by the time they get to you. The Amazon packaging job does not hold up in shipping. This is true for all types of digestives I have received over the last couple of years from Amazon. Unfortunately they are the best source in the US. I wish they could think up a better packaging scenario for fragile items like this.
