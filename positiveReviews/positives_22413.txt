We have been using this for over a year now.  We love it.  It pops perfect popcorn every time. In fact, we like it more than the popcorn at the movie theater.  It is possible to not put all the oil or salt in (with a little practice) if you have guests who want less flavor.  But we think it is perfect the way it is...every time.
