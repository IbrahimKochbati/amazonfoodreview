Excellent, tart concentrated fruit juices  4*          I'm a big fan of the Da Frut concentrates on several counts.          First is convenience, they can be kept on the shelf (instead of the freezer) until opened.          Second, cost: locally, the passion fruit is the most expensive at about $3.50   bottle    but that mixes up to "at least" a gallon.  Other flavors run about $2, plus or minus, and make either a gallon or half gallon.          Most important, they are unsweetened, leaving it to the customer to provide any extra sugar desired.  This is, of course, crucial for those trying to control their sugar intake, simply as calory control or because of diabetes, hyperactivity or other conditions.  But also it allows one to avoid the oversweetness of so many bottled juices on grocery store shelves, either due to the sugary apple   grape juice base or even added sweeteners.  If you choose to try any of the Da Fruta juices, I'd suggest you start with no added sugar and gradually add a few spoonfuls at a time (to that gallon or half gallon, not per serving!) until you reach your comfort zone.  I've been leaning toward the little if any sugar end of the spectrum lately, and find the result very refreshing and thirst quenching.  Of the two products I have in hand at the moment, the passion fruit has 2 g of sugars per serving (19 servings per container), and the cashew has 3 g of sugars.          Unfortunately, I don't have freshly squeezed juices to compare these concentrates with, nor even any other equivalent products (such as bottled whole or frozen concentrate).  They are nothing like the heavily sweetened canned "nectars" that are available in some groceries.  Considered on their own, they are flavorful, tart and refreshing, and allow you to mix to the strength and sweetness desired.
