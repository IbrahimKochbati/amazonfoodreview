So I have never tried Sencha before. Maybe it is just a "type" of green tea that I am not used to, but one thing is for sure, I am fanatical about my green tea. I've tried most of the premium  ands at the premium stores, but never tasted a sencha like this before.          Mine tasted like grass. No, I'm not stretching the truth; I still have it, and I'm considering sending it back. It smells like cut grass, and tastes like cut grass. Maybe I have a defect? Either way, the taste is absolutely putrid for a tea, and I think someone just mowed some grass, and put the clippings in a container.          Again, I tried to like it after all of the hype. I steeped at the proper temperature for the proper amount of time, and even tried multiple attempts. Nope, tastes looks smells like grass clippings. Maybe I had the wrong expectation, but yuck.          However, I would HIGHLY suggest the Silver Need Organic White produced by Rishi. It is now my favorite tea.
