Spike has been an absolute fav of mine for years.  There is no comparison to enhance the flavor of all veggies.  Sprinkle and add a little olive oil for the barbie.  None of my local stores carry it anymore, so when I found it online, you bet I purchased plenty of bottles.  Good thing, too, because my friends love it, and they take a bottle with them when they leave!
