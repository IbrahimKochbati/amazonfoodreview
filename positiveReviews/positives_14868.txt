I received a tin of this Rishi Organic Earl Grey loose tea as a gift a year ago.  I have enjoyed it immensely.  Having lived a oad, I have become accustomed to  ewing loose tea, as well as using tea bags.  I love this tea so much that I only  ewed it once in a while as a special treat, so as not to use it up all at once.  I wish it was decaffeinated, but other than that, it is truly enjoyable.  Because I like a weaker tea, I only use maybe less than a teaspoon per pot.  The aroma is great also.  The fact that this tea is organic is a bonus.
