This is a very good grade B maple syrup, with a deep, layered flavor and a good sweetness level.          Contrary to what another reviewer mentioned, "organic" does not necessarily mean only that the farmer added nothing; "organic" means (according to Wikipedia, and others) that the syrups are produced using methods that do not involve modern synthetic inputs such as synthetic pesticides and chemical fertilizers.  If you have an organic farm, it means that there are no pesticides or chemical fertilizers used on the farm.          I've tried other Grade B maple syrups (Highland, Trader Joe, plus another I can't remember the name of), and Coombs is at or near the top of the pack.          A very good product.
