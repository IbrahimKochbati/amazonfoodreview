I have 2 female cats. I have given them other Friskies food before, but this is the first time with the "indoor" type and with this flavor.  When I gave it to them they ate it much quicker than they normally eat their food and were licking the bowl to get every last bite. I know different cats prefer different food  for example, if I give my cats food that is not the pate kind they won't touch it  so it may not work for all cats but it was great for mine.
