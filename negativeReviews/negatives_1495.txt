These are a good alternative to candy, but still a lot of sugar in a better form.     Sharkies energy sports chews are not quite so sweet BUT are Healthier becasue the man ingredient is  own rice syrup which is a complex carbohydrate with low glycemic index. Being very hypogylcemic  own rice syrup and agave nectar are the only two natural sweetners that don't cause a "sugar crash". So for this reason the stingers only get 3 stars and sharkies get 5! If you want sweeter in sharkies get the kids version, but they are like stingers  no  own rice syrup. Oh, the  own rice version fill me up faster because they are a complex carbohydrate and don't cause blood sugar fluctuations.
