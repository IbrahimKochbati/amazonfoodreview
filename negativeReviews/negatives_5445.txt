I don't really fit the presumed target audience, i.e., those with medical conditions that require low acid diets. But, I dislike the sour taste of coffees with higher acidity, so I tried this with high hopes.          It  ews up a little strong (I used my preferred ratio). The taste was unspectacular, which isn't to say it was bad. It tasted like the diner coffee I used to love back when true diners were more prevalent. No toasty nutty flavors. No complex aromas. Just honest coffee.          So, I was not disappointed, but I wasn't impressed. For the price, I'll stick to Cafe Altura. I haven't tested the pH, but Altura is rich, strong, smooth, and best of all, consistently NOT sour.          BOTTOM LINE: Give it a shot, but temper your expectations.
