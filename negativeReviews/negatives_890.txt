I was looking for a good sweet and sour sauce for chicken and based on the reviews, I took a chance.  Well, no one in the family likes this stuff  it tastes nothing like sweet and sour sauce  more like what it says it is  Chili Sauce.  Now I'm stuck with two huge bottles.  Sometimes reading the label is really all that matters.
