This is the best dog food I ever had          I just adopted a Rottweiler Mamma Mia from the local pound and she wasn't in good shape          her coat was thin and so was she          her backbones and hip bones stuck out and she had dander          now after a month she has a thick coat, no dander and has gained about 8 lb          she's eating 3 cups a day          this is great stuff and she loves it
