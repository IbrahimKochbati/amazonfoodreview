Provided the mix is fresh, this is the best mix ever.  Easy, consistenly delicious waffles everytime.  The best thing is they don't have that baking powder taste of most mixes.  I have got my parents and inlaws hooked to it as well.  I warn you this stuff is addictive.          My recommendation is to get yourself a decent not to expensive Waring waffle iron (the type that flips them) then you will have nice light, yet crispy delights.  You will not be sorry, do it, you will love it.          My only downside here is that there are not too many blueberries, but enough. The blueberries are dehydrated, so they will not be as good as fresh (but you don't get the thermal bomb effect when you eat them). To make the most of the berries I recommend you let the mix sit for 10 minutes after you mix it for proper hydration. You will probably want to serve thse with fresh berries for the best experience.  They are also great with pure maple syrup.
