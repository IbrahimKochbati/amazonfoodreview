After I tasted a bottle of Ocean Spray Cranbery product that was labeled "100% juice' in big letters and the word "cranberry" underneath I realized that it was way too sweet to be 100% cranberry juice.  When I finally looked at the tiny dark red strip at the bottom of the label, I found that it was combined with grape, apple, and other juices.  I called the 1 800 customer info line and asked if I could order the 100% cranberry juice from the website, the customer service representative told me that Ocean Spray doesn't make that product.  When I asked for the percentage of cranberry juicr in the product, she said that she did not have that information.  When I asked where I could find out, she said she didn't know.  Truth in advertising?  Their commercials show funny men standing in cranberry bogs.  Give me a  eak.  And if you are needing the cranberry juice for your health, be VERY careful.
