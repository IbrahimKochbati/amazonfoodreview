Used it for two months now.  Not sure it's helped at all.  My dog still thinks she's starving.  I had already cut her back, then cut her back more on recommendation from the product directions.  She loves the taste, but if she's lost even 2 pounds I'd be surprised.  Worse, though, is that it doesn't seem to stave off her hunger at all (that IS a tall order though, as she is one of those dogs who would eat until she explodes....).
