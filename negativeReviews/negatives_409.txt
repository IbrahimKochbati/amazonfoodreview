I have had the herb pods for about 6 months.  They are a great concept, but have a poor design. The plastic cover is very hard to take off and snap back on.  I'm  constantly afraid that I'm going to  eak it.  The pods do keep herbs fresh for several weeks in the fridge as long as you replace the water.  Unfortunately I don't use them half of the time I buys herbs because they are more trouble than they are worth.
