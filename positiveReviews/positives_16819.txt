We have the large Busy Buddy Tug a Jug for a lab shepherd mix that is a major chewer!  He goes through toys fast and destroys the yard when left alone outside, so our trainer recommended products that you can hide treats in that he has to WORK to get out.  I thought for sure he'd just shred the rope, but he's happy to flip it around endlessly... just for little morsels.  We use about a half cup of dry items like KONG  and "Tail Mix" and GRIZZLY NUTREATS smoked wild salmon for the week.
