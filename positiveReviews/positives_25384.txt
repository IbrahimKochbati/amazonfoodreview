My Great Dane, Daisy, absolutely loves these chews. When she hears the bag opening, she knows her treat is waiting for her. She just grabs it out of my hand and runs off. I like that it helps to clean her teeth since she's prone to tartar buildup. Believe me, I'd love to  ush them, but she won't let me anywhere near her mouth (might have something to do with her being a rescue). At any rate, I would recommend this product to anyone who wants their dog to have nice, clean teeth and fresh  eath.
