I've used this powder for a few years now. It is great in smoothies and protein shakes. I've mixed it w water and used it on toast, sandwiches and graham crackers. It's worth the try if you are a PB lover but want to save the fat calories.     FYI: Bell Plantation also sells a Chocolate PB2 but I don't like the flavor of it at all.
