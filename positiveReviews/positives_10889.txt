I'm not sure how best to review the Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley dog treats. I mean, I didn't try them myself, so I can't compare their deliciousness (or lack thereof) to the other treats on the market. I can say that my dog seemed to enjoy them, wolfing them down without delay. Then again, she'd probably take down a bottle of hand lotion or a burger wrapper just as quickly.          Still, it was good to see her working her gums on these treats, and her  eath wasn't too bad afterwards. Another plus is the lack of stains or related mess on the floor once she was done. The seam in the middle is also a nice touch if you want to  eak them up for smaller dogs or multiple pets.
