It took my 4 month old Westie a week to figure out how this toy worked, but now he can get most of the kibble out in about 10 mins. It is a great toy and it definitely keeps his attention.  The one I have has an actual rope and not a rubber rope, so it has lasted. He has managed to chew off a few of the spikes on the rubber ball. Some end up on the floor and some in his tummy. I think the toy might be better if it didn't even have the spikes on it, so I wouldn't have to worry about him eating them. Overall it is a great toy and the jug seems very durable.
