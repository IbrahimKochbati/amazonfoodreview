I have been using this  and for about two months, but I was using the one with the new and improved formula. I decided to give this a try since it was cheap and I thought the Bavarian Chocolate would taste more chocolate tier than the regular chocolate. I was wrong this one doesn't dissolve as well and it doesn't taste like chocolate, it's more of a bitter taste. Also it doesn't  keep me full 4 5 hours like the other one does.I will be going back to the one that is sold in the bag since it taste amazing and it's $20 at Sams Club!!! The new and improved formula is the way to go!!!!
