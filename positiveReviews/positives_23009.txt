This is my favorite cereal. When we have it in the house I eat it every day, sometimes twice a day, so it doesn't last long. I'm a big fan of "sticky" cereal, and what I mean by that is cereal that is not soggy but not out of the box crunchy, either. This cereal turns to oatmeal mush fairly quickly (I hate oatmeal, oddly), so if you like it less than soggy, you have to be quick or go easy on the milk. It tastes fantastic, though. It's not too sugary nor does it taste like cardboard. It's just right, honestly, and it's a lot healthier than a lot of other cereals (although it is not the healthiest). A bowl of this while watching LOTR is a perfectly comforting combination for some reason. (:
