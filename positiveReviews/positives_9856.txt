I've used these before and they are quite aromatic and make a great cup of coffee.  I just bought a couple of bags at Costco and they still have them for $13.99 for a three lb. bag.  I tried the Sumatra coffee and really liked that as well.  So far I have not been disappointed with any of the Kirkland coffee beans.  I tend to like a more robust coffee and this one fills the bill.  Ever since I started grinding my own coffee beans I can't see going back.  I was almost in "crisis mode" as I was down to less than a pound of coffee and need my morning java.  Give this one a try.
