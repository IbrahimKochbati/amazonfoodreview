I bought this tea because I had a really bad cold (runny nose, sneezing, watery eyes, scratchy throat, body aches) and I read that Echinacea does wonders for the immune system.  I drank three cups of this tea the day that I bought it; it has a sweet flavor and is delicious (and this is coming from a very picky tea lover!) I woke up the next day completely cured!  Coincidence? I think not!
