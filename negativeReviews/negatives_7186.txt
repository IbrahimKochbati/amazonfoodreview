For around $9, I recieved a small box of 8 crickets. I figured it would be like a delicacy, but upon popping one into my mouth  an overpowering vinegar taste along with an undesireably crunchy non dissolving texture(like eating a popcorn seed with vinegar powder) forced me to promptly spit it out. Disgusting, and a huge waste of money.
