If you are looking for something with spice that kids will like, this one is it. Mine never eat spicy food, but they liked this. It is easy to prepare, just follow the box. And stir every few minutes so the bottom doesn't get stuck or burnt. A pound of chicken sounded like alot, but it is needed to balance out the seasoning. I tried it with less chicken but it was not as good.          Just add your own chicken and water. I skipped the butter as the chicken had just enough of its own fat.
