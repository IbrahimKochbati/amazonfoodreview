I'm a fan of Greenies for dogs. However, this size is just too small and almost immediately snap in half. The issue with that is they end up chewing each 1 2 down to a size that is easy to gag and choke on. Part of the advantage to Greenies is that they're supposed to  eak down to tiny bits that are easily swallowed. These  eaking in half defeats the purpose.          For puppies and even for grown up tiny dogs I recommend going one size up.
