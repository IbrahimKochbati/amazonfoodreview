My Great Dane will do anything for this  and of Pig Ears.  I originally bought these at Sams Club for years, but they discontinued carrying them there so I tried other  ands as an alternative, (which apparently don't compare in taste) ...  because 'Missy' the Great Dane tried various other pig ear  ands but began sniffing and turning away from all but these.  These are the best  and and best value!
