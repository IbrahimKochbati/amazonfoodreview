I have been drinking the tea for about a year now. The product is fine.     My complaint is with the recent change on the individual tea bag envelope.     The new lavendar colored envelopes are impossible to open without the aid of scissors (or my teeth).     The previous two tone envelopes tore open easily.     Please revert back.
