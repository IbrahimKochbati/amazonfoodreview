If your dog is bored and destructive at home, this would be a great toy for you, especially if your dog is food driven. Even my dog, who doesn't like to play much anymore was instantly interested in the bits of chicken. Although she got some help from my young son, when we leave her at home, this will be a great treat for her, so she won't be so sad when we leave.          This toy is a great idea for any dog owner.          This is a Social Writeup.
