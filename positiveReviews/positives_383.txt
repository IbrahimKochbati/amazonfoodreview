They are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut. I much prefer the salt & pepper just for the krinkle cut   they have a better texture. All around this  and is much better than Frito Lay and a good price on Amazon when you get free shipping. These are similar to Tim's or Zack's chips in that they are very crispy.          On a side note, these are the hardest bags to open by hand. I have to use a knife or scissors everytime.
