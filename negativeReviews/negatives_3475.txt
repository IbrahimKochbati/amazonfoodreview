i am constantly adding baby food to regular food [pumpkin, sweet potato into pancake mix; carrot, tomato, greens into spaghetti sauce; etc..].  so when i saw these i thought it would be a cool mix in without changing the consistency.          tried the sweet potato into our pancake mix.  i couldn't taste them, nor did it change the color of the mix.  which for most older kids probably would be great.  however, my toddler calls them "orange pancakes," so we ended up dumping in a jar of sweet potatoes anyway to make them orange.          also added the carrots to a 4 cheese noodles i made.  it colored them great and you couldn't taste the carrots.  so if you are trying to be sneaky, then these will work, it's a very, very small amount of powder, so it'll boost the nutrition without being detected.  with that said...          in wegmans where i live, they were 1.10 a pouch.  i didn't think that was bad considering the organic packets  [plum happybaby] are anywhere from 1.00 1.50.  EXCEPT, that nurturme is equivalent to a 2.5 ounce jar, NOT the typical FOUR oz!  this is equal to those 1st stage baby food jars that are tiny.  their picture seems a little deceptive, because i think when most people see a pic of a baby food jar they think of the normal size ones  not the tiny ones.          so in the end, you are paying more and getting less.          like i said, i didn't buy these to mix up and feed my baby, i just wanted to try as a mix in.  in all, i think it's a cool concept, but as for paying double for the same product, ehh dunno.  might buy a pack and use it here and there as a mix in.
