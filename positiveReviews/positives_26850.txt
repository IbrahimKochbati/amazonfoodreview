Great tasting tea.  Mellow flavor without an aftertaste.  Compared to rooibos teas, this variant honeybush with vanilla takes the edge off the aftertaste.  A little more vanilla may improve the taste a little, but that comes down to personal preference.  Kudos to Stash for providing a high quality organic tea.  A+
