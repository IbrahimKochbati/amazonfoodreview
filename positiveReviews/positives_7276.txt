I was buying this product and others like it in the 11.5 boxes but it saves a lot of money to purchase it in the 1 liter packages.  The taste is great and the product was very fresh with a good shelf life.  Since I have a Prime Account, I received package in just 2 days and with free shipping.  GREAT DEAL if you like coconut water like I do.
