I was hesitant to order this because of the recurring complaint of damaged cans, but then noticed that those reviews seem less recent, and it looks like the shipping issue was resolved (I selected the "Amazon Frustration Free" packaging).  The cans arrived in perfect condition, before their use by date, etc.          However, the texture of the pumpkin seems a bit off. We add the pumpkin to our dogs' food. Before buying this product, we typically used the large can of Libby's  and. The texture of this product is much firmer than the canned Libby's we were using, and it even looked like there was some congealed fat in the "Farmer's Market" can, which seems odd for pumpkin. Another difference is that it doesn't seem to be firming up our dogs' poop like the Libby's pumpkin did (sorry if TMI!). We will probably stick with Libby's once we finish the cans from this order.
