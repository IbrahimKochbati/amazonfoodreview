I found these years ago at a small buck shop as a kid, and I don't think I've ever seen them anywhere else. I've moved since, and it's probably been about three years since I've had them last, but I remembered how much I loved them and wished I could find them again. And now I have, which is why Amazon is the best! These are packaged exactly the way I remember, same box, same wrappers. I got it in two days with Prime and the package was perfect, no nicks or tears.          My only complaint is that I find these to be a bit sweeter than I remember. It could just be me, but I was sure I'd recognize the flavor accurately. Though that's a little disappointing, they still taste really good and smell as awesome as ever. My fiance (who had never tried them before) now loves them too.
