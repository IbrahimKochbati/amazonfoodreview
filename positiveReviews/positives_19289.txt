I've tried many different low carb pastas over the last 14 years. They all tasted like cardboard, didn't smell like pasta and disintegrated into grainy, pasty substance if even slightly overcooked (not that the texture was ever pasta like to begin with). When I ordered the Carba Nada, the most I had really hoped for was "edible" or that whatever funky grassy or cardboard like flavors it might have could be masked with a bold sauce. The first surprise was that it smelled exactly like regular hard semolina pasta while boiling (I really love that smell!) I like my pasta al dente and this was most definitely al dente and sturdy like a good pasta should be. I ate a few strands right out of the pot with nothing on them and was surprised at how much I liked it. Bonus: With all that extra protein and fiber in it, I was more stuffed eating what's considered 2 servings (4 dry ounces, like "regular" pasta) than I've ever been with the same amount of "regular" pasta but the Carba Nada has fewer calories. I saved even more calories because I didn't need to add a protein to my dinner. There's already plenty of protein in the Carba Nada pasta itself. The best basic pantry item I've found in years.
