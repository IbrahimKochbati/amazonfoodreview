SHAME on you Amazon for allowing such crooked, HIGHLY over priced item to sell on your site. I'm talking about "NESTLE COFFEE CREAMER VANILLA CARAMEL SUGAR FREE POWDER 10.2 oz. Sold by Mancor and fulfilled by.....wait for it..........Amazon.  $!5.00 for 1 10.2 oz jug, bottle, jar.  OUTRAGEOUS.  Does Amazon not screen for deceptive sale practices?
