EDIT: Recent price increase DOUBLED!  Sadly I will have to seek an alternative now.          We have been feeding our 10 month old pug Merrick food shortly after we got him.  He is still considered to be in the puppy stage, but Merrick discontinued Puppy Plate so we decided to start him on adult food a few months early.  I introduced it to him in a 50 50 mix for one weeks and there were no problems transitioning to the new food.  Merrick Whole earth Farms Adult dry dog food is grain based dog food with chicken and turkey being it's main sources of protein.  There are no real taboo ingredients in this mix and has turned out to be a great choice.  Compared to puppy plate his stools are equally firm, but slightly smaller, indicating better digestion.  Like another reviewer stated, our dog eats less now, and has held his weight and activity level.  Merrick please don't discontinue this one!
