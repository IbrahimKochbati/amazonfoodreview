I have been using this syrup for over a year, and it is the tastiest I have ever had.  When out of it, I tried some Grade A Dark Amber from Target (same price), and it just wasn't as good.  Full of maple flavor and none of the corn syrup junk of the table  ands, this syrup really  ought  eakfast to a whole new level of yummy!
