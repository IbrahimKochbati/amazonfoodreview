I love instant noodles! Some haughty foodies are prejudiced against them because they are "cheap eats", but, even     if I were a millionaire, I'd still eat instant noodles. Nong Shim is currently my favorite  and by far, and their     products are several steps above ordinary instant ramen. The Spicy Chicken Flavor Bowl Noodle reviewed here is of     the microwavable quick lunch variety, though I generally stick to Nong Shim's stovetop line.          One issue with these noodle bowls is that some  oth inevitably ends up on the turntable while cooking; some     plastic wrap on top should solve that problem. These noodles are more like standard ramen, and have a chewy     consistency. The  oth is flavorful and pretty spicy for most people, though it seemed relatively tame to     this old chile dog's taste buds. Small chunks of chicken and vegetables are scattered throughout, and, as is     usual for Nong Shim, some rather exotic ingredients are present as well. A disclaimer on the package mentions     "sand lance", which is presumably some sea creature used in Korean cuisine...I'll readily admit to having no idea.     I ought to mention that, in true Asian tradition, the noodles here are long and slurpable. If you can't  ing     youself to slurp, you're advised to  eak the noodles up before cooking.          The Spicy Chicken Flavor Bowl Noodle gives you just enough for a satisfying quick lunch. Nong Shim's stovetop     noodle packs are a better deal  I'm nuts about Chapagetti and Shin Ramyun  but the Noodle Bowls would be more     suitable to take to work in lieu of  own bagging or relying on vending machines. Try them if you're a noodle fan.
