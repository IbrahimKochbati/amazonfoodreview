I give one of these to my dog every morning.  She is a 15 month old Great Pyrenees and loves them.  In fact, she usually will not eat in the morning until we give her one of these chews.  Her teeth are nice and white.          They do not splinter and do not make a mess.  The only negative is that she holds them between her paws and they leave a light  own discoloration on her white fur.  It does wash (or lick) right off.  I would not let your dog have them on a light colored carpet.          Great product at a reasonable price if you shop around a little on line.
