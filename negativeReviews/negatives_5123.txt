Worst toy ever!      cheap plastic, not strong      rope too thick prevents treats to fall out          I have a super smart border collie and he got frustrated with that thing. Not because it's hard to understand how it works just because it's very hard to get the treats out even for me, even when he shakes it. The rope (too thick)prevents the treats from falling out.. and even when I removed the rope, the shape of the bottle makes it difficult as the kibbles roll inside but that's pretty much it, they barely ever get passed the neck. Which makes it a very expensive useless toy, I could have just use a small empty water bottle for no cost!!          DO NOT RECOMMEND!     Try the kibble nibble instead, I have one and it's way better even if sometimes the treats fall out of it too easily.    "
