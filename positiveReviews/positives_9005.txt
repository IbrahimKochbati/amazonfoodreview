We haven't planted it yet but it is still hanging in there.  We do water it in the little pot every so often.  We really need to get it in the ground soon.  It is very attractive but has just one stem and don't know how to turn it into Bonsai look but it has glossy attractive leaves and haven't had a bloom yet.  maybe if I were to get it into the ground it would help.
