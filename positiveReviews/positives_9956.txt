I first ran across these cookies while in Germany during the Christmas season.  They were selling them at a festival and I was hooked.  I would contact my friends to send me more each Christmas when they could find them at the various fests.  The next time I ran into them was on a Delta flight when I found they could be ordered on the internet.  They are amazing, a MUST try.  I'm ordering some today!
