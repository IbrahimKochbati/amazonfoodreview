I add a serving of PB2 to non fat yogurt for a protein boost, use it to make a lower fat Thai style peanut hot sauce, and add it to desserts.  If I bothered to read recipes, there would be more delicious and healthy uses.  We're going through our second case.  It is much more economical to buy by the case.
