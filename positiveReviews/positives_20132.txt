Terrific source of Fiber.  Not too sweet a product.  Only slightly messy handling, so have a napkin or tissue handy or water. These are filling. You might be tempted, but you don't have to eat two at one sitting or on the go.          My horses swear by these.  They love this flavor.  One little bite and they willingly swallow their medications, then another small bite for the reward.
