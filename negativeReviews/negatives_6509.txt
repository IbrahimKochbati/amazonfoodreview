When I first discovered this product, and how my Toy Fox Terrier puppy reacted to it, I was thrilled.  It was so hard to get her to slow down and do some productive chewing while I was busy.  However, I did notice that her stool was often a bit loose after eating this "puppy goo".  I started stuffing her Kong with kibbles to make sure there was substance and not just the gooey stuff, in hopes that I wouldn't have to take it away from her totally.  It seemed to work for a little while, then suddenly, pools of stool again.  Even when I froze the stuff, it didn't help.  Only gave her one a week, didn't help.  It may be that toy  eeds have a difficult time with it and heartier dogs will be fine.  But be cautious.          One further note:  I've noticed that the textural contents of the cans vary.  Not sure how or why.  Be wary of expiration dates!
