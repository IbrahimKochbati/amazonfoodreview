Can't start the day without a pot of this tea! Loose tea  ewed in a "coffeemaker" has been my morning mainstay for decades. Start with cold, filtered water and a scoop (rounded tablespoon) of loose tea per cup into the paper basket filter. Adjust per taste. If you use a machine where coffee had been  ewed, it may affect the taste, so use any new machine and keep it just for tea. This makes wonderful iced tea!          Loose tea is a  oader cut leaf unlike teabags where the leaf is chopped fine. The flavor is much fuller and crisper, like the difference between fresh ground coffee and instant. No messy teabags to contend with. I like glass mugs, as they let the gorgeous color of the tea show through.          Some areas may not stock Lipton loose tea in stores, but buying online turned out to be cheaper. Six half pound boxes arrived in two days. A box will last me about two weeks, but I drink tea exclusively. There are many good "imported" teas that are much more expensive and a lovely addition, but for my daily enjoyment, Lipton's is a delicious necessity. This is the preferred tea when using French presses or a traditional teapot.
