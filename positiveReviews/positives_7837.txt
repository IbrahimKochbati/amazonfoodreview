I'm currently deployed and I'm on a low carb and high protein diet.  But my current location doesn't allow me to go out into town easily to get the type of foods that would keep me on my diet. So i ordered this from amazon.          Pros     fast shipping!     taste great     Zero carbs          cons     does make the room smell once you open the package     so be mindful of anybody else who might complain. just open it outside, through a window, or stand under a ventilation fan.          I've read reviews of people have trouble cooking it. here's my method.           the instructions says cook for 2 minutes, but i set it to 3 minutes.      after 45 seconds I open the door flip the package and shake it to spread the pieces out again      after another 45 seconds i flip the package one more time and help the bag expand by just shaking the pieces around.      then I'll let cook for about a total time of 2:10 2:20 then stop and open the bag and place the rinds in a bowl or container.          I'll then look through to see if any have not expanded yet. I'll just throw them in the microwave without the bag on a plate or napkin and just let them cook for a minute.          there, you are done!          i like to dip them in hot sauce. ENJOY!
