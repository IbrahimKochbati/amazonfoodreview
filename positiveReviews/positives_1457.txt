I love chips and can easily go through an entire bag in one sitting. With Popchips single serve pouches, I can now feel good about snacking as each bag is only 100 calories. The single serve pouches also help in portion control. The larger bags are a slightly better value, but unless you have astounding self control, I would recommend the single serving option. They are that good! They easily stand up to any of the traditional fried chips I've ever had, and at half the fat and calories, how could you ask for anything more?          The variety pack comes in 6 flavors: Original, Sour Cream and Onion, Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, Salt and Vinegar, and BBQ. My favorite flavors are Salt and Pepper and Cheddar. My least favorite is Salt and Vinegar, but I don't like ANY salt and vinegar flavored chip. My only wish is that this variety pack contained the Parmesan Garlic flavor which is VERY good, but extremely hard to find in local stores. I have ordered the Parmesan Garlic flavor in a 24 pack here on Amazon, but prefer the assortment that comes in the variety pack.          At ~$17 after the subscribe and save discount, each bag costs only 70 cents. This is a bargain for these great tasting, healthy chips and I highly recommend you try them!
