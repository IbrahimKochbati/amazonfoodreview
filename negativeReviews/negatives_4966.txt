I bought this product to occupy my 13 month old mix.  She is an aggressive chewer, but the product description led me to believe that this toy was quite tough.  When I received it, I was a little disheartened when I saw that the tug was rubber, rather than rope (as it appears in the picture)  as she tends to get through rubber toys with very little effort.          Nevertheless, I decided to try it out, she learned quickly that she could get treats out of it and it occupied her very well for almost an hour.  At that point I went to dig it out from under the bed and was dismayed to find that the rubber "pull" was already in pieces.  While the bottle still works and seems to keep her interested, I feel like dog toys should have a more indestructible nature than this one does.  Especially for eleven dollars!
