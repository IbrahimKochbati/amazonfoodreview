Not our fav. It's great to have for guests who enjoy a lighter cup but it's not for us. We like Green Mountain's Breakfast blend and Doughnut Shop the best as our "Normal" cup of coffee and Newman's Own Extra Bold when we need a Starbucks type of  ew. If you love a light  ew then you will love this.
