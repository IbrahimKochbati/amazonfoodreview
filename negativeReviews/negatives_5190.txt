I thought this toy would be great for my dog.  He was in desperate need of mental stimulation and I thought if he could figure out a puzzle while he was eating his dinner that would be great.  However, within the first 20 30 minutes he had it, the rubber "tug" rope was  oken in half.  I think he chewed on it some, but I think the actual cause of it  eaking was being bent since it was a smooth  eak instead of jagged.  He still uses it though, even without the rope.  Instead of tugging it now he'll stand it upright, knock it over, and eat the spilled contents or sometimes he'll turn it upsidedown.  Even though he isn't using it the way it was meant to be he still likes it and gets a lot of use out of it.
