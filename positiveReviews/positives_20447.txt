My first purchase of this was my first foray into home roasting and it was some of the best coffee I've ever tasted... out of a popcorn popper!          I'm ordering another batch to roast up some spiced coffee for Christmas gifts (pumpkin spice).          This specific origin seems like an excellent base for building flavors... it's incredibly smooth with a nice body.
