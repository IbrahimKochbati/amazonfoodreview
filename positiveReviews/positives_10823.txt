Of course most dogs do love a treat, but I have found some they actually wouldn't eat.     Not the case here.  These are light and come where you can  eak them in half for small or larger dogs.          Although more pricey then say Milkbones, you know exactly what's in these treats.  No added preservatives, etc.          I've tried several of Newman's products and have found them to be excellent in quality.... plus the company donates a large portion of their profits to charity.          Buying this product for your dog not only makes the dog happy, but you can rest assured you're purchasing from a quality company.          Thank you.     MEF
