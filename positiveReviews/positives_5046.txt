This is wonderful stuff, exactly what I was looking for. Of all gochujang pastes available, this one is spicy sweet, with a wonderful depth of flavor. A good addition to soups, stews, sauces and marinades, occasionally I just eat a spoonful straight from the box! It's a good topping for noodles and rice bowls, too.
