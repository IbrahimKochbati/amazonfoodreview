One star given just for possibility that some cats out there may be less (or different) picky from ours.  See my review of CAT MAN DOO BONITO SPRINKLES for info on several products I "tested" in search of a flavor appetite enhancer, including this shrimp version and another F&S tuna treat product that was much better received by our gang of four.
