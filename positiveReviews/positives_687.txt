With all the allergies in our family, these ended up working out great.  We don't have any negative reactions to the ingredients and though we don't buy many pre packaged foods, these work for 'on the go'. Our family tried several varieties and I prefer the Cocoa Loco Bars; they're almost like a Tootsie Roll to me though I can't eat Tootsie Rolls, so this is a great substitute for that occasional craving.  My family prefers the Very Berry Bars because they can eat those when they miss  eakfast, need a healthy snack, or my son will take them on his cross country running meets.  They are very dense and filling not a 'soft bar' and we always eat them while having some liquid to drink at the same time.
