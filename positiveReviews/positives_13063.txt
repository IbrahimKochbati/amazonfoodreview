If you live in LA you like strong and bold coffee like I do.  I drink it with a spoonfull of raw sugar which makes it more wonderful.  Stores in Baton Rouge no longer sell the Bold Java and I thought I would look at Amazon and was surprised to find it on their list so I have a standing order for it to mailed to my home!  No hassel and it is cheaper.  You will enjou the bold taste of this coffee
