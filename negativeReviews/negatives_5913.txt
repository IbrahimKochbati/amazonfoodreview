I bought this as a birthday gift for my dog.  The plastic is pretty thin.  He loves tennis balls and playing fetch, so I thought it would be a great  ain teaser.  He figured out how to lift the doors to get at the tennis ball, but when he goes to grab it, it ends up rolling back into the trunk and over to another hole.  Then he just gets irritated.  It slides easily on the hardwood floor, so he ends up pushing it around the room trying to get the ball out.  We put it on a rug to keep it from sliding around and then the doors don't open as easily.  I'm going to try to put some rubber slip grip stuff on the bottom to see if that helps keep it in place on the hardwood floor better.  He tries to dig the tennis ball out of the top opening since the doors don't work too well and then he ends up knocking the whole top portion off.
