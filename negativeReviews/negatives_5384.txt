I didn't like this coffee. It did have a good smell when I first opened the pack, but that is about it. I like a medium to strong flavor in my coffees and this was just plain weak. I guess if you have stomach problems or just like a light coffee this would be great, but anyone who likes alot of flavor won't like this.
