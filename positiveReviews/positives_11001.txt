We tried several different kinds of gluten free crackers and for something similar to a saltine, this was our favorite choice. The kids really liked them for cheese and crackers and to crumble in chili and soups. The only problem we had with them is that most arrive  oken. I usually seperate the crumbled ones and save them in a ziploc for soups.
