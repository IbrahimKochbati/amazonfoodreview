I bought this fudge expecting a more creamy fudge.  I was disappointed.  It has a strange undercooked grainy texture that I didn't like.  My canister was mainly rum raisin and that was my least liked flavor, it is made with real rum and I do not consume alcohol.  The ginger tasted odd and the strawberry didn't have any strawberry flavor.  I did like the Clotted cream it was very good, but only 2 in the pack.  I would not buy it again.
