These are great for making larger portions of baby food. I think I'll use them more as my baby gets older. For my 7 month old, one cube makes about 2 3 servings of food for her. I love that it has a cover, and the silicone makes it really easy to pop the food out. But, it's pretty pricey for just 7 slots of food, and the fewer slots make it harder to mass produce baby food unless you buy multiples of the trays.
