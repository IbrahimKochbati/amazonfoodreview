Im was never a fan of eating fish but my diet requires it. I dug through my cupboard and found this seasoning my wife had bought last year. I tried it and fell in love with it. I went through the entire bottle in about 2 weeks. However when I tried to get more, it wasnt being sold locally.          I bought the 24 ounce canister because I was worried that it might get discontinued and because its a much better value. The only down side is that it doesnt have a shaker top.          Anyway, I now enjoy fish and Im staying on my diet because of this seasoning. It works well with everything.          Even my daughter likes it so its definitely a hit at our house!
