I purchased cases of these for our company picnic. The boxes were cute, the idea of it all was a big hit. But the "gift inside" was a bust. I would gladly have paid more for a stupid little item rather than the "writings on paper," or whatever they were. What is Cracker Jack without the gift inside? I find it to be misleading that they call it "Original."  Original had the gift inside.
