I admit that for many years I only liked the "bad" stuff in the grocery store that was chock full of high fructose corn syrup and didn't have maple syrup in it!  I just liked the flavor.  Other maple syrups (which were Grade A) just tasted watery to me and didn't have that rich flavor I wanted.          But since we're trying to eat healthier now and getting rid of stuff with HFCS in it I wanted to find a syrup that tasted really good.  And I've found it!          This syrup is really flavorful, dark in color, and very rich.  I just absolutely love it.  Never again will I go back to using the fake stuff when the real stuff is so incredibly tasty   not to mention better for you!  Thanks Coombs Family Farms for making this.  It's fantastic!
