While in Jamaica, my wife and I drank Blue Mountain Coffer every day and loved it.  We even went on a bike tour of the Blue Mountains, and purchased some coffee.  It came in a plain clear plastic bag, and we could see the darkness of the roast.  We enjoyed that coffee.          In Ocho Rios, we bought some bags of JABLUM.  You can't see the darkness of the roast, and all you can smell is the burlap bag.  When we opened it up, it was a very light roast, not much fragrance, and once  ewed, the coffee tasted a lot like dirt.  We were very disappointed.
