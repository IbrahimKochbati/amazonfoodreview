Nature's Path makes some excellent cereals, and this is definitely one of them. I really enjoy it because it has great flavor, a good crunch, and is a very healthy food. In fact, this is my favorite cereal   hands down.  I totally recommend buying the pack of 6   a penny saved is a penny earned. Besides, it's not like the cereal is going to go bad; it'll keep for months until you  eak the seal.
