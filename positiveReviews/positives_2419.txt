To the gentleman who reviewed this and said "just go to the store and get better," well, I'm disabled and the disability van only allows us two packages to carry...can you see me carrying two big cases of water home?  I think not.          This is wonderful water.  Sure, you could get it on sale at a better price, and if you can drive or have someone to drive you and carry it in, please do so, but for me it is a sweet deal.  I ordered six cases and watched the UPS guy set them inside the door for me.  I have nothing to complain about.  If the price is right for you, with all considered, you won't go wrong here.
