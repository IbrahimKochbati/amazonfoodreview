I found this refreshing drink while traveling to Big Island Hawaii.. the taste and hydration is extremely addictive! I subscribe to a case to supplement my habits and help quench my pregnant clients' thirst as well. Bits of aloe are so soothing. The slightly sweet and tart flavor of magosteen and mango really adds to the quenching palate. A long term fan!
