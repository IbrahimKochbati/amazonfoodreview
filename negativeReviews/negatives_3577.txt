I have a confession to make:  I had one of these bars and a cup of coffee for  eakfast, and it was actually not bad.  But the Amazon stars say "I love it" for 5 stars, "I like it" for 4 stars and "It's okay" for 3 stars.  So, I give it 3 stars.  I personally felt the coconut flavor was stronger than the chocolate flavor and I'm not a big coconut fan, but I am a chocolate fan.  It wasn't terribly sweet and I rather think I would have liked it a little better if it had been sweeter (but not too sweet   I'm kind of picky that way).  I liked the oats and the "gluten free" ness of it.  I don't eat gluten, so that makes  ead bagels pretty expensive.  These worked out best for  eakfast, although I think I used it as a going to bed snack a couple of times.          So, just for fun, I got some nutritional information from 1) Pamela's Oat Chocolate Chip bars 2) some unsalted, dry roasted peanuts and 3) some non gluten gingersnaps.          1) 1, 1.41 oz bar   had 9g fat, 15 mg cholesterol, 130 mg sodium and 2g of protein.     2) 1 oz (40 nuts)   had 14g fat, 0mg cholesterol, 0mg sodium and 7g protein.     3) 5 cookies (30g or 1.06 oz)   had 6g fat, 0mg cholesterol, 85 mg sodium and 2g protein.          I think that each of these snacks might serve at one point or another.  If you are looking for high protein, then neither the cookies or the Pamela's bars would do the trick, confirming that the Pamela's bars would be more of a snack than a meal.  So don't eat one of these with coffee for  eakfast.  Ever.
