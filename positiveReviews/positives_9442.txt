These are nice large nuts, well roasted and salted. I like the 12 ounce size and the three pack is nice. I get them on subscribe and save and the price for this quality peanut is good. I use them for snacks and for cooking stir frys and making lettuce wrap fillings. Good size to throw in your bag to take to a game, or put in your car for starvation emergencies.
