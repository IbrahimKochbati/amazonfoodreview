I am a veterinary student and I can say I really love these chews for dogs.  They are much better quality ingredients than the rawhides in the grocery store and most dogs like them much more.  I can say from experience that my dog prefers them over those.  My dog is a medium size dog but I buy the large chews  they aren't too big and you get more for your money.  He eats them SO fast that I know he really likes them and I can feel better about the quality of what he is eating.  At the end of chewing on these, some dogs can try and swallow a piece that is too large because they are being over zealous but as long as you keep an eye on them this shouldn't be a problem. (I think everyone who gives their dog a rawhide should be observing their dog anyway)  If you say this is a choking hazard, then so are every other rawhide chewables out there.  These are great for their teeth and they love to eat them, so what's not to like about the product?  I would highly recommend!
