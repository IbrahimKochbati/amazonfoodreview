I ordered Emerils Big Easy Bold a few weeks ago, and at least half the time I have been dissatisfied, because there is something wrong with the pods.  The pods do not work well in the Keurig.  Instead of dripping down into the cup, they collect the water, flooding the dispenser and delivering only half a cup.  At first, I thought it was our Keurig, but the other coffee we have, the tea, and the hot chocolate work fine.  It's only Emerils that doesn't perform the way it should. It was ordered new from Amazon, but other Keurig products from Amazon are fine.
