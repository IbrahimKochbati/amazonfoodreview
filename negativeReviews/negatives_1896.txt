I just called Bob's Red Mill customer service (just do a G search for the company, their customer service number is under "contact us" on their site), and I was annoyed to learn that NONE OF BOB'S RED MILL BAKING SODA CONTAINS ALUMINUM. I've been paying $10 15 (with shipping) for this magical 'aluminum free' baking soda only to learn that the Bob's Red Mill 'premium baking soda' at my local grocery is the same exact thing. Call for yourself if you don't believe me. Ugh.
