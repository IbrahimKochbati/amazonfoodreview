Like the other reviews, this package does not come in the fancy blue box. Instead, it comes in a generic cardboard box. HOWEVER for most things on amazon, it is still significantly cheaper than Walmart, target, or other places so I cant complain. Luckily I did not get any busted cups in my box.          This is going in my  eak room at work. I'll probably order it again. For the amount of cups you get and the cost, it just can't be beaten.
