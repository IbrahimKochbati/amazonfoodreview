I used to be able to buy this in a local grocery, but I moved to an area with far narrower shopping choices. However, this pasta is good enough that I have sought it out to order through Amazon. Lower carb, higher protein pasta that tastes excellent  the people in my new area love it,and although I just ordered a 6 pack, I can see that  I will soon need more. It's a great pasta staple, especially for more delicate dishes where a whole grain pasta would be a bit coarse  though I love whole grain pasta, don't get me wrong. But this with just a bit of olive oil, garlic, basil, and fresh tomato and or spinach  yum! Don't let this product go, Amazon! I need it!
