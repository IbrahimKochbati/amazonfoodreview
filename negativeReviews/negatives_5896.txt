I wanted a new challenge for my terrier, and she figured this out in no time flat.  Then she ran off with the compartment covers and chewed them to bits.  So, the product is not challenging and not robust.  Maybe this would work for a declawed cat, but if your dog is halfway on the ball, get something else.
