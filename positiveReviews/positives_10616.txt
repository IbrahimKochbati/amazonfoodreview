I rescued a VERY VERY sick kitten (nearly died) and after he was well, he was still not interested in eating   until I found this.  This is not only very high quality & full of important nutrients, protein, fat, etc., but he LOVES it.  Since starting on his babycat, he is gaining weight & feeling MUCH better !  *WHEW !*  Note also that the 'kitten' formula of this is mostly the same but is little chunks   I mashed them, but its not the same as the pureed babycat !
