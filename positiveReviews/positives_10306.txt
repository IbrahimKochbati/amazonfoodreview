This is by far the easiest way I've found to freeze baby food and get it out again. The getting it out again is key   it can be really hard to get frozen puree out of ice cube trays without cracking the tray. It's also dishwasher safe. The only drawback is that it doesn't prevent freezer burn so if that's a concern for you, you'll need to put it inside of a freezer bag.
