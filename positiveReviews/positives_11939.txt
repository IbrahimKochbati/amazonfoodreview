Every pup I have ever owned LOVED these treats. They will do anything for them and only like this  and! I tried another and they refused to eat them! If you love your pups and treat them like children BUY THESE!     Mine are not too spolied   DIVA and TIFFANY! They get them every holiday and I am never without a supply on hand. Try greenies too!
