Do I really need to make a review about Nutella??? I don't think so. If you've grown up in Italy like I did, you know that this product is not just a delicious hazelnut and chocolate spread, but a direct line to the heavens. Italian kids don't eat peanut butter (therefore, no pbj sandwiches!) but have Nutella on a thick slice of  ead instead. We eat this for  eakfast, dipping the slice in some nice hot caffellatte, or as an afternoon snack. And if you've been good, you get Nutella gelato on the weekend. Nutella is also advertised as a sports food for athletes who need the extra "energy kick".. yeah why not get it from a slurpalicious, divinely decadent chocolate cream spread!
