Both of my sons LOVE this pasta.  I, personally, think that Tinkyada pastas taste better (more like "real" pasta), but my kids like this just as much.  I think the fun, animal shapes make it more appealing to them.  They love the letter shaped pasta (made by the same company) as well.  I wish the company hadn't made the pasta size larger though, as my kids liked the smaller size better.  Oh well, they still like it and I'm thrilled to have found it on Amazon.  Our local MOMs store stopped carrying it, so we haven't had it in quite some time.
