They have a great fruity flavor.  They are pretty sweet but you can taste the honey in them and the sweetness doesnt overpower the fruit flavor.  The texture is perfect, not too gummy like gummy bears that you have to chew forever but also not stick to your teeth like sharkies. Kinda like gum drops and there's lots of them in a bag so you dont feel like you got cheated.  I think I like these more than any other sports chews I have tried.  They also dont leave your fingers sticky after handling them.  I hope they come out with new flavors.
