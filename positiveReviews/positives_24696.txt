look at the price!  Hardly a bargain!  So I figured I'd go to the new & used.  I bought a case of Monster for $30 dollars.  That's just over a dollar a can! Unfortunatley the case was almost entirely used.  Some of the cans were intact, but most were half drunk, and another three were entirely empty.  Next time, I'm just going to buy a new case.
