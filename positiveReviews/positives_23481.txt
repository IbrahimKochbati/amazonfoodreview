This was our first experience with Turkish Delight.....my daughter had a Narnia Birthday party so, of course, we had to have some.  I went by color when ordering, and as theirs is red in the movie, ended up with Rosewater.  I did not expect it to taste like roses, or rose potpourri exactly though.  I felt like I was eating old lady perfume.  I give it 4 stars because the kids love it, oddly enough, as did most of them at the party, although the adults all seemed to agree with the 'eating potpourri' idea.  Maybe if we had grown up on it us adults would have enjoyed it more too :)
