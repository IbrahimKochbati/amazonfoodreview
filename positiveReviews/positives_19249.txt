I have a Bigon Fri Maltipoo. He is soooo cute and I give him nothing but the best. He is sweet and friendly.           When he saw this product he first ignored it but I turned my back and then he stuck his little paw in the large shape to get the ball. Such a cute lil guy. Also since he is color blind like all dogs of course, the neon ball was very interesting to him. He rolled it around the house happily. The red part is great too because I can actually clean it unlike his other furry toys. I'm so happy a company actually took the time and effort to create such a great product with your dog in mind.          Thanks CAGEY :)
