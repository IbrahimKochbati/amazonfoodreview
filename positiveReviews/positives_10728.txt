I have three dogs.  Two cocker  iels and a jack russell terrier.  They all have their own favorite treats, but this one is one that all of them enjoyed.  It was nice for a dog treat to be healthy and taste good.  I liked the fact that the treats can be easily  oken in half and they are hard and dense enough to take them a while to eat.  This is a very good product.  I will continue to buy them for my dogs.
