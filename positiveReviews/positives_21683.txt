I love these beef sticks.  Especially when I'm on road trips I can't resist buying a couple if they have them on the counter at check out.  I now like to keep a few beef sticks in my bag at work (pediatric nurse) for late night snacks.  These are the best deal price ounce and quality that I've seen thus far.  I bag six at a time in sandwich bags, then six sandwich bags in a gallon size zip lock to keep them fresh in my pantry, then take a bag or two to work to keep onhand.          If you're compulsive and won't be able to stop eating them until they are gone, then you need to just buy a few at a time at the gas station, these are not health food.  They have some protein, but alot of fat, sodium, and calories.  They are a treat, not a meal!
