This is the best drink out there!  I've always had adult acne and no matter what I took or what the dermatologist prescribed for me, it has always been so difficult to treat my acne.  I started drinking coconut water for the electrolyte benefits after my intense spinning classes but I noticed within several weeks that my face started to clear up and actually looked smoother!  Besides keeping me hydrated and my electrolytes in balance, it has improved the quality of my skin tone!  LOVE IT!!!!!!
