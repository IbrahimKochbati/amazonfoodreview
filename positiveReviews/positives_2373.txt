I don't know which herb is so tasty in here.. but it's a great combination.  I don't like licorice flavors, and this tea is great because I can reap the great benefits of licorice root, without tasting it!          It really does help my symptoms, and drinking it for prevention has worked great for me as well.  And you cannot beat the shipping price (free with super saver shipping) with Amazon.
