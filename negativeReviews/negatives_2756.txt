I like the idea of getting grains out of cat food, but using peas instead doesn't seem to be the answer.  Carnivores (at least my cat) doesn't tolerate peas.  Vomiting began in about 2 3 weeks and is now instantaneous.  Eat some cat food  go right to throwing up. Both chicken and salmon.  So for me it was a waste of money and very disappointing.
