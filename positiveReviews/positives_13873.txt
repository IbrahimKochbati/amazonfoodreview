Like everyone else, I was a little skeptical.. our family loves peanut butter and and wasnt sure how powdered peanut butter could compare.  We normally buy Smart Balance, very limited ingredients (no stir).,we love it however thought we would give PB2 a try since the calories and fat are significantly lower,  PB2 did not dissapoint! I tried it all by itself, on a celery stick, and this morning in my smoothie.. WOW! Dont think I will ever go back to regular peanut butter.  Cant wait to try some of the other recipes and PB2 Chocolate
