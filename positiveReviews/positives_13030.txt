I ordered this Chef Boyardee Italian Ravioli and was greatly satisfied. First, let's face the fact that this is a can of Ravioli, not from Olive Garden or even home cooked! For a can, it is ever so tasty and full of the "things" a body needs. The fact that Chef Boyardee does not have to advertise on TV and still has really high market sells says it all! I am in my 60's and handicapped. To have good nutrition in a can and taste great is awsome! To have it delivered for free(Prime) in two days by UPS right to my kitchen is a miracle! For all thiis, the price is absolutely fantastic! I read all the reviews. My case was shrink wrapped very well and there was not one dented can! The experation date was 2014! I had a case of Libby's peaches in the same box and it was so bubble wrapped, I had to have my neighbor's help to get the wrap off and again not one dented can! Both the Ravioli and the Peaches make great kitchen stock items!
