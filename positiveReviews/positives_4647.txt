I was at my wits end with hypoallergenic foods for my cat with IBD. This one is one he will finally eat, and even ask for. Nothing is more heartrending than trying to get a sick cat to eat, and putting expensive prescription food down to have him sniff, walk away, and cry for food.. I was so relieved when I found this. My cat is now maintaining.. I pray they continue to make it for years to come!
