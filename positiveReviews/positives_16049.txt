These biscuits go very well with the PG Tips tea I ordered, and they even taste good on their own. Normally I'm not big on this kind of biscuits   they're either too sweet or too bland   but these have a mildly sweet taste that's surprisingly addictive.          I'm not happy with the packaging though. In the pack of 7, only 3 turned out perfect, 2 were slightly crumbled, and half of the last 2 were badly smashed.
