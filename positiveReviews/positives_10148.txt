I heard about these through Hungry girl.com and am so glad I tried them.  I kept hearing how I should replace pasta with spaghetti squash and found the texture and taste to be unsatisfying.  Although these need to be rinsed well and patted thoroughly dry, I think these are the closest thing to real pasta at about 10% of the calories.  I have tried the fettuccine and the macaroni, both which I like, but the angel hair shape is the best.  Works great with the Hungry girl recipe on the back too.  YUM!  I highly recommend.  The seller also sent these to me so quickly and at no additional shipping price for my multiple orders.
