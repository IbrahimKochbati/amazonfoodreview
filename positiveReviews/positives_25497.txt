After my  other, a film animator formerly with the Walt Disney Company, made a TV commercial for Season Brand Sardines I decided to try the product and have been a lover of the tiny (Brisling) variety since then.  This is now more than 20 years ago.  They are packed in various sauces and oils but my favorite is pure olive oil and lightly smoked, wild caught from the cold waters off Scotland.  I cannot imagine doing better than that.  Most sardine lovers whether they eat them for health (they contain over 2,500mg of Omega 3 fatty acids) or just as a wonderful gourmet food love the tiny ones.  The taste is nut like and delicious.  I like them best in a sandwich of toasted, seeded Jewish rye with Romaine lettuce.  There's nothing else needed.
