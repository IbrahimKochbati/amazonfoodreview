After being VERY disappointed with the performance of a Maxi Matic 4oz popcorn machine with Orville Reddenbacher's Original Gourmet Popping Corn and canola oil, I decided to order a prepackaged mix before giving the machine away.          It took a few weeks for the Great Northern mix to arrive, most likely due to the holidays.  It was well worth the wait.  The first batch tasted just like movie popcorn!  The texture, color, saltiness and flavor were just what I was hoping for.  The popcorn was also hot when it left the kettle, not like the Reddenbacher popcorn.          This is not the healthiest choice for popcorn, but it will satisfy my cravings for the real thing on an occasional basis.
