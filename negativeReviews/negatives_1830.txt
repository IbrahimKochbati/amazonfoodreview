THE CAN DOES NOT SAY "NO ANTIBIOTICS". I called the company and asked why the can does not say this.  First, she tells me that THEY HAVE NO ANTIBIOTICS BUT the FDA won't allow them to put it on their can.  I said "lots of companies put no antibiotics on their label".  Then she said we are making a new label.  I felt a definate flippant attitude.  I felt like she just wanted me to get off the phone.          Well, I just canceled my autoship for their goat milk. I am now looking for another goat milk that puts "no antibiotics" on their label.  I know that there are some good goat milk companies that do this.
