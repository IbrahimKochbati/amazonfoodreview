Our Schnauzer has some really horrible  eath and we don't know exactly why. I tried several of the "dental dog chews" testing to qualify their claims. All failed my test. I saw these at Wal Mart and decided to give them a try. SUCCESS! Honestly, though, her mouth doesn't smell like a rose garden, but what an improvement. I don't feel like shooshing her away. We can play at close quarters now My only problem with W M is they carry only small bags. So, I am going to buy at Amazon.com since I can get the large size bags.
