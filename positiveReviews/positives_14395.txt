Both of my dogs have torn their ACL's in their life, with that came the process of PT and a diet change. We started to give these once a day to the girls, and they couldn't LOVE it more. which makes me LOVE it because they take these easily and are getting great vitamins in the process. I wish I knew about these sooner, I would absolutely  give them to all future dogs I have as well. I was so sad when my local stores stopped selling them, and now solely get them through amazon. The service is so quick and easy. Overall I couldn't say enough great things about this product!
