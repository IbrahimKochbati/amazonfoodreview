My Mom, who is 83 years old, is restricted to a gluten free diet, and while we had found many items that were "palatable" to replace the cookies, cakes and snacks that she used to eat, finding a good  ead was not one of them.  Until we gave Pamela's Products a try.  My Mom just LOVES the  ead, which I bake once a week for her.  It is very easy to make, and I've even added a few things for variation.  Amazon is a great, cost effective, convenient way to purchase these products on a regular basis. We've tried Pamela's cake mixes, cookie mixes, etc., and they are EXCELLENT ... would highly recommend these products to anyone on a gf diet.
