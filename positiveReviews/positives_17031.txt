We've had this for almost a week, and the dog still hasn't figured out how the treats fall out.  I think this toy is worth the money just to hear my kids and husband laugh at the dog as she tries to get the treats out.  So far the toy doesn't show any signs of wear, and our dog is a real chewer of everything she finds.
