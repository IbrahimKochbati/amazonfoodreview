We've tried Switch before, but the only flavor we were aware of was the citrus.  That was good, but this Kiwi Berry flavor is far better. It's tart, but has sufficient sweetness to balance the tartness.  Best of all, there are no unwanted ingredients in this.  It's basically a carbonated fruit juice. There is no added sugar, or, worse, high fructose corn syrup.  There are no artificial preservatives or colors or anything else that's typically added to a soda (or even a juice drink).  The 8.3 ounce can is a good size, too.
