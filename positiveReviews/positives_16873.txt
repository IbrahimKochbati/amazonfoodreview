Dog  oke the hard plastic the first day by slamming it around by the rope so we have to tape it up everytime we refill. Dog does enjoy, carries it around wanting to play fetch but settles on tug a war. It does keep him occupied trying to get the food out. Container needs to be made of different material to prevent  eakage but still worth the money for the enjoyment it has given him.
