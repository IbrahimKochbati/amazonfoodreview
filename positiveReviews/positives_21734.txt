Love,love,love this creamer. It is so rich and creamy, was buying the smaller size but it is so much cheaper to buy the larger size just hated it on my counter, easy fix. I bought a 10 ounce bottle of water with the flip top lid poured the water in my coffee maker and then filled it with creamer, this is much easier to use than messing with the pump and large bottle just put the regular lid (not the pump) back on the bottle of creamer and store out of site. but if you want to use the the orginal bottle and pump you can remove the pump by pushing down hard and turning hard,just like childproof medicine bottles, must keep pushing down while turning.
