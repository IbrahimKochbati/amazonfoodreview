This review is ONLY IN REGARDS to the PHYSICAL CAN.  I will review the actual product once I have tried it.  But for now please be advised before you purchase        I read the reviews   Lots of dented cans....  I figured there were so many complaints that it just couldn't still be happening, right?  WRONG!  6 of the 12 were badly dented all along the upper rim seams.  Amazon did, however, make good on my order with an exchange.  Still      disappointing that the product quality control is so poor with this product after all the bad reviews.
