I liked it!          Didn't know what to expect.  It has a variety of fruit juices such as apple, orange and grape, but clearly had a strong orange taste.  I liked the fact there was no added sweeteners such as HFC or sugar.  I'm not a pop soda drinker, but I think if I served this instead of the traditional orange stuff in a 2 liter people wouldn't notice the difference.          It's a bit pricy for orange soda and I'm sure orange juice would be better, but if you are looking for something healthier, this one's for you.
