I gave this to my  other for Christmas and it was a big hit.  The instruments are well made and beautifully packaged.  He told me the tea was great   they even include some African honey.  They shipped really fast, too.          You're not only giving a great gift but you are donating money to a great cause. I can't recommend this enough.
