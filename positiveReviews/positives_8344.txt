I love this tea served as Chai latte, served with milk and honey. In fact, I use evaporated milk instead of regular milk and it gives it a lovely creamy taste. I am no expert on Chai Tea but then, I go by what I like, and I find this particular blend very pleasing. I would recommend it to anyone who like spicy teas.
