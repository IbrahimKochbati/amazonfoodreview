I've tried ten different GF  ead mixes, and this is the only one that yields a GF  ead that my gluten eating family members like. I have found that the directions apparently used JUMBO eggs. I have tweaked it a bit, using an extra egg white or two for added loft, and when I do the sweet  ead, I only use half the sugar amount listed in the recipe on the bag and add a little salt to balance it out. Doing it that way, my "I only eat bakery  eads" hubby LOVES it.          I use a Zoji  ead machine on the QUICK course setting, LIGHT crust. This keeps it from being overkneaded or baking out the moisture. Then I cool it completely on a wire rack (uncovered). The loaf lasts a week at room temp without molding (if it's not eaten faster than that).          This  ead is PERFECT FOR SANDWICHES, because it is sturdy and not crumbly or dry. You DON'T HAVE TO TOAST IT TO TOLERATE IT.          Other GF  ead mixes I have tried include 2 different ones from Gluten Free Pantry, 2 from Bob's Red Mill, 1 from Orgran, 4 types from Breads From Anna ( our 2nd choice), & Namaste. All of these molded within 2 days at room temp, and refrigerating freezing made it necessary to toast it to make it tolerable. With the exception of Breads from Anna, all the other ones I listed in this paragraph are really worthy of use for  ead crumbs or croutons or making stuffing...but not much else.
