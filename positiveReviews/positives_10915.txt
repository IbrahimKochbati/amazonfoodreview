I was anxious to have our 18lb dog try these wholesome treats made with organic lamb, barley,carrots, apples and molasses. Our dog never refuses a treat, and so I anxious to have him try these healthy ones.  The treats are very big and very hard! Rectangular in shape with a perforation at the center, they are easy to  eak in half too hard to  eak any further unless you use a hammer and smash them.          Our dog struggled, but was persistent and managed to eventually chew it and eat it. He liked them, but I would not buy them again, because of their size. Really intended for larger dogs in my opinion, so we will end up giving them to our neighbor's large dog to enjoy.
