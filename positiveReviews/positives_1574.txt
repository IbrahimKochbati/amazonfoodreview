I received this as a gift a few weeks ago.  It is by far the best home made pancakes I have every had.  The taste and consistancy is excellent.  Blueberries mix very well with this product and the container is desinged to keep the product fresh and not let moths in.  You pay a little more but it is worth it in my opinion
