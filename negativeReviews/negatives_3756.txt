This stuff is NASTY.  I don't even think it's particularly good instant.  Why would anyone spend all that money on a keurig coffee maker in order to make instant coffee at home?  You just need a kettle or a microwave.  And what a waste of space in your kitchen and landfill.  The worst part is that you don't know it's instant until you taste it, look carefully at the package, and see that it's "water soluble"   code words for instant.  Open one up, and you'll see!
