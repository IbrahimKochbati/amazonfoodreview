Judging how swiftly my cat eats this food she truly likes it.     Plus, apparently it's a good stuff for older cats because it's a non prescription and easily found dry food with one of the lowest phosphorus levels (0.73%), which is quite beneficial for older cats' kidneys.     I can heartily recommend it!     Especially at such fantastic (and unbeatable anywhere!) price at Amazon.
