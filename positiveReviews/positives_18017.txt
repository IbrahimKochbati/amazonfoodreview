I want folks to know that this ear cleaner definitely has a distinct odor, contrary to what the other review says. However, I am buying lots more of this great stuff, as my kitties don't mind it at all and I find it to be very gentle, effective and it really is natural, with only 4 ingredients. Plus it's alcohol free, so I have peace of mind that it is safe for my babies and not harsh in any way. And I found it for the cheapest price on Amazon   the key is to buy several bottles for lower shipping & you may as well, since it only comes in a 4 oz size! Stock up now!
