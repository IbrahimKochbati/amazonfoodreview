We have a tiny little 8 lb maltese, and we got him the mini size bag of these.  Each time we give it to him, he seems to love it, but he had HORRIBLE diarrhea that led to multiple vet visits (it was awful, pretty much the worse diarrhea he's ever had at age 3).  I noticed about 8 hours after he ate the nutrident, the diarrhea started and it had turned blackish green.  Fast forward 2 months, and our dog was nursed back to health and happy...I didn't think that the nutrident was the cause of the diarrhea earlier, I thought it just made it worse so I gave him another one.  Wrong.  About 6 8 hours after, I noticed his normally firm stools were extremely soft and once again, they were blackish green.  I promptly threw the entire bag in the trash.  Terrible product and I will never be buying these again.  As a side note, my little guy tolerates and loves Greenies just fine.  I'll pay the extra few bucks for the Greenies to make sure he isn't food poisoned by these ever again.
