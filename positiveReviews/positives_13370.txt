I like the Newman's Special Blend, and would give it a 4.5 on the 1 to 5 star review range.  It is a little bitter as most stronger coffees are, but not too too bitter.  I would say it leans towards strong on the medium to strong scale, but it's not overwhelming.  If you like a nice normal blend with some kick, and are an advocate of organic initiatives, this is a great pick.          I also like to say that I always look to buy the good Newman's Own  ands when I can based on the fact that the Newman's Own Foundation continues Paul Newman's commitment to donate all profits to charity.  A fantastic American non profit company.  You are not forgotten Mr. Paul Newman   RIP.
