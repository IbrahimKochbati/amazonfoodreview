It is a very nice milk powder. I don't have any allergies in particular but I am genetically lactose intolerant. If I have more than 2 glasses of milk in a day, my stomach will feel all acidic. I don't face that same problem with this milk. I drink this over the liquid one sold at stores because this has more value for money and has got folic acid in it. Be warned though, if you don't like the smell of goat meat, you might not particularly like this since it has a bit of that smell. It mixes very well with hot water and not so well with normal water. Despite all of that, I love it and use it to make my milkshake.
