This crisp ead is nice and thin   great for those with more sensitive teeth.          I eat 3 of these in the morning for  eakfast with Smuckers Sugar Free jelly on them.     Guilt free and delicious.          You do have to be a little careful when spreading heavy stuff on them like peanut butter.     If you press too hard they can  eak.          One thing you can't tell from the box is that there are actually 2 air tight packs in the box.          I'm currently eating these and the ryvita sesame rye crisp ead.     Highly recommend both.          Note: I have lost 12 pounds by changing my diet but I give the most credit to 2 things.  Rye crisp ead replacing almost     all of the flour in my diet.  And drinking oolong tea which helps burn belly fat.     You do need to exercise a little bit too.
