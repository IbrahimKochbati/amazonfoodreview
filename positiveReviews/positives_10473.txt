I used to buy Chips Ahoy!  and cookies at the store once in a while because they were my favorite cookie from childhood. It had been years since I even tried a Keebler  and cookie and one day I found them on sale. I found that Keebler Chips Deluxe originals are thicker, fresher, more crumbly (although very few if any were  oken in the package), and overall much more melt in your mouth delicious than Chips Ahoy! originals which were thinner, a little harder, and almost a bit stale tasting. If I remember correctly, the Chips Deluxe cookies package has 2 ounces more in it. I've never been a fan of the soft batch.
