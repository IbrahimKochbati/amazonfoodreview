Having received a Keurig Brewer with an assortment of coffee several years ago as a gift.  I had tried many of the offerings not only preferring the Newman's own, but find that I now use it exclusively.  When friends come to visit, I can be sure that the coffee drinkers among them will be pleased with the rich flavored delicious coffee vwhich is Newman's Own Special Blend,     My order is now the pack of 80 cup box as the much more convenient.
