Updated (12 20 2011): When bought in bulk  pack of 4, Wegmans is 4 cents more expensive; *BUT* for the first time I signed up with Amazon's 'subscription' that takes off 15% when automatically ordering every 4 months, which I have found this to be very reasonable.          Original Review:     Buy it from Wegmans (best grocery store according to Consumer Reports in the U.S., or the world); it's cheaper there.          Also, this has less sugar, since it's whole grain.
