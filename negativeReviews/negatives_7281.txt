When you taste these you only get the taste of salt. Either the package I got came from the batch Amazon had in storage for long period of time or when they packaged these someone overdozed the salt. I have these only because  the Roland Kalamata Pitted (whole) olives have been out of stock for couple month. As result had to dispose to trash Rolan Kalamata Halves.
