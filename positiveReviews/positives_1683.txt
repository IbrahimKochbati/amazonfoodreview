My dog thinks he was born into the gentry and is entitled to fine dining each evening.  Accordingly, he will not eat plain kibble.  A scoop of this on his dry food, a little water to make gravy and we're good to go.  Ordering a case from Amazon was way easier than picking up individual cans at the pet store, too.  All in all, a success for us.
