This is a cool kit for gifts, or a great price on a kit of Dave's Sauce if you use it at home.  A good variety.  My only issue is that the bottles do not hold in the wood gift box very well at all, they slide up and down until they fall out of the open spaces in the front or back of the wooden gift box.  I would buy again.
