You cannot go wrong with these instant potatoes. They make a great side if you are in a hurry and do not need seasoning. I usually microwave them and sometimes they come out a little too watery so I keep a box of generic instant mashed around to add a little bit just in case. I am not 100% certain that this is an issue with the product or my microwave, but thought I would mention it in case anyone else had a problem.
