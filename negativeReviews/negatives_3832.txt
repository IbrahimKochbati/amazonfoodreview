Switch is fruit juice that looks and drinks like a cola. From the packaging and  anding to the carbonation, it looks to sub in for your favorite soda or energy drink and   let's face it   that's not a bad thing!          The drink itself is pretty good. A fairly concentrated blend of fruit juices plays well on the palate by refreshing carbonation.  It doesn't feel thick or sticky like other beverages in 8 oz cans, but it does have a hint of that cough syrup flavor that is so common these days. Fortunately that bit isn't overwhelming and doesn't hang around long.          After the swallow Switch is sweet, bubbly, and light   a perfect substitute for most sodas. At about a dollar a can, Switch is a great choice for anyone looking to cut back on cola or make their kids lunch a little healthier without making them look uncool. Even if it does still seem wrong to pay more for straight juice than heavily processed artificial flavors.
