I am enjoying eating this candy. The packaging is a little wasteful (individually wrapped). However, for this candy it is a good idea because the sour sugar grains would make a huge mess if you wanted to travel with some of these. This candy is not that bad for you compared to a lot of other candies because it doesn't have any trans fat (no partially hydrogenated oils). Other candies might still have it even if it lists 0g because they are allowed to write 0g of trans fat if the candy contains less than 0.5g per serving of trans fat.
