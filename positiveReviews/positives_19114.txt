I actually got this flavor for my husband who really does like flavored coffee, usually I'm not a fan of them. After trying a French roast K cup in my  and new coffee  ewer and being very disappointed, I decided to give this one a go. Brewing a cup with 5 ounces of water makes a very nice medium strength, vanilla flavored coffee that tastes pretty good in the morning.     Usually when I have vanilla coffee, I grind an inch or two of a vanilla bean that's leftover from cooking into dark roasted beans and  ew coffee in a regular drip  ewer. Compared to that, this coffee is a lighter roast but with a nice flavor, and the vanilla flavor is mildly sweet. This is a coffee k cup I would serve without hesitation to my dad and I think my husband will love it.     Definitely planning to try more of Van Houtte's flavors.
