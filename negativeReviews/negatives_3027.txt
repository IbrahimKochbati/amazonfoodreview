Those silly elves...they actually think that cardboard is tasty! Well, we'll see if our bird friends like 'em. Hopefully, they do not pass away after ingesting these travesties of the Keebler realm. I know that I would. The box they come packed in probably tastes better. Give these to your children when they annoy you...they will never act up again, nor ask for ice cream ever again. O.K., I'm done.          Update, 9 1 11, 12:01 PM: The birds have not touched them as of yet.
