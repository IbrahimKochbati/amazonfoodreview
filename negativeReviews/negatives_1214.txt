I like my chocolate tempered to some level of crispness. These nuts were chewy, not crunchy, and the chocolate coating was a bit mealy.     If you know anything about dark chocolate, and like yours with some snap, don't order these.          Actually, the best dark chocolate covered walnuts are called Perigord and are available through a Canadian company called Kis Global.     They are sun dried, super crispy, covered in a fairly thin shell of 70% dark chocolate, and dusted with unsweetened cocoa.     Very adult and superb.
