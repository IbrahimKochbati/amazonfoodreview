I am not the type that ever writes reviews, especially for the internet, but Pop Chips are the best  "potato chips" that I have ever had    so much so that I have to limit myself to one bag per week!  A friend introduced Pop Chips to me and I immediately told her that I hated her because they are so good, they are irrisistable.  I purchased a box of 12 to be delivered every three months so that I can limit myself to one bag per week ... otherwise, I would absolutely be in trouble.          Believe me, you have to try these chips!
