I have this Oskri Coconut Original on subscription order and I truly enjoy it.  The size of the bar gives one just enough without over doing on one serving.  I do not want to be without it in my house.  Just enough chocolate to make the little bar perfect.  I do keep it refrigerated whether it is necessary or not.  If you like coconut and like chocolate    go to it.
