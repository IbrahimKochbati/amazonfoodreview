The one thing I do not like is the chemical aftertaste I get. But, I know this is what all bars of this type taste like this. I like the variety of flavors these bars come in and the convenience. The high protein makes it a good snack to tide me over until I can eat a meal. But it takes me 45 minutes to eat an entire bar because it is so sweet. I think I will stick to more natural snacks. I would buy these again though if they were on sale. I do appreciate the many products out there for people like me with celiac.
