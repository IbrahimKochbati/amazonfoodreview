These are a great alternative to your usual "par for the course" snacks as well as traditional, bagged pork rinds. I had the same issues with some of the others who've bought them in that finding out how long to microwave them with your particular microwave is a trial and error process on the first bag or two. On my first attempt, they "fluffed up" fine, but I ended up microwaving them too long and some of them started to scorch (leaving a bad burnt smell, though not quite as bad as popcorn when the same thing happens). Spreading them out inside the bag before you start to microwave them is probably the single most important thing you can do. It's a little tricky, but you can get them to move around a bit with minimal effort. If you just throw the bag in the microwave as if it's popcorn, you won't get a quality product, but if you take the time to spread them out (as stated on the bag) and then watch the bag until it stops expanding (again, stated on the bag), they're quite good.          Once you get the hang of it, the Bacon Curls are pretty delicious, especially paired with a beer or two (something pale and drinkable, from a "yard work" kind of beer to something like an IPA). The curls rinds are light and fluffy, but very crunchy (surprisingly so, I was halfway expecting there to be some kind of greasy sogginess, but there isn't). They're on the salty side, but again, with the beer, that's a good thing. I like how they come out of the package sizzling and popping a bit, warm (not hot) and delicious. If you already like pork rinds, then this is almost a no  ainer, as this is the same thing, only better (fresh, warm, delicious and with less fat).
