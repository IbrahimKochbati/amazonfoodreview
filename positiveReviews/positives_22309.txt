I'm a type 2 diabetic and this is one of the very few canned soups I'll eat. I take half the can and add steamed  occoli or cauliflower to make it more of a meal. I've also used it to make a mexican chicken casserole. I just layer low carb tortillas, baked, diced boneless chicken, the soup mixed with a "sofrito" kind of mixture consisting of chopped peppers, onion, fresh mushrooms and usually chopped  occoli   saute in a bit of olive oil and add to the soup and on top I put shredded pepper jack cheese or sometimes some store bought already shredded Mexican cheese.          At the time of this writing, price Amazon offers for this soup is comparable to Walmart + they'll deliver it right to your door for FREE!          The only downside to this soup and the only thing that keeps me from eating it every day is the sodium content. There are 890mg of sodium per serving and 2 servings of soup per can so if you ate the entire can of soup in one sitting that would be a whopping 1780mg of sodium for one meal! I don't have high blood pressure or anything but I do watch my salt intake.          If they could figure out a way to reduce the sodium of this soup, it would be perfect and I would eat it probably daily because it tastes so good and is fairly low in carbs.          Despite the sodium content, I'm going to keep buying this soup. The addition of more veggies cuts the saltiness enough for me and it makes a quick, low carb meal.
