I use Mrs. Dash spices, incl the Original version, for almost everything   soups, salads, salad dressings, chicken, fish, beef, etc. They're just unbeatable for flavor and no salt. When used in something liquid (soups or salad dressings) where they will soak a bit, the "bits" expand and you have tasty bits of carrot, onion, or whatever other veggies are in that particular type.          I would really like to be able to buy all of them in the large containers (at least the H&G, original, and lemon pepper), but they don't seem to be available.          Amazon has the best price I have found on the net.
