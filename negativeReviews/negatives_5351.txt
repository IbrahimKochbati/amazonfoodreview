I drink am a frequent coffee drinker   at least a couple of cups a day.  So I was glad to see this product available.  I often switch between light roast and dark roast coffee   depends on time of day, my mood, and availably.  I like to enjoy a good Dark French Roast at night.  I made a pot of this for my husband and me to try.  We were not impressed   it had a strong odor, and a very bitter after taste (neither of us finished our cup).  As far as the impact of the low acid   we couldn't judge since we didn't drink enough.
