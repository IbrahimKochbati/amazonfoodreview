This is a perfect example of "you get what you pay for".  Yes this is expensive but by golly, I think it's real food!  Amazing!  Upon opening the little can, I see flakes of fish & some liquid.  Smells like fish that you eat.  Check the ingredients, hmmm fish.  How about that?  No by products?  Where are the guts they scrap off the floor?  All that yummy stuff not fit for humans to eat...even though a small percentage does end up in our food supply.  The box says "People Food for Cats"  They weren't kidding!  That's why this is so expensive!  It's FOOD!  Such a novel concept!     Do the cats like it?  Oh my yes!  We have 6 cats & they simply LOVE this stuff & why wouldn't they?  This food, it is worth it!  Good food equals healthy cats.  Healthy cats don't go to the vet so darn much.  Less vet visits equal more money!  Yippie!     To ease the price burden, each 4 pack box of food contained a coupon for $1.00 off the next 4 pack purchase.  If you fill in some info on the coupon itself, they will mail you an additional $1.00 off coupon for your next purchase.  Not bad!
