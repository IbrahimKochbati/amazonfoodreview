The cans are listed as 13 fluid ounces each, but I measured and each can was 12 ounces or less.  Since you have to have equal parts water and formula, I had to carefully measure each can.  Each can was different.  The formula itself worked fine, but it was misleading as to how much I was actually getting for the price.  The already mixed formula is much cheaper per ounce than this or even the powder.
