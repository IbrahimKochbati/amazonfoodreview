Although I'm not particular fond of figs, I bought this sauce marinade on the advice of a total stranger I met at a Long Island, NY winery. He told me how unbelievable it was on steak, and, boy, was he right!  I've used it on steak as a dipping sauce and I've barbequed with it.  I've used it on pork and chicken and have had it accidentally soak up into my side dish on my plate,such as rice and vegetables.  I don't care what you use it on, it's absolutely the most delicious concoction I've ever used on everything (although, I must admit, I haven't tried it on ice cream or cake! Just joking!)  I'm so hooked, I plan to buy a case of it.
