Wonderful Walkers Premium 'traditional' Scottish Short ead! Almost the same as my mother's home made Scottish Short ead. This item was well worth the price for the size. Loved the tin too. Nice way the short ead was packaged and sealed in individual portions. The short ead did not last long however too good to not enjoy it with a good cup of tea.
