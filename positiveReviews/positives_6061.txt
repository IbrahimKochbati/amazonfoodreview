I like this product, and i agree with any post, who says it mixes well, i bought a sample case just to test the waters, and i dont feel bloated or anything after i drink it, i think i feel my body is responding to it very well, i am going to finish up the muscle milk protein because i bought it and i pay over 30 for it, lol, but when i finish up the other proteins i purchase, i am going to stick with egg white protein, since i dont like eating them, everyone taste buds is different, some may like it, some may dont, then depending on your body chemistry some responds well to egg whites, some dont, but as for me personally i like it so far, might try out the strawberry passion protein, but the vanilla kind taste very good, i would suggest this protein should be used for edurance athletes, or people who are into calistenics such as push ups and pull ups,
