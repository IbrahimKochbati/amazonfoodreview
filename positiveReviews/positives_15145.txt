Can't change the rating, I now give it 1 star.          I used Canidae for the last year and my dogs thrived on it.  Now their coats are dull, they scratch and lick all the time.  Loose stools...and they only eat it if they are hungry.          I understand about the commodities going up.  But, I would have rather they raised the prices rather than switch ingredients without warning.          Now, I gotta go hunt for another  and that is good for my dogs, and not part of the original recall.          It may just be time to buy a cow!
