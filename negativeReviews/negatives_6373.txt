I though that everything was fine as the first one I took out of the box matched the illustration exactly.  None of the others matched the illustration.  They do not say "EXTRA BOLD" on the cups at all, but the sticker on the box does actually say extra bold.     It's been a while since I tried one of these, so I wasn't sure if they just mislabeled them, decided they weren't "extra bold" to begin with, or they are jsut pranksters.  At any rate, I took off two stars because I suspect that they pulled a fast one at the factory.
