Melitta's cafe collection gourmet coffee is wonderful. It tastes rich, and just like a gourmet coffee should.  This coffee tasted like something I could have gotten in Europe at a cafe.          It  ewed very quickly, and with no coffee grain residue.  This is probably due to the coffee being an extra fine grind. The decaffinated version tasted great on its own, without milk or sugar to season.          I'm a coffee lover, and I enjoy Gevalia and Godiva coffee two other excellent foregn  ands.  The Melitta stands on its own, and are their equivalents in taste and price. Enjoy a cup today!
