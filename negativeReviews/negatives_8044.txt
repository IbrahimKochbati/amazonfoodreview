I really wanted to like this product but sadly, I hated it.          The texture was weird. Some pieces were almost "pre chewed" in texture while others were so tough and full of gristle you couldn't eat them.          The smell was just foul. I ordered the Teriyaki flavor and have never smelled anything like this before. It smelled rotten, rancid. The smell clung to your hands.          There was a thick grease on each piece. I've never had jerky that was so greasy.          I am feeding the strips I didn't eat, that would be almost the whole bag, to my dog. She likes them and hasn't gotten sick, yet.          I've never left a harsh review before but this product was so beyond bad I had to be  utally honest. I'm sure there are people who love this product but I am not one of them.
