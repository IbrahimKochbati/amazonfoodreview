Warning to other dog owners: the edible Nylabones are extremely dangerous for dogs with a big & greedy appetite.  My dog swallowed it whole within 30 seconds of giving it to her and choked on it.  She was fully unconscious before I could dislodge the bone and  eathe into her nose to  ing her back to life... We almost lost her over this bone.  If your dog is a greedy chewer or eater, then please don't buy edible Nylabones.
