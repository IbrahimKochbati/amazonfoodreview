hello,          i don't care if it's manufacturer's or Amazon's description, but it's weak. 1, you can't blow up product picture. 2. description is inconsistent. sometimes it states quantity in box, but most of the time, it does not, as with this size "petite". by the way, can someone tell the manufacturer it's bad french, there's no "e" at the end?!          thanks
