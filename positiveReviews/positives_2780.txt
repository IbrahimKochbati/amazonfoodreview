I don't know why this flour isn't available in grocery stores in the Midwest.  Typical grocer flours have a protein content much too high to give an authentic taste to such foods as pizza crust and homemade pastas.  And after years of making homemade pastas and trying to find that perfect recipe that would result in those served in the best Italian restaurants in the US and Europe, I'm happy to discover, the secret was in the 00 protein content all along.  What a fabulous difference this flour makes!  Freezes well too.
