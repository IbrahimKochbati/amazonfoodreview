I'm a big fan of Annie's Shells and White Cheddar (the purple box), so I figured I'd try this to see if it was as good. It's ok, but the whole grain pasta is very whole grainy. It doesn't quite cook the same, the texture difference is very noticeable and the sauce doesn't seem to blend with it as well.
