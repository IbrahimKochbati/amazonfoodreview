These contain all organic ingredients and the doggies gobbled them up.  What more can you say about a dog treat?  One of my dogs is a little fussy and sometimes turns her nose up at other treats but had no problem inhaling these and asking for more.  Do the math and decide if organic dog treats are worth the extra cash, but if giving you dogs the healthiest treats is a priority I can't see you going wrong with these.  Can't comment on the flavor.
