We've been buying this coffee for over a year on the once a month plan, and still love it !. Never mind the "Five pounds is a lot of coffee, and it will lose it's taste after three or four weeks'" It lasts us about five weeks, and it's still as good as it was at the start; at least to us less sophisticated coffee drinkers. And we also tried buying it direct from the roaster, following one review comment that it was much fresher that way; B.S., Back to Amazon; the price is less, shipping is reliable, and the coffee is just as fresh, and just as good. After years of looking, it's our favorite coffee, from what has become our favorite vendor. It's just the right roast, just between french roast and the weak stuff, and forgiving enough to make a mistake with the  ew time or the water and still be acceptable. But as stated earlier, We're not nearly expert enough to make the really critical fine point judgements.     Terry and Judy Hedgecock     Rural Arizona
