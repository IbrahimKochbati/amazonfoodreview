I was lucky enough to have been in Hawaii last summer  where i first discovered this amazing drink! At first  i was a little freaked out when i tasted the Aloe pulp ( as i was not expecting that); but after enjoying my very first bottle  i was automatically hooked on the taste, the benefits with the aloe; and i could not drink enough of it.          Then  to my dismay  upon returning to Montreal, Canada where I live; I could not find it anywhere!!! The only places that I could find it online were in other provinces  and they would not ship to Montreal. (nor was it cost efficient for me)     Then a month ago  I was shopping in one of our largest grocery stores (IGA Select) and found it in their health section....but at over $3.50 for a small bottle  as much as I liked it  it was a little steep.          Then I found it on Amazon  probably at the best price you can find anywhere; and even with free shipping. (They dont ship to Canada either  but I have it shipped to a USA address and a friend  ings it home for me. This friendly service costs me a few bottles for sure  but well worth it!!!)          My fridge is happily stocked with an assortment of ALO flavors; and needless to say I have been, and will continue to; order a case or more per month!          I am very much looking forward to trying their new flavors!!!
