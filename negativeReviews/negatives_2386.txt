i ordered this on 8 29 10, and it didn't ship out until three and a half weeks later. it's 10 12 10 and i still haven't received it yet. next time, i plan to order from a merchant who can fulfill it in a reasonable timeframe.          as far as the product is concerned, i do like that the similac liquid formula in the 32oz size doesn't contain BPA. i was really upset when i researched and discovered that the single use ready made liquid containers and large powdered containers both contain BPA. i would expect more diligence from similac to be BPA free in all of their packaging.
