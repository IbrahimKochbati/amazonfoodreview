i'm a big fan of hodgson mill products (we love their  ead mixes, i use their pancake mixes.) i'm not afraid of whole grains  (i mill my own grains, wheat, kamut, rye, barley) and i even put milled flax seed in my (home made) yogurt. I've been a baker for 35 years and love to try new recipes.          i had high expectations for this product but was very disappointed by the results: the box calls for too much fat and the baked  ownies have a distinctly oily feel in the mouth.  I can enjoy the grittiness and the chocolate flavor is fine but i would caution buyers against the results if following the instructions on the box          one of the problems is that the coarse texture of the mix does not allow the fat to be absorbed well.          i will go back to making whole wheat  ownies from scratch.  a little bit of time required... a little less convenient but  ownies being a treat (and comfort food), the texture should be right :)
