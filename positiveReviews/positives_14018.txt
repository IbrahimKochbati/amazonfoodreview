I saw this in a segment on a television show about foods to try if you want to cut fat and calories. I decided to try it by first ordering a small jar. It is very easy to mix (two TB powder with one TB water) and this  makes two TB of  creamy peanut butter and is only 45 calories. (I think REAL peanut butter is about 190). I was amazed  and very pleasantly surprised with the authentic peanut butter taste and consistency. Two TB is plenty to make a sandwich or a topping for another food. I even had my husband try it, as he loves the extra chunky, fat filled kind. His words...."not bad!" He won't be eating it, but he doesn't need to watch his waistline anyway. For someone who does, it's a great substitute.  I just ordered a large bag!
