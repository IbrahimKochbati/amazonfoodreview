I bought this toy and put one of my dogs in her crate with it.  I just filled it with a handful of kibble.  1 2 hour later the Tug a Jug was  oken.  My dog had chewed the end off where it screws on.  Her chewing destroyed the threads so the toy is useless. She's a 55 pound food motivated dog, medium chewer.  My original worry about the Tug a Jug was that it would be noisy on hard floors.  It never made it that far.  I had better luck with the Busy Bone toy, although she can get the Gnawhide rings off pretty quick. At least that one is still usable.
