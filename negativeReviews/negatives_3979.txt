the shipping was great... packaging great and the product, wonderful.  the shipping cost was out of line.  If my order was sent in a USPS flat rate boxes, you can get a much cheaper shipping cost and it is just as fast as UPS.  Especially to Nome, Alaska.  Shippers like UPS because of the ease of them picking up the items to ship but if they did their home work, they would see that the USPS does the same and it is so much cheaper...and to Nome Alaska...faster!     Thank you for letting me vent!     Patty Andersen     A     laska resident for 32 years
