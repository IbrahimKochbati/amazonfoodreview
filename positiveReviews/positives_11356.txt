These bully springs are excellent for dogs who tend to scarf things down quickly. My French bulldog (28 lbs) would chew half weay through a regular 6 inch bully stick and then basically swallow what was left. (This is why he never gets rawhides! At least bully sticks are 100% edible digestible.) The spring shape, however, really forces him to SLOW DOWN. He works his way around each coil slowly. For me, this makes them worth the $$ just in terms of TIME he gets out of each one! He also absolutely adores the flavor  as with most bully sticks.
