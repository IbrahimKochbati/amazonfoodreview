This may seem like a treat to my cats, but it really is food.  My two youngest cats prefer Tasty Treasures over all the Friskies flavors.  They sit and and eat until every last bit is gone.  I've never had a cat do that with any cat food.  I've been waiting for Amazon to carry all the flavors...at a reasonable price...so I can stop hauling them from my local Petstore.  I highly recommend this   especially if you have a picky eater.
