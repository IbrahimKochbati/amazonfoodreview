I purchased this tea because it is recommended for helping women's PMS symptoms and menopause symptoms.  I've only had one cup of it, so I can't say if it has helped my symptoms or not.  I have purchased other teas of this  and.  I would recommend their teas.  I wasn't crazy about the taste of the red clover, but that is just my personal opinion.  It's a little bitter but bearable.  Add some sugar and you're good to go.
