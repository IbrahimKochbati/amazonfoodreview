We bought this popcorn to go with a machine we had purchased, and the machine ended up not working.  So we took these portion packs of popcorn and used them on the stove top.  They worked great, everyone said it was good popcorn.  Would definitely buy this again, even if you just do it on the stove top, it's so easy having everything bundled into one package and ready to use!
