Here's the straight talk from a foodie, not a Top Chef food critic, but a foodie:      Name: Pop Chips. They are cooked in a kettle with pressure and heat. Fantastic. Not baked or fried. Made by the company POP CHIPS so it isn't frito lays or mars trying to forcefeed America in disguise.      Packaging and Branding: Colorful and way too heavy duty bags. This is why they are slightly expensive. Similar to kettle chips packaging. You will have fun opening the bags with a POP. Packaging was great. I've eaten about 6 of the small bags and not one was even slightly damaged.      Taste and Texture: They are about the size of half dollar coins, kind of puffy like a pork rind or rice cake, and they are not crunchy hard like potato chips but they do crunch. Definitely distinctive and they deserve a place on the market.      Nutrition: 100 Calories! Unfortunately, you know what this means. It's not a big grab by any means. It's about 15 20 chips per .8 oz bag. Which, honestly, is great for portion control. It's probably all we need and popchips knows it. Definitely more filling than other 100 calorie snacks made by, say, SnackWell or the oreos mini muffins type.      Flavor: The 3 pack comes with Cheddar Potato, Sea Salt and Vinegar, and Barbecue Potato. As an English major I'm inclined to take the "potato" off the label. Just as salty and flavorful as normal chips, but not overpowering like some (cheap tortilla chips some doritos). NATURAL taste.     I bought these on sale with a 15 20% discount I believe. I might purchase them again if I won a gift card or something, but I would rather look for these in a store or at a warehouse club and save some cash trees on the gigantic box they come in. But if you are on the fence and worried about being disappointed, you won't be. This is definitely quality over quantity.
