I've been buying Archer Farms "Chocolate Chunk Cherry" granola cereal from Target for years, and it's probably the greatest cereal I've ever eaten.  But now I live over a hundred miles from the nearest store; so, I came to Amazon, thinking to purchase it here.  And I was shocked by the price.  This particular buyer wants us to pay $11 for the same amount of cereal (1lb 4oz) that only cost $3.50 at Target???  Is this a misprint?  It's a joke, right?  Are you kidding, or is this for real?
