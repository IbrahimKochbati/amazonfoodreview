My 19 year old cat was on a prescription diet for almost 2.5 years for his reduced kidney function. It was a great food, but the vet that carried it was 45 minutes away and my other 15 year old cat had loose stools with it. So, after reading MANY labels, Royal Canin Mature seemed to be the best one to go with. It's not as expensive as the prescription and it worked wonders for both cats. My eldest has since gone to the Rainbow Bridge to wait for me, but he enjoyed this food until the end. I tried to switch my other cat to a different, less expensive  and that also has lower protein and natural ingredients, but he eats only enough to not be hungry; he is not enjoying his food. So, I'm switching back to Royal Canin Mature. I'm glad to be able to get it from Amazon, it's definitely cheaper than the local, but nationwide, pet chain store.
