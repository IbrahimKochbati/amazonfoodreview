I love Chuckles, so the temptation to buy some in bulk overtook my better judgement recently. I don't know why, but I was surprised to discover that each HUGE ("Movie Size" box was mostly air and contained a small clear plastic wrapping with 8 10 pieces of candy in it. I AM old enough to have fallen for this. I ate them all quickly to quell my feelings of having been made an idiot out of yet again by air filled boxed nothingness. Chuckles is a great and classic candy   But this packaging is quite deliberately deceptive and insulting. I would shop for other packages (at other sites) should the Chuckles urge overtake me yet again.
