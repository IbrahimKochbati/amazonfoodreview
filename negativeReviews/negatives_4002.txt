I love coconut but this bar is a disappointment.  The first bite had an odd flavor but after a couple more it got a bit better.  The problem is that it's very oily, they put way too much rice syrup and it's literally juicy with oil when you bite into it.  At 246 calories, 14g fat 33g carbs and 29g sugar, this bar is not worth it at all.
