If giving your kids, or yourself, carbonated juice gets them (or you) to drink more juice and less soda, that's good.  But the taste of this is similar to the juice in juice boxes.  It's a blend of juices with a fruit punch type of flavor.  It's also quite pricey.  Interesting once, but I won't be buying more.
