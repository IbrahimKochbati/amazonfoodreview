I am in NO way any coffee expert, connoisseur, or heavy user. To be perfectly honest, I had to look up how to SPELL connoisseur! But having a heart attack 6 months ago, I am learning to never use caffeine, salt, or almost ANY darn thing I love. And I HATE anything that is "light", decaf or artificially sweetened. My wife has bought about every single  and of instant decaf coffee for me along with assorted "real" decaf to try in her drip coffee maker. Hated em all, just hated them. Saw this so thought I would try the latest  and I would hate since it wouldn't cost me anything.           First batch was way to bitter for me, didn't even want to try any more but my wife said she would make it weaker. From that next batch on, I became hooked on this  and. I don't like the price, but love the taste.  That conflict alone makes me drop my rating to give it a 4 star overall. If I tinker with taste as I also add assorted coffee mate creamers (also something I am not allowed anymore but REFUSE to give up), the taste goes to a 5 for me. Even with all the discounts if I order through the subscribe & save program (see below), I find this a bit pricey.          ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________          UPDATE: December 4 2010:       It still pains me to pay so much but looks like this will be the very 1st Vine Program Item I ever got that will make an actual buyer out of me. As a result, I raise my review from 4 stars to 5 starts. Another thing I like is I have no decaf "aftertaste" that I always experience with other  ands. It is a wonderful thing to find at least one new thing (for ME anyway) that I can still really enjoy, that helps me relax in the middle of all this can't eat this, can't drink that "stuff" going on in my life the past 6 months. It's also the time I haven't felt like I was compromising good taste for good health. For that, I am truly grateful. Just ordered the 3 pack on the AMAZON Subscribe & save page.
