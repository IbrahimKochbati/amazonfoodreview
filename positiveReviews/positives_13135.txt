This pasta is everything a pasta should be. Its healthy, whole, has great flavor unlike the wall paper paste we usually call pasta. It has body, holds up to the flavors of sauces and is worth every penny. It is real food.     It doesn't have the off flavors some whole wheat pastas have and I had no problems with digestion. Some whole wheat products bother my stomach.     You do have to cook it a bit longer. Not a big deal its delicious. Try it!
