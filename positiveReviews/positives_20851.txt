If you're wanting to get away from pork and cholesterol, go for this.  I'm not a vegan or vegetarian by any means, but I choose not to eat pork for various reasons, and when you know what goes into regular chorizo...Well, it's not your usual meat.  So how do I still enjoy my mom's awesome chorizo?  I buy her Soyrizo!
