This is one of my favorites.  It's smooth and rich and not too strong for morning but also bold enough that if I like a cup in the afternoon it will do for that too.  My only problem is that I can never find it locally   I almost always have to get it online which is usually more expensive.  I've tried the Obsidian as a substitute and I don't like that one quite as much as the Mahogany.
