I also tried the Cherry Chocolate and Peanut Butter Cup flavors and they are amazing!  So thick and creamy, especially if you make it with a little milk!  What I really like is that they aren't overly sweet, and that it mixed together very well, unlike most  ands that just clump up and stick to the spoon.  Definitely my favorite hot chocolate!  The cider flavors are great too!
