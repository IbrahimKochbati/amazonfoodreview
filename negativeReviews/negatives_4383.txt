This tasted old and dry   I found it to taste stale, like old, instant coffee. It was a disappointment because I got this machine for my son to take to college, and had hoped the coffees would taste good.          I am still hopeful that other manufacturers will start to make capsules for this machine. But, currently, this is probably the strongest flavor available, and is just not very flavorful.
