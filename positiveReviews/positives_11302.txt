Rooibos Natural Red tea is something of a personal taste! It has an interesting flavor as all things that are good for you do! I prefer to add a little cinnamon to mine. It is known to be used for people who get GOUT and since I do , I have had no incidents since drinking this tea! If it works, use it! It is a good tea and caffeine free. Some prefer it with sugar!Give it a try too for it's calming effect!
