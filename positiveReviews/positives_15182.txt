This Beef Stew is fantastic!  It actually tastes like beef stew, no artificial flavorings or colors.  Everything in it is organic and there is quinoa too.  Babies need to be able to taste what real food tastes like.  This product delivers!  All of the other baby beef stews taste like a mystery and loaded with extra "stuff" that babies do not need.  It has great portable packaging for moms on the go.  Great price too!
