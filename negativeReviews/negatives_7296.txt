taste was very good but texture was watery compared to other  ands . i make a fat free  sugar free pumpkin custard using egg whites. only 400 calories for the whole dish . with other  ands of canned pumpkin it is the same texture as a normal pumpkin pie minus the crust . this  and comes out a bit soupy but still quite tasty. for a custard it is fine but for a pie ,it would never hold up to being a pretty slice, to hold it's shape unless you  over baked it. mind you   with the shortage we are having i would buy it again , i will buy it again because the taste is good unless you over bake it .
