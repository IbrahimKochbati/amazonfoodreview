I was looking forward to trying these, but they did not live up to my expectations. Not enough chocolate chunks, almost enough almonds. The manufactured taste is not something I crave. I had never thought to put almonds into cookies, as opposed to walnuts which I don't like. This give me a great idea to make homemade chocolate chip cookies with almonds! I love soft baked cookies, these hit the spot in that department, but failed in flavor.
