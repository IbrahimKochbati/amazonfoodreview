When one purchases a product that is called Newman's Organics, one would expect organic food.  Not just the vegetables, which are much less expensive to be organic than the meat or chicken.  I was very, very disappointed to find out that the chicken is not organic.  For a couple of dollars more, just buy real organic dog food. This dog food isn't exactly cheap, so you expect that they will provide what they are advertising.  This whole "greenwashing" thing needs to be regulated better.  If someone uses the word organic in their description, it better be organic.  Otherwise the consumer is being deceived which is unfortunate.  Newmans has a great reputation, I buy a lot of their products, but this was intentionally deceptive and it makes me reconsider buying anything from them in the future.          On the positive side, my dog loved it, she would lick the bowl around the room for 20 minutes after the last morsel was consumed.  I have no idea what they put in it that tasted so good, it's like the crack cocaine of dog food.  She has never been a finicky eater, she'll pretty much eat anything voraciously, but this stuff really rocked her epicurean world.  Too bad she isn't getting any more of it.
