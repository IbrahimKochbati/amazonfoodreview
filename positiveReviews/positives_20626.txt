This is the best chili to create your own without starting from scratch. I add lean ground beef, a jar of hot salsa, a few drops of cayenne pepper and a medium onion. Top it off with some melted low fat mexican shredded cheese and I'm good to go. I like my chili super hot! Corn  ead muffins on the side.
