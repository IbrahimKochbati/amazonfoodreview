The Quaker chocolate and almond naturally flavored oatmeal cookie is really not bad.  I recently got a package of six individually wrapped cookies.  I ate the first one, and was surprised at how fresh it tasted.  You can really taste the milk chocolate, as well as the small nuts in the cookie ( I assume the chocolate and the nuts are not larger in the cookie due to the company wanting to control calorie content).  And speaking of calorie content, each cookie according to the package has 180 calories.          Some of the few drawbacks with this cookie are the small size of the nuts and chocolate used to make the cookie. As I mentioned above, I am sure the company did this to control calorie content.  This cookie also bills itself as a "good source of fiber"   that is right on the package   yet I could not find any type of  eakdown on fiber content per cookie on the box package or the individual wrapping.          In summary, this is a product that will appeal to women trying to pack a more nutritious lunch for themselves on a work day or for their children in their lunch to school.
