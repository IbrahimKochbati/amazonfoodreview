very disappointed with this product. Although the taste is good it was difficult to serve these crackers with a topping of hummus to other celiac friends. The two foil pkgs in each box does not guarantee is whole cracker. From one foil pkg. in the first box I ordered I had 5 whole crackers...the rest of the foil pkg. was  oken pieces. This does not speak well for Glutino products. I will never order them from Amazon again.
