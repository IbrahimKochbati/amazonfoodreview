This product is great!  When mixed with milk it becomes a slightly less sweet chocolate milk.  It is hardly gritty like some other superfoods may be and you even get a hint of the berry flavor.  Unfortunately, my kids who are both over 10, will not drink it.  They take a few  sips but never want to finish it.  I've even added additional chocolate syrup but they don't care for it.  It reminds me of Ovaltine, which, when I was a kid, I didn't like as much as Quick...  great product   every kid is different so you will just have to try it and see.  Know that if the kids don't like it, an adult surely would.
