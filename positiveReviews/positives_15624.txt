Well, my kitty did not like this at first.  He was really annoyed with me.  Left the food in the bowl and walked away all angry and poofy looking.  Ouch.          But, then he came back a little later and starting scarfing.  And from that point on, he's been joyfully eating this.  I'm so glad!          The food is very good looking and doesn't have that 'cat food' smell, which is very nice.  I hate getting that cat food smell on my hands!  Blech.  This food is not smelly at all.          I like the 3 ounce cans.  I've tried to save some money by getting bigger cans, giving him half and covering and storing the other half for later in the refrigerator, but he doesn't like his food cold (I don't blame him) and it seems to just get wasted.  So, I like the smaller cans.          Ultimately, as long as the food is ok for him, the only thing that matters to me is if my kitty will eat it and be happy with it.  And he is.  So, I'll get him this again.          *************************          UPDATE   15 December 2008          We just finished the last can last night and my kitty enjoyed every single one.          The Chicken Pot Pie was a little bothersome because it has so much liquid in it.  If I wasn't careful as I opened the can, I would wear some of the juice.  Yes, it's very nice juice, but I still didn't want it on me!  My kitty really liked the juice so it was worth the extra effort to be careful as I opened the can.          I will order more of this and cycle it in with his other canned food.
