I wonder if someone started listening to the reviews on here of dented cans? Mine was shipped in a box with air filled bags inside of another box with a ton more air filled bags. No dents.          I purchased this oil for two reasons. One, homemade healthy mayonnaise. Two, high smoking point. I used it last night to deep fry some soft corn tortillas to make hard taco shells. Worked great. No gross after taste like you get with canola. I also deep fried some flour tortillas for my husband (I have a wheat allergy), and he LOVED them. The great part is I can deep fry and not have to feel guilty about serving up rancid, omega 6 filled food. Very happy.
