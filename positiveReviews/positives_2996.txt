This was a great selection of hot sauces, with a good variety of flavor. Each of the different bottles had a unique taste and each of them had a heat around the same as tabasco sauce. Oh, except for the Dave's Insanity. That will have you pleading for the sweet release of death.          But the other sauces are very tasty, and very usable in everyday cooking. Recommended.
