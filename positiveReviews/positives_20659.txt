I love this tea! It has a clean mint taste that's nice and smooth. The only ingredient is mint, which makes it great for an upset tummy. But it's tasty enough to drink whenever! And I love that it's organic and they use natural materials for their tea bags and recycled materials for packaging. Yay for green companies!
