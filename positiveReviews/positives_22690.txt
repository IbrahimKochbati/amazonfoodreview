This popcorn is da bomb!  Very yummy, even when cold and over 24 hours old.  (I know kind of gross)  I bought the 2.5 ounce so I could pop smaller portions in my 4 ounce popcorn machine.  Works like a champ.  The oil is coconut oil, same oil they use in theaters nationwide.  It is a solid and is a little difficult to get out and into the kettle while you try not to spill your corn and salt mixture.  I let the kettle heat up for about 3 5 minutes, then empty the oil in the kettle.  Immediate afterwords I pour in the popcorn salt mixture and less than 4 minutes BAM you are at the movies for about 1 56 of the price.  Healthy economical snack for the whole family.  We LOVE our Great Northern popper and popcorn from Discount Tommy!!!
