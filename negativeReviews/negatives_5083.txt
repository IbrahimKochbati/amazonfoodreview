I wanted to like this item and had seen the generally favorable reviews.  I loaded it with some liver treats and opened our front door to offer it to my dog   she grabbed the rope and released it...and it fell about two feet onto the step and cracked!  I was pretty surprised it took that little to  eak it.  The crack was on the screw in bottom so it spread and basically the bottom  oke and it was useless...back to Amazon, sorry!  Maybe a rubber guard for the bottom would make this a better product?
