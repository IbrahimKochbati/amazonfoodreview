I've known I need to remain gluten free for over 25 years now, and have tried many, many gluten free products to get as close to the old "normal" days as I can.  The bottom line is that my wife and I purchase the Tinkyada products almost exclusively when we buy pasta (she eats it too despite not having to be gluten free).  And getting it from Amazon make it far easier too, since we can't find most of their products in our reasonably large city   we have to drive 100 miles to the REALLY big city.  So for about the same cost, minus tax, minus travel or shipping, we get it direct and avoid extra expenses.          As for the product, this is as good as any "regular" pasta I ever had in my "past life."  There's far less stickiness, and it holds up well for leftovers the next day.  It is not mushy or relatively tasteless like some of the other  ands of gluten free pasta we've had in the past.          When we give 5 stars, it's because it stands out as superior.  A really good product "only" gets a 4 star rating from us.  This one's a definite 5.
