Taste isn't everything and this stuff doesn't taste that great but it works and I'm grownup enough to understand the difference. It costs a little less through Amazon but you have to pay shipping. It costs a little more direct and you have to pay tax in California but if you buy 2 or more bottles the shipping is free.
