I used this fondant to create dice to add to cupcakes for a Bunko for the Cure fundraiser.  They came out awesome and were a huge hit!  The fondant color was  ight white and worked great with the Wilton food markers (for the dots on the dice).  This fondant is so incredibly easy to work with and it tasted delicious.  Even the non fondant lovers in the crowd (including me) loved the taste! I look forward to using this product again....and again....and again!
