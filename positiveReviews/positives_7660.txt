These were a great quick snack that did not raise my blood sugar level and you could sprinkle a variety of seasons to your taste preferences.  However, I chose to use the auto ship. Because of new health issues, I am unable to eat these anymore.  However because Lowrey's does not give you any option or information on how to cancel an order, I am forced to waste money buying these and having to toss them.  I hate to write this here, but maybe if they read it, they'll add the contact information.  Thank you.
