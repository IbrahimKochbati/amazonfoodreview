This was a disappointment.  I use other products from this line manufacturer on a regular basis.  I bought this item as a convenience to carry liquid Stevia in my purse.  The first time I went to use it, the liquid was a dark color...almost black..and I had to throw out the latte I was trying to sweeten.  All the manufacturer's other liquid products are clear, and, in fact, this is titled "clear liquid".  It must have been outdated spoiled. I had already thrown the packing out, so don't know how it was dated.  I tried calling the Amazon supplier, but the call rolled into voice mail.  It's not enough money to spend time following up, but it was disappointing.
