I love this tea from Arizona tea hot or cold.  I call it my bubble gum tea.  This is a very pleasing tea that has a wonderful aroma and taste just like the Arizona tea in the bottles only hot.  It is very relaxing in the evening or invigorating in the morning or anytime for that matter.  I highly recommend it if you like Green Tea.
