I have the 8ounce popcorn machine with kettle. I have used 10 packs of the popcorn out of the 24 pack case. The taste of the popcorn is great, but at least 25% of the popcorn does not pop. The kernel cather is half full of unpopped kernels after each batch. I will try other  ands because to Me that is just too much unpopped kernels.
