I do reccomend this product, as it is effective and very fun to try. Here are the setbacks: It only lasts around 30 minutes, not 2 hours. I bought these in lieu of the actual berries ($90 vs. $10) so they weren't as potent as I had read about expected. Nonetheless, they do work! Lemons and limes were delicious!     Oh, be sure to move the tablet over the ENTIRE surface of your tounge in order to cover ALL of your taste buds.
