I bought this sampler for my Mother and she loved it. This is a woman who does not function without two or three pots of coffee a day so she knows her coffee. As for me, I am not much of a coffee drinker but I tried most of the flavors and thought that they were very good without being overly strong. We got about two pots (8 to 12 cups) per bag without the coffee being too watered down. Definitely a hit with any coffee drinkers in your life. I sprung for the gift wrapping and was not disappointed. Be warned though, the box it is shipped in will have the name of the company and what is inside of it, so if you are trying to surprise someone maybe have it shipped to a friends house first. Otherwise very happy with the product.
