I drink hot tea on most days and have found this one is tasty and sweetens other teas when mixed (I usually make 4 cups at a time & just use one bag of this in the whole batch). It really seems to help if I am feeling a little puffy or bloated. It has a very pleasant taste. The instructions for use are different from ordinary tea, so read those and follow them when first trying it or you might get mild diarrhea...it happened to me, nothing painful, just frequent trips to the restroom.
