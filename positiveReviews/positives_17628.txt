For folks thinking about trying this: please keep in mind that this blend is a FRENCH ROAST. As such, it will not taste like Folgers or Eight o'Clock, or whatever regular coffee you're used to drinking. French Roast really describes how the coffee beans are roasted: rather than being removed from the roaster as soon as the beans crack (which is what happens with lighter blends), they're left in until the crack a second time. The result is a very strong, very dark, very full bodied coffee which is    by nature    lower in acid than other blends. That said, if you're used to the lighter blend, this WILL smell incredibly strong and even over powering. I, however, love French Roast for my first cup of the day since it's basically like drinking an extra large espresso.          As for this particular product, I was somewhat annoyed by the 'low acid' claim since ALL French Roast coffee is lower in acid than lighter roasts. But, setting that aside, I found this to have a wonderful, deep flavor and more body than any grocery store 'French roast'. (Yes, Folgers, I'm looking at you!) I'm no longer a regular French Roast drinker, but I'd be happy to  ew this the next time the mood for a deep, strong, full bodied coffee strikes.
