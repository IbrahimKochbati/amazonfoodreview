My first experience with this sauce was a purchase through Costco in Jax. Fl. They no longer carry it and I'm very disappointed. Obviously they never tasted it or they wouldn't have gotten rid of it. I put this sauce on everything but chicken is the best and even my morning scrambled egg omelet. They also sold it in a 32 oz jar for 6.99
