Although this is a very good tea and it does calm me down, anyone suffering from an immune deficiency or Candida should not drink this tea as it contains barley malt, which I did not realize until I had a bad reaction. Otherwise it is a great tea and does as advertised. Just watch the ingredients, I seemingly over looked the "Other Ingredients". Now I have to give the tea to house guests, it's so disappointing.
