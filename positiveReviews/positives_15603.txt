I don't know if it's typical or not, but our cat gets tired of any flavor of canned cat food after a while. Sometimes she'll eat a flavor one day, but turn up her nose at it a week later. We vary the flavors, but she's picky. We've been trying the Petite Cuisine for several weeks now, and the four different flavors seem to give her plenty of variety    she hasn't refused it yet. Here's hoping that continues!
