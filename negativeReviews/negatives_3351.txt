I have a Chihuahua that eats anything and everything  even things that are not supposed to be eaten.     When these treats came, she wanted them, she could smell them when the bag opened and was going crazy for them. I gave her a biscuit and she played with it for a couple minutes and tried to eat it but she couldnt  was too big and too hard. I could NOT  eak it into a smaller piece by hand, they are extremely hard. I left the treat out overnight and she left it alone. A friend  ought their Doberman over and she ate the treat no problem.     I am rating these treats a 3 because my small dog couldnt eat them and there was no sizing info about the treat on the package and really if it wasnt for a friend having a dog the treats wouldve been trashed.
