Switch is the "all natural" soda that has no sugar, artificial sweeteners or preservatives and with vitamin C.  The flavor in question is kiwi berry.  I must admit this is the third beverage by Switch that I have tried and I believe it tastes the best.  The other flavors I have tried didn't taste bad, but really didn't taste like the flavors they were promoting.  This soda tastes both like kiwi and berry.  A very crisp and light flavored drink and it is only 135 calories a can.  This isn't a bad alternative to a basic can of soda, but the calories in a can of Switch aren't too far from a can of Coke Pepsi.
