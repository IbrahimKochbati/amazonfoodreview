I don't think everything from China is crappy, though I do think it pays to be vigilant EVERYWHERE these days.  But cage free in the US and in China doesn't mean happy chickens either place   it just means they're in a barn (usually without light)   check out Food, Inc. and many other documentaries.  If it were natural for my dogs, I'd have them go vegan too, but right now I do what I can with the humans in our family and try to pick what seems to be the least harmful to all other sentient creatures sharing this planet.     So that being said, this product compares to other chicken jerky products for dogs out there just fine and to boot does not have hormones.  Also, the individual slices are thinner than many other  ands which helps the dogs chew these properly (fewer larger chunks swallowed).  The price is great to boot   I highly recommend these and will be buying more (at least until there is some healthy vegan jerky for dogs that I can afford!)
