This is no better. . . and no worse than ramen noodles you can pick up in the store for a LOT less $$.          Pro's:     Comes in in a bowl, so it's easy     No MSG (but plenty of other "stuff" like Gum Arabic, Malic Acid, Maltodextrin, Disodium Guanylate, Disodium Inosinate, Disodium Succinate, etc.)          Con's:     Cost     Don't let the picture fool you.  This is a "serving suggestion".  There is no chicken in this product.  There is just "powdered chicken  oth" as well as beef fat. . beef stock. .  and it's less than 2%.     Not spicy at all.  If you think this is spicy, then a dash of black pepper must set you on fire!     The package shows that this contains 30% less sodium than their "regular" products.  Well, this has 890mg of sodium, which is 37% of the recommended daily allowance. . . and it is quite salty. . . so I hate to think what their "regular" would taste like. . . and OH. . . if you read the package, one bowl has TWO servings, so that means you're getting 74% of your daily allowance of salt in one bowl of these noodles, which I don't know anyone who is going to eat just a 1 2 bowl.     Lots of extra "stuff" inside.  See above.          Again. . . I think that ALL of these types of noodles are going to be very much the same.  Certainly it's not a healthy item. . but nor is most fast food. . . But it's quick. . . It's easy. . . So once in a while, I'm sure it's fine. . . but you probably don't want to try and live off these.  FYI, there are no vitamins in this product.  None.  Zip.  Zilch.
