Sue, I think you got a bad batch, these are awesome! I have ordered them three times now and each time they have been soft, tasty, and easily slide out of the bags. I sincerely think you got a bum pack. I have tried a couple of other flavors too but prefer this one over the others. The cookies are healthy and fast and most of all, taste great.
