I loved this cereal. I'm not much of an oatmeal fan, but this really blew me away. The peaches and raspberries inside really add to the flavor and make it absolutely delicious. It has a really fresh taste which makes it seem a lot like homemade oatmeal that takes 3 hours to make. But it only takes 5 minutes after you add boiling water. I highly recommend this oatmeal to people who don't like oatmeal because it is unbelievably tasty and much healthier than the sugar laden cereals or donuts people sometimes will eat for  eakfast.
