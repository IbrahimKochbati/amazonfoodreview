IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST HAPPY BABY PURCHASE, TRY AGAIN, THE REST ARE AMAZING! I love Happy Baby. My daughter eats this companies products all the time.  Chick Chick is great, Beef Stew is wonderful, but Gobble Gobble is weird.  My daughter didn't mind the taste, but I could not get over the texture.  It looked like a giant blob of wet dog food.  It was more putty like than any other flavor.  I actually had to cut bites off of it.  I am grossed out just thinking about it.  Good thing there are other flavors.
