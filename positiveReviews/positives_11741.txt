I'm always on the lookout for healthy snacks for my family. Seeing how chocolate chips and coconut are a combo I can't resist, I had to give these a try. Wow was I surprised. These are actually really tasty. The big test was offering the kids a taste of this new cookie. They loved it and immediately ask for their own to chow on. I caught my 4 year old sneaking one out of the package thinking she was stealing dessert. The ingredients on the side are all things I can pronounce and I didn't notice a single thing I would be afraid to feed my family. Bonus points for containing some organic ingredients AND being packaged in 100% Recycled Paperboard AND printed with Soy Ink. I love "greened" products! I also love that it contains Omega 3 Fatty Acids. I've tried incorporating more Omega 3's into our diet and it has been surprisingly difficult. These will make a great afterschool, pre game, or on the go snack to toss in my purse. Only complaint is the bar was falling apart when I took it out of the wrapper. Not sure if that is a product flaw or if it happened during shipping. Either way this is a  product, and  and, I look forward to trying more. Yay for healthy snacks!
