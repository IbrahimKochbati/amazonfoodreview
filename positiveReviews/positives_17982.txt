I ordered this and the Big Train Sugarfree Vanilla Chai Latte to try them since I wanted to save money from buying chai tea latte's at Starbucks or Panera.  At first I didn't think I liked this as much as the Big Train Vanilla Chai, but then I read the ingredients and realized the Big Train had a lot of additives and for some reason, I developed a taste for this over the Big Train.  I love it.  I actually put it in a thermal mug and add more water than it calls for and still love it.  My son is a Marine in Afghanistan and I included a box of this in his care package.  He loved it too, so I am ordering more to send him and am also ordering the Oregon Vanilla Chai Latte mix.
