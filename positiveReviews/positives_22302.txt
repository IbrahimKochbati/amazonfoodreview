*****     This Izze Sparkling Blackberry Soda isn't exactly a soda and isn't a really a juice   it's a healthy alternative drink that's a bit of a combination of the two. It contains a lovely medley of healthy juices without sweeteners except for the actual juice concentrate. For fizz and refreshment it includes 30% sparkling water.          The juices it contains are: white grape juice, apple juice, blackberry juice, and lemon and raspberry juice concentrates. It also contains sparkling water, citric acid, natural flavor, red grape juice concentrate for color, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), niacinimide, and pyridoxine hydrocholoride (vitamin B6). All of this together surprisingly tastes exactly like blackberries!          Izze Blackberry is very sweet but light (not thick and syrupy). The adults in my household really like it and I think children would enjoy it too. There's really nothing not to like about this healthy juice or soda alternative beverage!          Highly recommended.     *****
