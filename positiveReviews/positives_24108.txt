Dear honey lovers!          My name is Jan, from Attiki Pittas, the producer of Attiki. Thank you all very much for sharing your opinion on our honey. As you'll understand, this is always great for us to learn about! I hadn't seen these reviews before, that's why this is a bit of a late reply. Sorry for that.          Honey Attiki is a multi flower honey, a blend of Greek honeys from the wild: flowers, thyme and coniferous.          @ Tudor: I just wanted to assure you that our honey is as pure as it comes from the beehive. There are no processes involved that diminish the unique health and quality beneficial values of the honey, nor do we use any additives. It is a 100% natural, 100% pure and 100% Greek honey, with all the related benefits.          Thanks to great periods of sunshine combined with unique landscape characteristics, Greek honey is highly concentrated. The honey is gathered from a variety of around 6000 different types of natural flowers, herbs and trees, 600 of which are only found in Greece.          In Greece we have about 80% of the year sunshine. Besides the fact that this is obviously pretty great to live in, you also know that sunshine means health and healing. All this is what Greek honey represents. It is great for your health and it has so many benefits for your body and even mind (stress relief, against insomnia, to name some) that you really treat yourself on something exceptional when you eat Greek honey and Attiki, as the most popular honey from Greece, is cele ated for its great taste.          If it interests you, Greek honey is one of the most studied honeys in the world and if you Google it, you will find quite some information about all the specific qualities and uses of it.
