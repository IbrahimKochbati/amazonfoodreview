I feel bad for alot of other gf  ead baking flour makers because if more peopl discover the goodnes of pamela  ead mix they would go out of business my sister and I are celiac and believe me we tried it all. We tried baking our own to purchasing about every different mix we could find and It came down to pamelas or  m because they are more readily available at local grocery stores. Let me tell you Pamela blows them all away. I've had family member and co workers (who by this time were pretty scared of taste testing my gf baked goods) completly surprised some even said they preferred over wheat varieties. The Sweet  ead recipe taste almost like a moist potato  ead. Sorry BRM
