SOMETHING TO EAT IF YOU'RE STARVING   BUT PLEASE GIVE REAL FOOD TO HUNGRY PEOPLE,          What's in Kellogg's Corn Flakes? "Milled Corn, Sugar, Malt Flavoring, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Salt." Yes, of course, it also has lots of yummy preservatives such as BHT and a few synthetic vitamins and iron in minute quantities. For nutrition you get basically 100% Carbs from lots of SUGAR and almost NO PROTEIN. Add skim milk, or you'll get saturated fat with a little protein from whole milk. For added nutrition, include a sliced banana and a capful of wheat germ.          If you like Corn Flakes, that is your business and you should enjoy them, but this is not health food and it is a very poor value for more than 0.29 cents an ounce [$3.49 per package]. At this price, the inner package's failure to maintain freshness is an even bigger drawback when one thinks of how long it may take to finish 12 ounces of this stuff. Why not use a vacuum sealed container like Kretschmer's Wheat Germ to preserve freshness? After all, it's in the same price range!          So if you are hungry, you are really eating the wrong stuff. SOMETHING TO EAT IF YOU ARE STARVING   BUT PLEASE GIVE REAL FOOD TO OTHER HUNGRY PEOPLE PLEASE!
