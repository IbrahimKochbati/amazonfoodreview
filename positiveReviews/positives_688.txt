I'm new to food allergies.  My 6mo son was diagnosed with some severe FA and since he's still  eastfed, I had to drastically alter my diet.          Before learning about this  and, I was stuck eating chicken  easts with potatoes for every meal.  So when I stumbled upon this at my local Whole Foods, I was very excited to try it.          Overall, I really like them.  It's got pretty good texture, taste and heft.  It's not so dense that you want to gag after two bites but also not so light that you can eat the whole box (which really isn't that big).          I know alot of people complain about the size packaging and I agree somewhat.  But each bar is an ounce and 120 calories... on par with many other  eakfast bars.  I like the Berry flavor the best, it's the closest to real, non FA specialty flavor. Overally, I'm grateful for these bars because now I can tote several in my diaper bag and car and know that when I really need a quick snack, I won't be left stranded.
