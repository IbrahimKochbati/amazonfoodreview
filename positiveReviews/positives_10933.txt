My wife and I wanted to get a gift basket like this for her father for Christmas.  We weren't going to be able to visit in person this year and enjoy Christmas morning  eakfast and thought a gift basket would be nice.  After researching tons of options I became frustrated that so often the shipping on products like this cost more than the actual products themselves.  Let's face it, a pre arranged gift basket of food is rarely going to be a "value".  But when you add in shipping these things can be down right outrageous.  We came across this basket and it was available with Amazon Prime free shipping.  Not only that, it was less expensive than other alternatives we were looking at (some from other non Amazon vendors).  We went ahead and ordered this.  It arrived exactly on time in excellent condition and, according to my father in law, it was excellent.  I have no complaints and was happy to find this option.  I was pleased with the company and Amazon.  Hopefully it remains "prime eligible" in the future.
