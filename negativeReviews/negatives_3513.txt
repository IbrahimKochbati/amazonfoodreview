They were okay.  I can't rave about them or hate them, but having had them fresh from the shell, I can definitely tell the difference.  They don't have as much taste to them (they're rather bland, actually), and they're smaller than the fresh ones I've bought.  However, they're not bad tasting, and you don't have to mess around with shelling them.  That's one thing that keeps me from getting fresh ones more than once or twice when they're in season!          I don't think I would use these in a recipe unless I was in a pinch, because of the bland mushiness to them, but they're just fine for snacking.  I would recommend that you try these out if you see them in the store, and then if you like them go ahead and order the 24 pouch pack.          Give them a try.  You might like them.
