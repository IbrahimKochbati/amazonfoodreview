If you find this too thin, just pour it over a nice dish of fluffy rice or bed of potatoes, with a dash of cayenne pepper. Superb! In addition, stir in a can of beans and or vegetables, and one packet could easily feed a family of four. Surprisingly low calorie, the flavor is complex and a welcome change. I'll definitely buy this again.
