I've given these to friends that don't eat spicy and they wanted to kill me afterwards.  Actually one person did not want to speak to me at work for a week.  These are pretty spicy.  I'll normally sit down and eat maybe 20 30 at a time and that's it.  If you're a fan of Dave's hot sauces then you owe it to yourself to get this 4 pack.  It's also a great gift or stocking stuffer.
