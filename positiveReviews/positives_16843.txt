We have an English Mastiff puppy, and when we has about  months I picked up a small one of these on clearance. He loved it and played with in multiple times each day. As he grew it was just too small, so we upgraded to the Large Jug.          He would hold this my the role and swing it back and forth hitting himself in the head. We eventually took it away because we didn't want him to give himself  ain damage, but dang he enjoyed this thing.          It was really durable. We have dents in our walls from it, but the plastic never cracked. The only part that eventually  oke was the rope itself from our dog chewing on it. That wasn't a fault of the product, just a puppy with sharp teeth.
