Only reason I give it 4 stars is because someone was right, there are ALOT of hard stems sticks in this product but maybe I just have been buying catnip without stems in it for a while.  Maybe this means it is fresh and all natural too.  I saw lots of buds which was good.  I removed as many sticks stems as I could and gave it to my cats.  They seemed to really like it alot.  They didn't go crazy nutty cuckoo but who knows, maybe tomorrow they will!  I bought it mainly for their digestion and it seemed to calm them and relax them which I liked.  I noticed a little bit later one of them was up on the table trying to get in the jar which I thought was cute.  They give it eight paws up!  (because there are two of them, four paws each).
