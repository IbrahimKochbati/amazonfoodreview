I agree with other one star reviewers... this tea smells like grass.. If you get lucky, you can get the right balance and make a decent but always weak cup of tea (ok   delicate if you prefer instead of weak).. if you use a little too much then it is grassy and or bitter. I guess you have to really like Sencha Green to use this tea.
