I have two cats who are very picky,  I'm always trying to find treats to tempt them.  I found the Purina Friskies Indoor Adventures Crunchy but it seems there are other cats out there who demand their owners buy these treats.  I love that I can order this product on a subscription shipping schedule which means I will never run out of their favorite treat.
