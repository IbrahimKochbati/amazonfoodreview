I haven't had the chance to test this salt on a variety of foods:  this review is based on nibbling on little crystals right out of the bag.  I have just bought seven different salts and this salt (at first taste) seems to be the saltiest to me:  it bites my tongue as I bite into it:  I consider this a good thing.  I don't know if this is a mineral thing, a texture thing or even a 'my mind is playing tricks on me' thing.  4.25 Stars.          I will update later with a more complete review (if I don't get lazy!).
