I know Oreos are cele ating 100 years, and I feel badly about it, but I've had to switch loyalties.  Somewhere along the line they've changed and I am not as fond of them.  I tried the Newman's gluten free version last year when I became Vegan.  Surprise!  These are Vegan friendly as well, not to mention organic if you care about such things.  They are crisper and have a better tasting filling than Oreos (I just bought a bag last week so I did the side by side taste test.) They freeze beautifully (and they are even better frozen by the way.)  I buy them on the subscribe and save plan and am well please with the service.  Note there is some  eakage in shipping, but who doesn't have a use for chocolate cookie crumbs?  Love these cookies. I use them with these molds
