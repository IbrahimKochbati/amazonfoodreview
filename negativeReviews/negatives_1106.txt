I HAVE TO SAY IN THE BEGINNING..I HAVE NOT TRIED THIS FOOD, IT HAD ME SOLD. I SAID OH BOY! ITS MADE BY PAUL NEWMAN IT "HAS" TO BE GOOD! THIS SHOULD "NOT BE CATARIZED "ORGANIC"!! ITS DECEITFUL. IT SHOULD BE ADVERTIZED AS PARTIALLY ORGANIC! THEN YOU WONT BE UPSET THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU WANT TO BE ORGANIC   THE MEAT   IS NOT! WHO CARES IF YOUR VEGGIES R ORGANIC? WELL YEH IT HELPS DEF BUT THEY DONT NORMALLY RAISE VEGGIES WITH ANTIBIOTICS ETC ETC!     SO IF ORGANIC IS WHAT UR LOOKING FOR WALK UP THE AISLE TO CASTOR AND POLLUX ORGANIX DOG FOOD! EVERY SINGLE INGREDIANT "IS"  O  R  G  A  N  I  C  !!!     SHAME ON YOU THE COMPANY OF ONE OF MY FAV ACTORS! IM TRULY SURPRISED HE LET THIS BE UNDER THE REVIEWS OF ORGANIC!
