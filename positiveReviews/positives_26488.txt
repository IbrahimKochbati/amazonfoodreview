I initially bought at these at the recommendation of my vet for my 50 lb, medium size Vizsla. Previously I had given her actual bones, which can cause a cracked tooth...which is not good. These help with the dental hygiene without that risk. The sizes of the chews in the bag do vary, probably because it is a natural product. I've read the other reviews about dogs choking on the chews. I can see where that could happen for a dog much larger than my girl, as she can devour the smaller ones pretty quickly. I suspect these would in inappropriate for a much larger dog.
