The sinus buster tea had an interesting aroma when seeping; it's taste is acquired not offense at least to say more like burnt bark or really overheated coffee. I had no drainage of my sinuses while drinking one cup of the tea the next morning I could feel relief of pressure and pain. I would prefer this product over any inhaled sinus relief agent. As a plus all the ingredients of the tea are on the package in english nothing unknown.
