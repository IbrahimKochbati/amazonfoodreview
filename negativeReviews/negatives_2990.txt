I loved wintergreen Altoids!  In fact I loved them so much I stocked up last year at Easter when they were on sale for half price.  I had enough to last until this week.  So I bought a couple of tins at my local grocery.  Today I opened one and found out 1) they are now blueish in color and 2) the taste is terrible!  What prompted Wrigley or whomever to change these?  I can't describe the taste except that it is too strong and has a bitter aftertaste   nothing like the Altoids I used to love (and I had a few left today so I could compare side by side).  If you love Wintergreen Altoids and haven't had the blue ones yet, don't buy them.  You will be very very disappointed.  I'm going to return the unopened tin and see if the grocery will take the opened one back too.
