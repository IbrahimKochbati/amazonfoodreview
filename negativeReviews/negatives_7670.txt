I really liked how they were individually wrapped.  Bummer that a box only has 6 cookies in it, doesn't feel like much value.  The cookies didn't have a whole lot of chocolate in them, so a little disappointed in that.  They were soft which I like, yet still seemed to be a little dry and crumbly, which I did not like.  4 grams of fiber is nice, and 9 grams of sugar is nice and low for a sweet treat (our household limit per serving of something sweetened is 9 grams sugar), but at 180 calories per cookie, you won't see our family eating too many of these.
