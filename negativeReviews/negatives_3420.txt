This is not really a high protein snack. Too bad I missed the link to the nutrional values   only 6 grams of protein. The other primal strips have 10 and are better textured. But if you can't have wheat, this one's mainly mushrooms. Also the free shipping takes forever and the prices have go up make them close to the store cost where I live.
