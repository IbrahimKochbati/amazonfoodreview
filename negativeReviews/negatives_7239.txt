I tried this baby food several times, even though it it recommended 7 months & older, my 10 month old baby is not able to handle this food.     She's able to "chew" other, more textured baby food, but this just makes her throw up (literally...unfortunately)!     It has a very weird texture, that I've never seen before in any baby food (organic or not)!     Even warming it up or mixing it with fruit only food did not help, it looks like it is not "moist" enough.     I can't recommend to buy this food, we didn't have the problem with organic baby food of other  ands.
