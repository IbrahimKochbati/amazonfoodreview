This line of products from Dr. McDougall's, is a reasonable solution to those looking for a semi quick and easy snack or small vegetarian meal. The ingredient list was something that I was fine with, as well as the (relatively) lower amount of sodium. While the other products in this line are good to go after about 5 minutes, the white bean and pasta soup requires 8 minutes, according to the directions. Even then, I notice "crunching" of somewhat dry pasta when eating it. Thoroughly stirring the product helps to a cetain extent, but even so it still happens.          Also, the lids are glued on TIGHT. Very difficult to remove the paper lid without ripping it. This also wouldn't be an issue, except the directions say to cover the lid with the spoon while the soup is sitting. So have a suitable substitute cover for it.          Otherwise the taste is fine, and it does make my lunch meals easier.
