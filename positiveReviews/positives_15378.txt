In case you're wondering, this is a pate, and not the hunk variety.  That said, I have one cat that will eat this and one that will not.  I've never had a male that will eat a pate, no matter what the variety and this one is no exception.  The female, she just lOVES this stuff.  I mix it with a bit of water and microwave it for about 8 seconds since it's pretty thick in the can. The quality is quite good on this stuff too   almost like Fancy Feast.  It's a bit rich and will fill you cat up quite nicely too.  Great stuff, loved sincerely in this house, highly recommend!
