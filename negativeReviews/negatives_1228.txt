As I have with all other Earth's Best jarred baby food, I won't be purchasing these Dinners for my baby because the jar lids contain BPA.  I contacted Earth's Best's consumer relations dept. personally, and the representative read me a prepared statement saying that the epoxy resin that lines Earth's Best baby food jar lids contains "trace amounts" of BPA, but it "doesn't come into direct contact with the food."  That kind of lukewarm response wasn't enough to put my concerns about BPA to rest ... after all, packaged food is jostled around so much during shipping that these jars could spend days upside down, with the food resting directly on the jar lids.  So I guess I'll have to pass on these jarred Dinners for now.  (The Earth's Best rep did say that they were doing "accelerated testing" of BPA free alternatives for lining their baby food jars).          This is such a shame, because Earth's Best is the only company that makes organic, pre packaged Stage 2 complete meals (e.g., with meat protein, veggies & carbs starch) in PUREE form.  All the other organic baby food manufacturers, such as Plum, Sprout, Ella's Kitchen, etc., only make Stage 3 meals, in chunky form.  Earth's Best does make some baby food in BPA free squeeze pouches, but that doesn't include its Dinner line.  I was hoping to be able to expose my little one to a wider variety of flavors and well balanced meals while still at the puree stage.  But I guess I'll have to wait until she's old enough for Stage 3 chunky meals, or make her baby food myself.  (Virtually impossible for this super busy and domestically challenged mom, LOL!)
