Wow!!!  This cat food must have something like catnip in it.  After the first smell and taste, the cats have come at the first sound of opening another can.  My cats seem to really appreciate the taste.  It smells fine to me.  Cat food is cat food, to me, but, to my closest friends, at least my cats, they love this product.  It's a little more expensive than the cat food that I could purchase in a discount store, but, here again, I think that my cats seem to enjoy this a bit more.
