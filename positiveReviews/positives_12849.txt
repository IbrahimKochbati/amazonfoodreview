This drink is fizzy, sweet, and delicious!  I was so pleasantly surprised by it.  It really does taste like you're drinking something so yummy that it must be bad for you.  How fun that it's not!  I loved the Kiwi Berry flavor, and definitely recommend anyone trying to kick the habit of unhealthy sodas to give this a shot.
