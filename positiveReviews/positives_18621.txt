It's not just a bunch of stems.  There is a mixture of cuts, tops, tops w  stems and some smaller pieces.     I do advise pre soaking them before use.     Texture and taste is decent considering they are dried.  Obviously not as nice as fresh shitake mushrooms, but a lot more affordable b c they don't go bad!
