My dogs love these treats.  I've been giving them these treats for several years now.  They go nuts when they know they are going to get one, and my vet recommends the supplements for them as they get older.  They are a bit pricey, but I think they are worth it.  Much better now that Amazon is carrying them directly.  I can also say that the manufacturer stands by their products 100%.  I used to buy these in a 3 pack from a 3rd party seller here on Amazon.  On my last shipment, it was very noticeable that in all 3 bags, the treats were very hard and  ittle, despite being well before the use by date printed on the bag and the packaging being intact (no holes).  I emailed the manufacturer, and within just a few days they shipped me 3 new bags without any hassle.  Now that is Customer Service!
