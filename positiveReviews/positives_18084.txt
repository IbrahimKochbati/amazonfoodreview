My husband purchased a tin of the Illy decaf expresso as a treat for Christmas season  eakfasts.  In the evening we have also been adding a nip of Bailey's Irish Cream with our after dinner java. Expensive, but so worth it.  I am a tight wad, but even so, I would definitely recommend this coffee. No bitterness, and what a fabulous aroma! The tin keeps it very fresh, and could be reused for other kitchen staples.  Highly recommend (even for tight wads in this economy)as a special treat. Cheaper than Starbucks, and better. Of course Amazon has the best price on a two pack. Heaven delivered right to your door.
