I'm not a coffee "gourmet", so my review is quite simple. I've tried dozens of K Cup varieties, and, this is the best ever.  I like strong coffee, but, sometimes the bold varieties are somewhat bitter.  This one is strong yet smooth and has a very pleasant aroma as well.  My very favorite!  Would like to see this one on autoship!
