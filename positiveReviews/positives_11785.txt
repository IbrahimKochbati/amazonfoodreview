Love this stuff, its my favorite seasoning for french fries! Unfortunately, its hard to find near me, and when I can find it, I only can find the small jar (which never lasts long). Finding a huge canister like this on amazon was just the thing. Can now use it on everything without fear of running out... try it on your fries.. trust me!
