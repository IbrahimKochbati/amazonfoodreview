This product is steeped in water to make a tea or drink that is something like a fruit punch.  This 2 lb bag is economical and the flowers (actually a calyx, I think, if you want to be technical) are clean and fresh.  A relative of mine uses the drink for medicinal purposes and has had good results with it.  One caveat:  It stains badly if you spill it so it's best to keep it away from any heirloom tablecloths you may have.
