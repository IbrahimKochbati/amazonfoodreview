I ordered two cases, which arrived in the same box this morning.  Packaging was in perfect condition.  One case of twelve was also in perfect condition, without a single dent.  However, the other case had 8 out of 12 cans dented, some badly. Since the packaging is clearly not damaged, I would take this to mean that the cans were already dented when they were packed.
