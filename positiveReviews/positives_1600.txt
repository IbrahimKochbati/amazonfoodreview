I use this as the base for my waffles.  Use 2 small bananas mashed, 3 4T cinammon, 1T vanilla, and 1 2 cup gratted pecans and then blend it all together.  You need to let it cook a much longer period of time at a lower then normal temperature and you need to cut back on the amount of water used. You need to know what the consistency of the waffle mixture should be before you attempt this recipe so that you can determine the amount of water to use.  This is a somewhat tricky recipe since it's easy for the waffles to stick and pull apart.  One banana makes it easier but I've had some success with three bananas.  Banana's are better overripe.
