I've been drinking Nutiva's Hempshakes nearly every weekday for more than two years now, and it's an excellent product, but not everyone is going to like the stuff.  If you're used to traditional whey based protein powders and want something similar, you may not like this.  It's a bit of an acquired taste and has a different mouth feel.  I don't like whey or soy powders, and wanted something with a lot of fiber that wouldn't aggravate my acid reflux.  The hempshakes fit the bill for me.  I can drink them mixed in soy or rice milk, but usually I make a quick smoothie in the morning to drink in the car while I'm taking my son to school.  This fills up for a few hours but doesn't make me feel stuffed.  I blend together 1 2 cup juice (usually Odwalla Blueberry B Monster), 1 cup soy or rice milk, a banana, and 4 tablespoons of hempshake powder.  If I need it to last me until lunchtime I'll add in a cup of frozen berries.  It's a healthy way for me to start the day, and I don't end up skipping  eakfast anymore.          I haven't noticed a big difference between the old formulation and the new, except that the new seems a little smoother so I'd guess it's probably not as gritty if you're drinking it straight rather than in a smoothie.          Long story short:  good product, but if the word "hemp" makes you cringe or laugh, this probably isn't something you're going to like.
