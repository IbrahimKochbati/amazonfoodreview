The Keurig  ews excellent coffee, is economical, and saves energy at the same time because one is not making a pot of coffee in order to get one or two cups of coffee.  I would make 4 cups of coffee and often wind up throwing away half.  Now I have two cups of caffeinated coffee, a couple cups of decaffeinated,  a cup or two of tea (either made with a pod or a tea bag  yes you can get just a cup of piping hot water for your tea), and hot chocolate.  It takes less than a minute to  ew a cup of coffee; just enough time to go to the fridge and get the cream or milk.  We have started to use the 'eKo ew' pods, which makes it possible to make our own  blends and we do not have a little plastic pod to throw away.
