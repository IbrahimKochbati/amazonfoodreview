I bought two of this bottles because I liked the principle but ended up realizing that this toy was basically designed for puppies.     The two bottles I bought lasted no more than two weeks with my German Sheppard.     The main problem is that this bottle is hit on the floor and walls at the time the dog is trying to get the kibble out of it. It cracks and is basically a dangerous toy for adult dogs that will end up eating part of the plastic.
