I am also a die hard Folgers coffee fan.  I simply prefer it to any other  and.  But as others have said in their reviews, these cans are oddly too small.  I wish they were the 3 lbs cans you can buy at Dollar General for $6.00, but they are much smaller.  Therefore, this isn't an Amazon deal I will be doing again.
