My 1 year old black lab mix has had stomach issues since small puppyhood, and it took me months to find the right food (and then the right portions) to stabilize his tummy. I tried everything, including the super high priced  ands currently popular among the 'boutique pet store shopper' pet parents. I finally settled on Natural Balance Venison & Sweet Potato, and haven't looked back.          My dog will eat literally anything, and ate every kind of dog food I put in front of him with equal enthusiasm. But I do appreciate that with Natural Balance, I found a food that agrees with his stomach, gives him the high quality nutrition he needs to run endlessly around the yard chasing balls and squirrels and his dog friends, and is actually fairly reasonably priced.          Love that Amazon delivers it for free right to my door, too. No more lugging this heavy bag from the pet store.
