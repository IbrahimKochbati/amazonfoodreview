This solved my pups dog food allergy problems when I started purchasing it (I have a husky and a german shepherd), but several months ago the itching started again; the color and size of the kibble even noticeably changed. I wrote a letter of inquiry to Newman's, with batch numbers from the bags, but have received no answer. Since then, I've purchased both Solid Gold Wolf King and Royal Canine 24 German Shepherd and the dogs are doing okay again.
