We were running out of vanilla. I'd made my own before using vanilla beans and vodka, and the price of these was far cheaper than getting them locally. I figured it was worth a shot.          I'm not sure what I was thinking, but half a pound of vanilla beans works out to something like 50 of them. It's hard to picture 50 vanilla beans, but this would be a good order to go in halves on with someone. Or quarters.          The aroma is incredible. It's been a couple of months since we originally opened them, and our pantry still smells like vanilla, even though they are wrapped in two ziploc bags.          As for the vanilla itself, it is fantastic. If you've never tried vanilla produced yourself, you are absolutely missing out. There is a distinct and definite difference between homemade and what you buy at the store.          Do yourself a favor, hit "add to cart" and check out. You'll be glad you did.
