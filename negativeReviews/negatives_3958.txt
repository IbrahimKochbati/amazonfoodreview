Bought this with my last bit of money so I could eat for a couple weeks..     I assumed this would taste pretty good, because I like canned foods pretty well(as well as someone can like canned foods)... but Chef Boyardee is dreadful when you compare it to generic  ands. Walmart  and and stuff that I buy at Save A Lot tastes WAY better than this. I had to water down the sauce just to be able to eat it.. It was just... nasty.          It did save me from starvation, and one can lasted me all day.. so I can't fault it too much. However, save your money. Buy the cheaper generic  ands. They taste way better, and there's more raviolis in a can   even if they aren't "overstuffed".
