I have tried and enjoyed The Switch black cherry flavor, but their kiwi strawberry left a lot to be desired.  To my palate, the flavor seemed a mix of floral and medicine y, not very pleasant.  I appreciate the fact that they are trying to push a healthy alternative to soda (basically carbonated water and fruit juice), but they need to get the flavor right.
