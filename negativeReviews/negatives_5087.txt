I have a 3 year old black lab named Layla who LOVED the busy buddy.  It got to the point where she enjoyed having some of her meals put in the toy each day.  Layla never really chewed on the toy, just picked it up and dropped it, etc.  After about 2 weeks though the screw off bottom developed a crack that eventually split the top. The plastic on the screw off top doesn't seem as thick or sturdy as the rest.  I thought about buying this toy again, but decided to try a treat toy made of rubber which is her new infatuation! If you have a gentle dog and carpet try this toy out, but if you have a large one and hardwood floors maybe think twice!
