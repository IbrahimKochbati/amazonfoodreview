I have a 6 pound toy poodle and she would be very depressed without her daily ration of greenies.  She knows that after supper she receives her greenie and she loves them.  It is the one thing that I can depend on her eating.  Since we do feed a lot of soft food, the greenie helps clean her teeth.  The price on these greenies is very good and they were fresh and came in a timely manner.
