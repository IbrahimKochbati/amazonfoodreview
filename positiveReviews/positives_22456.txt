I love popcorn, and have it often. None of the micro wave popcorn i've tried comes close to the great northern popcorn. A short time ago we had friends over, I popped corn on the stove, and put real melted butter on it, ( you know the old fashioned way,) and used to be my favorite. I also popped up some great northern popcorn in my popper. Once the great northern was tried, it was gone in no time.. Thank you great northern for the best popcorn ever....       ps, I will be ordering more soon       carl p       watertown ny
