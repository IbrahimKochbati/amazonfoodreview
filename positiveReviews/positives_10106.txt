I love a high quality French roast. Since I was in college, coming home to visit my parents and drinking my mom's amazing coffee has never been beat by my Keurig.  Until now.  I love it.  It's super rich and flavorful.  It's not overly dark and there is no burnt taste like "other" coffees (you know who I'm talking about).  This is truly a lovely coffee.
