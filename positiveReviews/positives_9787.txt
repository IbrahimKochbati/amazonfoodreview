I have been using this product for several months on an over weight, spayed, eight year old female Dalmatian. This dog has been ravenously hungry her whole life and constantly begged for food and stole food when given the oppotunity. Because of that, keeping her weight in check has been a battle. We even went so far as to have health screens done to make sure this wasn't a thyroid or other issue. I decided to try Lean Dog to see if maybe it would help with her appetite. I am pleased to say that it has been like a miracle for her. It has definitly taken the egde off of her appetite. She has dropped weight, her coat looks great and she just appears younger and happier. I like that the product has all natural ingredients and is not filled with drugs. I highly recommend this product for others to try.
