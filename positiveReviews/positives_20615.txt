Bear Creek Darn Good Chili Mix is just that   darn good! The instructions to turn this mix into chili or dip are clear and concise, and include suggestions for "doctoring" it up. Following the directions to the letter will result in a meatless (but not vegetarian   read the ingredient list) chili that is flavorful but not too spicy. I especially love the variety of beans included. My suggestion for perfect chili: add a half pound of spicy turkey sausage (mild is too sweet) and a half pound of lean ground beef. Brown the meat first then add water as indicated on the package (don't increase or decrease the water measure) and follow the directions from there. Yum!
