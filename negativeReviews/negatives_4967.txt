I think my dog was just too smart for this toy.  I purchased one of the larger ones with the rubber rope.  After 5 minutes of frustration in trying to get the treats out, my dog chewed through the rubber rope so that she could just empty the treats out the hole.  It was a waste of money for my dog to try out.  With the fa ic type rope, the toy might have lasted longer for her.
