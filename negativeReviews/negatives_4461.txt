My dogs have been on Canidae for the past several years and even the picky dog who has lost over half her teeth loved it.  However, I recently bought a new bag of Canidae.  The packaging was different, but I thought that was the only thing that had changed because there was nothing on the bag indicating it was a new formula.          I noticed the kibble was a lighter color than in previous bags, but still didn't think much of it. However, two out of my three dogs now consistently refuse to eat it.  The only dog who will eat this new bag is the one who has been on a diet for two years and quite frankly, will eat anything.          I'm very disappointed that the change in the formula was not even mentioned on the bag and that they changed a great food into one that my dogs won't eat.          NOTE: I emailed Canidae to ask why the formula had changed, and why it was not mentioned on the new bags.  Their response:          *********     Our quality of raw material as well as quality control has actually increased not decreased. Yes we have diversified our complex carbohydrates as rice continues to climb and high quality availability decreases. Our products are better than ever and more consistent. We are getting a lot of positive feedback from our customers that are actually feeding their pets our improved formulas.     *********          I hadn't actually said I thought their raw material decreased...just that 2 of my 3 dogs now refused to eat it.  And when they say they are getting positive feedback from our customers that are *actually* feeding the new formula, are they trying to imply that I only pretended to feed the new food?!?!
