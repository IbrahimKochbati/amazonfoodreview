I became a vegetarian about three years ago, and before that, Teriyaki was my favorite flavor of beef jerky. So when I saw this, I immediately bought it. However, this was NOTHING like jerky. It was squishy, and tasted like  ead, and the supposed "Teriyaki" flavor was nothing like any Teriyaki flavor I've ever had. No one in my house will eat it, so I'm returning it. If you buy, I guarantee you'll be sorry.
