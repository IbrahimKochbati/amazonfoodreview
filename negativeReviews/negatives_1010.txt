I just received my order of 100 count regular bully sticks and am extremely disappointed.     "Only ValuePetSupplies bulk Bully Sticks are hand measured for consistent thickness". I beg to differ.     The "regular" size is quoted as 9 16" thickness. The product I received is less than 4 16" in thickness.     Out of 100 pieces, less than five actually measured up to the regular thickness advertised.     My blue heeler dispatched one piece in less than a minute. It usually takes him five minutes.          On the other hand, my toy fox terrier is still working on hers and won't leave leftovers for the big guy to clean up.     While I understand that ValuePetSupplies.com sponsors good causes, I will be spending an extra 15 cents per piece and get a much more substantial treat.
