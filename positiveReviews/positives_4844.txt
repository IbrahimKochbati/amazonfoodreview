Welcome to heaven, Judy.     What?     Yes, you have arrived.     What?     You are asleep now, thanks to Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime tea.     But I don't remember going to sleep.     My point exactly. That's why I call it heaven.     But who are you?     I am Sleepytime Judy and I am asleep.          What welcome relief, knowing there is a pleasant, calming antidote to the stresses of a relentlessly busy mind that sometimes refuses to shut down. Just walk to the kitchen, put the kettle on, pull out a Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime teabag, place in a favorite cup  mine is a slender version of a Blue Willow cup, pour on water at just the boiling point, and wait for the tea to steep.          Meanwhile, pick up the box  how many times now  and read the the words.     "100% Natural Herb Tea, Caffeine Free."     "a comforting blend of chamomile and spearmint creates a lullaby of tender flavor to soothe your senses..."     "...it lets you curl up under a quilt of flavor and quiet the tensions of your world..."     'The sweetest way I think of you is when the day is done.' Emily Dickinson     Ingredients: Chamomile, spearmint, lemon grass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorn berries, and rosebuds.          But before I take my cup back to bed, I look at the last panel of the box. There's papa bear asleep in his cozy chair in front of the fire, Mama is carrying the baby and holding the hand of another, taking them to bed. Through an open door one can see two little bears already asleep in their bed. All in all, a cozy room of happiness and warmth and the promise of sleep.          I sip my cup of Sleepytime tea quickly, almost gulping. I have learned that if I sip my usual slow sipping, I will fall asleep only halfway finished. That is how efficacious the tea... really... is.....
