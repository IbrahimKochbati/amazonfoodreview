I prefer deep, dark roasted coffees but many people don't.  My mother used standard household blends such as Folger's for many years.  When she received her Keuring machine she started to experiment with other  ands and blends.  She occasionally drinks a flavored coffee but this has become her favorite.  I get her a couple of boxes a month and she loves it.  I have tried it and here is my take on this blend:          The body (or "mouth feel") is light to medium.  The acidity is medium low so it won't have too much of a bite, especially of you use cream.  The flavor is surprisingly complex with some spice (maybe cardamom or anise and a little pepper) as well as a rich coffee finish.  This will not replace my favorite dark roasts but I will keep it on hand for those guests who find a "Starbucks type" of coffee too strong or bitter.  If you, like my mother, enjoy a "regular" blend I don't think that it get's better than this.
