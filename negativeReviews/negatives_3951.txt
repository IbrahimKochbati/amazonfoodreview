Picked up a few jars of this on closeout at Walmart for a buck apiece.  I love all of the Pace salsas so I figured this would be good as well.  I was wrong.  Disgusting texture, WAY too much salt, stale flavor.  Guess I'll go back to Tostito's  and, which is not very good but a LOT better than than Pace.
