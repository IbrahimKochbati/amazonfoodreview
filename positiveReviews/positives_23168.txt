I've been making Pamela's Gluten Free Bread Mix for quite some time now and absolutely love it.  The mix makes a dense loaf that can be enhanced with the addition of molasses and sesame seeds, or with the addition of herbs such as dill, oregano or basil.  I've added other herbs and spices, as well as parmesan cheese, and the  ead always turns out fantastic.  The mix also makes great sandwich buns.  I highly recommend this product.
