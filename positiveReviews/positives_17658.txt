I do love my morning coffee, but sometimes it gets back at me via my stomach, so I thought this would be a nice taste test to see if it was low acid y feeling. I got one free sample in the mail, and when I made it, if I hadn't known it was the sample, I would have thought it tasted like my regular coffee, a Kirkland Costco  and.  I do think I had to add a bit more sugar though.  Still, the familiar tummy ache followed and I was a little disappointed, but I know that doesn't mean it came from the coffee.  One sample is just not enough to tell if it has a low acid effect on the stomach.  I would drink it again if I saw it priced well in a store, but it's not something I will order just to have.
