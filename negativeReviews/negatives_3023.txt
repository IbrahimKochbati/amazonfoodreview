The meat tastes GREAT. Unfortunately the shipping was 4 times the cost of the meat. I had looked into buying this 2 months earlier but never finished the order because of the outrageous shipping cost. Then I was placing a quick order for schoolbooks for my son and this was still in my cart. I had forgotten about the shipping cost and ended up buying it. I didn't find out until it arrived that I had paid $79 shipping for a $20 product.          On a positive note, it was delicious.
