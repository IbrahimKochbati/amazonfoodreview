Kitchens of India probably makes some of the better tasting ready to eat meals out there.  They do seem to be a bit saltier than some other  ands, though.  My husband and I love these for when we don't feel like cooking but don't want to pay to eat out.  I find they also make excellent camping food.  We make couscous because that takes less fuel than rice, and then each pick and boil a packet of curry.  It's the easiest way to get our veggies while in the desert for a week.
