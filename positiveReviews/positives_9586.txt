I agree this is not extremely cheesy, but that is what I like about it.  I have been using this for years and only one store near me carried it.  I have recently moved to Florida and can't find it anywhere.  I don't understand the reviews that says it is too salty.  I tried the very overrated Flavacol and found that to be way too salty.  I actually use more of this on my popcorn than I would think because it is not that salty.  It sticks to the popcorn better than salt and has a very good flavor, admittedly not overly cheesy.  Best popcorn seasoning I have ever tasted!
