I've read a few reviews for this product complaining that it's too sweet to drink truthfully. I'm a soda drinker but I usually stay away from fruit sodas as they do tend to be sweeter to taste than say a cola or root beer. To me though The Switch billed as a healthier alternative to soda had a less sugary taste compared to something like Fanta or the like that was perfectly fine I suppose if it truthfully was healthier than soda. Personally I never really go for the idea of alternatives and with the price of the product, the ammount given I wouldn't really recommend it over regular water or just drinking some type of juice. Then again if you really must having something billed as a healthy alternative to soda then its not bad I suppose just not something I'd be interested in personally.
