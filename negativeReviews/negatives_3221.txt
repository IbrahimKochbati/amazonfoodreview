Tastes like pine needles!!! I've had other earl greys before and never have I thought I was drinking pine needle tea (Another reviewer said it was a bergomot flavor, i'm not educated enough to know)...  I bought this for my wife who can't have caffeinated varieties, and I can say i'm not a big fan.  The English Breakfast decaf is EXCELLENT.  I prefer my tea black, hot or cold, but this earl grey is not tolerable unless drank with a splash of milk and sugar (splenda for me though). It is undrinkable as iced tea.  I'd return this if i could. Avoid this at all costs, young jedi.
