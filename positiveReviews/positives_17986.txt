Ok, so I'm sure this isn't authentic Chai to everyone. But for a person, like myself, that lives in a rural area with very few coffee shops this is perfect. I can't afford to buy a single latte for the same price I could pay for a box of 8 packets. And why should I? This mix is wonderful and I don't even have to add milk! Just heat some water or pour in the packet. Instant goodness.
