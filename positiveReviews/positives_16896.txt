My dachshund dog, Barney, ABSOLUTEY LOVES THIS TOY.  He loves for us to put dog food kibble in it, and then he entertains himself for hours.  He is very crafty in that he knows exactly how to get the cookies out of the jug.  He rolls it until he can get it against a solid surface and then he flips it upside down and gets the cookies out.  This toy is great, because I have two dogs, and they usually are always fighting to share toys, but the other dachshund, Cooper, doesn't like this toy, so Barney can have it all to himself.  Strongly recommend this toy!
