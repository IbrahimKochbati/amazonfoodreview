These apple chips are really delicious and satisfy that craving for crunchy foods while not intaking the calories of potato chips.  Even my husband, who eschews dieting, enjoys these.  I dock a star because they have no nutritional value...which is great for keeping calories down, but fresh apples are so rich in Vitamin A...why couldn't some of that have been preserved?
