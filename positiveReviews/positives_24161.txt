I fell in love with Stash chocolate mint tea two years ago.  I am thrilled to be able to buy it now in an economical and environmentally friendly way.  This is used for my private use and I've felt uncomfortable with all the many boxes I've gone through in order to have my six bag a day tea fix.  If you are a tea junkie and care about our landfill situation then go for  oke and purchase this way and save yourself a couple of hundred bucks.
