My dog LOVES this toy but the rope seems too big for the opening, making it virtually impossible to get out any treats.          I contacted the manufacturer regarding this issue and was sent a new rope, just to make sure the bottle I had wasn't mismatched with the rope size.  The replacement ended up being the same diameter, so I gave up on the rope altogether.  The way I adjust the difficulty of the "game" is by varying the size of the treats inserted.          My dog doesn't eat kibble so I put in all natural treats, nuts, dehydrated salmon, etc. I sometimes throw in a whole walnut just to make the game harder.  He LOVES the toy and rolls it all over my apartment in an attempt to get everything out.          When only the large, impossible to get pieces are left, my dog  ings it to me out of frustration, and I reward him by opening the bottom and giving him the last pieces.          One aspect of this toy that I really like is the fact that you can disassemble and wash it.  Some other toys say they're dishwasher safe but can't be opened, so I can't imagine the cleaning being very thorough.  Also, the "mouth" is made of soft rubber that [I would think] massages the dogs' gums and cleans their teeth a little.          Overall this is a great, challenging, tiring game that rewards dogs for their effort and determination.  My only wish is that the rope were a bit thinner, which would make the game "reasonably" challenging rather than almost impossible.  This is the only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.          You can't go wrong with this toy, even if you use it without the rope.
