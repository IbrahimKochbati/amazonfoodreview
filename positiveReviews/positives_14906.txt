OH MY GOSH! I JUST ATE A WHOLE CAN OF THESE YUMMY POTATOES! I HAD BEEN GETTING CONCERNED ABOUT NOT EATING ENOUGH VEGETABLES AND FOUND THE NATURAL LIBBY'S BRAND. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT AND AM NOW PLEASANTLY SURPRISED! HEAT IN MICROWAVE WITH A LITTLE BUTTER, SALT AND PEPPER AND SAVOR THE FRESH TASTE! I MIXED THE POTATOES WITH THE LIBBY'S GOURMET WHOLE BABY CARROTS AND I' M IN HEAVEN. I JUST DON'T GET TO THE GROCERY STORE FOR FRESH VEGGIES VERY OFTEN, SO THESE FIT THE BILL FOR A NUTRITIOUS, EASY, TASTEY SUBSTITUTE. LOVE THIS PRODUCT, AND THE PRICE WAS INSANELY INEXPENSIVE. I'M A HAPPY CONSUMER!
