Well, I really love this spice because I was told to avoid garlic and onions for the next six months by my doctor. I didn't think I was going to be able to make it through life without the two main flavors that are in just about everything. I did some research and found this spice was used by buddhists as a replacement for garlic and onions. I decided if it works for them it should definetly work for me. And it does! Just a pinch in the skillet with a little olive oil flavors anything I cook in it so nicely. The smell is VERY strong, but only before you cook with it. After it is in the oil or food you are cooking it mellows out to a nice onion garlicy scent and taste. I didn't try it dry because the smell is so pungent it is a little intimidating, but my husband did and said it isn't bad. I use it for salad dressings and anything that just can't do without garlic. I am very happy with the purchase although I have so much of it from buying in bulk on Amazon I may be looking for an airtight container to put it in now!
