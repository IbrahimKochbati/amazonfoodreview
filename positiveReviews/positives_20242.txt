Easy open foil pouch. Approx 220 calories, 12g protein, 5g fat per pouch. Labeled vegan on the back of the box. By using only vegetable oils, this wonderful treat also lets Ama Gai [mother cow] save her milk for her own babies. Although freshly and locally made is always better, this Tasty Bite dish is a fantastic tribute to the cuisine of Rajastan and a great choice for everyone to enjoy the wonders of this wonderful Indian cuisine at home. Product of India. Highly recommended. Also really like    "
