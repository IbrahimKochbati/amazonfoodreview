These chips are good. Knowing that they're not as bad for you will make you eat more of them   very dangerous. Most of the time, the chips tasted quite good, but every now and then I'd get one with this somewhat bitter aftertaste that wasn't very pleasant. Besides that, I would definitely buy these again.
