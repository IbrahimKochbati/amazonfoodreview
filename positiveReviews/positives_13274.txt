I have made these  ownies for family and for a den of cub scouts and no one would have known they were gluten free and everyone asked for seconds!  These  ownies have a fudgy texture and have bits of chocolate chips in them which are delicious.  I would say the mix is very thick and a little difficult to work with.  The cooked  ownies are slightly difficult to cut into very neat edges as the edges tend to crumble a little and I would also say that they make a slightly thinner layer of  ownies than most of the store  and gluten containing but they taste just as good, if not better.  Highly recommended!          (For those wondering, this mix requires 2 eggs OR 4 egg whites and 7 tbs melted butter to prepare.  They do have suggestions for lactose free and low fat preparations)
