This is a great grain free, alternate protein dog food.  We've been using it for years for a pup that seems to have every food allergy under the sun, and he's thrived on it.          In one month (Aug September, however, the price jumped from $59.99 to over $78.00 (for you non math people that's a 30% increase).          This bag was the anchor of my monthly Amazon order, but now that the price has made it un economical to buy through Amazon, I will parcel out my orders to have a more economical result.
