The Switch in Kiwi Berry is a good tasting carbonated drink. It's fruity sweet with a bit of tang.          We have made our own carbonated juice or punch drinks in the past using a home carbonating gadget. While it's not hard to do this, we can only make limited quantities and it's not very portable. But we love the results.          The Switch took this same idea and packaged in their rather smallish cans. (Good size for kids, a bit too small for adults.) I'm still concerned with the sugar involved. At 35 grams a can, it still seems a bit much. But there is no caffeine, no added corn syrup, no added sugar, or other ingredients normally found in colas.          But for what it is, The Switch soda is quite tasty. It's a great alternative to standard sodas out there. (Water is still best!)
