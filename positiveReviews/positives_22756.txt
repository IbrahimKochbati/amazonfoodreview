This popcorn is very convenient and tastes great.  The coconut oil is in a solid state, which it should be.  Once it hits the kettle it melts.  You heat your oil, and then add the popcorn and salt.  I do recommend putting the popcorn and salt together in a scoop or something for ease of emptying into the kettle (if you have a popcorn machine), otherwise it gets messy.          I read several reviews that using all the salt makes the popcorn too salty.  We didn't find that at all.          There were several unpopped kernels, so I'm not sure if this is the popcorn or not being used to our machine yet.          This is perfect for our 4 oz popcorn machine and leaves the whole house smelling like a movie theatre.  Yum!
