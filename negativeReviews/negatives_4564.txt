I visited my daughter in NC and she had the Keurig coffeemaker and I just loved it.  I ordered the Keurig K Cup Home Brewer and I received it.  I just do not understand the 6 oz and 8 oz cups because the coffee does not come out to the full amount.  This is a problem and I do not understand why this is happening?  If I put it on the 8 oz it comes to a half a cup not the full size.
