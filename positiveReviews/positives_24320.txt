My cousin has been drinking the "Spiced Chai Tea" for months now and it's pretty tastey, but I wanted to try the Vanilla because I prefer a smoother tasting tea. And let me just say... I am sooo happy that I decided to purchase the "Vanilla Chai Tea." It's delicious with warm water, but if you want a creamier taste try it with milk. When I was developing a slight cold I mixed one scoop of the tea, 7oz. of hot water, 1 tsp of honey, and 1.5oz of Remy Martin 1738 Cognac and it was heaven in a coffee mug :o). I can honestly say that I am addicted to this stuff and I'm not ashamed to admit it. If your a "Calorie Counter," BEWARE of this tea   it's hard to have just one cup a day!1!
