I bought two of these for my 16 month black lab and my 3 year old Golden Retriever. At first they nosed it and tossed it, but within 5 minutes my black lab had ripped the rubber stopper in half and dumped out the kibble! Maybe he is smarter than I thought!     The toy is completely unusable now and we are sedning it back.     I think this would be a great toy for a smaller or less voracious chewer. If your dog is a strong chewer, I would get something else to entertain them.
