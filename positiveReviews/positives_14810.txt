Pros:       Blown away from the intensive taste compared to Lipton  ands       Great smell       Leafs are relatively large so they do not fall through and end up in your tea.          Cons:       STAINS anything and everything          I never tried this type of tea, but WOW.  When you  ew this tea my fiance and I actually said "WHOA!" out loud.  The leafs are perfect size and makes  ewing it very easy.          IMO I would classify this tea as a winter tea as when I drink it I just wish snow was falling and I am drinking my tea to warm up. :)          I cant give it 5 star mainly because of how fast and dark this tea stains our cups.  You have to make sure you clean your cups right away or else this tea will stain, A LOT.  I accidentally spilled some tea on our floor, and it actually stained the floor :(  Of course this would be considered User Error and the draw back of using an actual organic good tea, but now I have to make sure I can find the cups that have already been stained so I dont stain any more.          Overall: Get it. I will make sure I always have one in the house.
