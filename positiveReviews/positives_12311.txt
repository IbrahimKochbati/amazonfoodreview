I started searching the internet for "Emerald Dry Roasted Walnuts" when my mom complained that after purchasing them in a store ONE TIME, she couldn't find them anymore.  Emerald  and nuts, yes, but she was not able to find the dry roasted walnuts at ANY store in her area.  Of course, after hearing that, I checked the stores in my area, too, and she was right; no dry roasted walnuts.          So World Wide Web, here I come.  I googled the term and bingo, Amazon sells them in the 9 oz. canisters (6 pack).          My mom loves these nuts!!!!!  I mean, absolutely, in no uncertain terms loves them!  The 6 packs that I purchase from Amazon are her BD, Mother's Day, Easter, Christmas, and every other Holiday gift out there!  When she's down to the 5th canister, she lets me know and I just order another pack to be delivered to her house.  No muss, no fuss, and it's the best gift I can send her because she can't get them anywhere else.          As my Mom states, "Flowers die, chocolates make you fat, but nuts are good for you!".  So, in my case, nuts it is!
