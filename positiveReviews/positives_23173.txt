I've tried many different gluten and dairy free  eads and this is the first one that feels like  ead and tastes great too!  It is soft enough to wrap around a hotdog if you choose, even days after baking.  And fresh baked, I have to hide it from my kids or there will be nothing left for lunch.  I have used it to make hamburger buns as well, which worked perfectly.  I thank Pamela's Products for making packing lunches as easy as it was before we stopped eating gluten.  Truly an amazing  ead mix!
