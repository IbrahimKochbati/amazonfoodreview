Dare changed their recipe, they are now called "Chocolate Creme".  I contacted Dare they told me, they changed the box to make it more environmentally friendly and it's the same cookie because it has the same product number. I've been eating this cookie for 30 years, I know what it tastes like, these new ones taste like 'Oreos'.  VERY DISSAPOINTED.
