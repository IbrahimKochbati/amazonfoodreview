I was unable to get any canned pumpkin in the grocery stores due to the pumpkin shortage.  I use it every week and was out of it, so I turned to Amazon.  This pumpkin is organic, much fresher than the grocery store, but also a bit thinner.  I was concerned it would not work so well in my pumpkin  ead, but it came out just right.  Tastes better than store bought canned pumpkin too!  Buy it, you'll like it!
