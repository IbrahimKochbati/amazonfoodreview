This is really tasty jerky and the price is right, but ~20 30% of the jerky strips in the bags I purchased contained some sort of "gum like" inedible grissle that I end up spitting out.  I've bought 2 bags of this product approximately 30 days apart and both were like this.  I'll try one more bag for the reasons I cite above, but if the next one is like the 1st two, I'm going to stop buying this product.  It's a shame, because as I said, it really is tasty.          UPDATE FEB 2010     OK ... I've kept my monthly subscription to this Jerky ...  What can I say ... Every 2nd or 3rd piece from the bags I've been delivered turns into a gum ball that I'm not willing to swallow, but it is just so darn tasty.  Dunno how long I'll stay with this, but for now ... I sort of look forward to the monthly delivery.
