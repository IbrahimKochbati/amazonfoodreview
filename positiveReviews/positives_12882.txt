This is the second flavor of this line of drinks that I have tried (I have also tried the cherry one)  It was a nice fruity flavor and I enjoyed the drink. I love the fact that this beverage has no added sugar.  Just beware that that does not mean that there is no sugar as you get a lot of sugars from the fruit juices.  I think that this is a great drink and would recommend it to people my only real major complaint is that the cans are too small and I really feel that I need a second can to quench my thirst.  However if they were much bigger then I think the sugar content would be bigger than a regular can of soda.
