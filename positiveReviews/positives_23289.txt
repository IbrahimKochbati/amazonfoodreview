I have used this  ead mix for years and it always turns out a fabulous, delicious loaf of  ead in my  ead machine. Sometimes I follow the directions exactly and sometimes I play around with different ingredients. No matter what changes I make, I always get a great loaf of  ead that appeals to people who can eat wheat as well as to people who are GF. I hope this product stays available forever.
