Green Mountain Breakfast Blend, is by far my favorite k cup coffee!!! I was a die hard Starbucks girl for years, and now that I live in a town without one I use my Keurig daily. I don't like strong or dark coffees, so this one is nice and mild for me. I also use fat free, flavored creamers and they taste great with this coffee blend. I also love getting this shipped to me fast on Amazon. The boxes that I found at Walmart, Kohl's, etc... had less kcups in them. I find that ordering them online via Amazon is a great value!
