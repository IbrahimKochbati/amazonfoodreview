I was impressed with the speed in which I received my order.  I do not usually order things online but, when I found the Twinnings Lady Grey Loose Tea (my most favorite tea) I just had to order.  The order was shipped same day I placed it, and was received by UPS straight to my door in 2 days.  Because I live in an out of the way place, regular mail is delivered more than 1 2 mile away from my home, so all packages shipped regular mail have to be picked up at the post office, which is very inconvienent. Also, Lady Grey is almost unheard of in my area and totaly nonexistant in the loose tea form.  I will order this way again. Thanks for the wonderful service.
