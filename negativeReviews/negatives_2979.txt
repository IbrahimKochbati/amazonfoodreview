I wanted to try this, so I purchased it, however I was very disappointed. So you get 2 bags of popcorn and 2 bags of caramel for each servings. It takes about 10 minutes to mix  the caramel into the popcorn. Save the money and buy yourself a popcorn bag at your local grocery store and buy caramel in a jar and just pour on top of it plus it will cost you about 1 4 of this product. The popcorn doesn't even look like the picture on the packaging!.
