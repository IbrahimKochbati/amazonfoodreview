I've been buying these chews for a long time for my two dogs.  They do a good job when used in conjunction with  ushing their teeth with the CET toothpaste.  In an effort to more effectively clean my dogs' teeth and prolong the time between expensive dental cleanings, I purchased CET's HEXtra Premium chews.  While they were more expensive than the regular Enzymatic chews, I was willing to pay the additional cost for a more effective product.  The outcome was this:  one of my dogs wouldn't even touch the HEXtra chew and the other one threw up the first two chews I gave him.  I refused to give him any more of them.  Amazon was great and issued me a prompt refund when I expressed to them my dissatisfaction with the product.  For now on, I'm sticking with these Enzymatic chews.  My dogs beg for one every day as their after dinner treat, my dogs can easily digest them, and it helps keep their teeth in good shape.
