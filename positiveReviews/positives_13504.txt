Real Mexican chocolate of any version will be much better than mass produced American chocolate simply because the cocoa content is much higher (as w  European chocolate). This is REAL dark chocolate w  a little spice and sugar. I do not think it requires any additional sugar when I make it since I want the dark chocolate flavor. I use a whisk and it comes out delicious. I think this is one of the best products Nestle makes and about the only one I consistently purchase. In fact I'm going to try the powder mix version for convenience, but since the chocolate will be further processed, it probably won't be as good. However, it also received positive reviews.
