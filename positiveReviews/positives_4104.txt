I picked up a package during an airport layover and since I won't be back to LAX soon... decided to check Amazon for some more.  The 4 oz package cost 7.99 at the airport, so you do get a small price  eak by buying them here in triple packs.     WOW!  The flavor is amazing.  I don't know if the other reviewer got a bad batch    or what    but mine were crunchy walnuts with the smoothest slightly sweet tasting thick dark chocolate coating.  One bite and I was hooked.     If you are looking for a sweet treat for your sweetie, look no further.  this should be in every adult Easter basket or Christmas stocking.  I haven't raved about a candy like this since See's dark chocolate covered raspberry cremes!          If you like walnuts and dark chocolate, you will absolutely love these.  The taste is so pleasurable it is hard to describe.  I just ordered 6 packages, for me and to use as gifts.  Amazon, you need to start selling these so I can use prime shipping!  (these will fly off the shelf, I promise!)          ingredients:  Organic Walnuts, organic ark chocolate coating    ooh there is some organic chocolate liquour and soy lethicin in there, that's why it's so tasty and smooth.  Contains small amounts of milk, soy wheat and egg and is manufactured in a plant that processes peanuts.  Made in the USA by Tropical Valley Foods.          YES, these will melt in your hand or the hot sun, so be forewarned!
