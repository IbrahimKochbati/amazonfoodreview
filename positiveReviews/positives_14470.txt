I highly recommend this energy drink, I take one to work every day and I find it to be very refreshing. It doesnt have a wierd toxic drug kick like some of the other more hardcore energy drinks   this seems alot more natural and balanced. I definitely found the orange flavour to be best, by a mile. The ginger ale is a little bland, and the raspberry tea is very pungent. this orange is just right, fruity and citrusy. perfect! I love this drink!
