I bought one (to try) based on the reviews for the 18 pack for $15.19.  They popped perfectly, tasted delicious (crunchy, not too hard, not too spicy, not too salty) and are a really healthy snack.          ZERO GRAMS saturated fat.  Total protein per bag:  31.5 grams.  Total calories per bag:  210          Within minutes of tasting them, I ordered an 18 pack.  These things fall into the "Totally Awesome" pile, for sure.          If you like pork rinds and eating low fat, high protein snacks, this item might work out well for you.
