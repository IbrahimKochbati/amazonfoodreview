I have been using Swheat Scoop for 6 years and absolutely love it. I have one cat (that uses a litter box, the other uses the tub and had for years before I got her.)  Not only does it control odors very well (I don't add anything to it to help) but it clumps nicely for scooping. The best parts are that I don't get a face full of choking clay dust when I change the litter and it is flushable! My second litter box is a Cat Genie (which I also love) so I only have to clean the upstairs box every 3 to 5 days (at the first whiff of an odor) but I just flush it away (it takes about 5 flushes for one whole litter box worth because you have to do it in small increments.) I see in other reviews that some have had bug issues, in 6 years I have not seen one bug of any kind.  They also have a rewards program that is great... buy 12 bags and get one free, plus they send you a few coupons for a $1 off at the same time.
