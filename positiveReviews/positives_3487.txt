This Melitta Riviera Sunset blend is a nice, and light coffee that is suitable for anytime of day.  It's particularly great for drinking at night because it is decaffeinated.  The texture is nice, and does not have an acidic taste or anything.  It's meant for casual drinkers.  I do prefer my coffee darker, WITH caffine, but I did enjoy this blend.  I would recommend giving this a try and judge for yourself.
