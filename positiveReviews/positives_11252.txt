I cannot say enough about Pamela's  ands, especially the Brownie Mix.  They are just as good, if not better, than many conventional mixes out there.  And Pamela's gives many variations to the recipes on their packaging   although I highly recommend the "Fudgiest Brownies".  I bought a case for my sister who also went wheat free and she agrees.  If you've found out you must have a wheat free diet and feel that loss, try these products!
