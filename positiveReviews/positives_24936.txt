I got a sample of this product at an expo. My papillon loved it, so I decided to purchase more.  This has turned out to be such a great product for her, as her hips and neck were so sore and stiff prior to her experience with Happy Hips.....  The doctor had told us she had disc problems in her neck, she would walk around and scream in pain all the time.  She seemed to just be deteriorating right before our eyes.  Now, after just a few weeks of giving her one to two a day, she is running and bouncing and playing just like a puppy again.  She plays with our other 2 dogs and it's a joy to watch.  We used to give her liquid medicine for this, and it never made her feel THIS good.  This is a product I will continue to buy over and over......
