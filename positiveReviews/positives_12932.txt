It certainly served as a wonderfully refreshing  eak on a hot day. I enjoyed the taste a great deal, which is rare for drinks with no added sugar. It had just the right amount of sweetness, and overall it tasted a bit like a lollipop   tart, sweet, and sour. I don't necessarily believe that a quick ingestion of lots of Vitamin C makes you feel better by any mechanism other than a placebo, but needless to say this drink has this vitamin in excess, which certainly doesn't hurt. 130 cals is a bit much if you're trying to limit your caloric intake, but then again it would hardly be organic if it had artificial sweeteners and 5% juice. Good stuff.
