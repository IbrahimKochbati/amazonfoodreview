Just received my case of Pumpkin Puree, not one dent or any black mold...releived!!!          Also, the box is a heavy corrugated box with same, as can dividers, would have to be handled pretty hard in order to dent cans...but I guess not impossible.          Added bonus, which I did not know...each can has a BPA Free Liner, Certified USDA Organic, they use NO GMO's and cans have an experation date, mine is 8 2014.          And, they have a recipe site at framers market foods, great recipe ideas.          Happy Holidays,          DavAndrew
