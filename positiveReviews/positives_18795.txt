It's hard to find a good quality dog treat at the grocery stores and even most pet stores.  Many have added sugars and artificial ingredients as well as harmful chemicals.  But these have nothing but natural ingredients you can recognize, rice, fruits, vegetables, cheese etc.  Made in Canada, grown in North America.  Natural.  My dogs love them, the treats are not too large as some other  ands are, just right for a special treat.
