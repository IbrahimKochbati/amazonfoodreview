Taste.. 3     stars.Yes, strong with a kick, but to my taste buds very, very bitter.  Might be the guarana but the bitterness is very difficult to overcome regardless of  ew cup size (I've tried 5,7 and 9 ounces so far).          I like the smoothness and strength of Kona and the strength of Revv does equal that of the Kona but it is not smooth.  I occasionaly add hazelnut non dairy creamer as a sweet treat to my coffee and the bitterness still comes through over the hazelnut creamer.          My latest on the go experiment that seems to make it more palate tolerant, is  ewing 7 ounces of Revv and adding 5 ounces of a milder medium roast coffee to it in the travel cup.  It still has the bite, but with a reasonable amount of sweetner the bitterness seems to be dulled to an acceptable level.          K cup container 1 star if not less.     I've made 5 cups of this coffee,  The  5 K cups I've used today have had the lids come unsealed during  ewing, resulting in a god awful mess of coffee flowing around the K cup holder, out all gaps in the  ewer itself and coffee grounds all over the place, in the coffee, in the  ewer, in the K cup holder.  I've used lots of K cups from every one (haven't tried Wolfgang Puck's products yet) and have never had a K cup unseal like this before.  I'll not be ordering more of these.
