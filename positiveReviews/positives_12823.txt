I really like the Switch drinks so far, 100 percent juice with a carbonation too, it is a nice combo for us soda loving consumers.  I think too that the carbonation prevents me from sucking down a can this size in one gulp. I like it so much I ordered, and I am halfway through a case of the black cherry flavor.  With free shipping in a combo order, the price of these drinks is pretty good.          Kiwi Strawberry, it sounded like a weird combination mixing fruits I don't normally expect in a cocktail together.  Still it works, strawberry and kiwi seem to be very complimentary fruits, and I may eventually have to try a case of these, (the one can sample from the vine program is just not enough when the item is sold in cases).
