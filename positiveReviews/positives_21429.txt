The price I pay thru Amazon for Pacific  and soup is SO much cheaper than my local store! And as I love black bean soup [not to mention the fact it is so nutritious, plus loaded with fiber] a dozen boxes will not grow dusty in my pantry. I was surprised, tho, that this soup is a puree, and thus has no real lumps of beans in it, so it has no textural interest in my mouth to slow down my swallow. I'm going to get some cans of a good black bean, rinse of the gooey slime they can them in and add it to the soup. yum.          the kick of the spice in this soup is excellent, tho, and can easily contain the added beans without neutralizing the fun of the spicy sting... of course, this puree is an excellent base to use to create all sorts of veggie, legume and cheese combos, for a lot of variety in my soups, not to mention chunks of chicken, minced scallions and a dollop of sour cream. yum.
