I am aware of the disclaimer and that the picture may not indicate the proper merchandise. However, the ingredient list I assumed would be an accurate description of the product. Not so. Romanoff recently changed the formula for their Black Lumpfish and have added several ingredients that in my opinion have ruined a great product. Upon recieving the shipment we were extremely disappointed that the product shipped was of the new formula. We purposely sought a vendor that would sell the older version after being able to find only a few local retailers with a limited supply. Very disappointed that Amazon would not have a more updated listing for the item.
