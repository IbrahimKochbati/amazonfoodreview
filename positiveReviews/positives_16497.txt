I have 2 boxers. 1 is 16 mos. and the other is 11 months. The older one, often gets what my husband and I call "shrimp  eath". The younger one has lots of digestive issues. They both get 1 greenie a week. Vet says their teeth look great and it's helped with the bad  eath. Also, doesn't give the little one runny poop, which is nice. Only problem is they are expensive, that's why they get one a week.
