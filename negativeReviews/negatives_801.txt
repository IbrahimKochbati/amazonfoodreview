I guess there is a reason that the ingredient section on this page doesn't mention that the first ingredient is trans fat (partially hydrogenated oil).  Had I know, I would not have purchased this.  Consumers need to vote with their dollars and avoid buying items where the manufacturer is using cheap and unhealthy ingredients.
