Very odd product.  Can says No GM ingredients (Genetically Modified?) but the ingredients include partially hydrogenated canola and palm oils.  Yucky source of transfats so be aware that thsi imported product contains 2g trans fat per serving...and each can has 3.5 servings.          Taste wise   in my opinion, tastes like soggy, wet fruitcake (not in any good way at all).  WAY TOO SWEET and I even got a few bites with a sandy, gritty, crunch texture which was horrible and I can only hope it was from the raisins?!          This product is not pleasant tasting at all so I am just not sure about all the other great reviews.  But for my taste, I couldn't choke down even a few bites of this stuff.  Only thing I appreciated from this was the few laughs from friends family over the name of this Heinz product.
