How about this idea? Even though we buy the non hydrogenated "natural" peanut butter (Skippy, mainly)  sometimes it is still separated so there is oil on the top. Even though you can mix that oil back into the peanut butter, when you do the results are usually a fairly runny peanut butter unless you refrigerate it. Or, you could drain the oil off, but that's such a waste. So, we like to mix in some of this powdered peanut butter to thicken those runny non hydrogenated peanut butters up! The flavor is never diluted, it is rich and delicious!
