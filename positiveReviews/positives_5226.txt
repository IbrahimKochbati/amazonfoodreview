...and you'll have a pretty good idea what this tastes like. The tangerine (and or the added flavoring) provides a nice 'tang' to the flavor. I found it to be quite tasty and refreshing.  I'm not sure why they are packaging it in the small 8.3 oz "energy drink" size cans, unless it's to keep the calories per serving down. At 140 cal.can, it certainly isn't low cal, but there is no added HFCS (high fructose corn syrup) or sugar. The surprisingly high price is also a downside. True, real juice is a lot more expensive than water and HFCS, but at this price, I'll give it a pass.          Pros:     Good taste, not too carbonated          Cons:     Small can, expensive, fairly high calorie oz
