Every year for Christmas I have given my boyfriend different gourmet  ands of hot chocolate as stocking stuffers. However three years ago I got Bellagio hot chocolate and that is the ONLY  and he wants. He especially loves the caramel praline and the chocolate truffle. They are smooth and wonderful in warm hot milk! It's never an over whelming or under whelming flavor. Always delicious. Whether you are sipping it reading a book or having it with friends after a great meal. I highly recommend it!!!
