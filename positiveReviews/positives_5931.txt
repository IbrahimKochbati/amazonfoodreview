I do not drink cow milk and was on soy which was sinking me further into estrogen dominance.  Remembering that I had liked goat milk when I had the opportunity to drink it fresh from the goat in my home country.  I started to do some research online to see if it would be a good substitute and what do you know, it was.  Yes it is not fresh straight from the goat milk, but being able to have it again has been a blessing.  Thank you Mayenberg for both the powdered and evaporated milk.  Thank you Amazon for offering it a price that is not  eaking my purse.
