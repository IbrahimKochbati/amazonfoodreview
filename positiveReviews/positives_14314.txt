I love giving and receiving these Lindor Truffles Assorted Gift Boxes for the holidays.  They are delicious, bite sized gourmet chocolates that are individually wrapped.  The wrapping looks like miniature gifts with the sparkly and festive colors that look pretty around the holidays.  They look almost like miniature Christmas tree bulbs.  With the assorted flavors, everyone can find one they like at least.  And it's fun to sample the different flavors.  Dark chocolate truffles are included and everyone knows now that dark chocolate is good for you.  (Chocolate is a vegetable, after all  chocolate is a bean.) These seem to have popular appeal  even my sons and their friends like them. The host hostess can put these out for a party, and save some for their family.  They keep well in the wrapping and are a perfect after dinner mini dessert.  I find one is enough for a tasty treat.  If you like chocolate, you should enjoy these bite sized chocolate treats.
