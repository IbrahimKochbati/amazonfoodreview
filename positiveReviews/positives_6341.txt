The cats like this stuff pretty well, for the health of our felines we keep them on an all canned food diet. This is one of their favorite flavors, I will admit that sometimes you can see bits of fish bone in the can, but the food seems to be of high quality. I wish Amazon woudl carry the organic versions of petguard canned food for cats.
