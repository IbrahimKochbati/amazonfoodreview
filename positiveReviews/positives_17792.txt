Yesterday my friend shared with me a bag of this Pom Raspberry snack from his 12 pack box. The bite sized crunch is lightly sweet and delicious.  I was instantly hooked and got online to do a lot of research because I had a serious doubt about food products made in China. I really hoped this product would have a clean bill of health so I would feel comfortable buying it regularly.          I should say that Mrs. May's website erased a big part of my concerns. First of all, most ingredients were grown in US and Canada. Only three ingredients are sourced from China (rice malt, sesame seeds, and sea salt).  This is important because chemical contamination of China's natural resources is so serious that I won't want to eat a lot of food products grown there without endorsement from very reliable inspection agencies. The company seems to have done a lot of work to make sure the manufacturing process would be safe from microbiological hazard as well.  They also use two 3rd party international inspection agencies.  That being said, I've learned from multiple sources that Chinese factories are known for staging for health inspections. So I cannot just rely on the company's own words.  However, what makes me more convinced is that Whole Foods is one of their buyers.  I think this is an important endorsement for the product.  It makes me feel a lot more comfortable about making the purchase myself.  With the overall food safety concerns removed, I will give this product 4.5 stars.          A good reference is Mrs. May's website FAQ on general production.  Since Amazon does not allow pasting of the link here, you can just google the website and check it out.
