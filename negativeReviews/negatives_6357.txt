My wife originally ate one a few weeks ago and told me about how the next day she had sharp stomach pains and spent quite a bit of time in the bathroom.  I didn't think much of it and I ended up buying one for myself (admittedly by mistake, I just wanted a regular beef stick).  They taste okay; the spiciness is interesting that it has sort of a delay but, it does seem to stick around long after the burn starts.          However, the next day I woke up out of a deep sleep from sharp pains in my stomach and had to use the bathroom twice.  And the pains are very sharp, I had to keep clenching my stomach and I was rocking back and forth.  I feel bad that my wife had to experience this during work!          tl;dr: Tastes okay, but the 'end result' is not worth it... unless you've been constipated for weeks and have grown desperate for a cure, you'll probably not want to experience the end results of this delicious beef stick.
