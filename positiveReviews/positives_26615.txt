Great Medium Roast Coffee, very similar to a lot of the Columbian Style K Cups          Pro's     Smooth pleasent aftertaste, not that bitter after taste you get from some of the Jet Fuels that pose as bold coffee.     Great start your morning coffee if you enjoy the medium blends.          Con's     I presonally don't care about this but it's not fair trade or organic.          Again coffee is not something you can review like a video game, each person has different taste and was taste like Jet Fuel to me is someone elses dream cup. However if you enjoy the medium roast coffee I think you will be happy with the full bodied flavor but is easy drinking without a bitter aftertaste.
