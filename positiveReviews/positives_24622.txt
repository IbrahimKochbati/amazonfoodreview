Someone was saying these are all dented.  Not a single can of mine was.  And even if they were, who cares?  It's not like anyone is giving these as a gift, so all that is important is the contents.  The contents are fine.  I'm glad I found some!          UPDATE ***          We ordered a second batch of this, once again with NO dents at all.
