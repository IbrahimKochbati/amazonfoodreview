These are very delicious, not quite the standard potato chip and not quite popcorn.  The kind I tried, salt pepper, only only 100 calories per serving, little fat (no trans saturated fat), and less sodium that I expected, about 10% of your daily value.          If you like chips, you'll probably like these.  A little different, but also familiar.  Worth a try.
