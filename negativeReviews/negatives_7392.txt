These bags never close well, so if you are a compulsive bag closer, forget about it. Ah, the taste you ask? Dry, and dusted with its own carnation in powderized form. Snack creators  anching out by offering traditional products in slightly different forms results in me expressing negative comments via reviews. And why, oh, why does everything have to be miniaturized in order to appeal to rugrats and the type of people who have to proclaim their  ood with stick figure ish stickers on the back of their vehicle? Please, just go straight for the original "Chips Ahoy!" in standard size, pig out, and forget about the kids for six minutes.
