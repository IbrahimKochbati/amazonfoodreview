My dog loves these and I feel good about giving them to her since they're organic.  When I first opened the package, I thought the treats were a little too large for my small dog, but was happy to see that they're scored and fairly easy to  eak in two.  If I had any complaints, it would be that the treats are extremely hard and are a little bit difficult for my 15 year old dog to eat.
