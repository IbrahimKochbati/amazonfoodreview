Gatorade Frost Glacier Freeze is another great flavor.  I LOVE this blue powered drink and it reminds me of the raspberry blue Kool Aid years ago.  Its 3 pounds of easy to mix  ( hardly have to shake or stir this at all )which makes many gallons of Gatorade.  Its very refreshing and a different twist on the flavor being a berry vs a citrus.  Its much cheaper than soda pop and easy and fast to make for picinics and outdoor events for a large crowd.     12 fl ounces has 80 calories, 150 sodium, 45 mg potassium, total carbs 21 grams, sugars 21 grams,.
