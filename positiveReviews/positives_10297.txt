I'm a big beaba fan. After trying out the babycook machine and the beaba spoons, I decided to splurge and buy these freezer trays. I'm so glad that I did...no buyer's regret here. I love that they are made of silicone and come with its own lid. The silicone material keeps the tray flexible so that it's easier to remove the food balls (as my husband calls them). Just a few twists and turns on the tray and the food balls pop out. They're so easy to clean too, dishwasher safe. I bought 3 more of these so I have 4 trays in different colors. Looks super cute in my freezer! :)  I would DEFINITELY recommend these to my friends.
