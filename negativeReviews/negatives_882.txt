Sure to be a hit with chalk a holics everywhere, from first sip to last this product suggests its European heritage deep in the chalk mines of southern France.          Some seem to be making a case for it only having 60 calories, but the Keurig Chai Latte only has 70, and that product actually tastes pretty good.          I have yet to find a Keurig compatible hot chocolate that stands up to plain old Swiss Miss, scooped from a tub or a foil packet. And Swiss Miss isn't that great to begin with, although it sure is cheaper than this stuff.          I wonder if the size of the Keurig capsule limits the amount of cocoa and powdered milk that can be put into a cup, so what ends up there has to be strong and highly compromised.
