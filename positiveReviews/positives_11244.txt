And that is the weight I will gain from eating too many of these scrumptious  ownies!  I used the fudgiest  ownie recipe with just oil and water, followed the directions to bake them for 18 minutes and got moist, chocolatey delicious  ownies.  This is my first Pamela's product...next I'm going to try the corn  ead!
