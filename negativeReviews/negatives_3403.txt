Boutght both frech vanilla and the caramel macchiata(sp).  Not eh caramel cam in 6 boxes of 24.  The french vanilla came in a bag! Just a plastic bag! Some of them were busted and leaking probably from shipping. I don't understand why the caramel ones come in boxes of 24 but the french vanilla comes in a bag? *shrugs*  I like the flavor just didn't like the way they shipped it.
