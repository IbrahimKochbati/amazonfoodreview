Think kiddie juice box with a kick   plus surprisingly flavorful. That basically describes this interesting drink. The cans are 8.3ozs, slim and perfect for toting along. No sugar added, no corn syrup, no preservatives. This is definitely a good alternative for kids' lunch boxes.     Flavor wise, you definitely can taste the kiwi fruit and strawberry. Considering that most "fruit" drinks taste like syrup water, it was nice to have something actually NATURALLY flavored and carbonated so my kids' think they are getting "soda"when in reality they are getting something infinitely better.
