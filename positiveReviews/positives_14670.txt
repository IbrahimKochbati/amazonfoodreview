If you havn't tried Lady Grey, try it and then buy the loose leaf at this price.  You won't regret it.  This is one of the best everyday teas I've found, with a healthy dash of citrus and a flowery finish with no cloying flavors, it really is a good all around tea for any time of the day.  Buying it on Amazon saves a lot of time trying to find it in stock and it arrived faster than the books I ordered at the same time.
