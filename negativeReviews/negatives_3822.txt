This drink left me thirsty, which isn't good when said drink is supposed to quench your thirst.  It's bottle is appetizing, though I found the drink took very little time to finish.  When it comes to taste, it was lacking.  Either the mixture of the Kiwi and Berry was off or something because it reminded me far more of an energy drink than a juice drink.  To its benefit, there was no icky after taste.          I will not be 'switch'ing anytime soon to this drink, but recommend giving it a try, as all our taste buds are different.  Maybe you'll like it.  It just wasn't my cup of tea.
