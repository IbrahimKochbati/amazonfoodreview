My 11 month old Welsh Corgi figured this out the first time she took it from my hand.  However within a matter of hours she had the rope soaking wet and chewed mostly in half.  The rope is now soft and not a useable tool to get the treat out.  The knot was also too big and frayed to let any of the snacks out of the bottle.  You should also know that the snacks this company makes are too big for the extra small bottle.
