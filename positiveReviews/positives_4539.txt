I ordered a set of three cans and they showed up yesterday in perfect condition (no dents).  So far I have made some boiled red potatoes and seasoned them with walnut oil and sea salt.  I also roasted some yukon gold potatoes and english squash with the oil and it turned out wonderful  the walnut oil gives it a great flavor.  I will be giving one can to my parents.  Since my mom is not a fan of olive oil it will give my dad a new flavor to play with in his cooking.
