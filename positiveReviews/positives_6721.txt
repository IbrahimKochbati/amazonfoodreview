I haven't bought this online yet (I just saw it here for the first time today), but I've been buying it locally for almost a year now. I originally bought it for a mocha dessert recipe in the South Beach Diet book. I tried it to make a latte and was pleasantly surprised. I hadn't expected much from instant espresso based on past experience with instant coffees. This is actually very good. I have only used it for lattes and mochas. I don't do espresso by the shot. I particularly like it when I go camping. I've shared it with fellow campers who also liked it. The flavor is rich and can be adjusted to taste by varying the amount per cup. It also has a light froth on top. I recommend it highly.
