OK   this is not great if you're trying to eat low carb. The thing is sweetened with Agave, but it's still carbs.          The taste isn't bad for a healthier snack. It will never beat a Ring Ding, but it probably won't kill you as fast. One of my kids likes them, the other doesn't.          I think they're OK. They have that weird aftertaste that all soft bars, like Luna bars, seem to have. There could be a lot more coconut and chocolate for my taste.          The nice thing about these puppies is that they are gluten free for those who care. They are a good size to cram into a bag, though they'll crumble if you push them into a pocket.
