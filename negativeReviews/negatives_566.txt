this paste is actually what first got me into thai curry, at the time i loved it, made it all the time, then i discovered a better  and of curry paste, hand  and curry paste, premium stuff, amazon doesn't sell :(, hint to amazon, stock it, but you can get it at [...], its based in seattle and they import everything from thailand, the flavor of hands  and is so much better the mae ploy, a huge difference, i went back to mae ploy after having hand  and and i didnt even finish my meal, very bland, boring by comparison, also as a side note, these are very small containers, i was used to buy the large ones at my local asian store, these are like 1 4 the size of those ones. not a good deal if you can find it locally.
