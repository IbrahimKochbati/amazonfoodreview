My dog loves this flavor and seems to be one of his favorites, along with the chicken flavored one.  These cooklie inserts are hard and durable, taking a long while to get through, thankully!  They are obviously very tasty because my dog can't get through them fast enough, though it does take him about a week just to finish one of them.  The good thing about this cookie is that the dogs can only scrape off a small amount at a time, rather than being able to gulp down big bites.
