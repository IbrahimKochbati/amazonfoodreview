I have a 45lb lab mix that loves his busy buddy, but that cheap rubber rope lasted all of 20 min with him. He chewed it down to a nub. A thicker rope or actual rope might be a better choice. Or maybe Kong like rubber!          That said, he goes bonkers for this and clangs it noisily all around on the hardwood floors. It gets to be a bit much. But he sure has fun!
