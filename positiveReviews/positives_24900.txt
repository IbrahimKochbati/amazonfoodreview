Dogswell has continued to live up to its stellar reputation with these additive free, wholesome treats for dogs.     I give all of my four footed babies these treats and it adds to an organic diet already rich in good food.  I have yet to meet any pup who doesn't love these treats both for the chewy, crunchy needs that dogs need, but also for the total nutrition it provides.  If you are worried about the latest pet food recalls from China, these treats have never had to be recalled.
