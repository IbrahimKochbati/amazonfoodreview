Half way through the supply, I noticed that there were tiny white worms boring through a greenie so I checked the remaining greenies and they also had worms.  Please empty the contents of the box and check the greenies when you receive your order before giving them to your dog.  This may have been an isolated incident but it would only take a few minutes to check the contents for freshness.
