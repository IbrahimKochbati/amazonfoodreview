If you like the sort of carbonated fruit punch that you get at, e.g., office holiday parties (where alcohol is verboten), you'll probably like The Switch: It does have a nice, "fruity" taste (kind of a "sharp" orange    perhaps the tangerine's influence, although probably more the apple juice), with a bit of a bite due to the carbonation.  If this were one of my options at, e.g., the Medusa esque soda dispensers found at 7 11, I would definitely indulge occasionally and buy some.          But an indulgence it is... and that's why I'm not planning on purchasing more from Amazon.  In particular:             You're paying nearly a buck a can for a little more than a cup of soda.  Please.  I don't mind paying more for higher quality goods, but at least make it a decent value for the money... make it 12oz.        Calorically it's not a great value, having around half again as many calories per once as Coca Cola does.  If you're some teen who can eat whatever you want, this doesn't matter... but for those of us who aren't blessed with such metabolisms... well... the calories are better "spent" elsewhere.  The "no sugar added!" bit is somewhere between annoying and downright misleading: The "all natural" sugar that's coming from the fruit juices is no better nor worse for you than, e.g., regular old cane sugar like better traditional soft drinks have.          So, in  ief, yes, it is quite tasty, but it's really not a good deal for your pocketbook nor your health unless consumed only on special occasions.          P.S.    My wife tried some as well, and didn't like it as much; she tasted some of the unpleasant "metallic" tastes that others here have mentioned.
