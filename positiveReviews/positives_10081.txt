This is the best almond butter I've had, and it mixes more easily than other  ands I've tried. However, when I opened the jar after it arrived, the jar was only 3 4 of the way full. The almond butter went to just past the top of the label on the jar   there was at least an inch of empty space. For the cost of this item, it should be a full jar, or the company should pack the almond butter in smaller containers.
