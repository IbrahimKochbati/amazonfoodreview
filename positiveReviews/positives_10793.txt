I have a small dog who is finicky and most treats dog food gives her diarrhea.  She loves pupperoni and will carry around a beggin strip for hours and rarely eat one.  With milk bones, she whines and tries to bury them in the sofa cushions and finally after a day or two, maybe, eat them.  All this is said so you can see just how finicky she is.  She really does not like anything hard.  These treats are thick and rectangular with a score down the middle so you can  eak them in to two squares.  I  oke one and my dog carefully took it from my hand and then looked at me as if to say "now what".  She set it down, looked at me again and then picked it up again.  She didn't try to bury it like she does with milk bones but tried to eat it.  Several minutes went by as she gnawed away, making no progress.  I took it away from her and the outside was a little softer but the biscuit was still too hard.  She really wanted it back so I let her work on it a little longer.  She still hadn't managed to get any off of it so I took it away and soaked it in warm water for a couple of minutes.  This softened it just enough that she munched it down.          The next time I offered her one of these treats, she held it in her mouth for a few minutes and the next thing I hear is crunching!!  She loves them.  She's missing a lot of teeth and is still able to crunch these down.  These treats are never hauled around the house and I have not found one in the sofa or her bed.          I really like the ingredient list: lamb, apple (her favorite), carrots   natural stuff that I recognized and NO corn.  I'm sure a bigger dog would munch these right down without any problem.  It's nice to find a hard treat that my dog will actually try to eat and not bury.
