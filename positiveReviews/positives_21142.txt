The Cranberry Pomegranate herbal tea from Stash is one of my favorites, but this flavor is not always readily available where I live.  I was happy to find this bulk supply here on Amazon.  Instead of being packed in the standard 18 count boxes that are sold in stores, this item is packaged as a dozen individually wrapped packs of 10 tea bags in a specific flavor.  Each tea bag is sealed in its own flavor saving pouch, just like the retail packaging, but this bulk version takes up much less space in your cabinet, while still keeping each tea bag fresh until use.  Buying in bulk like this is a great way to stock up on a favorite flavor while saving a little bit of money.  The tea itself is full flavored; a perfect selection for those who enjoy fruit flavored herbal (and caffeine free) teas.
