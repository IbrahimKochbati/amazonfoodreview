If you could get a non acidic Peet's coffee, it would taste like this.  I love Peet's coffee but the acidity in it makes my stomach hurt.  So you can imagine my delight when I drank this.  It was just like Peet's but without the acidic after taste or the accompanying stomach cramps.  I tried drinking it with our  dairy, organic creamer and with soy milk and, while what you add to it does change the texture of the coffee a bit (I prefer drinking it with creamer), it is consistently good.          And, for those of you who like me almost rely on coffee to keep on top of things, let me assure you it really does keep you awake and alert.  And it definitely picks you up in the morning.  I recommend it.
