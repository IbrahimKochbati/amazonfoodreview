The product is excellent   I like the flavor these creamers add to my coffee.  As a single person, I also don't have to worry about spoilage since these are shelf stable for 6 months or so, unlike the refrigerated version which expires shortly after opening.          However, I would highly suggest purchasing this product locally.  It can be had at your neighborhood warehouse club for almost half of what's currently being charged.  This method also has the benefit of being able to check expiration dates and to date, I have never had a problem with containers  eaking and leaking.  The only negative is that French Vanilla is the only flavor available in the warehouse stores, so if another flavor fancies your palette, Amazon is probably the best way to go.
