Opening the second, tightly sealed, metal lid on the organic Earl Grey by Rishi Tea, the aromatic fragrance of fresh tea and bergamot citrus which characterize this blend filled the air.  The resulting  ew did not disappoint; it was smooth and rich with a citrus tang.  I followed the directions exactly, pouring rapidly boiling water over a tablespoon of leaves placed in my infuser, and allowing it to steep for four minutes. The cup of tea was enhanced by the awareness that, in addition to enjoying the fine flavor, I was supporting an ethnic Chinese family by using an organic, Fair Trade Certified product.  It was a win win situation   great tea and ecological balance.  (The package was even correct in promising that the leaves could withstand a second steep!)
