I got these for my two chihuahuas and a welsh corgi. All the dogs were interested in these treats, but neither of the smaller dogs were able to handle the size. My corgi, however, went crazy over the treats not only ate the one for her, but also devoured the treats the smaller dogs left behind, then looked around for more. These treats look and smell good, without the usual dog treat odor. They claim to be organic with no wheat or corn. Judging by my corgi's reaction, they get an enthusiastic 2 paws up!
