I have been a bit disappointed with one of my favorite snacks the last year or two  Jennies Coconut Macaroons.  For some reason they just have not been as good as I have experienced for the last decade or more that we have enjoyed them. I was disappointed as so many companies have compromised the original purpose of making non sugar laden snacks, including using carob in place of chocolate.          Jennies used to have both  using honey instead of sugar.          Well, this past Christmas I got a package of Oskri Coconut bars.  I was not sure what to expect as the ingredient list is pretty simple  Brown Rice Syrup and Coconut!          When i opened the first bar, it was complete excitement.  These bars are DELICIOUS.          Not as overwhelmingly sweet like Jennies, these have a delicious sweetness that is subtle but fulfilling.  The bars are wrapped and very easy to eat.  Moistness is wonderful and the flavor is delightfully simple!          I liked these so much that not only did I end up getting a subscription of them, but I found out my mother did so too!          These are wonderful simple bars if you want a nice snack that is not overly sweet yet satisfying.  I highly recommend them.
