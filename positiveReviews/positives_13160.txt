The last place I bought a Bonomo's Turkish Taffy bar was at a 7 11 convenience store in Orlando, FL. It was 1974 and I was 14 years old. Devastating, I know!          As a military  at, service member and spouse, I have looked for genuine Turkish Taffy in nearly every corner of the earth only to discover that the recipe had been sold and then shelved without a single batch being made. I've made several attempts along the way to find something similar but all fell way short of satisfying. Plain salt water taffy was okay but it was always too soft and airy. Then there was Doscher's French Chew taffy bar that purportedly is as close to Turkish Taffy as it gets. All I can say is, "ICK!"          Now, before we get to the bottom line here you need to know that unlike so many others folks, cracking a Bonomo's was not necessarily an option in FL unless you took it home and stuck it in the fridge for a while (longer than the recommended five minutes). I suppose that might work if you lived next door to the 7 11 but who could wait that long? So, before leaving the store, I would already be peeling back the wrapper on my taffy bar and sinking my teeth in only to find that my teeth would be locked shut in the thick gooey taffy. Mmmm   Heaven!          Back in the present, I finally received my box of Bonomo's Vanilla Taffy today   the ONLY flavor worth sinking my teeth into. Unfortunately, there was no way I'd be able to do so. Living in the Blue Ridge Mountains in NC, my taffy had apparently been sitting on a truck stuck in the snow for several days before they finally were able to make it up to our house. To my great disappointment the first bar out of the box was already cracked. I had no choice but to rip open the wrapper like the 14 year old I wish I still were and slip the very first cracked piece ever into my mouth with much anticipation.          I was not disappointed!          It's funny how the taste of certain foods remain with you, no matter how long it's been since you last had them. Like the original Liege Belgian waffles we used to get in the market a few blocks from our home in Brussels when I was eight years old. I returned to Brussels and that market several times in the late nineties and sure enough   those waffles were just as sweet, sticky with syrup from the partially dissolved "perle" sugar.          And so it is with the new Bonomo's vanilla flavored Turkish Taffy. Thirty six years later and still, unmistakably genuine Bonomo's Turkish Taffy. Now to find a way to soften it just enough to get my teeth stuck in it again.          I am now contemplating whether I should buy several cases of this stuff   enough to last 36 years perhaps. You know, just in case they stop making it again.
