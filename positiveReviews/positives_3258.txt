We found out last week that my son has MULTIPLE allergies, including milk, soy, wheat, tree nuts, oranges, tomatoes, corn (thus corn syrup and starch).  We are in the process of trying to find ways to make what he likes to eat and still avoid thsese ingredients.          Does anyone have a list of all ingredients before I spend $10 on this product?     Thanks
