I watched a video on this product.  I'm trying to buy more American made items to support my country.  For whatever reason, I thought this was made in the US.  I bought all 3 Kyjen Dog Games.  They all work just fine.  On this particular one, the rubber sticky foot that stops the game from sliding around, was stuck to the instruction sheet rather than the game itself.  I was able to gently take it off the paper and it had enough stick left to stay on the game.
