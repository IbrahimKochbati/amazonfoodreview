We have pancakes once a week and this is our go to mix. It is incredibly easy to prepare, and I add a handful of chocolate chips, pieces of banana strawberries peach slices or whatever else people would like onto the individual pancake while it is cooking in the pan. No need to buy different flavors you can customize it yourself.
