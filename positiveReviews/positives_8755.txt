Every bit as good as the Vermont maple syrups, in my opinion.  As you may know, Grade B maple syrup has a stronger flavor than Grade A and I prefer the grade B version.          Looks like Amazon's out of stock as of this writing.  Hopefully they will get more soon because it's quite good and also was well priced.
