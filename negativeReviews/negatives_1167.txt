I would agree with the other poor ratings for Royal Oak   very poor customer service from Royal Oak. We ordered, this year, the exact same product as last year. When it arrived, the nuts were not the same product, and they would not refund or pay shipping for the return. Also, they only operate the few weeks that peanuts are 'in season.' Otherwise, emails and phone calls are not even acknowledged.
