I love this gravy mix   much easier and less fat than making from scratch and not as salty as McCormick's or other  ands.          I use non fat milk instead of water to make a cream gravy.  This is good stuff.  And by time you order this set of 24 and other items, there is no shipping and no tax.  The price is much less than I could get when on sale at my local supermarket.
