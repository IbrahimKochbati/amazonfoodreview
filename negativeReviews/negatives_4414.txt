I lived in Italy for 5 years and became addicted to this espresso confection.  The problem is, you can only get it in the winter months, and it has been hard to find stateside.     As I found via Amazon, I felt it would be a good deal.  Truth be told, the day after I ordered, I found twice the quantity on Ebay for only $15.00 more directly from a Ebay store in Germany.  I bet you can guess where I will be buying from next year!  If you love Pocket Coffee, check out Ebay 1st.
