Maxwell House has a winner with these filter packs. I leave home every morning before 5:00 AM and I always make one half a pot with one filter pack every morning when I get up because I need my coffee for the road. It is convenient and I prefer fresh  ewed to the coffee bags that Maxwell House also makes.
