So far this is the best cola flavoring I've found for those wanting to make their own cola.  It's got stevia in it, so it still doesn't taste 100% like coca cola, but it is SO MUCH BETTER than the nasty cola flavor that sodastream makes.  And hey   no artificial sweeteners is always good!          It doesn't taste quite like cola, but it's close enough to make me happy and I liek it for it's own flavor.
