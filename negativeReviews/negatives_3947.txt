The order of three different plants arrived as advertised.  They were packed well.  Unfortunately, they didn't last a week. i contacted the seller and wrote him it was my first experience at growing plants and requested a refund.  He e mailed and wrote he preferred to send replacements and asked questions, as well as, pointed out the plants go into hibernation around Sept. and last some months.  Over this weekend, i decided to scope out other plant sites. i decided no refund and no replacements. Lesson learned.
