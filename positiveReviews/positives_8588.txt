DESCRIPTION:       Blue Diamond Roasted Salted Almonds are moderately roasted with canola, safflower, or sunflower oil (but not oily or greasy), and lightly salted.  These are "heart healthy" oils which are actually good for you, as is the almond oil itself.  Roasted Salted Almonds are available in bags or small cans small.       Blue Diamond Smokehouse Almonds are similar with wonderful smokey flavor.  At this time Smokehouse Almonds are available from Amazon only in 16 oz (and smaller) bags.       I have not tried the "lightly salted" variety but I presume that they have almost no salt.          CANS vs BAGS     Various types of Blue Diamond Almonds are available in bags or small cans.  The small cans (3 1 4" in diameter by 2 3 8" high) are very convenient and assure that the almonds stay fresh until openned, and afterward, because they don't stay "openned" long (it is easy to eat a whole can at one setting).  Arguably the bags more environmentally friendly, but you don't get much of a price  eak for the much cheaper packaging.  I prefer the convenience and freshness of the cans.          EVALUATION: Excellent and flavorful.  Well roasted and crunchy.  I cannot decide which I like best: the Roasted Salted or the Smokehouse.  Although not oily, the roasting oil does effect the flavor.  Whether that's a good thing or not is a matter of individual tastes.  I happen to like the roasted in oil flavor.
