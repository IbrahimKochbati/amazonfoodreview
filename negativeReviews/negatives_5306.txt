Maybe I got the runt of the litter, but when I opened the bag, the foul musty moldy smell hit me in the face. Even though the label (which was just a printed sticker as opposed to something stamped on the bag itself) said good until 1 2013, there was no doubt that the food had gone bad. Very disappointing.
