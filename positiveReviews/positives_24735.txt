I had to choke down the first cup of this tea. It burned the back of my throat and made my tummy rumble a lot. But once I got used to the taste and how to drink it (not super hot and sipping slowly) I love it. It is definitely dehydrating and will make you pee alot, so be sure to drink lots of water, too.          Drinking this daily at bedtime has been really beneficial to me. Even if it's just a placebo, I love it. In combination with lots of vitamins, exercise, and good nutrition, I'm seeing the weight come off a lot faster than before. I know it's probably water but hey, you gotta start somewhere!          Highly recommend. Spicy, sweet without adding anything, like chai with a bit more licorice scent. Yummy.
