The vanilla coffee taste is pretty good and mild, as I expected. But I bought it for a discount from the Amazon Warehouse (otherwise K Cups are a little expensive). When Amazon does this, it usually means they are trying to get rid of this stock quickly.          As I expected, the expiration date is for a month or two from now, so they were trying to get rid of them. I also noticed the seals didn't seem as tight as they normally are. This also could be because it was sitting in Amazon's warehouse in the heat all summer.          As I expected, about half of these K cups burst open while  ewing. (This is not usual, and I've tried many different  ands.) This made them leak (so clean up was kind of annoying) and not taste as fresh, but it still tasted decent. Bottom line: When K cups are discounted from Amazon Warehouse, be ready to pay in other ways! lol
