This was a pretty good idea    it's basically juice from concentrate that's been reconstituted with sparkling instead of plain water. As such, it's about as sweet and flavorful as regular juice. The sparkling water gives it a little different sort of fizz from regular soda's. Although these cans are only about 2 3 the size of regular soda cans, it's relatively filling and a single can makes for a decent drink. Sure, it has a fair amount of sugar, but it's not a diet product. And for most people, it's better to drink the natural sugar in fruit juice than the chemicals in most sodas.          There are two problems: the price and the flavors. At nearly a dollar a can, even when purchased by the case, this is expensive stuff. One could simply buy some juice and some sparkling water and make a fair approximation without spending so much. The other issue is the fact that the recipe contains more apple and grape juice than kiwi or cherry juice. This isn't uncommon for juices made from expensive fruits, but in this case it's really noticeable.  However, it's less noticeable than it was in the Switch Black Cherry flavor    the kiwi definitely stands out.  (If you're deciding between the two, go with Kiwi Berry.)  If you don't like apple or grape juice, that could be enough to ruin this drink for you.
