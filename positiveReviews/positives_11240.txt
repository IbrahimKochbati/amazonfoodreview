I bought these in our supermarket on a whim one day.  I love them.  I have had digestive issues since childhood.  These taste great.  They dont make me feel sick.  I can have my cookie fix without feeling compelled to eat all of them.  My supermarket stopped carrying them so I bought the six pack.  I make them about once a month so the mixes will be used long before they expire.
