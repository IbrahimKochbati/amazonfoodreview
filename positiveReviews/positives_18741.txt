My mom never made this but my husband had fond memories....  so we decided to try it.  It is quick and easy and tastes pretty good (though it might benefit from some added cayenne).  However, I think it works best with skin on chicken.  I don't think it will stick to skinless   but I guess I could try dipping chicken in egg first.
