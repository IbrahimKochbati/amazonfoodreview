I read about these for weight loss among other benefits and thought I'd try them.  Make sure you know they are related to the tomato and chili pepper more than a normal "berry" because they taste more like a bit of dried tomato than a sweet fruit.  Easy to lose weight with them when they taste like dried tomato  make it your only available food :)
