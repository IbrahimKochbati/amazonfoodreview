I just got back from Maui after living off POG (which is Passion fruit, orange and guava juice). Needless to say the stuff you get in the frozen can is nowhere near as good as the real thing.          POG is best for vacations, unless you want to develop diabetes... This is a great alternative. I already enjoy the mango flavor and the pineapple is alright, but the pink guava version is my new favorite. I only wish they made the flavored coconut waters in the larger one liter size...
