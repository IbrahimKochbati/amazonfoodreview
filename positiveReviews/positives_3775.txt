My husband has been taking this Sinus Buster tea once a day (before bedtime) for about 6 months already, he usually had a real bad sinus problem before but now it is almost completely gone. This tea is so wonderful and it really helps.  When he skipped for a few days because ran out of it then the sinus came back again. Don't want to skip it for so long anymore. Highly recommended.
