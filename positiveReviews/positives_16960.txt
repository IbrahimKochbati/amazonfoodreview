I just purchased this item see that it is made of good quality from what I can tell and the overall concept is great; however, my dog will not interact with it. I have a yorkie, Tinker, that just stares at it. She just waits for someone to move it to dispense the food I've put inside. Is she that lazy? I know she is smart enough to figure it out. We were trying to show her how it works and now she just waits for us to show her again so the food will come out (perhaps that's the smarty pants coming out). We have two small dogs and Tinker has become quite posessive over this and will not let the other dog come near this toy. She sat by it for several hours and then got tired and fell asleep next to it. Does anyone have any suggestions?
