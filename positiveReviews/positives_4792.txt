These are perfect if you want to add some beans to another soup, or just to have any size portion of black beans right away. As they are dried, they last forever, and you can have any portion size you want. With a little water and microwave, they perk up to give you really good quality black beans. I like these better than canned black beans, and I don't have any more at any time than I want. Adding them to soups which are too watery is a great way to thicken them up. You can't do that with canned beans which are mostly water in the first place. I haven't calculated the price out, but these are probably not any more expensive than canned beans because you aren't buying any water. Would be perfect for camping food as well.
