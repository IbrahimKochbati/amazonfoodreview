This is a great Coffee Tea Hot Water Maker. It Heats the water very quickly,  ews very quickly, and its very easy to clean. The only problem I have with it is the price of the "K Cups". At Sams Club you can buy them in packs of 80 for $36.  This is a great deal compared to Walmart (Which was a pack of 16 for $12.)but that's still $0.45 per cup. If you were to drink 1 cup of coffee every day, for a year, it would cost you about $165. On the other hand, the same amount of Folgers canned coffee would cost you about $10.6 per year at $0.2 per 6 ounce serving. And of course that would be even less if you went with an off  and coffee. So overall the Keurig is a good machine, and a good deal if you use the reusable filter. This is what I will be using most of the time because of the price of k cups. Until they sell 1800 k  cups for $36 (the price of 80 cups at sam's) they just aren't worth it. So If you decide to buy this machine I DEFINITELY recommend the reusable k cup.
