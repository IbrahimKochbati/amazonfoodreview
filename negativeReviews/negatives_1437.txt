I honestly have to say that I just won't buy this variety. It looks bad, smells bad and I'm sure tastes bad because my cat won't touch it.  No way, no how, won't even look at it.  My other cat was the same way with this one.  It just looks like a huge ground up mess of leftovers they had at a fish market.  I'm sure some cats must like it because it's still being made, but there's other things out there much, much better than this one.
