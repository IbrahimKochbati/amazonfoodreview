What can I say about these other than that they are very addicting or is it addictive? &lt;g           If you like cheese puffs, I have no doubt that you'll like these and they're way better for you than regular cheese puffs. Not only do they have an extremely yummy taste and texture, they are also lower in fat than the others.          If you have kids, these would be better to give them (shoot, they'd be better to give you, too! &lt;VBG ) than the extremely high fat cheese puffs you find in every store, and the price from Amazon isn't too bad, especially if you catch them when they're on sale for twelve dollars instead of 18.74. But, even 18.74 is a better price than you find in most grocery stores who carry them, so, go for it! But...don't blame me when you find yourself eating an entire bag in one sitting...
