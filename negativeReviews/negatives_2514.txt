3 months later and I STILL HAVE 1 more box, after giving away the other TWO boxes lol. There's no taste in butter and although it's a reasonable price, It's too simple, no flavor and you can sometimes get burned popcorn even though the same timing worked for the same PACKAGE and the same MICROWAVE (so never leave your popcorn unattended)!
