The taste is different than flour for sure, but in a very good way. Just be careful when substituting it in recipes where you're hoping for something sturdy or stiff. When used in pizza crusts, it tends to crumble and you end up with more of a pizza casserole. However, it makes excellent pancakes, and when used in sauces rousses, it's basically indistinguishable from flour. All in all, the texture takes getting used to but the taste and low carb formulation are definitely worth it.
