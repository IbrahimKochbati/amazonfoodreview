I am hooked on Stevia. Not only is it all natural but it tastes great and is truly a guilt free sweetner.          Of all the  ands I have tried NuNaturals is the best; it dissolves easily in ice tea and it does not have any bitter taste.          I keep the packets in my car and my backpack for when I eat out, I use the stevia baking blend to replace sugar in all my muffins and cookies, and this is large 12 oz jar the best size for use at home. I keep a 1 4 tsp measuring spoon in the jar to spoon it out.          I have given up all artificial sweetners. I no longer drink diet coke (and wont until they make it with stevia instead of splenda).          If you have not used stevia before I urge you to try it. If you have used other  ands and did not like them try NuStevia and you will be impressed.
