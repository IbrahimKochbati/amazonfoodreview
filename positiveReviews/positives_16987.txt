My four year old beagle loves the tug a jug! It was recommended by the shelter I adopted her from, and it keeps her busy. I give hre about a third of her meal in her bowl, and the rest in the tug a jug.  It took her a few tries to get the hang of it, but now she rolls it around and has learned to put her paw on the bumpy part to tip the jug up and empty the food out. It works great with her kibble (eukaneuba adult maintenance small bites) but she goes crazy when I put her high value treats in it like little pieces of string cheese.          There are two down sides   one, since the rope never comes out, the part inside the jug gets kind of gross with all the food. its a little hard to thoroughly wash, but it can be done. Two, I had her at my parent's house and they have tile floor.  She banged it hard enough to  eak the plastic on the end piece (it unscrews on the bottom of the jug to let you put the treats in)   so I suggest not using it on tile floor and of course, quality supervision.          I leave it out after she is done with it and she often returns to it during the day just to check and see if she missed anything! Definitely recommend. However, I will saw that these products are significantly more expensive at Petsmart Petco   I recommend Target, Amazon, or a local shelter's shop where the proceeds go back to animals in need.          Enjoy!
