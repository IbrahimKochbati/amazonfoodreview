I don't know if I have a lot of credibility to review this, since this is the first time I tried ghee. I loved the booklet that comes with the purchase and assures that this is 100% grass fed ghee, which was my main consideration. It's great for cooking, since it doesn't smoke or burn even on high temperatures.
