I found this at Walmart for $3.00, and on taste alone, it is way overpriced. I'm not sure how they pass this stuff off. Like another reviewer said, the texture is weird. It honestly made me feel like I was eating dirt. The sauce isn't good, either. I could taste just a hint, a very fleeting hint, of alfredo. Even the pasta they use tastes weird. It doesn't look very appealing when cooked, either. My husband didn't even want to try it. Never again.
