After years of  andy soaked Twinkies, I just tried one of these tonight.  Wow!  These are good.  My wife was right:  They're good.  But not so good you go crazy and eat the entire box.  It may be the whopping 3 grams of fiber in these tiny little things.  I think it's actually my stomach screaming, "NO MORE!  I CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE FIBER!  I'M GONNA BLOW!"          They remind me of the homemade wholegrain hippy Eucharist from the late 70's and early 80's.  Heavy, moist, whole grain goodness.  Takes me back to my Catholic school days.  They used to let us kids eat all the leftover homemade wholegrain hippy Jesus after a mass.  Good times.
