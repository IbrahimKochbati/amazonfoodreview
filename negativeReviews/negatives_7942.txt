I agree with a previous post from DanS "This is Earl Grey?".  I love Earl Grey tea, so when I did not smell the familiar Bergamot smell, I thought the tea pod was labeled incorrectly and checked the box.  This was just a cup of black tea.  Definitely not the Earl Grey I'm used to in the bag from Twinings.
