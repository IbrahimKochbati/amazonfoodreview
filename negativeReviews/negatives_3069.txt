The cake arrived askew (smooshed, like a smiley) more due to the internal packaging    it looks like it should have been vacuum sealed.          Overall the taste wasn't what I expected   it was kinda yucky pasty.  The ingredients show corn syrup, which is not suitable for a rum cake glaze.  The taste is likely due to use of a starch.  It's not "terrible" per se, but I doubt I'd buy another.          I think they can improve the recipe quite a bit.
