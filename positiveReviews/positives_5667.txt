This coffee is my favorite.  I usually don't like the taste of coffee and can't tell the difference between  ands, but this stuff tastes different and good.  My only complaint is that Amazon raised the price recently from 29.70 to 34.42.  I still bought it again at the higher price but if it goes any higher I probably won't.
