In trying to eat a little healthier I'm reducing my gluten intake (gluten wheat may not be the best for arthritis inflammation) so I gave this gluten free Bisquick a try. Surprisingly, I was pretty impressed with the flavor which to me tastes almost as good as regular Bisquick.          I followed a reviewer's suggestion to let the batter sit for about 15 minutes after adding just the milk; the batter looked better and was a nicer consistency after the resting time. It was a little hard to get all the lumps out of the batter though and because I have limited GF experience I wasn't sure whether further stirring would gum it up so I left some lumps in and they dissolved while cooking.          The texture of the cooked pancakes was very SLIGHTLY gritty. Makes pancakes a little thinner than with regular Bisquick however thick enough that I'd say they are just right. See photo added.          I used a cast iron griddle to make the pancakes, which made them barely crisp outside and nice tender inside   *very* good!!!          The taste is close to regular Bisquick but a little more "plain"   I use real maple syrup and sometimes preserves and with either of the two toppings, I had a very good, very tasty short stack.          My only quibble is that this mix is a little pricey but I'd rather buy this mix than other GF products I've tried that are just as pricey and don't taste nearly as good.
