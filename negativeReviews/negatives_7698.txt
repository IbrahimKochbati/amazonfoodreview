I buy sugar free products a lot, and it is hard to find sugar free barbecue sauce.  I held out hope for this, and indeed did use the whole bottle.  I hate to waste things, and I am generally very easy to please.  I won't buy another though because the stuff just doesn't taste like barbecue sauce.  In my opinion, it has nothing to do with the artificial sweeteners either.  Whatever they are doing with the rest of the recipe just isn't getting the job done.          If you have NO other choices, maybe you could give it a try yourself.  I do see some others love it, so maybe you would, too.  However, if you have a choice, choose the other  and(s) first before bothering with this.
