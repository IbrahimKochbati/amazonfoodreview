I work in an office full of coffee drinkers.  The other day, in a 16 hour double shift, we ran our 12 cup drip machine 10 times.  It's always a bit of an informal contest to see who can  ing in the most exciting new grinds from our bean stashes.  The first time I  ewed a pot of Black Silk one of the guys I worked with commented on how good it was and asked what it was.  In a very level voice I answered, "Foldiers."  The guy was absolutely horrified for a moment, thinking he'd lost his edge in the coffee tasting arena.  Then I told him what it was and that it was a new product and he went from horrified to merely pleasantly surprised.          In short, this has become my go to coffee when I run out of beans or don't want to run my noisy mill and wake everyone up in the morning!  It appears that the "Starbucks" craze has done to coffee what the micro  ew invasion has done to beer.  Would you ever have thought you'd see wheat beer that said Budweiser on the can?
