When I was younger my mom used to buy trail mix bars, Nature Valley ones I think, and I really liked them, so when I saw these on Amazon I decided to give them a try. I absolutely love these, so much more than other trail mix bars. They've got fiber and protein, as well as good fats and sugars, they're filling and make an excellent  eakfast or snack and I really like that they're not grossly sticky sweet. They're also on here for a great price, especially with the subscribe and save discount.
