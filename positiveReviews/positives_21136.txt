I love fresh sprouts, but the problem with my old sprouter was simply that it was to big to use for just one person.  Since my wife died I more or less quit growing sprouts because of this issue, so when I saw the smaller set up I thought I would give it a try.  Works great!  And the tray divider makes it even better since different sprouts can be grown at the same time, but still in small enough batches that they are eaten instead of thrown out.  But, since there are three trays there is enough capacity to grow larger batches if the need should arise.  If you like sprouts, and are at all interested in fresh ones, this set up is perfect.
