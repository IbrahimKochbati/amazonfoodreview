This is an excellent quality product. I have a Siberian Husky, a  eed which loves fish. I have hard time finding fish in canned dog food, so I feed this food to my cat and dog and they both love it. It has rice flour but no rice in it. My cat doesn't like the foods with rice, but she loves this. Sky and Peaches highly recommend this food!
