Sesmark Savory Thins. This is one of the few snack products without saturated fat that goes well with nonfat soy cheese. The price from Amazon is about half that of the local market. The problem is that many of the packets in the case came with many cracked( oken)crackers; no pun intended. I will give it one more try.
