This is our favorite K cup at home. Mellow and flavorful.          Also, I wanted to clear up the question of whether or not this is decaf   it is not. See the response I received from WP Coffee:          "Is Breakfast in Bed K cup actually a decaf coffee?"          "Thanks for reaching out to Wolfgang Puck Coffee. The Breakfast in Bed is not a decaf blend...."          Thanks.     Mandy M     Customer Service     Wolfgang Puck Coffee
