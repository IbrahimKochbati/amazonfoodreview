NOTE: This one is better for me at the smallest cup setting, which makes it stronger.          This is my first time to try Wolfgang Puck coffee. I have mixed feelings about it so far. The Rodeo Drive Blend is a little more 'bland' than I'm used to, which is great for people who prefer that. It's just a different taste, which is good or not so good, depending on each person's preference. Personally, ever so often I take a sip of Rodeo Drive Blend and think that it almost tasted like dishwater. Then that goes away and I enjoy the rest of the cup of coffee. I think that reaction is because it isn't as strong and bold as I'm used to, but it's pretty good. I can see that some people might make this their favorite because it is different.          Will I buy this again? No. It's good, but it's not my preference, and I might as well buy the ones that make me rave on and on about how good they are, usually Tully's French, Kona, Italian, and House. Those may be too strong for some people, and the Rodeo Drive Blend does have its own unique taste which may really appeal to some coffee drinkers. As with most things, actually a little more than in most things, with coffee, it's a matter of taste and probably a matter of what you are in the habit of drinking. You may want to try this one, especially if you can find it in a sample packet, or do like I do, keep the rest for guests to try.
