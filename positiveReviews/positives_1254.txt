I like these Pop Chips a lot, but not all the flavors.  This variety pack makes a good sampler of the various flavors and then you can purchase the flavors you like.  These chips have strong flavor and are not greasy.  They are fairly filling and make a great snack.  They're pretty noisy (like most chips) so don't take 'em to the local theater!          These came well packed and they are in stay fresh packaging.  I can attest that they do keep well for a pretty long time as I found a bag that had gotten pushed behind some other things, and after several months it still tasted fine.  ;)          These are a pretty good size for a quick snack.  Quality has been consistent over several different batches.  I really like the texture and crunch, and love the lack of greasiness.
