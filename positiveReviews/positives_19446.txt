Kraft Mayo with Olive Oil and Cracked Pepper takes a little getting used to. It is a "lite" mayo so it has that slight difference from regular mayonnaise. It is not quite as rich and has more of a lemon flavor. The cracked pepper is prominent in the mayo. I can see why some reviewers were put off. Only order this if you are used to a heavy black pepper dose on your food. That said, I find this condiment a fantastic replacement for regular mayo in nearly every application. It is mind blowing on a sandwich and just as good on salads and veggies. If you are partial to sliced tomatoes in your sandwich, then you are in for a real treat. Highly recommended!
