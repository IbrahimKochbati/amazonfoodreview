I buy Virbac's large dog chews for my 85 pound lab. He loves them, but tends to choke on the smaller pieces. Quality control seems non existent for this product. I've bought bags that are predominately filled with chews that should be in the small dog category. These bags are not cheap. Now when I buy them at the local pet store, I try to find the bags with the larger pieces. I'm looking for a product to replace these.
