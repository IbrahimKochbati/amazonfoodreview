The Switch Orange Tangerine soda is an attempt to made a fruit soda with real fruit juice, real fruit flavor, and no added sugar.  They have mostly succeeded.  In the glass, the Switch looks like juice.  It is lightly but distinctly carbonated and easy to drink.  The orange and tangerine flavors are true   none of the "burn" of fake orange flavor.  The hit of tangerine is really nice and I greatly enjoyed the flavor.  My problem with the Switch was that it was too sweet for my taste.  I was surprised at the how sweet it was given the advertised "no added sugar".  The ingredient list mentions grape and apple juice concentrates.  That's how they get the sugars in without adding sugar.  Fruit juice concentrates are loaded with natural fruit sugars.  The nutritional label tells the story:  the 8.3 oz can has 34 grams of sugar!  That's more than Cocoa Cola (27 grams per 8 oz).  Bottom line   this is just too sweet for me.  It's too bad because the flavors are awesome.  If you have a sweet tooth, maybe this is for you.
