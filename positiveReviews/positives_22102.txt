These are quite possibly the very best snack bars on the market! They are gluten free, wheat free, and dairy free, with a low glycemic rating. A great source of fiber and protein and only 200 calories. Most of all they are absolutely delicious! If I'm feeling low on energy in the afternoon, I eat one of these bars and I'm good to go until dinner. If you like extra bonuses, KIND BARS donates 5% of all their profits to Peaceworks, so you can feel good about promoting world peace while consuming this delicious snack.
