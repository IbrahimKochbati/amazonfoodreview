The whole idea of a Spongebob Ginger Bread Pineapple is really great, but the sticker that says "Use By" Has a 10 JN 16 date on it. If thats 2010  this is not good! I think it would be fun to make and a cute decoration, but my son is going to want to eat it.  The least the seller could do is to check the expiration date! Its right on the front of the box! Not happy at all!!!
