Overall the drink was decent. It's tart and sweet at the same time. Switch is alright but might not be worth the money depending on how much you like it. I myself would prefer a Spicy V8 over this. It might be a good substitute for some who don't want to drink as much soda, but for me i'll just stick with the v8 and the occasional soda.
