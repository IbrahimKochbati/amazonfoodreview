Most high quality coffees have layers of flavor and nose you want to smell. I  ewed this using my French press and was extremely disappointed.  This Melitta Classique Supreme is some of the worst, most bitter, awful tasting coffee I have ever had.  There is no depth to it, it is not a "good bitter" like espresso, it is flat and harsh to the palate.          Perhaps I am spoiled by having excellent local coffee producers, from which I purchase whole bean and grind them fresh before each  ew. But I've actually had canned coffee from supermarkets that possessed more personality than this stuff.
