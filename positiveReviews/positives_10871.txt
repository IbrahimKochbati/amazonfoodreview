The bottom line is that I recommend these treats.          We've been feeding our dogs organic food and treats for years. Our pooches were just as happy to eat Newman's Own Lamb and Barley Dog Treats as they do their regular organic treats. Taste wise, they seem to rate 5 stars.          Take note that these treats are hard. If your pooch is a gulper, you might need to  eak it into pieces. Our dogs are all chewers and took their time right down to licking the floor to get the crumbs.          Price wise, these treats cost slightly more than the organic  ands I usually buy. It appears Amazon will eventually provide these through the "Subscribe and Save" program. If   when that happens, the 15% discount will  ing these down in price. Until then, I'm knocking off one star for price.          If you question whether, in general, it's worth paying a premium price for organic foods and treats, read on.          Treat prices and ingredient quality vary wildly. Higher quality almost always equals higher price. Products certified "organic" usually add yet another premium.          Whether or not you buy organic pretty much depends on whether or not you've given thought to what your dog is eating. In our case, we admitedly gave it little thought. At the super market we always bought name  and foods and treats and figured that doing so made us good gaurdians.          Oliver, our 8 year old dachsund, suffered loose stools and had trouble keeping down food for years. After a really bad case of him having the runs, it was recommended that we try changing his diet to certified organic products containing no wheat or corn.          We learned that grains used in most super market dog food and treats are often a mixture of wheat and corn said to cause allergies that can cause stomach problems.          Additionally, products not certified organic are allowed to be inconsistent. Between batches, the amount of meat by products can vary wildly.  By products include lungs, spleen, kidneys,  ain, liver, blood, bone, and stomach and intestines.          Also, non organic pet food can be leagally made from meat sources rejected for human consumption. Shockingly, even  and name pet food manufacturors are often a legal dumping ground for dead, dying, disabled and deseased animals.          Making the change to all organic food and treats made a difference with Olliver in just a few days. It's been years now since I've had to clean up one of his messes.          Olliver's canine housemates had no qualms eating the lower grade food. While they don't seem to care we made the choice to feed them better, we sure feel better knowing what it is they're really eating.
