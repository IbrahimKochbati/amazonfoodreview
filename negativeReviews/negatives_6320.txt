Wee bits is a great size kibble for small dogs. However, soft stools were the results with my two little dogs. I added lactobacillus acidophilus but it made no difference. I called the local distributor in our state, and his recommendation was adding yogurt or lactobacillus...some dog foods just don't work for certain dogs, and I don't think you should have to add supplements just so your dog can tolerate the diet. We have since switched to Innova EVO and have great results.
