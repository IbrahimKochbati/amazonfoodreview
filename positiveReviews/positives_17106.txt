I live in Alaska   I could only find this product in Fairbanks, which is over 300 miles from my home in Anchorage. Strange how we didn't have it here in our stores, being the 'bigger' city.  The large bottle retails for $18 here, so I would buy one or two on my occasional trip up north.  When I discovered it at Amazon I was so excited!    it is very low cal and fat, high in good stuff and it tastes great.
