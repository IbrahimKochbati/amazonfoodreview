I realize this is healthy food for a baby, but the smell alone is bad enough to make any adult sick to their stomach.  After half a spoonful, my daughter started making these gagging noises and proceeded to projectile vomit three times.  I would not recommend this.  We ended up throwing out the remaining jars.  This is the only Gerber food we have ever had this type of problem with.
