My dogs love these treats. I have 3 small dogs and they can't wait to get their morning dental treat. The younger dogs teeth are pretty white and I hope to keep them this way but my older dogs teeth have some tartar on them. I noticed the tartar has gone down quite a bit after a month of feeding him these treats. Hope his teeth keep getting better.
