I am so disappointed. I also had the mold issue a lot of reviews were talking about. Since I paid for it I found a piece that wasn't touching the mold and tried it. I'm daring I know. The beef jerky was very tender. I know some might like that, but I like it a little rough. That's how beef jerky is supposed to be. The flavor was also really bad, but that is probably from the mold. I think the issue is the moisture. It makes it tender, but it is also leading to the mold issues a lot of people are experiencing. I won't order this  and again, which is a shame because it was a great price for the amount of jerky.
