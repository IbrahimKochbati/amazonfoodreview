As other's have mentioned, this is available in other stores for much cheaper so I recommend to shop around before buying on Amazon.          When it comes to the actual product, I highly recommend buying this if you own a Keurig. You are able to discretly hide so many of the Keurig cups. The carousel is a neat product but when you don't have counter space, it just doesn't work.          This unit is pretty great quality but I do find that it is tough to slide sometimes. The material that they use on the top of the tray makes sure that your Keurig doesn't move at all.          Highly recommend that you pick one up whether it be from BBB or Amazon!
