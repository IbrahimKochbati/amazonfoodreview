I have to say that this dog food is not for every dog. I have 2 chihuahua mixes and they both love it, but one of my dogs did get diahrrea. It is great for my other dog who has very dry skin and it was recommended by my vet to change to a salmon diet. She loves it and it helps maintain a shiny healthy coat and no more dry skin.
