My dog eats a greenie a day and we were very excited to have found them here at such a great price.  The package arrived in perfect condition and they are very fresh.  I have chosen this size Greenie for my chihuahhua, who is approximately 12 pounds.  It has proven to be effective for us, though through time I still notice some tartar buildup on the very back teeth (molars).  Therefore, I am sure to still  ush them frequently.  He loves the taste and has been eating them for about a year and a half.
