I ordered this plant for my seven year old daughter.  She was extremely excited to get it so I even ordered the express 1 day shipping, which I paid over ten dollars for, and it still took over a week to reach my house.  Once it got to my house, I opened the box expecting it to be a fully established plant, which would look similar to the picture shown.  This is not the case.  It came as a pot, a bag of soil, and a damp paper towel with a VERY small plant inside...maybe 1 inch long.  There were absolutely no care or planting instructions or anything like that at all.  We were pretty disappointed.  However, I was able to plant what was there in the dirt and it seems to have survived and looks a bit better now.  My daughter is happy with this plant now, but it was a rough start.
