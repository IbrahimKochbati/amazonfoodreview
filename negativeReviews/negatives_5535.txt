To the horror of foodies everywhere, Shake and Bake looks like it's trying to make a comeback. Well, the concept is good, but the flavor just isn't quite there.     I do like this cooking method for pork. I grew up in house where pork had to be cooked to death because "you could get trichinosis." Well now you don't have to cook pork forever anymore.     Anyway, the amount of S&B powder in the packet was not enough to cover 6 thin pork chops. I took two 4 inch diameter, 1 inch thick boneless chops and pounded them to about 1 2 inch thick. Then I cut those in half. The S&B barely covered those four pieces. I cooked it according to directions and then checked them with a meat thermometer. One had to go back in for a few minutes.     My results looked very little like the picture on the package. I'm thinking the "serving suggestion" photo was one chop with an entire packet of S&B packed on to it and fluffed up for the photo. The powder itself is that color, it doesn't develop it in the oven.     We had to liberally douse the meat with ketchup or Japanese tonkatsu sauce. You really do need to serve something with it that has some flavor.     SOOO, I won't ever buy it. But I might try making something similar with panko crumbs and some seasonings using their cooking method.
