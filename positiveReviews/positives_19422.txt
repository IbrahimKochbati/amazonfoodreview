I don't like instant mashed potatoes, but when I came down with a very bad cold flu and the power went out in Southern California, I was forced to eat Instant Mashed Potatoes and these weren't bad tasting at all they were pretty good. So I decided to keep them on hand for emergencies and for lazy days.          I still love homemade mashed potatoes. But these are good to have as a standby.
