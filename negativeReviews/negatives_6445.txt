They work well but it's a lot of money for some simple plastic trays that aren't even dishwasher safe (buried in step 10 of the instruction booklet).  So far..., I've found them to be dishwasher safe when placed on the top rack without a heated drying cycle.          It's somewhat inconvenient that it has 3 containers and only 4 lid bases.  You can't keep two containers in the refrigerator and 1 on the counter without making your own lid base.
