Although the packaging is labeled for Pork, this flavor of Shake and Bake goes well with chicken as well.  Nothing could be easier.  Mix the seasoning with your meat and bake.  You get the fried meat flavor without all the oil and mess of deep frying.  It can be a little on the salty side, so you may want to moderate the size of the meat.  The spice blend complements, but does not overwhelm the meat flavor.
