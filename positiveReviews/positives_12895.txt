Switch Kiwi Berry is the perfect blend of tangy, tart, and sweet, with a delicious dose of kiwi flavor and subdued berry taste.          This drink is bubbly, but better than a soda because:  1   it is clean, not sticky, 2   it is 100% fruit juice, 3   there is no added sugar, 4   there is no added anything else that is bad.          This is a healthy drink, but it could trick us into believing it is bad.  I have only good things to say about Switch drinks, and can't think of one bad thing about it.          This drink would be a perfect substitute for soda with whatever you would normally drink soda with, such as:  sandwich and chips, pizza, tacos, grapes and cheese and crackers, nachos.
