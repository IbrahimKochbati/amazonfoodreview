While opening the package, it bugged me that the label is prominently labelled "ARTIFICIALLY FLAVORED," in a manner that is not immediately noticeable on the website.          I am the type of person who remains always aware of such labeling, even as I savor the coffee (which I do). I remain uncomfortably aware that its flavor profile was partially concocted by a food scientist in a lab, using unknown chemicals that I may not be able to pronounce.          The "artificial flavor" scarlet letter is something most modern day coffee outfits would jump through hoops to avoid    and reasonably so, because labelling creates a genuine psychological component of any product.          Not so fussy are the 8 O'Clock people (spun off from the great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, now owned by Tata Coffee, a tea & coffee plantation giant headquartered in India, though their 8 O'C executives still HQ in  Montvale, NJ).          While my enjoyment of this  ew would be greater without the "artificial" label, I'm sufficiently happy with the flavor and the price that I will certainly allow my subscription to stand, though I will continue to sample other, all natural  ands.          Another reviewer takes this coffee over the coals, contending that it tastes like a stevia sweetened candy bar. I have to wonder what he's using to sweeten his  ew, as my taste buds detect no such similarity...I suspect that this reviewer is even more neurotic about the "artificial" label than I, and he's tasting the labelling more than he is tasting the coffee.
