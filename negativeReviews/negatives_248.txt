I have loved ketchup flavored potato chips since I was a kid and spent my summers at my grandparents in Canada. This is a very popular flavor there and seems to be always available. I recently got back from a trip to Montreal, where I ate at least a pack a day. I decided I really wanted some around and was happy when I found these on Amazon. Unfortunately, the flavor is nowhere close to the  ands I've tried before. There's a sort of smoky, barbeque sauce thing going on. Not that they're as good as BBQ potato chips (which I love), they just don't taste like ketchup. I tried to get through a bag over a couple of weeks to see if they would grow on me, then just threw them all out. Yuck!
