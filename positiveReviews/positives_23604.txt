We try to keep our pantry stocked with a number of items that can be used in a wide variety of situations, that require little preparation, that are nutritionally sound and that have a very long shelf life. One such item is Rosarita's refried beans and of the various types available we prefer the Traditional Variety. We buy them in cases of 8 16 ounce cans at our local warehouse club store, but they're widely available at almost any large grocery outlet. A variety of different  ands are available, but Rosarita's Frijoles is by far our favorite.          We use the beans in a wide variety of situations. We serve them with eggs or various types of meat. They can be used in a variety of situations where mashed potatoes might fit. We use them with items purchased from local Mexican restaurants and taco shops. We use them as side dishes with sandwiches. They take such minimal preparation that a serving of hot refried beans can be ready in a matter of minutes. And they're delicious. Plus, these beans pack a lot of excellent nutrition. They're high in protein and dietary fiber and low in fat. The sodium potassium ratio is about even and a serving is only about 120 calories. Beans are notorious for producing gas, but we've never had a problem with Rosarita's Frijoles. It's an excellent food to have on hand.          Gary Peterson
