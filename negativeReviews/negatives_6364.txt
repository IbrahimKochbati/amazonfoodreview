This is not a sausage, this is paste in a plastic tube which is shaped like a sausage. Then you cut the tube off and you're left with a log of mash. As one other reviewer mentioned, it'd be better (and more honest) if this came in a tub.          The taste is fine, but not remarkable in any way. I'm not sure how this product is better than you putting tofu, TSP and spices in a blender and then shaping it like poop.          Usually vegan fake meats are at least texturally close, and while they can't approximate meat exactly they are at least trying. Soyrizo makes no attempt (other than the plastic packaging) at being what it claims to replace.          It is a pain in the butt to cook as it has no structure at all, and it burns readily. I cooked half at a high temperature like the packaging suggested   it burned quickly! Then I cooked the other half at a low temperature, cut up into smaller poops so I could roll them over. Regardless of how long it was cooked, it did not dry out or become more solid.          I was very very disappointed by this Soyrizo and will not buy it again.
