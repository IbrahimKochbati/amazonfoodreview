I did not really notice that it was low acid coffee, but I also noticed it was NOT decaf tasting! To me that means a lot.          The flavor was pretty darn good. I made a pot and drank it and it went down smooth. I was not looking for low acid coffee. It tasted, well, like coffee!          Now for the big question   would I buy it again?          Yes. That said, I am not going to go out of my way to buy any   the other coffee I buy now works just fine. However, if I needed something that was low in acid, I would buy this.
