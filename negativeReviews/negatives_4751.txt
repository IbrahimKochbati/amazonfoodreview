It is hard for me to assign stars to the cat litter.  I like the product and so do my cats. From that standpoint it is 5 stars.  But the litter was exactly twice as expensive as Target (but they will not ship it) and Petco (who will) which  ings me to my final problem   having a 40# box of KL in a larger cardboard box is scarey.  I must say that there was no leakage in the Amazon box or the 2 Petco boxes.  I will probably go back to buying KL from Target and schelp it up the stairs.
