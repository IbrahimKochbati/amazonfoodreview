We have tried 3 different gluten free  ead mixes for our  ead maker.  Tried every  and of ready mades on store shelves and freezer cases.  Pamela's Gluten Free  ead mix is by far better in taste and texture than any others.  And simple to do.  The even nicer plus is the smell of fresh "home made"  ead baking and eating it warm from the "oven".  Yum!  It really is amazingly good.
