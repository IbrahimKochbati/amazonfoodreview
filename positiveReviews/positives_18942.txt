Everyone is giving these such a great review. I just ordered my first bag for my Scottie to replace the  and that he normally goes crazy over that is stopping making his "duckies". We were up in arms when we got the email from the company that they would not have duck and yam treats anymore.  Charlie has a lot of allergies and duck and sweet potato is one of the few things that the vet said that he could have as a treat (along with his allergy dog food, lamb, rice, and hamburger) We lucked upon these duck and sweet potatoes in an Internet search. I hope they are as good as all the reviews say. Because Charlie will be very disappointed if his "duckies" were not coming after he did his business outside, that is his reward. Charlie is waiting in for his new "duckies" to come, and try them out. We have tried chicken and yam but he does not like them as much as his "duckies.". We will keep you up to date on the progress on the new "duckies" they should be here in a day or two. Cross your fingers that they pass the muster.          Just an update; after two weeks of switching duck and yam treats from a different company, Charlie has become a mad man for these duck and sweet potatoes. The other company is discontinuing their duck and yam, so on a whim and all these great reviews we tried this  and, now if you our down one of the old and one of these on the floor he gobbles down this one and just leaves the old kind. What a great find!  Charlie loves his "duckie" which he gets after doing his business outside. He now comes in and sits infront of his treat jar and waits. He eats the duck part first then the sweet potato which shocks me, I can believe he eats a veggie. But he loves them, I can not give a higher review then I am now, if there were a way to give 10 stars these would get 11! Great for dogs with allergies too, no filler just all natural products which makes me feel good about giving them to Charlie!  So worth the price, you only give your doggie 1 3 a day and there are a lot in a pack and it is resealable which keeps them fresh.  And they have the "rawhide ish" duck which is good for their teeth and the sweet potato for fiber. I am kind of lucky that the old  and has stopped making theirs because I found these, and no need to run to Petsmart once a week to buy a new bag these seem to last forever, and are a good size for a treat, bigger than a milk bone and smaller than a greenie. Greenies used to be Charlie's favorite now he turns his nose up at them and wants his "ducky"  I can't say enough good things about them!          I am buying three more bags today just so I have a stock up of them because I never want to run out!
