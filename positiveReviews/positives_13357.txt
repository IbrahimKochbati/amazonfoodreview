I see there are no other reviews for this item yet. There need to be! It is great, and with recent changes in Twinings lineup, I'm sure more people like me are out there looking for a good replacement   so I hope this will be helpful to some who are doing as I have done. I took a blind chance on this tea   and I am so glad I did. I've been a fan of black currant iced tea ever since I first tried it. For years I used Twinings  and, but they have changed their formula and I have read many negative reviews, so I decided to look for a new  and. I tried several others and Mighty Leaf black currant has been the best so far.  If you are a fan of Twinings Black currant (the original) and or you like the black currant iced teas served by Jason's Deli or Corner Bakery, you will probably really like this tea as it has a very similar taste. It is slightly stronger and has a little more of a "bite" than Twinings version did, (which I like)  and it is an excellent quality tea all around. There are several  ands out there whose interpretation of what black currant tea tastes like is very far removed from this flavor I am familiar with. A few of them I tried were just downright weird. I am not really sure which black currant taste is more "authentic" to be honest, I just know what I like and I am very very happy with this tea. I will be buying this  and from now on for making my iced tea. It is well worth having to order it.
