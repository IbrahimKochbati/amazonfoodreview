Finally a High Fiber cereal that tastes great!! I like mixing the Carmel with either the Honey Cluster or the Raison Cluster for an even Higher Fiber load. And the lowest price I've found these cereals in on Amazon.com (we all love saving money while being healthy, right?). Try it for 3 days and I'm sure you'll love it like I do. Thanks and have a healthy day!!!     Mike Buckley     Concord, CA
