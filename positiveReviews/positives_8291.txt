I've been a Flavrz fan for about a year. But all that time I pretty much stuck to the Tropical flavored version. Which was excellent. Recently I decided to order a couple new flavrz flavors, through Amazon. This cola I think is excellent. I have been drinking it just with filtered water. Really good taste. I just wish it was easier to get the stuff.
