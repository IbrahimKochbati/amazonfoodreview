I think the Wabash Valley Farms portion packs taste the most like the popcorn I get in my local theaters, but the Great Northern Popcorn Company's Portion Packs taste the best.  Using the full portion of flavored salt does make it too salty for my taste so I use just 3 4 of the portion amount (the 4 Oz. portion pack contains exactly 1 teaspoon of flavored salt).  I've also found that the 6 Oz. portion packs work just fine in my 4 Oz. Maxi Matic Table Top Popper, better suited to movie night party quantities.
