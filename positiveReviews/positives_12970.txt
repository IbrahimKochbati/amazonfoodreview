I have long believed that you can get anyone to drink anything as long as you add enough sugar to it.  And this drink is proof of that.  It's 100% vitamin C but 34grams of sugar.  I actually think it would taste better if it were not carbonated.  It's just a juice pouch with carbonation.          I really liked it, my kids really liked it and it was a very tasty drink.  But again, 34 grams of sugar, wow.  It's also only 8 ounces.  I tried the strawberry kiwi, it left a syrupy taste in my mouth.  I would not purchase again, just because of the sugar level.  If you disregard than it is a good drink nevertheless.
