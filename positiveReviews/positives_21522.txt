Everything I said about the Cinnamon and Spice version applies to this.  And what I said was:          It's oatmeal that tastes like cinnamon and spice.  Just like the box says.  The oatmeal is good enough, and quick to make. Obviously it isn't as high quality as really good oatmeal, but if you just want quick and reasonably tasty, as well as cheap   well, this is for you.          Except remove the 'cinnamon and spice' and replace with 'Maple Brown Sugar'.  Well, except the first time, because then this review would be self referential.
