After purchasing a few bags and receiving just crumbs, I wrote to the company.  No offer to replace, no refund and most important not even a thank you for taking the time to let them know; just that they will try and fix the problem.  I am sure the flavor is quite good but they were literally just smashed crumbs. And expensive crumbs at that.  In this economy, I tend to stay away from people companies that don't stand behind their product.
