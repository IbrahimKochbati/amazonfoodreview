I just love this Chili  it is beefier chunkier than other no beans chilis and the blend of seasoning is simply outstanding  much more savory and less of an assault to the tastebuds than Hormel's in my opinion.  Goes great on a hot dog, a baked potato, good to dip tortilla chips in and a wonderful companion to grilled cheese sandwiches or just toasted english muffins.
