As a health nut, I want to know what's going into my body. I try to buy things with ingredients I recognize. Here you can find just that.          I know what sugar is. I know what fruit juice is. There's no HFCS or junk that was made in a lab.          It's a perfectly bubbly, tasty soda that keeps you refreshed. The taste is very bold  much more than you'd expect than something 'healthy.' but healthy it is  and it's excellent!
