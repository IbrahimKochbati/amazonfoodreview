I love cheese in general. I've had lots of European cheeses, and this one is OUTSTANDING.          The texture is a bit hard, not creamy as French cheeses; and the flavor is full and rich. Great to serve with some  ead and of course, some wine. It is great with salads as well, you won't need any dressing since the cheese is enough a good flavor enhancer by itself.          I have shared it with many guests and they ALL love it. It's not salty like Cheddar and smoked cheeses, it's more of a refined goat milky flavor.          It's always a Success!
