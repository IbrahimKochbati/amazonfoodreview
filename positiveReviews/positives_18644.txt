This Ketchup is wonderful!!! Tastes just like any "sugary" product on the market, but without the sugar and the calories. I purchased this when Amazon carried it as a Prime product. I am so sorry they have discontinued. The only replacement they have with Agave is a product from Mexico, where there is absolutely no oversite as to what is truly in the product, how the product was produced or the labor conditions with which it was produced. Come on Amazon,  ing this one back....a USA produced and FDA regulated product!!
