I have a rather small kitchen and a "Tower" type holder would take up too much counter space.  This holder is perfect for me   the rubberized top holds my Keurig plus a sugar dispenser, a bowl of Sweet n Low, and a tall shot glass with coffee stir sticks.  Very convenient, and the drawer slides out easily to hold 36 K cups.  I'm thinking of getting a 2nd one and stacking them so that I have room for 72 cups, clearance above my Keurig is good.          4 stars for price, at ~$45 I had to really think about it for a bit.  But, it works better for me than the cheaper options would so I am happy with the purchase.
