While not the finest Earl Grey out there, it sure is packaged for maximum appeal.  The petite cylindrical canister  is sized just right for glorified spice rack tea cabinet storage, with artwork that's just short of overwrought. Pop off the top, and lo: it's double hulled, requiring an extra bit of effort for each pot  ewed.  Special!  This second satisfying pop comes complete with a wallop of sharp, nose tingling bergamot.     Regular tea drinkers may find Rishi's Earl Grey most suitable as garnish to a darker, fuller bodied tea (a couple of spoons on top of some PG Tips makes for a nice afternoon pick me up). Otherwise they may find they go through a can a week, at best.          Alone, this tea  ews to an orangeish hue, no darker, and always tastes slightly understeeped, or overmilked.  I tried to oversteep, but no dice: It's as if the tea's been neutered, the merest hint of tannin erased. It's unnerving.          If you want a tea that will pretty much always present pretty well, and are willing to pay extra for that pritnear peace of mind, Rishi's Earl Grey is a good bet.  If you like more involvement with your tea    attention to leaf volume, water temperature, steeping time, ratio of additives, etc.    stick with Twinings, Numi, or Taylors of Harrogate.
