****          This tea is good   it is a meld of green and white teas: White tea, Japanese green tea, Chinese green tea, Assam green tea, Darjeeling green tea, and organic green tea from Sri Lanka. It has a mild and interesting taste, and doesn't appear to be as strong in its [...] effects as some other green or white teas.          I went to Stash's website to find out more about Fusion Green and White and it says that white tea is a very rare and healthful tea, even more so than green tea, containing powerful antioxidants; it is thought that white tea may have the strongest anti carcinogenic effects of all teas. White tea is not oxidized, but withered and dried by steaming. It is not clear exactly how much white tea is present in this tea compared to all of the greens   I'm thinking there might be far more green than white. Still, it is a fine tea nonetheless.          For a basic green tea, with some extra healthful white tea added, it is a not overly exciting but certainly tasty tea. I would especially recommend it for people new to tea drinking who want to  anch out from orange pekoe to something different, and are looking for a gentle introduction to the wide world of teas.          ****
