I found this to be one of the best kcups available.  The Colombia has flavor typical of a coffee chain's  ewed coffee  bold, lots of subtle flavors, not bitter, smooth, etc. Type "Colombia barista prima" into Google for detailed tasting notes from other folks.  I REALLY enjoyed it and will be purchasing the largest box possible for my next order.
