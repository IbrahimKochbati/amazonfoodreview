My baby isn't born yet so I haven't used this for baby food yet, but I HAVE used it for freezing homemade chicken stock. I just filled the 2 ounce cups, popped it into the freezer and then stuck the frozen segments into a ziplock and then repeated. It makes the perfect sized little portions and is extremely easy to use. I love how flexible the silicone is and am looking forward to finding other uses for this. I would highly recommend this to anyone, not just those wanting to use it for baby food.          As another reviewer stated, it is not airtight so it could get freezer burn. But I have never had this issue and you can avoid it as well by simply transferring the portions to a freezer bag once it's frozen. If you are looking for a container to hold what you make in the freezer indefinitely, this is not the product for you.          I like this so much, in fact, I would have purchased a second or even third one for convenience if it weren't for the price. Once my baby is old enough, I have a feeling I will be investing in another though.
