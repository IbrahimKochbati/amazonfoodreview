I've learned that I can cutopen the top of the packet, pinch it to divide the micro ground coffee in half, and it makes a nice cup of coffee! Be sure to know how many ounces your cup is, or, you may be making very strong coffee. Try experimenting a bit to s t r e t c h the individual packet servings. :)
