The Gluten Free Pantry Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix is so easy to make and tastes heavenly.  I combined two packages and baked the  ownies in a large cake pan, then cut them into serving size and froze them.  They taste as good after being frozen as they did the day I baked them.  In my book, these  ownies taste better than anything sold in the supermarkets as regular wheat containing  ownies.  I recommend the mix to anyone hungry for the real thing!
