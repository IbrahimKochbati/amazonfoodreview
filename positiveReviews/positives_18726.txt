I missed Shake 'n' Bake.  I haven't had this stuff since I was a kid.  It was so easy, except I was surprised by one thing: it didn't come with a bag.  It is just a packet of seasoning   I thought I remembered this coming with a bag.  No big deal, I always have spare Ziploc bags on hand, and I didn't even use one for this.  I simply poured the seasoning on a plate and dipped the raw chicken onto it, and it covered very well.  I didn't need to coat the chicken in egg or water or anything, the seasoning stuck very well.          As for taste, it was very good.  Interestingly, it tasted slightly similar to Old Bay, so I tried it on some Tilapia and that was good, too!
