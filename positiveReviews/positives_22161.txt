I have a five months old corgi jack russel mix, and I give him the petrodex dental chews every morning after  eakfast, and he loves them! He expects them every morning. And plus it's good for their teeth! He's def. a chewer, so it gives me a little time to eat my own  eakfast while he nibbles on his treat :)
