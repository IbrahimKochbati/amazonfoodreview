Generally speaking, I am a big fan of chocolate, but not of coconut (unless it's milk), but this blend of the two made for an especially satisfying treat, especially after a long, aerobic workout.  It's a good, sinful treat that can be enjoyed anytime, whether it is while watching one's favorite episode of Psych, or as a reward for finishing that extra mile when jogging.  Two of these treats were knocked off that way.          I had one of these treats with my lunch.  At that time, I found they tasted even better when chilled, as the one I ate with lunch was in my lunch bag in the fridge.  The bars have good texture and consistency  either at room temperature or chilled, and are quite filling, especially with water.          I gave a couple to two of my acquaintances, and they both raved about the treat.  Also, the one I  ought to work and left casually on my desk mysteriously disappeared  perhaps it grew legs and walked off?!?  In the interests of minimizing workplace theft, I strongly suggest you keep these treats under lock and key.
