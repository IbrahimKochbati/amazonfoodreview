DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT.  AS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE WRITTEN THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS TO THE DOG.  I TRIED IT ANYWAYS BECAUSE MY DOG HAS BAD BREATHE.  THE VET RECOMMENDED IT.  HOWEVER THE DOG CHEWED IT AWHILE AND THEN SWALLOWED IT AND CHOKED.  VERY SCARY.  THANKFULLY THE DOG THEN WAS ABLE TO VOMIT AND IT CAME OUT.  DON NOT USE THIS PRODUCT.
