Best you know you are buying a Northerners idea of collard soup.  It is really white bean soup but tasty!  It is worth buying due to the short prep time.  Tastes like you simmerered the beans all day.  By the time you cook the corn  ead the soup is also ready to eat!          High starch but good fiber source as well.  Serves two very generously and definitely three, maybe four, with smaller appetites or extra sides.          Did I mention tasty?  Just do not expect collard soup with lots of collards.
