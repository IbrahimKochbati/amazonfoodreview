After a lifetime of mediocre maple syrup, this is the perfect one.  Compared to Grade A, he Grade B has the heartier flavor which works perfectly for waffles and pancakes.  The amber color and consistency of the syrup are also just right for the  eakfast table.  The organic designation, though nice, is not a personal requirement given that the product comes from the sap of trees, which really should not require herbicides anyway.  The price for this product, given the volume you are getting is almost 50% cheaper than buying something similar at your grocery store.  A must have for  eakfast.
