I'm always looking for new and wonderful things to feed my dog, so when I saw the Cesar's Prime Rib treats, I thought "Bingo!" After all, they love the Cesars food. However, the treats are far from gourmet as the packaging, price, and picture would suggest. In fact, they're really no different than the run of the mill soft dog treats that you can buy for half the price. One thing I always loved about the Cesars line is that their dog food actually smells palatable. It doesn't just have a meat like aroma but a meaty aroma...a big difference. The same difference in quality can't be found in the treats though. Upon opening, I was at once overcome by a strong, acrid and chemical like aroma. Upon examining the treat up close, I found it to be waxy, sweetish smelling, and so chock full of preservatives that the fumes made my nose itch. The picture on the package shows a white filling surrounded by meaty goodness. The truth is that the filling is barely noticeable...whatever it is. My dogs would have nothing to do with it. I gave the package to a neighbor who feeds her dogs Ol' Roy treats which resemble these in texture and smell and they loved them. Nothing wrong with Ol' Roy btw...but why pay three times the price for the same thing?
