There is much confusion about tomatoes, and shopping on line in this case adds to the complexity.  These are not the best tomatoes offered at the time of this writing.  The Strianese are hands down the best.  My local store sells them.  I have been using them for fifteen years.  But they are significantly more expensive and the shipping is  utal.  No Prime shipping with them.  I use these specific Cento when I am not home.  It all depends on how much your sauce means to you.          But you need to know what you are buying.  These Cento tomatoes are 1) San Marzano sauce tomatoes; 2) they are D.O.P. certified 3) and this point is often overlooked, they are from the Sarnese Nocerino.  They are the second best in terms of absolute flavor.  Bright from proper acid, deep from proper natural salt sugar balance.  You probably cannot get better tomatoes fresh unless you know a specialty grower, or do it yourself and have no day job.  Cento sells many others, much cheaper, that are not these.          The price per can is good.  The best deal is if you have Amazon Prime and get regular shipments.  I get three large batches per case, enough to feed the mob that forms on sauce day.          Most people are happy with the many good canned tomatoes, especially when you look at the poor genetically engineered ersatz "fresh" tomatoes at the supermarket.  But if you are a maestro, these are what you want.
