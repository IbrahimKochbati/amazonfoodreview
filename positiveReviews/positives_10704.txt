These are hard dog biscuit treats (like MilkBones) in a square shape about 1.5" on each side and 1 4" thick.  So for a small dog, they're pretty big. I tried to  eak it up for my little dog, but it was hard as a rock and I wasn't about to try and hack it with a knife so I just gave it to her as is. This is the only reason I'm deducting a star because the ingredients are great and they are good treats but sometimes a full sized treat is too much for a small dog.          We have a 4 year old, 9lb mutt who is REALLY picky and not very food motivated.  She has been known to turn her nose up at fish if not prepared to her liking and has literally spit out most grocery store purchased dog treats   especially if they require any effort to actually crunch them to eat. It's like she can't remember that she has the capacity to eat hard foods, so she'll let a bowl of her (very expensive) dog food sit out for 24 hours before remembering how her jaw works.          So. Needless to say I was surprised when she took this treat from my hands and ran off to another room with it.  In the other room, she sat and inspected it and played with it for about a minute before she was struck with the idea to try and eat it. Normally this is when she leaves the treat in the middle of the room and comes back to me to see if I'm going to give her the real treat   usually some kind of jerky   but to my surprise, she ate the whole thing.  And when she was done she ran back to where we were and sat in front of the bag.  Waiting.  This has never happened with a dry treat before so I have to assume that's a sign of approval from a pleased dog.  I gave her a second one, which she hid under her blanket for about 3 minutes before coming back to it to eat.          In Amazon's 6 pack it  eaks down to about $3.25 for each package.  Compared to the biscuit treats I had tried before with similar ingredients that my dog rejected, this is on par with the pricing.  It's more expensive than treats I'd find in normal grocery store aisles or at the big pet store chains, but about the same price as the stuff I normally get at specialty pet stores.  It's way cheaper than the duck jerky I had been buying, but those are two totally different types of treats so I can't compare the two and this will not replace my dog's duck treats.  The biggest selling point for me is that I have to go to a specialty pet store to find the other biscuit treats with the same kind of ingredients so being able to order this in bulk on Amazon makes it a much sweeter deal.
