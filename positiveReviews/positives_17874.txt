My daughter said it was so good, she ate some right out of the pouch.          We didn't make porkchops. We did a pork loin. It was moist, tender, juicy and delicious. I haven't used Shake n' Bake for years...but I've gone out and bought several packages.          I loved it. My daughter loved it. Her friend loved it. We're making more.
