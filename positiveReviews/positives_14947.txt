I have a stubborn chihuahua daschund mix dog.  Kibbles 'n Bits is the only dog food that he will eat with any degree of consistency.  He actually prefers the mini bits. (I guess size does matter.)  I tried premium foods thinking they would be better for him, and, at most, I've only been able to get him to eat each  and once or twice.
