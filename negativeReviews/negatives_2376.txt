I love the Nativa  and, however, they always seem to leave out very important details on their packaging.          I heard so many praises about how much better the Chia seeds are than Flax seeds.          Upon arrival I opted to use these in my salad as opposed to the flax seeds I've been using.          The Chia seeds caused the most horrible and painful bloating I ever experienced. Granted, I did use the full serving size, but since then I lowered the amount and STILL with even just a quarter of a teaspoon or less I get the bloating.          I have since switched back to the Flax seeds which didn't wreak havoc on my intestinal tract.          I am hoping I can find some way to use these seeds in the future because I hate seeing anything go to waste.          My advice if you are set on trying the Chia seeds is to start out with a very low amount!!! And stick with that low amount until your stomach builds up a tolerance for these seeds.
