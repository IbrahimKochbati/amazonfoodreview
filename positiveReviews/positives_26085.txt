I've tried other dry cat foods that have animal protein as their first 4 5 ingredients, but this is the first one they actually like.          I mix it half & half with a supermarket  and because I can't afford to feed them the good stuff straight.  They used to eat the supermarket  and and leave the "healthy food" in the dish.  They don't do that with this  and  they clean the plate! :o)
