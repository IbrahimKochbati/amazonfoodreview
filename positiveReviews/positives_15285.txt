My first Keurig was purchased in January 2011 from Macy's.  It died on 4 29 12.  It worked that morning but later in the day the power light was out and nothing we did to try and revive it worked.  I was disappointed that the unit died after only 15 months, but it was on 16 hours or more per day and had worked perfectly up until its sudden demise. I never had any problems with the prime as some people have reported and can only hope my next unit will work as well.          Because I had heard of Keurigs failing just after the warranty, I had purchased a 3 year warranty for it from Square Trade.  It's an online company that provides reasonably priced warranties for a wide variety of products.  I contacted them the day the unit failed and received an email with an Amazon gift card number within 24 hours of my contact.  The card included a 5% promotional credit from their partnership with Amazon so it was actually a little more than I paid for the first unit.  My next Keurig will arrive 5 3 12. (Note:  I did have to ship them the burned out unit but they provide the shipping costs via a UPS shipping label.  The hard part was getting a big enough box and enough packing materials so that cost me a little over $5. Next time I'll keep the box.)          I have read good things about Keurig customer service and their replacing  ewers out of warranty due to priming problems, but since I already had this warranty and it wasn't a priming problem, I didn't contact Keurig.  They might have been helpful too   I don't know.          Before I knew Square Trade would come through so quickly, we went to the store and bought a Mr. Coffee  ewer for $79.00.  Our intent is just to use it until the new Keurig comes and then put it in our travel trailer for weekend trips (instead of taking the Keurig with us).  While the Mr. Coffee is quieter, it takes much longer to heat the water and we have yet to get rid of an odd after taste from it.  I'm going to run vinegar through it to see if that helps but so far it is rather disappointing.          Another side note:  I buy my coffee from Green Mountain.com online.  If you join their club you get a pretty decent discount and they sell 24 pack product, not the 18 that you buy in the store.  If you join the club (automatic shipments) and order 4 or more at a time they pay the shipping. You can set the interval at the number of weeks that is right for you and it's easy to change if your circumstances change.  Recently they included free samples (a full 24 cup box) of their hot apple cider.  That wouldn't happen at the grocery store.          In summary, I love my Keurig.  Being without it for a few days has really made me realize how much I love it.  Is it more expensive than a pot of  ewed coffee   yes.  But to me it is well worth it.  I will buy another Square Trade warranty though   just to be safe.          Addendum 5 3 12.  My new unit came today.  I had ordered the Classic (B44) because I could get Prime Shipping.  I mistakenly thought it was the same as the Elite (B40).  It's not.  The cup sizes are smaller.  You have two choices, but the larger one is only 7.25 oz, not 9.25 like the Elite.  That was a huge disappointment.  They don't show the cup sizes in either of the write ups on Amazon and it's not easy to find in writing anyplace.  Because I can't return it, we're going to put this one in the trailer, return the Mr. Coffee to the store (still tastes funny after 3 days including a white vinegar cleaning) and get the Elite 40 for home use.  Live and learn.
