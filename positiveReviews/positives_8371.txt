I really liked this hot sauce, it is incredibly hot. It's perfect for pranking friends with, if you're looking for something like that. My only complaint is that it's a bit hard when cooking with it to find a good balance of the hot and flavor. Other than that, the heat and flavor are both there and are almost perfect!
