I'm sitting here watching the Olympics, enjoying my latte. And in the national spirit of giving praise, this espresso ground is great! We moved from California and have been dissapointed with the affordable coffee here in NYC. I missed my Peet's!!They're tops in flavor and body. It's just a godsend to have it arrive fresh and ready to go. Thanks!
