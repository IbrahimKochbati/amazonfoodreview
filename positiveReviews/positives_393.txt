I simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends.  :))  My experience with a lot of cheese favored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side.  But these NY Cheddar from Kettle really changed my mind.  Thanks to Amazon for great discounts and I don't have to buy them from the store anymore.
