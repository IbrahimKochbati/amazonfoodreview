I was wary about ordering, but I received a shipment today and not a single can was dented. There weren't even any of the tiny dents that I would be OK with, and there were certainly no major dent issues. Hopefully Amazon the manufacturer have solved the shipping and packing issue. I would feel comfortable ordering this again.
