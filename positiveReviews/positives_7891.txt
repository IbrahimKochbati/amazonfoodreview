I ordered dried galangal root to make tom kha gai soup.  Although the fresh root tastes better, I ordered the dried root to have "on hand".  It does the trick  and the quality is great.     TastePadThai shipped my order very fast!  When I opened the box I was surprised to find that they had also included a complimentary assortment of fresh Thai herbs (kaffir lime leaves, lemon grass, thai peppers, and galangal).  How generous!  I will definitely shop with TastePadThai again.
