I was very hesitant to try this food for my 7 month old. After mixing up the sweet potatoes (with water) I tried them, and they were awful! I added more water and decided that it must be the fact that they were dried that's making them so terrible. I gave them to my son and later that day he threw them all up. My son has not thrown up once since begin born.... this food is terrible. Once the water is added, it doesn't smell right, much less taste right.... Please just stick regular organic baby food.
