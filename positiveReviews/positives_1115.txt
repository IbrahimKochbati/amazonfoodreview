I love this coffee! Like the other reviewers, I took a trip to Costa Rica and was immediately addicted to this bold, flavorful coffee. I am a cover lover and have tried many different  ands only to find that Britt is hands down the best I've ever had. I  ought back one bag from Costa Rica and have started ordering my supply because I can't go back to other bland store bought coffees. Definitely worth a try! You won't be disappointed.
