As the title says I'm not a fan of fizzy water and that taste definitely comes through in this drink. The 'tang' of this product assaults your mouth right from the first sip.  It smelled nice. But really it was just so sweet and carbonated that the experience was not enjoyable.  There no discernable taste of kiwi or strawberry, just a blast of sugar and bubbles. The 3 people under 11 in our familiy loved it but   as we knew they would.          No thanks.
