This is a great mix to use as a starting point for mixing whole grain  eads for a  ead machine.  It's good just out of the package, but can be great by adding some whole wheat flour, oatmeal etc.  it can be sensitive to the amount of liquid; if you don't use the right amount, you can end up with a doughball.
