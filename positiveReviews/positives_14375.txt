This product is amazing!  We had a gift card for an out of town feed store and my husband happened to pick this up.  We have an older Rott Boarder Collie who has been having joint, arthritis trouble.  The vet has given him several medications.  One he won't eat unless I  force it and the other makes him act "wonky".  The vet says I shouldn't have a problem with either product, but I know my dog! Anyway, because of this fluke purchase, his mobility and attitude improved by "leaps and bounds" within two weeks!  He no longer cries or yelps when he tries to get up and he is much more playful.  Bucky, our dog, is also allergic to corn.  It isn't easy to find a "treat" that doesn't have corn. This product is free of corn and other additives i.e. wheat, soy, artificial colors, flavors, added fat or by products.  The only thing I could wish for is disclosure of the caloric content.  I don't know how many calories are in a treat.  We use this in conjunction with a senior glucosamine  condroiton dog food. The 1lb pk that we purchased was $17 and a 45 minute trip out of town.  I'm down to one treat. He takes three (huge dog) a day.  I decided to see if I could get it on line.  Everything I found was still expensive especially with S&H.  And, then I thought maybe Amazon.  Sure enough there it was.  So, thanks to Amazon.  But more importantly, greatful thanks to Zuke's for a miracle product.  Couldn't be more happy.  God gave us a great gift when he gave us all our furry friends!
