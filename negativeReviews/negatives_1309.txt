Would have rated no star if available.  BeefeatersÂ® Chicken Liver Freeze Dried Treats for Dogs, are a product of China, and irradiated "for your protection" according to the company's hold message.  Called Amazon.com customer service, and requested a full refund with pre paid returned shipping.  Too bad none of this is in the product description.  Amazon CSR was very helpful, and very cooperative, postage paid shipping label received via email immediately.  Thank you, Amazon.com!
