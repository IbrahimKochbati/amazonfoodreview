I love the fact that this cereal has probiotics in it and that it's organic.  My daughter has a very sensitive digestive track (although she will eat about anything we have made so far) and I think the added probiotics really help.  It sure keeps her regular that for sure!  I also like all the unique grains this particular cereal has, such as Amaranth.  At first I didn't like the fact that I had to buy 6 can of the stuff, but I am glad I did.  It's been about a month and I only have one left.
