Purchased approximately 24 of these bars in different flavors (the chocolate fudge being my personal favorite, though the  ownie crunch is also tasty).  The texture is a bit chewy but the flavor is good...for a protein bar.  Not necessarily on par with the average sugar filled candy bar of course.  The carb sugar protein content is on par with most higher end Gluten Free protein bars I've discovered (including Quest Bars and NoGii).          All things considered   flavor, consistency, and quality, I'd likely give these 4 stars.  The issue, however, is that after eating about 6 bars with no issues, I began having gluten reactions to the next three I attempted to eat.  Needless to say, no matter how much protein you consume, your workouts are not going to go well if you're horribly sick.          I have written to the company to complain, but cannot afford to take this risk, especially with other comparable bars available.  I caution anyone with Celiac Disease to try these at your own risk, they say GLUTEN FREE on the label, but something was not or a batch became contaminated.  I've been a diagnosed Celiac for over 10 years and I (unfortunately) know the reaction all too well and this bar sparked it.          Although I wanted to support this bar for it's high protein content and GF label, I will not buy Think Thin bars again for this reason.  I've moved to Quest Protein Bars for now as I've never had any gluten or allergic reactions to those (and they tend to taste better if you like an almond caramel type flavor)    "
