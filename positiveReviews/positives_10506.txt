This is a great buy.  We are talking a whole pound, here. And, packaged in individual 2 oz. packets to keep it fresh till you want it.  We have been paying $4 at the store for small 3 ounce bags, so this is a great price as well.  Besides all of that, it's a great tasting product.  One of my best purchases here.
