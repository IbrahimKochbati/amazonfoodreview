These liver treas are phenomenal. When i received the 14oz. bucket by amazon i began training my 3month old Alaskan malamute. Now that a month has passed by, she now knows: Sit, Stay, Down, Paw, & SPEAK! My bucket is almost empty as it only lasted for about a month but was worth every penny as ive read malamutes are very stubborn quite dogs. I gave some to my 2 poodles where they gobbled it down and were begging for more. These treats are highly recommended, plus the liver cubes can be further  oken down into quadrants. A+++ product
