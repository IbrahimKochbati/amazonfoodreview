I have so far only made pancakes, but plan to make pizza crust, biscuits, etc. I was not expecting much more than "edible". I was very pleasantly surprised that the pancakes tasted like any pre made mix. I used sugar free syrup and didn't feel cheated. I'll be using this rather than pancake mix from now on.
