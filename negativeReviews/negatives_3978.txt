I still like my jasmine rice that I can get out in town. We use rice all the time so I figured we would buy in bulk. Bad idea to buy online. Sooo much cheaper at your local grocery. Right after I purchased this item, my local store came out with bulk bags of my favorite jasmine rice, which is cheaper and much better quality than buying online. I have not yet been satisfied with a food purchase on amazon yet.
