I'm one of many women in the world who find it extremely hard to get my eight glasses of water in each day. With the Wyler's Light Pink Lemonade packets, I've found that I'm actually drinking a lot more water than I used to. I started mixing a packet in my water bottle once a day; now I'm mixing up about three bottles a day! This stuff makes water taste so good! It honestly doesn't have that Nutri Sweet taste that a lot of "light" drinks do. I'd definitely recommend this product to everyone I know!
