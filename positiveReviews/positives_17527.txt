These meat snacks are fabulous and incredibly healthy.  I first discovered them at my health club in New Hampshire, where they charge $2.50 for one stick, so buying them from Amazon made sense, cutting the cost by a buck.  Try all the flavors   they're all great, and very low in fat with lots of fiber.  Highly recommend.
