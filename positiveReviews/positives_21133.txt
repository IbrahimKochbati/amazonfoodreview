I have the larger version of this item, and am now buying this one.  I like it, but the larger version is just too big for my crowded refrigerator.  I've had other sprouters in the past, and this one is as good or better than any I've tried.  (Skip quinona (sp?) seeds, however.  They were my one disaster).
