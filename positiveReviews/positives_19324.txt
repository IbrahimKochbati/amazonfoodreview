This is the best oatmeal that I've ever had, and the instant is a  eeze to make in the microwave.  I make it with skimmed milk (not water) and add cinnamon and a tiny bit of sugar, so the result is not at all like those overly sweet products produced by other  ands.  It's wonderful that Amazon carries this oatmeal at a price that is consistently below grocery store prices.
