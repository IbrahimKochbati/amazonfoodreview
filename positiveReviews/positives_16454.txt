My postman started giving Maddie Greenies when she was about a year old, when he stopped I had to purchase them myself, she has one each day, she is now 13 1 2, she loves them I feel they are good for the gums and teeth, she has had very few pulled, looks good for a Senior.  I would highly recommend them to any one who has a pet.
