I love my morning cup of coffee, but cannot have caffeine.  Finding a decent decaf coffee is difficult.  I am not a $tarbucks fan... I don't like bitter, acidic coffee.  The Lavazza Gran Filtro decaf whole bean coffee is a high quality medium roast coffee.  It is well balanced and has a great aroma.
