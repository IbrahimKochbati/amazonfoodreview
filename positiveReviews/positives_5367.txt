I have ordered three boxes of these so far.  They work very well.  Shipping was fast.  Their claim to fame is the ability to pre fill these little cups and store them for later.  I just store them in the freezer.  The problem with most refillable disposable filter k cups, is that they are prepared on a per cup basis.  To me this defeats the whole usefulness of the k cup system.  Instead with these, I can sit at the table, and quickly throw together all 50 and store them.  Convienience is maintained and the cost effectiveness goes up as these are so much cheaper than buying the prepared ones.
