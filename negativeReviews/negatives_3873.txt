My family and I sampled two flavors of Switch    Kiwi Berry and Watermelon Strawberry.  Though neither is something we'd want to purchase, Kiwi Berry was the least desirable of the two.  It tasted like it had way too much sugar, even though the can claims to have no sugar added.  The strawberry flavor was predominant, overwhelming the kiwi almost entirely.  In all, it tasted like strawberry candy.  Even worse    it had a kind of chemical y bitterness to it.  If you want a fruity beverage that tastes a lot like candy, go ahead and try Switch.  But if not    avoid this.  I would especially not want to buy this flavor.  There are better ways to get my daily Vitamin C fix.
