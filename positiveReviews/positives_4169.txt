Our primary reason for buying this product is that it came in a variety pack.  We make most of our own baby food, but we were going on vacation and that was going to be difficult.  Since packing space was limited, we had this shipped to our destination.  It was the only  and we could find to order in a variety pack.  The kids liked all the flavors and the consistency seemed good.
