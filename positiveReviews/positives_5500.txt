If you are a chamomile tea drinker, you will be happy to discover this tea.  The citrus addition makes for a full bodied but smooth tea.  Definitely the best chamomile tea on the market.  Also, I  ew one bag in a coffee maker dedicated to tea only, and get a whole pot out of each bag.  You won't be disappointed in this one.
