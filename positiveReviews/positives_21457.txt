Prior to ordering, I had not heard of or tasted this chai tea. I ordered it based on reviews. While it is delicious, it's not for the dieter. At 150 calories and 3g total fat, all of which is sat fat, and total carbs at 28g, 25g sugars, this is going to be my indulgence treat I'll have on special occasions. Or maybe once a week :)
