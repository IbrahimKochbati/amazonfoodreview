This veggie jerky is fantastic!  The Hot & Spicy is my favorite, but all are pretty good too.  While it's true there is a bit less protein in this variety, there is significantly more fiber (6g vs. 1g for soy protein based flavors).  Note: there's a definite spice here, it's not overwhelming, but it's definitely there... as the flavor implies.
