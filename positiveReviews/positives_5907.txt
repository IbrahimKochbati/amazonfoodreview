I don't like non organic dairy, but this stuff comes close. Goats are not given steroids or hormones as far as i know. the taste is usually very consistent, but it does take some getting used to. the powder mixes very well, and it is handy when on the road and need to mix a protein shake. It improves the taste of protein shakes and that's my favorite thing about this. very recommended.
