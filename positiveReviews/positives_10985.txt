We've spend way too much money buying boxes of crackers only to find out they taste like crumbly cardboard, but once we finally tried these we knew our search was over. My wife loves these crackers and often eats them with peanut butter, Nutella, hummus or tuna fish. They do somewhat resemble Ritz crackers, but noticeably less salty. We've had pretty good luck with this Glutino  and in general and you definitely won't go wrong with these crackers.
