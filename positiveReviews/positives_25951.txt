I was hesitant to order this because of all the negative          reviews about shipping.  And while this is no fault's of          Amazon's, it gave me reason to pause.  However, I ordered          it and while the box was dented in and in terrible shape,          all 12 bags were sealed and in perfect condition.  I always          find Amazon to be prompt and offer excellent service.  They gave me free shipping and gave an estimated time of arrival and all          my items were received in two days and a week early!!GREAT JOB!!!
