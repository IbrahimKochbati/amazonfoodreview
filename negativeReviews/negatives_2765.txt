Tuna, as is well documented, absorb and store Mercury in fat.  Anything that eats that fat consumes Mercury. I wouldn't feed tuna to a child, and I'd recommend any adult to read the literature regarding mercury content in seafood. How can it be safely fed to a cat? Regarding this  and of cat food, it's excellent as long as you feed chicken or turkey.
