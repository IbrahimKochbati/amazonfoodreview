I have bought this 2 other times and really enjoyed it... so much so I subscribed.  However, this time I don't think the bag they sent was a recent roast because it was very flat and the crema was poor compared to the previous batches.  I will buy it one more time and if it is like this one, I will not be buying it again.  They are definitely having issues with quality control if batches can taste so differently from each other.
