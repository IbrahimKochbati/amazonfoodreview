I've not been a big tea drinker but wanted to be because of all the health benefits. I now drink this tea everyday and it energizes me. I can't wait each morning to drink this tea. It has just the right combination of light mint flavor to make it refreshing. The white tea doesn't stain the teeth as readily as other teas and it's very high in antioxidants.
