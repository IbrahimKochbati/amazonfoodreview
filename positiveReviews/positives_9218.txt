This is the best cereal!  It's my favorite by far. It has a good flavor and an excellent crunch.  It's high in whole grains (9 different grains!) and protein.  It's good in milk or in yogurt.  It's also good as an ice cream topping.  My kids just call it "crunchies."  As in, "Mommy put crunchies in my yogurt."  Try grinding it in the blender and mixing the crumbs with natural peanut butter and honey.  Make into balls and serve  great for a snack for adults or kids.
