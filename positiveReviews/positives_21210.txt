I love this product and have been using it for many years now. It makes a perfect yogurt every time. I use the Yogourmet incubator too   a gift from my mother when I got married 12 years ago. The gift that keeps on giving is always the best! I have tried all of the Yogourmet freeze dried starters with fantastic success. The Yogourmet Casei Bifidus Acidophilus Probiotic Yogurt Starter, is my favorite, found here on Amazon for a GREAT price. I give this company a 100% positive review. I have never had problems with any of their culture products or with the Yogourmet incubator machine.          I use 2 quarts of milk with the recommended 10 grams of Yogourmet starter. I have found for myself, that the key to making great yogurt is to heat the milk to 185 degrees and continue cooking it at this temperature for 10 minutes. Cooking at this temperature kills any harmful bacteria in the milk that remains even after pasteurization. It also  eaks down the proteins in the milk insuring a great yogurt SET. Apparently, the proteins are easier for your body to digest in this  oken down state as well. Cool the 2 quarts of milk to 112 degrees, add starter, (10 grams freeze dried starter or 1 2 cup leftover yogurt from original batch) 1 1 2 cups optional powdered milk, up to 1 cup optional sugar and up to 1 tablespoon optional flavoring extracts. Incubate until desired tartness is reached. My kids prefer the maximum sugar so the yogurt tastes more like store bought. Although with this much sugar, the milk takes longer to turn into yogurt   up to 24 hours. Try using honey extract, vanilla extract, raspberry extract, etc.
