If you like instant coffee, Taster's Choice is the one to buy.  I especially like the single serve sticks because I know for sure what my coffee will taste like. When I measure myself, I either get too much or too little coffee on my spoon.  The pre measured stick solves that problem for me.  Then all I have to do is use the right size mug.          These single serve packs are easy to tuck away in a pocket or purse...saving money at the office not having to buy coffee from the machine.
