Hearty, nutty and stomach filling good stuff.     I really have come to appreciate the value of oatmeal like this.     It fills the tummy well and provides good healthy grains.     I was out recently and tried the regular Quaker oats etc. and could not believe how gummy and pure bland they tasted, I could barely finish them.     The Quaker oats just seem over processed.          Quaker does make a good steel cut though , but they take ages to cook like regular Irish Steel cut. A good 20 30 minutes full boil in a stove top pan to cook these types.          I also like Irish 5 minute version steel cut when I'm out of coaches oats, Irish 5 minute are not as good and are a smaller grain ; Coaches are nuttier more flavor packed and a few minutes less cooking time.          Irish 5 minute steel cut are around 5 9 minutes microwave     Coaches Steel Oats are around 3 5 microwave     Irish regular Steel cut 30 minutes stove top full boil          Coaches are a nice balanced oat , like Irish steel cut , but more flavor because of the patented process which  ings out a nuttier mouth satisfying flavor.          Our local Costco doesn't have them anymore?!!          WHY I don't know so I'm forced to order online here or at the main website for Coaches Oats.          By far Coaches are my fav oatmeal, even with ample time to cook I'd go for the Coaches Oats every time.
