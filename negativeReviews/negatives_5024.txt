I have purchased many Premier  and products and liked them, especially the Busy Buddy dog toys.  However, the Tug a jug is not one of them.  The treats do not dispense as easily as some of their other products so some dogs may get discouraged.  My dog stopped playing with it due to that.  The  tug a jug can be a dangerous toy being made out of very hard plastic almost as hard as glass.  If one dog is swinging it, it can injure another animal standing by.  It also can do damage to furniture, walls, etc. I purchased the large size. Today my dog found it after not using it for a very long time and was playing with it and cracked and  oke the whole end off leaving sharp plastic edges.  Luckily I noticed it right away or my dog could have ingested that!  I did buy it in 2009 but my dog hardly ever played with it so I am not sure how long they would last if a dog played with it frequently.  Premier has so many other wonderful dog toys to chose from.
