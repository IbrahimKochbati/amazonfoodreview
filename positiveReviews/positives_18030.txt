I would describe this coffee as medium to dark flavor.  No sharp taste, no acid taste.  It is very smooth and can be easily consumed with minimal creamer.  If you like a strong bold roast, this may not satisfy you.  I use the TImothy's Rainforest Expresso for my morning wakeup (which is the best bold coffee I have found), then I switch to Newman's Own Extra Bold Special Blend later in the day.  Overall, it is an excellent cup of coffee with great flavor.  Definitely worth 5 stars.
