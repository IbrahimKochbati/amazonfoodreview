Simple to use, intuitive to set up. Makes great coffee and tea, provided you use your preferred  ands. Fits on the kitchen counter, does not take up extra space, reservoir holds a decent amount of water so you can have more than one cup, or provide cups for guests without filling reservoir over and over. Great item.
