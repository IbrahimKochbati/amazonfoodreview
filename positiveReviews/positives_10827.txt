I love all of Newman's Own products, and I like that their dog treats are all natural and that it's a trustworthy  and. My dogs really like these treats and they are a good sized for a snack for medium small dogs (I have pugs). The biscuits are hard and they come in "sets" of two, but are easy to  eak apart. The  oken apart squares are about one square inch.          They are definitely hard snacks, and they are easy to  eak into one square, but I could see that it would be difficult to  eak them up further. They are perfect for my dogs, but I would say that they may be difficult for tiny dogs to chew because of their size and crunchiness.
