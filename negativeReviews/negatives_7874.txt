Both of my Golden Retrievers love these.  The older one eats it perfectly, tearing off little pieces at a time, chewing, swallowing.  The younger one (2 yrs old) tears off large of pieces which end up lodged in her throat.  I knew this due to her licking the roof of her mouth after the treat was gone as if I gave her peanut butter.  I would reach in and pull the piece lodged in her throat.  This happened consistently until I gave up on these.  The product is vet recommended and the dogs do love them, but it's not worth the risk!
