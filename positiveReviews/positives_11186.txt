My daughter had given me Emeril's Big Easy Bold coffee as a gift.  I like strong coffee.  When I had finished by gift of coffee, I tried other coffee and found I needed to order Emeril's coffee myself.  I work 3rd shift and need coffee to keep me going and this coffee definitely does that!  It has a great flavor, body and aroma and would recommend it to anyone.
