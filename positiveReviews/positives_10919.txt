Got these for our two large (50 and 100 lb) dogs, who love them.  The biscuits seem hard, they do snap in half easily for sharing with the dogs (one for each) and the smell of the biscuits, we agree smells to me like "ginger snaps".  Maybe there is ginger in them, don't know.  Our two big dogs love them, and they are given only as treats maybe once or twice a day. Recommended!  Minus one star for being really hard.
