One of the things I've really missed since going gluten free are good crackers.  I've tried several  ands.  None of them quite stack up to the real thing.  The Glutino crackers are slightly...soft.  They just don't have the crispness of regular crackers.  The flavors are okay, but, one thing that aggravates me most is that after paying A LOT of money for what looks like a substantial sized box, one finds a pouch inside that contains very few crackers.  This deception seems to be rampant among most of the gluten free cracker  ands! (ie: Nut Thins).  The best gluten free crackers I've found so far are the  own rice crackers that come in a cellophane "log"...at least you can see what you're getting for the money and they are crisp!  When I am desperate for something to put a slice of cheese or some dip or spread or whatever on, I'll slice a cucumber and use the cucumber slices as a cracker (a trick from my low carb days).  If anyone out there has some suggestions for a really good gluten free cracker that doesn't cost a fortune for a small pouch...I'd love to know about it!
