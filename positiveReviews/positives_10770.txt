But unfortunately she's an Italian greyhound and these dog treats are too big for her! She really loves the smell of them and totally wants to eat them...as soon as she sees me reach for the bag she gives me her full attention and comes up and waits eagerly. However, these things are 1"+ on each side and she can't fit them in her mouth. They come connected to other pieces, so first you have to  eak these apart from each other. Then if you have a small dog, like an IG for instance, you'll have to  eak or cut or crumble them up from there. It would be easier if they weren't almost literally rock hard, which makes it really difficult if you're trying to just  eak them up by hand (which means if you're taking some out with you you'll probably want to prepare them beforehand). But she does want to eat them and when I managed to get a small enough piece for her she ate it up; a slightly larger one she worked on and worked on trying to chew on it.          These are USDA organic treats and they must be doing something right, because as I said our IG gets totally excited when she sees the bag being picked up. It would be better if they were easier for small dogs to eat or if Newman's Own at least advertised that the target is ideally large dogs.
