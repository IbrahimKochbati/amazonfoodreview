I do actually get heartburn from coffee, so I was excited to try this "low acid" french roast coffee.          I have noticed that it does seem less acidic, I am on my third cup with no heartburn so far... though I would not chose to drink this as my standard coffee.  I normally  ew dunkin donuts  and coffees at home and really enjoy their flavor.  There are a few other  ands that I will buy when they are available in this town, though that is rarely.          I did not care for the flavor of this coffee.  It was very wooden tasting and almost had an old burnt coffee flavor to it.  I guess if you HAD to drink coffee and were really worried about the acid then this would work... but I'd rather stick with good tasting coffee and follow it up with a tums.  I would not purchase this product on my own.
