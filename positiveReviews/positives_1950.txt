I have been a rose Gardner for many years, I remember when this product was made by Ortho and called Rose Pride.  This product really helps with the pests and diseases that roses tend to acquire.  Though it does not stop all pests (cane borers) it stops the major ones that cause serious damage and spread disease.  I treat all my plants on the same monthly regiment and make sure to do it every four to six weeks making a note on my calendar.  Like one other reviewer said you will not see immediate results with this since it is systemic.  For the best results make sure to read the package and work the granules  into the soil and water in.
