I read many recommendations for Maldon and how it is a great finishing salt.  Looked all over at my local Whole Foods, grocery stores and gourmet shops.  Whole Foods didn't carry it and the gourmet shop sold it for much more than Amazon.  So far I have used it on sauteed and roasted vegetables and a tomato and cucumber salad   delicious and a noticeable difference compared to the regular sea salt I was using (Kirkland  and).
