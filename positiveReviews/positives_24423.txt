I tried the first packet of salsa mix the other day and made salsa for some friends coming over. Rave reviews all round! This salsa mix definitely has a bite to it which I really like. It was super easy to use, cut up tomatoes and throw in the mix, can't get any easier than that! I did add some fresh cilantro though, to spruce it up. Was delicious and fresh tasting with chips and all the ladies were asking what my secret recipe was. Great product.
