This review covers the two chicken flavors offered here as well as four fish flavors in the variety pack offered elsewhere on this site.  My three cats loved all four fish flavors and the Chicken Pot Pie but only the one who eats anything would eat the Sesame Chicken. Fortunately Chicken Pot Pie is available separately.          Because of concerns about the controversial ingredient menadione sodium bisulfite raised in Joe McBu's review of the fish flavors, I'm  somewhat wary of  this product.  A Google check of "menadione sodium sulfite in pet food" shows  there's quite a bit of concern in the blogosphere  and it centers on two factors 1. This ingredient is a cheap and not very effective source of Vitamin K that has not been tested for safety in pets.  2. The FDA  bans it for human consumption due to its associations with kidney liver damage.  So the question then becomes: might it not also be a factor in why kidney disease is such a common pet killer, especially senior pets (which mine are)?  Consumer concerns seem to be having some impact, as many manufacturers are discontinuing using it. An email questioning its use sent to the Petite Cuisine site over a week ago has not been answered.          After losing  a cat to the poisoned Chinese wheat gluten in '07, I switched to Fancy Feast grilled flavors,  the only wet food that was both free from wheat gluten and considered edible by my fussiest cat when laced with his evening meds.  Petite Cuisine is a huge hit with Fitz, probably because it's  even more liquidy than grilled Fancy Feast, which I've just learned also contains menadione.          So, what to do?  At the moment I'm dividing one can of Petite Cuisine among the three cats for the evening meal when Fitz gets his meds, supplemented with California Natural or Paul Newman Senior dry food, neither of which contain menadione. Mornings I use wet Wellness (which is much less popular at my house, but menadione free) instead of Petite Cuisine or Fancy Feast.  For treats, Greenies have been eliminated in favor of  Whole Life Chicken Treats.          Meanwhile, I recommend you read Joe McBu's review on the fish pack page.
