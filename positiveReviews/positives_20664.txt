I got into mint tea when I first started drinking tea and didn't really like black or green teas.  I started with other  ands like Celestial Seasonings and Stash and tried Numi mint tea with a coupon once.  The difference is strong and Numi mint tea has deeper, more intense flavor.  At the time of purchase, they were on manager's special and were cheaper than the grocery store price after coupons.
