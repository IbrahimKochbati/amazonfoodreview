I love pork noodles at the Chinese restaurant, now they are getting hard to find on the menu.  I was having a cup of noodles on rare occasion to satisfy my noodle urges, they are not too satisfying.  Just tried a bowl of the Nong Shim Spicy Chicken, must say they are a major improvement over the ones that I have previously bought.  These actually have flavor and are quite satisfying.  The serving size is generous and is plenty for a quick lunch.  At about a dollar a bowl, a very reasonable meal.  Compared to the ones that I have had in a restaurant, fresh would naturally be my preference.  I can say that I do like these and I will purchase more.  Great item to have in reserve for lunch at work and when you just don't feel like cooking.
