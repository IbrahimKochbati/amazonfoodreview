These are quite different from the C Howard's violet mints I've eaten before, in many ways.  The taste was subtler and sweeter, and the candy itself was letter made, as to be expected from a product like this.  For those of you that don't know how these are made, they are Anise seeds(delicious seeds, somewhat similar to fennel) rolled in sugar and violet extract to create a pearl like ball of sugar with anise flavor at its center.  Takes some getting used to, having an actual seed in the middle of a candy.  The main complaint I have with these is the aftertaste   the C Howards violet mints may have tasted slightly soapy and perfumey, but they leave you with a wonderful aftertaste that sweetens the  eath for a while after.  These left me with the slightly unpleasant feeling that I had just eaten a flower, stem and all.  Still, they have a delicious, very purple taste.  Also, shipping was excellent, they came 2 days before the stated arrival time and were packaged well.  The tin they come in is also quite nice.
