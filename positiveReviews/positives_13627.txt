Some of the best dried apples I've had. I like the light cinnamon, and they're not too dry like most of them. Slightly sweet and not sour at all.          Packaging is good and I love the organic products! Newman's Own is a superior  and.          It's hard to find all of the  ands items in the shops, so Amazon is a great place to buy these, especially in bulk w  free shipping.
