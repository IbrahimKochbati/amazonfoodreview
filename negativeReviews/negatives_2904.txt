Kamfen Noodle King  Beef flavored soup. This noodle soup comes in a carton waxed paper bowl. Included are noodles, and three flavor packets. You add boiling water after you add the packets of dehydrated vegetables, spices, and a paste of some sort.       The noodles were starchy, and there was little or no vegetable flavor. The beef taste was probaly beef bullion cubes. All in all, a soup with very little flavor and my guess, high in sodium.       There are much, much better ramen noodle soups available. You can cross this one off your list.
