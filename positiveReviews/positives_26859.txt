This is absolutely the best chai tea I have ever  ewed, and I've tried well over 20 different blends from many different tea purveyors! The spices are very rich and mixed with a nice blend of green and black tea for a wonderful robust yet clean taste. I typically prefer the bolder flavor of black tea, but have found most black chai teas too bitter to drink without some sweetener. This blend is delicious as is without any sweetener, hot or cold. My search for the perfect chai tea has ended    thanks for a wonderful product!
