I bought a Bigelow "sampler" type box of decaffeinated teas, and fell in love with this French Vanilla Tea. I couldn't find a box of just this flavor in any local stores, so was delighted to be able to order it from Amazon. It's just wonderful tea; I love it! I think you will, too, if you like French Vanilla flavored coffees etc.
