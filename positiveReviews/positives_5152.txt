I enjoyed this drink.  It has a tangy citrus flavor which tasted a little less orangy than I expected, but was still good.  I liked the carbonation in the juice   it was about the right amount for me.  The drink has about the same calories as a regular soda, but I feel better about drinking it because of the natural ingredients.  The drink does not have the syrupy feel of a traditional orange soda which is a bonus.  This is definitely a lighter tasting, very refreshing drink.  The only reason for reducing the star value by one was because of the price which is a bit extravagant for me.  I recommend this drink.
