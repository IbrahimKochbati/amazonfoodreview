when I opened this, I thought no way my little Lhasa Apso is going to be able to play with this.  So wrong.  I stated with some yellow cups upside down (easier for her to grip them) with a few right side up.  She figured it all out very quickly.  It's lots of fun to watch her get the big yellow cups in her small grip, place them carefully all in one spot.  After a few times, she was able to grab all the cups placed in the red container the proper way.  She loves finding treats!
