The sauce was just fine. However, I can't resist flagging a particular piece of idiocy, in the hope that someone might be able to convince Amazon next time. The sauce comes in a pack of 2, but one bottle was  oken. Yep, you guessed it, Amazon sent me a new pack of two, and asked me to return the un oken original. It's only cost me a little time, but how much it's going to cost Amazon to ship and process that returned bottle, your guess is as good as mine. Is it REALLY beyond the bounds of possibility for someone to have split a pack and just sent me the one replacement bottle?
