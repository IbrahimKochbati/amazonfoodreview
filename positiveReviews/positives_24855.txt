I read many reviews of this drink, and the same people said the same thing...that the drink burns their throats.  That is exactly the intention of the company, to "imitate" the affects of actual Cocaine.  To cause a throat burning sensation while it gives you an intense, euphoric energy high with no crash.  Its quite a gimmick, I admit and I searched relentlessly to find a can just based on that.  Well, was I impressed when I tried it?          To date, I have ordered 4 24 packs of this from the site.  I just ordered a 24 pack 2 days ago, so what does that tell you?  I have found a few loose cans in flea markets and instantly jumped on them.  So how would I describe the product personally?  Apart from the throat burning sensation which indeed takes some getting used to.  The flavor is unique, unlike any energy drink on the market today.  It has a slight cherry taste, mixed in with hot cinnamon and a hint of bubble gum sweetness.  The cinnamon flavor is dominant and most recognizable out of all the flavors.  If you can drink this down without pausing, you have a powerful throat because I still can't do it.  Just make sure you drink this served chilled, because drinking it warm would be kind of gross.          Now for the energy buzz.  What a buzz it is, too.  I have drank hundreds of energy drinks and I usually don't go a day without an energy drink.  I have a high tolerance.  5 hour energy does nothing for me, I fell asleep twice after taking them.  Redline Xtreme barely does anything at all.  The first Cocaine I ever drank, I was seriously buzzed.  My body was shaking and I had a numb, tingly sensation, but it felt amazing.  I didn't have a ridiculous jittery energy high, but a focused high where I felt I could focus on video games for the rest of the night or write a long essay.  I didn't get the bouncy knee, it was mostly all mental energy, which is what an energy drink should supply you with.  I am definitely sticking with this drink as my energy drink of choice.  Whenever I have insomnia and have to wake up early to go somewhere, I drink one.  When I have a long day of walking, whether it be out shopping, to a mall, or flea market... I  ing one with me and slam it down.  It is the perfect "get out and do stuff" drink and perfect for your hardcore gamer, such as myself.          So stop the whining about a burning throat sensation, realize that is the intention of the company and order yours today.
