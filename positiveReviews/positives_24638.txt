We were so thrilled to be able to order canned pumpkin online! You cannot find this product in any stores where we live! The vet wants us to add a tablespoon of pumpkin to our dogs food once or twice a day and we have been so frustrated that there is a shortage and we are not able to purchase it. We've ordered this a few times now and will continue to do so.
