I first bought this  and of walnuts at my local store and loved them. They were fresh, crispy and had a hint of spice on them taht made them a tastey snack. I am trying to reduce my cholesterol and walnuts have the correct oils that help with this. So I bought a couple cases of these from Amazon. The nuts I recieved are just as fresh and crispy, but the spices on these containers for some reason are almost overwhelming. There are many nuts in the package that are caked with the mix of garlic, onion paprika, etc..., so much to the point that I have now taken to rinsing them off. This makes them a big soggy.., None the less, they are still a good value compared to the store prices, and you can rinse them , use them in recipes and they take just fine. Wish that they weren't so overpowering, so that I could snack on them right out of the container.
