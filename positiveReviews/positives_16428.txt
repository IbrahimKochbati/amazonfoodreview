Been using Greenies for a couple months.  I have a toy poodle with a sensitive stomach.  So far, no issue for her.          And it is sooo nice, no more doggie  eath for her.  I highly recommend the treat as long as your dog can tolerate.  Seems like it has helped with the tartar too which is what motivated me for the purchase.          Thanks Greenies!!! : )
