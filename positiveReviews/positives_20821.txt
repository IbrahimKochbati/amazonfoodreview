When Jack Link's named their super sized beef stick Hot & Spicy, they weren't kidding!  I was initially leery about buying this product, as I have found Jack Links jerky to be mediocre at best, but these sticks are delicious.  Soft and chewy, with a succulent mouthfeel, and big enough to really be satisfying.  Oh yeah, and they're hot!  Spicy hot to the point where a lot of people I know can only manage a bite or two, and then have to put the stick down for a few minutes to recover.  They always pick it back up again, though.  In fact, I have a stash of them in my office, and I have to smuggle them into work, because all of my co workers hound me for them as soon as they know that I've re stocked.  Kudos to Jack Links for a great snack!
