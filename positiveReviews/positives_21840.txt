The whole family loves this fajita marinade. Friends request it. The granddaughter forewarned her husband that he would be eating steak like he had never before tasted. Just put some Fabulosa on the steak, add garlic, McCormicks Montreal Steak seasoning and lemon pepper. Let the meat marinate for about 30 minutes before grilling.          The marinade is made in Mesa, Texas, and we go to a great deal of trouble to find sources for it. I've even carried it to South Africa to help in the preparation of Mexican meals. Treat your fajita chicken with Fabulosa before you grill it. Yum.
