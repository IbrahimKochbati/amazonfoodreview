tasted like plastic. The texture is so strange you question if it is ment to be eaten while you eat it. instructions are in japanese not english. kinda hard to fallow. I paid 11 bucks for it but there are other sites that sell it for 5..shoulda bought it somplace els.. I don't feel i got my monies worth
