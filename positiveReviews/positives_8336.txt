I make my loose tea in a coffeemaker that has never been used for coffee, and I use unbleached filters to hold the tea.  The tea is fresh and so flavorful you wont believe it.  There is no dust in this tea as in teabags, just real tea.  I dont understand why loose tea isn't available everywhere, but I am glad to have found this source for it.  The price is very reasonable, especially when compared to other loose teas.  Do a Google search for loose tea and you will found out for yourself.
