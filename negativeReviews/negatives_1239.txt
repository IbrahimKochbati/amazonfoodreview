We ordered the Earth's best 2nd dinner variety pack along with the fruit variety pack.  We got the fruit variety pack and an oatmeal and fruit variety pack, not the dinner pack.  Found out we can't return the item, either.  We will try the Amazon phone help, but if all else fails maybe my little one will like this stuff...
