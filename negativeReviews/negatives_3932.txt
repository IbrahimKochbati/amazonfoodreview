I was completely put off by SWITCH KIWI BERRY. Another entry into the already boring sparkling juice market, this flavor not only lacked anything new or interesting, but went a step further in its poor flavor.          I didn't really taste kiwi, and the "berry" was bland and unidentifiable (raspberry and strawberry, according to the ingredients list); it was, like most of these juices on the market, mostly apple and grape and not much in the way of uniqueness. In fact, the can I tried actually had a metallic flavor to it  I don't know if it was actually picking up the tang from the container, or if it's just the poor flavor profile of the beverage. I really don't care enough to try it again to find out.          Also, I don't know why they're calling this line SWITCH. It's probably a marketing thing  they want people to "switch" from IZZE or whatever they currently drink. I won't be switching anytime soon, at least not for this boring, low quality drink.
