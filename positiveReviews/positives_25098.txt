purchased a but load of these, 5 packs to be exact! and we put them all over our beehive cake to decorate for our bbshower.  They not only looked great.. everybody loved getting one and crunching the sugar and getting a sugar rush.. all from that little sugar bee. I especially liked that they came in both directions.. They were exactly what I envisioned when I purchsed them.
