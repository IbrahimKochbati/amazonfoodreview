Our Airedale Violet liked the idea at first. I sat on the floor with her and introduced her to the ins and outs of it. She just couldn't coordinate holding the jug in the correct position while jiggling the rope. She wound up frustrated, barking at the treats which she could clearly see... "they're right there in the bleepin' jug". She spent some time trying to figure out how to open the bottom of the jug. I guess she thought she had a better chance of getting the bottom unscrewed than getting the treats out by holding it at just the right angle with her paw while tugging on the rope. Sorry Vi
