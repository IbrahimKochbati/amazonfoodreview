I love these, but Amazon sent me the wrong flavors.  Received the box today, opened it, and they sent an assorted box instead of the salt & vinegar only.  Went on to my account at amazon.com to let them know and Amazon said I "could not take any action" because I "hadn't received the shipment yet."  Then what is this box in front of me?????  Anyway, I need the chips for a party in two days, so guess I am stuck with the assorted box.  5 stars for the salt & b vinegar chips, but 1 star to amazon for the screw up.
