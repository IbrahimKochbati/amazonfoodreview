Be warned, the BBQ flavor is terribly addicting. In fact, I'm eating some right now. Local prices hovered around $4.50 a bag (!!!!!) so I ordered them off Amazon for a great price. If only Amazon would ship them one by one a few days apart so I won't eat 4 bags in one sitting.... ;] Go ahead and try them, you won't regret it.
