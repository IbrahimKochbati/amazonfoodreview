My plant arrived quickly and packaged very well. Almost too well cause I was so anxious to see it and it took a bit of time to unwrap it:) The first day it didn't want to eat because of the stress from shipping, but now it's eating the bugs I give it. Everybody is so intriuged with it and we all love it!!
