I'm really not a chili connoisseur, in fact, I don't really like chili that much.  But one cold day, I was wondering through the grocery while craving something different, so I grabbed a bag.  Like most reviewers here, I thought I'd add a few ingredients.  A can of spicy rotel, some seasoned ground chuck, a little onion.  Other than that, I followed the directions and added a couple extra cups of water (I like my chili a little soupy, probably not recommended for most).  Wow!  I was floored.  My son was ready to report me to child services for making him eat chili, but one taste and he was just as impressed as I was and didn't even complain when we hit the left overs the next day.  Bear Creek did a really nice job on this one, I'll have to try their others.
