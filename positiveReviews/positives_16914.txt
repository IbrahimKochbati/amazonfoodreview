Jack, our 3 year old La aDoodle (I refer to him as a "La aDingo" sometimes because he's so nutsy) really enjoyed this Jug    our second one lasted 7 months of heavy use before the rubberized rope  oke.  (Another reviewer suggested inserting a tennis ball into the now ropeless jug in order to salvage it; I'll try that, but am not enamored with the idea of mixing a tennis ball with edible things).  It seems to be his favorite toy    a good balance of enticement, challenge and reward.          PRO:     Keeps our dog engaged.     Good price ($10 currently)          CON:     It can be loud rolling around and crashing into things.     Hard plastic should be washed before use; unknown chemical safety.     Limited durability, but fine for the price.          Net: I'm ordering our third!
