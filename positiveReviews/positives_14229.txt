It's a bar of curry sauce mix   not just a spice, a full sauce mix that when mixed with water will thicken up into a yummy curry sauce. It's so easy to use. High sodium content though, but it tastes really good. I thought the flavor of the S&B Mild was a little sweetish, I liked the Vermont Mild flavor a bit better.
