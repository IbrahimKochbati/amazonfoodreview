I purchased these with high hopes because I do not seem to have enough time to eat a great  eakfast, but I thought this would provide sustenance 'til lunchtime; however, I was disappointed after a few bites. While the cookie is wholesome and filling, it does have a slight aftertaste.  To me it seemed like "something" was missing...not sure what, since there are many good ingredients, but I think I would have enjoyed apple cinnamon much better.          Also, I also found it disturbing that even though my cookies were not frozen (probably should have done this since they are a moist cookie) and not yet expired (January 2011), they were stored on the pantry shelf, as they are individually wrapped...but they became moldy. Yep. I just threw away three cookies because I could see mold through the package (opened one to confirm it). Yuck.
