Finally found this item and was very excited to buy because of its low price and because I have messy kitties. Was happy about the fast shipping but was not happy that I recieved a blue mat when I wanted the silver one pictured. Also it was mailed rolled even though the package it was sent in was large enough to lay it flat. Now it has a kink in it. Overall, I like this product because it does elminate some of the mess the cats track out of the litter box. However, now my kitten, who doesn't want to step on it for whatever reason, just jumps over it when exiting the box. And leaving more litter sprayed over the floor. lol Kittens......
