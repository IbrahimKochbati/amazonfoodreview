These are healthy for your dog and based on mine's reaction they appearl to the dog pallett (I can't speak from personal experience here).  The ingredients are things you want in your pet's diet.  My dog's not fussy, but he won't eat anything offered to him, however he seemed to really like these.  He even opted for this over another dry biscuit treat that was offeredat one point. The treats are east to  eak into smaller pieces if you want to give your dog a bit a smaller portion than the whole.  They're also crunchy enough to be good for teeth and gums.  The price was reasonable given the ingredients and overall, this is a good, reasonably priced option for your pet.
