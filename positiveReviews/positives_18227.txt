Wow, these are really good!  At first, I didn't understand "Popchips", and I was actually expecting something like regular fried potato chips, only made from sweet potatos.  The Popchips are very different from that!          These contain rice flour as well as sweet potatos, and they are kind of air popped, very light like popcorn.  Texture wise, they remind me of "Munchos" only lighter and without the oily feel and taste.  Remember Munchos?  These are WAY better.          Next thing   the flavor from the sweet potatos is YUMMY!  I know when I first read "rice flour" in the ingredients, I was thinking those cardboard like rice cakes.  The sweet potato completely takes away any blandness or boringness and adds good taste.  And there is just a touch of salt   just enough to  ing out the YUM without overdoing it.          Finally, the package size.  When I saw "0.8 ounce", I expected that I would want two, three, or even four bags of these at a time.  Nope   one bag is a good snack!  Not that 0.8 is a big bag, or "filling" or anything like that, but the bag is just the right size, which is a very pleasant surpise to me!  I finish the last chips, like the last of the salt from my fingers, and I feel satisfied   like, wow, that was tasty and just right!  At Amazon's prices, I believe I will be buying these regularly!
