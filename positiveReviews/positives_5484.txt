For any Tea lover, (we became fans in England) Ahmad Tea pleases immensely. I we have sampled tea from quite a few vendors but after our son  ought a pack of Ahmad Tea back with him (from Jolly Old..) as a gift, we were sold. We found the flavor splendid. We loved it. It is fully flavored and needs NO sugar milk sweetener at all. (And I usually needed sweeteners with the other  ands of Earl Grey, so...)     Buying it from Amazon is a very economical solution and delivery was expediant. I HIGHLY recommend, if you enjoy hot tea, try this  and!     MAC,     Please excuse any spelling errors, that may have occurred in my haste, and NO spell check help. Heheheh. Ta ta. "Earl Grey..hot". JLP
