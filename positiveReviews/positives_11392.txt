I really like this tea. My doc told me to up Green Tea consumption for the theanine benefits, but honestly, most green teas taste nasty to me. So far this one, and Celestial Seasonings Raspberry are the only two I can stand. I have tried Zhena's green teas, and other  ands, but I like this one best. I add a teensy bit (1 4 teaspoon) of Organic Agave for sweetening, and I'm good to go. The bags are elegant, and I love the orange aroma of this tea. I also enjoy Two Buds Earl Grey and their Assam (with almond milk, yum). I wish that other reviewer who disliked this flavor would send me his her box of 100! I'll drink it. Maybe if you're a purist Green Tea person, this one is too flavored; but like I said, my uneducated palate loves it.
