Christmas Eve tea (which does not actually contain tea) is not just for Christmas Eve. (Although if you are frazzled, it does releave the stress.) Christmas Eve is good any time. I do not know anyone who doesn't like it, and have often given it as gifts. It is especially nice in the winter when mint teas are a little too  isk and do not produce the same level of cozy comfort as Christmas Eve which is a soothing combination of spices and mint. It is almost as comforting as a cup of warm milk, but without the calories.
