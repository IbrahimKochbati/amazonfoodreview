It's absolutely amazing how adding a simple dab of sugar can make a cupcake pop! The thing about this product is its vi ance, which quite frankly makes the grocery store  and seem dull. It's as if they infused in granule with as much Red 5 that they could pack in. Mind you sugar and artificial coloring aren't the best things for you, but they make for fun times with food. Would I recommend you to buy it, sure would. After all what do you have to lose, the bottle is cheaper then your store  and and with amazon prime there's no trip to be made to the store.
