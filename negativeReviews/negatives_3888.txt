I've tried a few different flavors of Switch and this is my least favorite. (My favorite is the cherry.) Unfortunately because I didn't enjoy this flavor I didn't find it as refreshing as the others.          I quickly handed it over to my son who does like kiwi berry flavors and he did like it a lot. Of course, since it contains enough vitamin C for a whole day, I felt just fine giving it to my child, too. No preservatives, no added sugar. I like the carbonated soda product a lot, just not this flavor.          However, the biggest flaw with this product is that it's too expensive in my opinion for the little cans you get. Rounds out to about $1 per can. Less than you pay often with a vending machine but twice what you pay for a flavored water or vitamin C juice pouch when you buy them in larger quantity. Not worth it. :(
