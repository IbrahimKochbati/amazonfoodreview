I've been using Nantucket Offshore Turkey Rub for about 8 years... maybe longer.  I always get tremendous raves at the table, so  much so, that after numerous requests and years of begging ... what is the secret ... I had to let my friends and family know.     Now I have received so many thank you's, not only from my friends and family, but also by their children, their family and friends too.     Everyone I have told about this product are so thankful and tell me how easy it was for them to use it and how delicious everything is.     I've also told them that I use it in my stuffing dressing, gravy sauce, my turkey soup etc.  Also, I works great with chicken and duck.  This is one of the best, most used product in my kitchen... I use about 2 3 tins of Nantucket Offshore Turkey Rub, per year and so do my friends.     One of my friends just moved to PA, so I ordered a couple of tins and sent it to her and she called me and said, "You saved our Thanksgiving!..."
