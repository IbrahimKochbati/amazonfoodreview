Great for any kind of stuff toy.  Put your toy in the freezer after you've stuffed it to make it a little trickier for your dog to empty it.     I don't know that I'd use it with an overweight dog  lots of calories.  There is a reduced calorie version for Senior dogs, but it's not always to easy to find.     Look around and you will be able to find the regular flavors in bulk for a much better price.
