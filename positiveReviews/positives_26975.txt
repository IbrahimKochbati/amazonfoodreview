Seriously delicious. Not sure where the bad reviews are coming from but this stuff is one of the better tasting jerkys I have ever had. The balance of the spice and sweetness is spot on. It seemed rather fresh. This stuff is just plain good. My only complaint is that it wasn't in bigger pieces and that I wish it didn't have so many scrap small pieces. Not enough to deduct stars because the taste is there.
