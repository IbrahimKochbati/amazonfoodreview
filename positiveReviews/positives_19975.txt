Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet, savory and spicy   everything you'd want in a good meal or better yet...a potato chip.  Since these are kettle cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over  owned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without  eaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard.
