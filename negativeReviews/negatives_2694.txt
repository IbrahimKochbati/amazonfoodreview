When I bought these mushrooms before, they were clearly labled "from Italy". This time, the origin is not mentioned on the bag, and when I checked their website, I see they've written a bunch of malarky about how porcinis'taste the same wherever they're from, even from North America or China. That is just not true. Porcini from Europe taste better: the terroir changes the mushroom's flavor considerably, just as it changes the flavor of grapes made into wine. Since JR Mushrooms refuses to reveal their country of origin, I must assume they are selling cheaper, possibly contaminated mushrooms from China in order to make a bigger profit. Beware! Buy another  and.
