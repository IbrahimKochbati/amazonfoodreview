I have been looking for the perfect cup of coffee and i think i found the closest thing to it. So Far i have tried Timothys kona and italian, all of the green mountain  ews, coffee people, and gloria jeans. I think i am settled on the caribou med roast, it is not acidy, it packs a nice caffeine punch and has a good coffee flavor. You will not be dissapointed with this coffee.
