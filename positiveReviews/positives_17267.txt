On a whim, I bought an 8oz pkg of Diamond Glazed Walnuts on my last grocery shopping trip. These are very good. They're slightly sweet with a chewy crunch. My husband & I like eating them, as is, for a snack.  We also add them to Activia Vanilla yogurt along with some fruit. (Activia vanilla is the best tasting vanilla yogurt we've ever had). These walnuts would be good in an apple salad, too, or used as an ice cream topper, added to oatmeal, some cookie recipes or be used as a garnish.
