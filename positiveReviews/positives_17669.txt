I'm NOT a coffee drinker. I have too much of a sweet tooth to tolerate the taste of coffee. This product will not change that.          However, my coffee drinking spouse with acid reflux liked this coffee, and was able to drink a second cup because the acidity was lower, and bothered his stomach less.  He normally can only have one cup of coffee in the morning, because his stomach doesn't feel well enough for a second cup.          This coffee allows him to enjoy more coffee without suffering the sour stomach.  Does it still taste like coffee, complete with bitter aftertaste? Yes.
