This is the only K Cup my mother will drink. Her actual home  ewer preference is Folgers 100% Columbian medium dark roast from the can. They don't use that actual blend in K Cups. My mother has Neuropathy, her fingers are becoming numb and nerves have a stinging sensation. Keurig is her easiest way to make a cup of coffee without going through all the stages to make a home  ewed batch.          SamsClub.com pricing as of this review...     Newman's Special Blend EXTRA BOLD Keurig K Cups 80 ct.     $36.88 box     $5.94 shipping (Go to the club to save on shipping)          I bought three boxes.          If you don't have a Sam's Club account, you can still buy but add 10% premium to cost of product.
