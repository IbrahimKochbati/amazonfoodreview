I agree with the other reviewers    it's a great beverage for the kind of congestion you get with a cold, and that's why I started drinking it. But now I've gotten so addicted to it that it's the first thing I reach for when I want something hot. And it's great for those of us with acidic stomachs who are not supposed to have black tea or mint (there is a little mint in this, but only enough to give you a hint of the flavor). And the licorice is mild enough not to taste very much like licorice and just makes it sweet enough not to need sugar. Perfect in every way.
