I have been a fan of Peet's coffee for nearly 30 years, starting from when I was a student at UC Berkeley. Peet's had a few cafe's in Berkeley, roasting their coffee on the premises. People standing in line always got a small cup of complimentary coffee,  ewed super strong and served hot and black, not for the faint of heart. Major Dickason's blend has long been my favorite   strong, rich, smooth. When my  other moved to Seattle he was ecstatic that he had found a local cafe that was almost as good as Peet's. The name of the cafe was Starbuck's. Some years later Starbuck's and Peet's joined forces, but eventually Starbuck's expanded internationally and Peet's chose to stay local. Peet's wanted to keep its coffee pure (not mixed with syrups and whipped cream) and didn't want to compromise its quality by expanding too quickly. I am so thankful that Peet's chose to stay true to what excellent coffee is really about, and since I moved away from Berkeley I am thankful that logistics have improved, and I can get fresh Peet's shipped to me (even now that I am living overseas).          While I could go on and on about Peet's, which I love passionately, it is not a coffee for everyone. It is much stronger and richer than most, and some people whom I have served it to have found it to be too strong (I guess I could have  ewed it with less coffee grounds or mixed some hot water in at the end, but it didn't occur to me at the time). But if you really love coffee, and you want something much much much better than Starbuck's, then you might really like Peet's.
