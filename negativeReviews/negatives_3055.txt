These reviews are all from sometime ago, and perhaps what was said was true at that time. But let me warn anyone looking for some good Rwandan coffee right now, do not waste your money. I have tasted true good Rwandan coffee, which is very similar to Kenyan coffee. Most African coffees taste naturally citrus sweet. I don't know what was in the bag I got. The aroma was terrible (like the beans had partially absorbed some odd flavor from something else) and it tasted just the same. I had to toss the 3 pound bag.
