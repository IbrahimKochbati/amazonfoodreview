The ingredients say Green Tea Matcha powder.  There is no mention of sugar in the contents.  This is a product that contains sugar.  NOT GOOD FOR DIABETICS or people who can not have sugar.  Also the color is not  ight green but more of an olive tan color.  This product description is very misleading.  I will return to the 100% organic Green Tea Matcha powder from Eden Foods which I have purchased in the past and was extremely happy. BUYERS BEWARE!
