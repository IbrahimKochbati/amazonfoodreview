Maybe I'm asking too much   but I am trying to find a nondairy organic protein powder that would replace the whey protein I'm using in my morning shakes. Thought I'd give it a try   my normal shake has the protein powder shake mix, as well as kale and blueberries, and I usually love it    with the nutiva hemp shake mix, it was in edible   adding banana didn't help much   bad with a really wicked aftertaste. I may be expecting too much, but I'm going to keep looking!!!!!!
