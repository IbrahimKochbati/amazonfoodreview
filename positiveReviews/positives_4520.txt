I love Big Train! There is a local shop that sales Big Train Products.  After spending $20 a week on the stuff, I decided that I wanted to make it at my house sometimes to save a little money. The individual bags are the exact bags that the local shop uses.  I do prefer the consistency of the product when made by the shop, I think that has to do with my blender's age.  Overall, this product is super yummy!
