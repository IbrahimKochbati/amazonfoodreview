We really enjoyed this mustard. I have been searching for a mild honey mustard and finally found it on Amazon after many searches. The one I got from Emeril's  was just too hot and spicy for us. This one is delicious. Keep stccking this  anc Amazon. The rest of the choices look too spicy and or hot in comparison to this one.
