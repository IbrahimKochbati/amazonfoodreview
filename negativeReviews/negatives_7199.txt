This almond butter is very tasty and spreads well.  But I ordered it because it says it's CRUNCHY, and it is NOT crunchy!  There might be one or two almond pieces in each cup  a far cry from crunchy, in my book.  If you're looking for a delicious smooth, CREAMY almond butter, this would definitely qualify.  But I'm going to continue my search for a CRUNCHY almond butter!
