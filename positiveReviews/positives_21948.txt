This product is great!  I was skeptical because I had never tried anything similar but I am sold on it now.  I recently went on a flourless diet and thought I was done with pasta for life but when someone recommended I try your product I decided to give it a try and I am so glad I did.  I bought the Tinkyada Brown Rice Fusilli packages and have shared with friends.  I am anxious to try more varieties and make some old familiar recipes with a pasta that works on my particular diet plan.  I used the quick and easy cooking method and it worked perfectly.
