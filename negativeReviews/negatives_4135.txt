At first it is not so hot but.... it grows on you.  I added a very tiny amount of honey in warm water to mix, dash of salt too.  like it so much I made up the entire jar like that and kept it ready in refrig .  I put it on apple slices as a pm snack or mid morning  eak.  Spreads nicely on an apple, unlike real PB.  Love not getting all those calories.
