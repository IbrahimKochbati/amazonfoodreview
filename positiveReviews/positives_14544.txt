I was not satisfied AT FIRST with this product.  After posting a less than glowing review, I was immediately contacted by the seller (distributor).  They graciously sent a new "fresher" bag of coffee.  This is much closer to what I remember.  Try with sweetened condensed milk as suggested, it is served that way in Jamaica.  Now if I only had some coco  ead to go with it.          Thank you for the prompt, courteous service.
