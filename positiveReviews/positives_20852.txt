We love soyrizo but Hannaford Brothers (in the Northeast) are no longer carrying it.  I called the whole foods store and they don't carry it either.  What's up with that?? The price of the soyrizo and shipping charges on amazon are prohibitive.  We are so very disappointed to not have access to this product anymore!!
