When I give her one of these treats, my dog snatches it, runs off, greedily wolfs it down, then spends 5 minutes going back over the place where she ate it, trying to hoover up the crumbs.  I don't think you can ask for much more than that from a dog treat.  They are pretty hard and a pretty good size, so the dog seems to have a little trouble getting it  oken down (she's a relatively small beagle).  Really small dogs might need these  oken up a bit.  I don't think it's a problem that they take a while for the dog to consume, since that means she eats it a bit slower and it's longer before she comes back to me begging for some more.
