I have tried several of the K cups and none of them have the taste that Folgers has. They are either too strong, too bitter or just have a funny taste. Not that they all taste bad, just not what I have been looking for. I just want some good old fashion American tasting coffee and this is it. If you want coffee that is comparable to MacDonald coffee this is the closest I have found in the K cup.
