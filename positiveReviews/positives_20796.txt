I chew this gum all the time, I love getting a this amount (240 pieces total) and having plenty around. I usually keep one pack in my bedroom and another in my car. I also love the Polar Ice, it's a strong mint flavor that I definitely prefer. I wish Amazon would add this to the "Subscribe & Save" list.
