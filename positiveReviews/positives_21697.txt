We used to buy Jack Link's Beef sticks from stores at a cost of 2 $1.00.... since I found where to order them online, I now pay about 33cents each!  What a savings!  And, Amazon saves my info so when I need to order more, it's right there and easy to order.  Now, if I can just keep the rest of the family away from them, the 72 stick order might last more than 10 days!
