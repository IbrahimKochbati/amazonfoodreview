Let me preface this by saying that I dont even like hot sauce but after marrying a mexican woman and meeting friends who like spicy food I had to try a few things...I first bought some of Dave's insanity sauces, the ghost pepper and the "hottest sauce in the universe" and when I first tried them I did not think it would be possible to try anything worse, then I found this bottle of terror...Let me tell you, those sauces taste like kethcup compared to this, i put about half the amount on those sauces than I did with this sauce and it was so hot, after about 5 minutes I ended up throwing up lol!!  I would not recommend under any circumstances to try it straight out of the bottle, I dont think there is a human being alive that could handle it but if you have a friend who thinks they can handle anything, they will meet their match with this sauce I can guarantee that.
