I have two cats. My big boy has eaten these and never had a problem...as a matter of fact he has never vomited or had a hair ball since I adopted him at 2 months. My girl cat throws up every time she eats this particular flavor. Since I treat them equally these are no longer purchased. I hate to see my girl sick so I just recommend you watch your cats after you give them these treats. If not a problem...carry on.
