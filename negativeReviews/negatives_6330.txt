These sellers do not want to give me my money back i purchased this item and it said pack of 4 accross the top of the box with an arrow and in the description. The cakes are great but i ended up spending a total about 40 dollars for this thing. I a purchased them for about 4 dollars at big lots a few years ago. I'm working on getting my money back but i suggest you be aware of what you are ordering. It isn't a pack of 4 it only 1.
