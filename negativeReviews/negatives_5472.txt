I normally drink Foldger's (sp) coffee and not much of that.  My regular coffee is definately strong in the acid department, at least for me.          This coffee has no acid as far as I am concerned.  It had no acid aftertaste and did not impact my stomach at all.  As far as the taste I liked it less than my normal coffee.  It is stronger than Foldger's  (sp).  I would have given the coffee another star but my wife couldn't stand the taste so I figured it had to come down at least one star because of her complete disapproval.          So I give this coffee 3 stars overall and 5 stars for lack of acid problems.          AD2
