I first tasted the donut house coffee's while waiting for an MRI. I am not a coffee drinker, at least I wasn't at that time. I made a cup of the donut house cinnamon roll flavor coffee. I didn't plan on drinking the coffee... I just wanted to try out the coffee maker. To my surprise the coffee was delicious. I came home and kept thinking about that cup of coffee. 3 months later I bought a Keurig coffee maker. I'm a little sensitive to caffeine so I decided to try the donut house decaf coffee. The donut house cinnamon roll used to be my favorite flavor coffee, well now the donut house decaf runs a close 2nd. I live in Michigan and on many cold nights I'll make a cup of the donut house decaf coffee before I go to bed.
