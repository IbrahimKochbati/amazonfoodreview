I recently cut sugar and flour from my diet.  To be specific 23 days ago (woo hoo!) I cut sugar and flour.  Because I still do have a "sweet tooth" and can't have the real stuff my researching  ain went to work.  Voila   I found this product!  Low calorie, carb and with stevia instead of the aspartame crap this stuff is great.  I have tried it warm with a little sugar free creamer and it's a delicious filling hot cocoa.  I do want to try the blended version   I don't usually drink cold beverages as I like warm but I will try it. I am curious how it may be as a pudding as well   added with milk.  All in all I am enjoying it.  Try it out!
