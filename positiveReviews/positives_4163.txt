We only use jarred baby food as emergency food.  I make all my little one's food and freeze it or give it fresh.  Yes, full time working mom but really is it that hard to cook, puree and freeze basic foods like carrots that cost $1.27 for 2 pounds?  I taste all the foods that my baby eats and enjoy the Earth's Best line because they taste real.  It's not food that you could add to a baby shower game and go "what in the world was that?"  They use quinoa and kamut flours.  It is excellent all around.          I believe that the apricot puree that other's talked about in the sweet potato and chicken dinner is there to maintain the color of the food.  I make my own sweet potato and chicken dinner for my little one and it turns  own.  My baby doesn't care about the color of the food but I'm sure maybe a mom would freak out if she saw this color in a baby food jar   knowing how vi ant sweet potatoes are.          Half of the jars in my case were popped up.  I wrote amazon and at first they offered me not even the cost of the damaged jars.  I called and they replaced the entire case free of charge.  This had to have happened at the manufacturing plant and didn't occur during shipping but rather was a sealing issue.  I was impressed with the speed and efficiency at which amazon handled this.  Will continue to be a loyal customer because of this.  Customer service goes a long ways!
