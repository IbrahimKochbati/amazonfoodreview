I bought this because I wanted to try the Wild Blueberry and the Hazelnut Dark Roast.  I really liked the Wild Blueberry (which is really yummy!), but this pack doesn't contain the Dark Hazelnut   it's the regular Hazelnut which is ok but a major letdown.  The Caramel Vanilla is really good, so is the French Vanilla.  It would be better if they would replace the French Vanilla with a different sample though, to give a wider variety of samples.
