York peppermint patties are a wonderful candy; refreshing, they clean your  eath up after dinner in all but the most extreme cases.  The mints arrive in a presentation box, a display that many small companies use to distribute the candies while collecting money on the honor system.  For someone like me that (as a kid) wanted a vending machine of his own, this is a cheap and harmless substitute.
