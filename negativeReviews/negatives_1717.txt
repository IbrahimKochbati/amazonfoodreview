Good, easy to use, somewhat hard to get the caps on, but at the end you can easily dispose of these disposable Kups after using.          Good that you can use your own coffee.  Fresh coffees.  I personally like coffees from Spain, Puerto Rico and other countries.          The bad, sometimes is messy.  Coffee grinds seem to leak, creating a slight mess and the need to clean the machine.  This leak is more in the area of the Kups lid and cup.  And some times these grinds even get in your cup of coffee.  Just read other reviews about this.  Not sure if it could be related to how fine are the grinds of coffee.          On the other hand, with disposable Kups you don't need to keep cleaning wire filter baskets.  That's a very plus.          All considered will probably buy again, but wish a better lid cup seal that will not leak.  Hope down the road they will offer improved DisposableKups.
