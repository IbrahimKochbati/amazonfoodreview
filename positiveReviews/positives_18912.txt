I eat this in a bowl like cereal, on yogurt or just by the handful   it is so good and I love that there is REAL fruit in it!  MY GF little girl does the same   she especially loves it in yogurt.  It is a staple in our house, and this price on Amazon is actually quite good compared to what we see it for in the stores here in CT!
