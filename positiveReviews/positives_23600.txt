I have only tasted the chocolate mint and these as far as the honey stinger bars, but these are hands down the winner. I bought them to take on long bike rides but have wound up using them more as mid day snacks at work. They are delicioius, nutritious and give me a little boost. I highly recommend these. I have not really been disppointed by any of the honey stinger products.
