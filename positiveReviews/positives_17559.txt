I guess I expected that there would be some compromise in flavor due to the low acid, but there is none. So for those who need low acid coffee, this is a good choice. I've read some of the other reviews and it seems some like the flavor, some don't. Personally, I like coffee a little on the bitter side. I'm not one of these mocha java with whipped cream type of guys. So keep that in mind. You pretty much need to do your own taste test, but to me it tasted like a good cup of coffee.
