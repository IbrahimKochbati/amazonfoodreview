"YOU MUST TRY THIS!" Peanut butter lover, PB2 (Powdered Peanut butter) is DELICIOUS. Use it on and with every different food you love peanut butter on. The way to use this with food is endless, be creative. Need to limit foods that contain fat? Now you can have your peanut butter and eat it too! My favorite recipe using this is: Peanut Butter Milk Shakes one at a time as follows: 1 and ½ cup of no sugar added vanilla ice cream, ½  1 cup of horizon organic DHA omega organic 3 milk and 1 and ½ tsp. of PB2, blend until smooth and drink with straw.  Very happy I've discovered this product thank you. Definite future purchases."
