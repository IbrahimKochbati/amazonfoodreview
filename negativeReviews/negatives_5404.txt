I was eager to try Puroast Low Acid Coffee, as I've had GERD for quite a long time.  I had to give up regular coffee about 10 years ago, much to my dismay.  The only type of coffee that I've been able to drink is Folger's "Simply Smooth" and it can be difficult to find in my area.  So, I was pleased to see another low acid  ew on the market.  I  ewed a pot, drank one cup and promptly poured the rest of it down the drain.  I gave this product 2 stars because it did not aggravate my stomach in any way, so it did live up to its claim, but, the taste of the coffee was awful.  Since taste is subjective, I hesistate to dissuade others from trying the Puroast, but I have to caution buyers about the taste.  In my former coffee drinking days, I was never picky about  ands, and I find the taste of the Folgers low acid coffee to be almost as good as their regular  and, so again, I would caution coffee lovers that Puroast, while it's definitely easy on the tummy, is not as pleasing on the palate.
