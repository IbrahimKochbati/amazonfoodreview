While I find this dish to be quite tasty, those with Celiac disease should be aware that Tasty Bite dishes are not gluten free.  There is a warning on the label that the product is manufactured in a place where wheat is also manufactured, and there is no sign of an official GF label.  I personally tried the dish and had a reaction.
