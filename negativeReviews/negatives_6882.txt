I purchased one of these packages recently to try out a new  ead maker and I highly regret that I did. 1 & 1 2 pound loaf? Yea right, I followed the instructions to the T and What I got was a 4 5 inch tall ball of baked doughy mess. I would give it 0 stars if I could. I was already skeptical that such a small amount of dry ingredients could make a 1 1 2 pound loaf of  ead and they just proved me right. It was so horrible and inedible that at first I thought the problem might have been my  ead maker. Then I tried the "Light Oat Bread" recipe on allrecipes.com on the same exact setting and what do I get? a PERFECT loaf of  ead with very little more effort time.  Do yourself a favor and buy another  and of  ead mix, or just look up a Bread Machine recipe on one of the several sites on the internet that have them, Buy 10 15 dollars of ingredients (instead of wasting nearly 3 bucks on this crap that gives you an inedible less than half loaf) and that will probably be enough for at least 10 loafs of  ead.
