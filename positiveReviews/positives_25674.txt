Am using the Equal Sweetener Tablets for many years. The tablets are solid, they do not create a mess and they give a consistent amount of sweetening.     Recently this product is Made in Agentina and now the tablets often get jammed in the outlet of the dispenser. Many users complained about this problem but it has not been corrected yet.     I always turn the dispenser upside ddown and back before I squeeze the button ... that seems to clear the passage.     But I still prefer the tablets to the messy small packs.
