This is the fifth different type of coffee I've tried with my Keurig coffee maker. Right now, it is tied with a Newman's Own k cup as my favorite. A couple k cup products seemed fine when I first tasted them, but have come to pale somewhat in comparison with other flavors and makes.          This is a really smooooooooooooooooooth tasting coffee. It does not have a strong taste, but goes down very easily. There is a richness to the taste as well.          Bottom line? I will be purchasing this again when my supply runs out as I continue experimenting with different flavor k cups.
