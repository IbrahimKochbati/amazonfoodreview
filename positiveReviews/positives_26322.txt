Headline:  Once you try them, nothing else will compare.     They may seem a bit expensive, but they use quality ingredients.  Also, it doesn't seem that much when you compare the cost to a per piece price of a box of G***** or another quality  and.     I worked at a company that owned a chocolate company.  I lived in Switzerland, the UK, and other places who lay claims to having the best chocolate.  Ice Cubes have been around at least 35 years, because I can remember having them as a kid, and I've never tried anything that compares.     I would like to be able to buy less than 120 at a time, and think more people would give them a try if that was possible.     One tip from my friend:  when you have a piece you won't want to talk or be distracted by doing anything else;  you may just want to concentrate on enjoying the taste!
