I recently purchased these bones for my 4 Cairn Terriers. All my dogs absolutely LOVE them ! Even the 11 year old enjoys chewing them and getting off a "little crunchy bit " . The one review stated that they are a little  " messy" . That is true as there are some loose pieces of grizzle  when you open the  plastic wrappr ( that itself is a GREAT feature to be INDIVIDUALLY  wrapped). How I have solved this problem is  that I wash each bone  under running water and then towel dry it before I give to the Cairns . That way there are no loose crumbs. The dogs  enjoy chewing these and it keeps them busy for a long time. When all the the crunchy tendons on the bones are gone , they still enjoy chewing at the  marrow. I have not yet seen any diarrhea or  even any large pieces  chewed off the bones.  They dont seem to splinter either. THUMBS UP for this  product !  They are all natural and  even my Male Cairn who has multiple allergies can enJOY  them!!
