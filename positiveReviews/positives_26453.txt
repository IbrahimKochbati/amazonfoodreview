Great to keep my Bostons teeth clean, Watch out for choking and I always watch him eat these and take it away from him before he gets to the last 2 inches, I have had to pull them out of his throat while he was choking!So I buy him the large ones even though he is a smaller dog. Every night he goes to the pantry door to beg for these. He loves them . They smell funny so he eats it on a washable blanket! Yes he is a pampered pooch!! BT Mom
