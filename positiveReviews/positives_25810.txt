The coffee tastes great.  It's bold enough flavor wise without any bitterness.  However, we have an explosion with about every other k cup.  The foil seal on the top  eaks and coffee and grounds spew out the top.  Wouldn't be surprised if shipping in the summer heat weakened the adhesive that seals the foil.  I'd buy it again because I like the coffee so much, but be prepared to clean up messes if you get a batch of k cups like we did.
