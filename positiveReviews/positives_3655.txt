I tried many different types of dry food for my picky eater, a cavalier king charles  iel. When I found the Newmans own I hit gold. My dog loves it, he licks his bowl clean, and best of all it is good for him. His coat looks very healthy and his intermittent stomach issues are controlled. I am really happy with this  and. I wish it was available at more stores.
