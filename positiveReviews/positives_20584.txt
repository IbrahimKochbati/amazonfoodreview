We use this for our poodle.  He's been on it pretty much since he was a puppy.  We tried several different premium dog foods and this seemed to be the one he liked the best.  He's 4 now, and is still built the same as he was at 1.  None of they typical Poodle chubbiness.  We don't feed on a schedule, just always have a bowl out with food in it.  He's full of energy, never had any skin problems, and in general as healthy as a horse.  We occasionally mix in some raw frozen foods or other premium dog food for nutritional variety, but only every now and then to prevent him from getting an upset stomach.
