I'm not a potato chip addict, but sometimes like them as a snack.          I chose these because I'd never tried them before.          They are delicious, zesty, slightly sweet and spicy.It's like a combination of sweet and tart at once. The oils in these chips are better for health. It is hard to put the bag down.          They are made in Detroit Michigan and contain no trans fats, that's good enough for me. Try them.
