Puroast didn't have that deep coffee smell when I first opened the package nor did it give off a rich smell as it  ewed, that comforting scent that says "wake up".  The taste was ok at best.  As advertised it didn't bite back or cause acid reflux or heartburn.  I  ewed it in a standard drip machine.  I'll be sticking to my usual  and of coffee rather than switching to Puroast.
