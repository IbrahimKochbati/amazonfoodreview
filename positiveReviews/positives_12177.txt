   class "tiny"  Length:: 1:30 Mins              Delicious medium roast blend with complex tones (5 stars)          The name belies an intoxicating medium roast blend that fuses flavors from Central America, Indonesia and East Africa. The Nantucket Blend is deliciously complex   a m&eacute;lange of four coffees from three continents   opening with the aroma of berries, spice and wine and soft floral undertones and finishing smoky and sweet with a touch of French Roast.          According to the Green Mountain Coffee website, the blend's origin dates back more than 20 years ago, "created at the request of a loyal customer who lived on Nantucket Island. The blend proved a winner, and the name stuck."          I drink Nantucket Blend black, using Keurig's small mug (7.25 oz) setting. My wife, who will often add creamer to darker roasts, also enjoys this blend black.          In summary, this medium roast blend is a new favorite in our house. We first purchased Nantucket Blend during an Amazon sale for about 55 cents per Keurig cup. Regular price is about 66 cents, 15 cents higher per cup than other  ands. Is it worth the additional price? Yes, but keep an eye out for sales.          Added bonuses:     Nantucket Blend is certified kosher by the Orthodox Union.     Green Mountain Coffee is Fair Trade Certified.     Green Mountain Coffee is organic.          Rating: Five stars.          BTW: Here's my recent K cup coffee reviews for Amazon:          5 stars:    "
