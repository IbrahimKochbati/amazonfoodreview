This food is wonderful for dogs!  It's healthy and doesn't contain all the fillers that most dog foods do.  We saw an instant change in our dogs skin and bowel movements for the better.  Now, any dog we get will now eat Natural Balance LTD. Our vet recommended this to us after our boston terrier got bladder stones, wish we would have known about it sooner.
