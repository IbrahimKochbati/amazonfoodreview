These soy crisps are an excellent choice for snacking. With 7 grams of protein in each serving, they are SO much better for you than potato chips or other snack foods.They have a great flavor, just enough salt, and leave you feeling satisfied  nutritionally and snackwise ! My grandchildren know these crisps are what they will be offered at my house for snacking. I highly recommend them.
