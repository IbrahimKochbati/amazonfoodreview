THE PRODUCT, BEING NEW, IS FAIR, BUT HAVE NOT HAD TOO MUCH LUCK GETTING IT TO EXPAND MUCH....HAVE TOOOOOOO MANY FLAT HARD PIECES....FLAVOR IS OKAY, BUT HAS A GREASY TASTE TO START, LIKE IT'S BEEN SITTING IN BACON GREASE..I HAVE TRUST THAT IN TIME THE PRODUCT WILL IMPROVE AS ALL NEW PRODUCTS DO, ....I THINK IT IS A GOOD CONCEPT AND HOPE IT DOES GET BETTER
