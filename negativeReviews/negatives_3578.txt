I like this bar because it is healthy without tasting blah! It's nicely chewy and not as dry or tasteless as some "health" bars tend to be.  A nice combination of grains, coconut and chocolate make this a bar to reach for if you want a quick, easily packable snack that is not unhealthy. With that said, the calories are rather high: 180, and it includes 9 grams of fat, so you couldn't really call it a low cal snack. I've often had one for  eakfast as a kind of meal replacement when I'm in a hurry, with a glass of OJ and felt it satisfied me for a few hours, until lunch time. I like that it's gluten free, even though I don't actually have a gluten allergy that I know of.  But I think it's great that those who do have gluten intolerance are getting more and more choices.Bottom line: this is a nice snack, fairly healthy, and not a bad choice as a quick meal substitute.
