I have three puppy mill rescue Pekingese and I have tried about every other high end dog food that I could think to try.  This is by far the best dog food that I have found to date.  One of my dogs has terrible food allergies and can't eat ANY other foods without getting a bad reaction.  Another one of my dogs previously had very bad tear staining, but when I asked around I heard various reasons why (I was told hard water  switched to deer park with no results) and after eating ziwipeak my dog's tear stains are GONE.  It's unreal.  Most importantly... they LOVE it!  Even when I walk past the bag, they go nuts.  Worth EVERY PENNY.
