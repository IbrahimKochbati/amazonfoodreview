When my supermarket discontinued Newman's Own Organic Black Tea (Royal Tea) I started ordering it from Amazon. I order it a case at a time and it arrives promptly.     The tea itself is one of the only organic black teas that come in boxes of 100.     Royal Tea is a full bodied black tea. It is a smooth tasting tea. Strong  ewed is never bitter.     The more you drink, the more money is donated to charity. What a bonus!
