I am trying to find a great chai to make at home when I am not treating myself to a Starbuck's chai. I was drinking Pacific Chai (spicy) for a long time which I liked for the most part. (I made it into a vanilla chai by adding a 1 2 tsp of French Vanilla coffee mate creamer to about a 10 oz cup of water, with 3 tbs of chai powder, while in the blender.) After a year or so, I wanted to try something different because the Pacific Chai containers were always 3 4 full   it became annoying. But it turns out that some other  ands are the same.      I love vanilla chai but I didn't prefer the Pacific vanilla chai because it wasn't spicy enough, and the same thing goes for Big Train Chai Vanilla   not spicy enough. I also did not like Mocafe Vanilla Chai.      I would love to find the perfect vanilla chai that has great spicy flavor.
