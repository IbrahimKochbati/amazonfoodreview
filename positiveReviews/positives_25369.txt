These CET Hextra Prem Chews are super for all my dogs and I have 6 small to medium sized house dogs. They last and last for a good long time chewing and cleaning of my dogs teeth. I get the Ex large ones and cut them in two pieces each for my pets. This makes them more economical for me to buy. My dogs love them.
