We all want to do what's best for our dogs.  And with these treats, we can probably feel a little bit better about what we're giving them.  For my dog at least, we had a fairly successful outcome using these.          My dog is stubborn, very stubborn, and we're in the process of retraining all the bad habits out of her left by her numerous previous owners.  This is a trying experience, especially in a dog that is not food motivated once outside (inside is a different story!).  Usually I can take her out on a walk, try to  ibe her with treats, and she still focuses on everything but me.  These treats produced a different effect.  She got one whiff and all of a sudden I was the most interesting thing around.  As far as I could tell, they seemed to taste good to her and can be used as a high value treat.  Inside we had a different experience with these treats.  She was so focused on the treats that she didn't listen to a word we said and just kept trying to get to them despite our commands.  This may not happen with every dog of course but if you've got a stubborn dog, it could have the same effect.          They are fairly large and come in two attached together.  When outside trying to juggle everything else, they were somewhat difficult to  eak apart or even into smaller pieces (I can't see a small dog handling these treats well).  While the bag is pretty big and full of these treats, they do contain premium ingredients and could be a bit pricey for regular training treats for a dog.          In regards to nutrition, these are very healthy.  The ingredients include Organic Barley, Organic Lamb, Organic Carrots, Organic Apples, Organic Palm Oil, and Organic Molasses.  I don't even get that much organic food normally!  I feel good giving her these treats though, and honestly, I've half a mind to try one myself they sound so good for you (although I will resist).          I'll probably keep using these treats as a motivator for listening when we're outside.  They seem to be effect and I am pleased with their results there.          Review by M. Reynard 2011
