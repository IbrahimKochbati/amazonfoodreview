I love cereal in general and Lucky Charms is up there as one of my favorites. I like my cereals a little sweet and Lucky Charms is just that. It's not too sweet. I love the marshmallows. I think they are the best marshmallows in any cereal that has them. I also like the fact that this cereal doesn't get that soggy after being in the milk for a little while. The taste is great and I can't get tired of it like some other cereals.
