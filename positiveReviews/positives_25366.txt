I would definitely reccomend these for your dog.  My dogs love their taste and think they're getting a treat when they get these.  I also save money by buying the biggest size and cutting them in half.          Here's our tale.  My dog Babe is 11 yrs old.  3 years ago at her annual check up the vet reccomended we have her teeth cleaned (this means anesthesia).  We were busy so we scheduled her appointment 2 months out. The new dog foods with teeth  ushing had just come out in our area so we switched her to one.  When we took her in for the teeth cleaning, the vet said she didn't need it.  Yeah!  Then last year we took our new dog Hercules to the vet and she showed us the CET Hextra chews.  Which my dog treated like the best thing he'd ever seen.  So I went home and ordered some.  Amazon had the best deal I could find by far.  6 months later after daily use of the chews.  Babe went in for her annual again and the vet said her teeth looked like those of a 1 yr old dog.  They even  ought other people in the clinic in to see her teeth.  They said whatever we were doing to keep it up.
