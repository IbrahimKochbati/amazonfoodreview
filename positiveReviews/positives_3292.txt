I love this Bisquick Mix!  Over the past 10 years, since being diagnosed wheat gluten intolerant, I have tried so many gluten free mixes that were so bad I ended up feeling like I might as well be eating the box!  This Bisquick mix is by far the best I have found for making scones (plain or sweet) and biscuits!  The Orange biscuits, cheddar biscuits and raisin scones I have made were delicious. It was easy to substitute this mix into my old recipes, because unlike some gluten free mixes, I found I can play around with this and don't have to measure everything absolutely precisely to get a good outcome.  Of course, you can't roll this dough out like traditional dough, it has to be dropped onto the baking sheet in spoonfuls.  I have found that if I don't make it too sticky, I can gently form the balls in my hands to give a more regular shape to my scones and biscuits. I have also used it for making deep dish chicken pie and pizza (be sure you press it nice and thin in the pan   I use a silicone spatula to press it so that it doesn't stick). Bisquick Mix is made by the Betty Crocker company and this, along with the Betty Crocker cakes and  ownie mixes, allows me to indulge in delicious baked goods again!  I have Bisquick Mix on Subscribe and Save, which makes it very affordable and makes sure that I don't ever run out!
