What's not to like about Pamela's baking mix? I use it as a base for a number of baked goods. I have made biscotti   and a wonderful Lemon Ricotta cake with Pamela's  to name just a  couple of things.          I got a little carried away with the last purchase   I bought the 25 pound bag  which means I won't have to order it again for a year!          For those that area curious about the Pamela's Baking Mix   it's a wonderful tasty base mix. The waffles and pancakes it makes are delightful   I really cannot say another bad about the baking mix nor Amazon for  inging the larger bag option to us   the consumer.
