This soup is incredibly good!  But honestly, I was looking for a better deal through Amazon. The free shipping is great, but it's over 3 bucks a can, and I can get it cheaper through my grocery store. They are always having WP sales for 2 bucks a can, 2.50 a can... so does anyone know about a better deal than this? It's a really good tasting soup!
