Ok...TODAY 4 15 this company decided to put them up for sale at 12.50 per 24pk...  This advertisement was on SLICKDEALS.NET          Well... Went to order and refreshed the page and in my cart was now 1 at 36 dollars???? so they sold one out of my cart.     Next.... I waited 20 mins to see if it was a fluke and SD.NET started claiming dead link.          Well upon refreshing again... they were now 44.95 for one 24 pack...          Hey RIDICULOUS SELLER..... GET WITH THE PROGRAM ...IF THIS IS YOUR WAY OF RECOVERING QUICK MONEY...I THINK PEOPLE ARE MUCH SMARTER THEN THAT UPON PRESSING CONFIRM MY ORDER ..... ROUND OF APPLAUSE TO YOU FOR BEING SO UN TECH SAVY
