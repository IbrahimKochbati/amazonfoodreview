I first had these k cups at work. I discovered that although we had a variety to choose from, I always went for the Van Houtte french vanilla. I recently ordered a ton of these for my home and still wake up each morning to a cup of french vanilla. I love the flavor and always seem to revert back to this  and and flavor after trying something new. It's a great choice all around!
