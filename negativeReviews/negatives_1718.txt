Thought this might be a nice alternative to use with my favorite coffee, but was sadly disappointed.  It leaked all over   no matter what we tried and the coffee was weak, machine clogged with most attempts and water wouldn't  ew thru.  At times the cup even melted a little   leaving a nasty taste in the coffee.          Go with the greener alternative and try the eko ew   much better results and no waste.
