I don't drink decaf, my wife is the one who drinks this coffee. I bought this going off the great reviews from Amazon and the Lavazza name.          I would have to say that the coffee is over hyped in terms of a taste price ratio. When I purchased it, it was approximately 9.4 lb. We all know coffee has gotten more expensive over the last year or so, so I was expecting a medium good coffee for this price.          My wife says it doesn't taste much better than other "lesser"  ands of coffee. She actually prefers a local  and that generally doesn't cost more than 7 8 lb.
