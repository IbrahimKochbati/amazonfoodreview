As a long time fan of Blair's death products, I am familiar with Blair's other spicy items like his sauces. However I had never tried any of his chips.          Until now.          These are the tastiest, crunchiest, and easily the spiciest chips known to man. Everything you love in a chip all rolled in to one.          Do not be deceived by the fact that it says chipotle on the bag. This is some concentrated stuff here. Personally I can only eat 2 3 chips per serving. It's that hot.
