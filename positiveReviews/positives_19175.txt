After seeing all the reviews for this, I had to try it and now need to order another box of them. The smell of it  ewing alone is probably enough reason to want to get more, but it tastes just as good as it smells. I've come to expect the same aromatic results from other kcup flavors and every other kind I have tried hasn't come anywhere near how this one  ews. I find myself sniffing other flavors while they're  ewing to see if there is any smell at all and I'm generally disappointed. This is my favorite flavor thus far!
