My oldest child has Ulcerative Cholitis, which effects how her body processes food.  Since her diet is so restrictive we often add HAPPYBELLIES as a additional supplement for nutritional reasons.  This has been a lifesaver for us.  The BELLIES help with the amount of probiotics she is receiving each day and she does not even know it good for her.
