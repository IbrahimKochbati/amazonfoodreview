Last night I tried this product according to the instructions.  My oven was at the right temperature, and I baked for just over 12 minutes (around 157 degrees according to my tests).  And I tried it with some center cut pork chops with the bone in, which should have made the resulting dish better than if I'd chosen plain old no bone pork chops, but 100% of the three people who consumed these chops agreed they would have preferred them with no coating at all.          One person said that the one part of her chop that I missed coating with the product on one side was the single best bite she took.  Another tester said she wished I had merely seared the two surfaces of the chops and left off the coating altogether.          I myself appreciated the crunch of this coating, but every bite had an off flavor that I would prefer had not been there.  I too would have preferred no coating at all to the coating this product added to the pork chops.          In case you're interested, here's the ingredients list.  ENRICHED WHEAT FLOUR (WHEAT FLOUR, NIACIN, IRON, THIAMIN MONONITRATE (VITAMIN B1), RIBOFLAVIN (VITAMIN B2), FOLIC ACID), SALT, CANOLA OIL, SUGAR, SPICE, CONTAINS LESS THAN 2% OF CARAMEL COLOR, DRIED ONIONS, DEXTROSE, YEAST, EXTRACTIVES OF PAPRIKA, ASCORBIC ACID.  I think you can whip up a reasonable substitute    except for the caramel color    by mixing flour and ground corn meal with salt and paprika, and I'd add some pepper if I were you unless you don't want me to.          Why shake?          Also, I'm not sure why you should bother to put the coating and the chops into a zip top bag and shake them, especially since you must supply the bag, and especially especially since you must discard it immediately since it's coated in raw pork ick and which also adds maybe 15 cents to the price of the product.  Why can't you just dump the 2.25 ounces of coating onto a plate and dredge?  I get the bake part of Shake 'N Bake, but I don't get the shake part.          The package says to buy four to six half inch thick pork chops, and I bought one for each of us three diners plus one extra for a total of    just a moment while I whip out my spreadsheet here    four.  As you can see from the photograph I've thoughtfully added, they were pretty big chops, and there was not nearly enough coating to have done the last one, not to mention a fifth and sixth.          This morning for  eakfast I fried the emergency backup pork chop in a little butter but obviously with no coating, and it was much more agreeable than the coated one last night.          As a result, I conclude that this product needs improvement, and I rate it two stars.  I'd rate it one star, but that means that I literally hate it, which is a bit strong.  I just have no immediate or even long term plans to use it again.          In case you were wondering, as I can attest from having run the experiments for you, this product does not improve the flavor or texture of tapioca, a mocha latte, or vanilla ice cream (or probably any other flavor, but vanilla was all we had).             Update: I don't see where we reviewers can add photos to the product page, so I take back what I said above about "the photograph I've thoughtfully added."  Maybe later.             Update of August 8, 2011: I've now been able to add the photo, so please stop emailing me asking when the heck I'm going to get it posted.
