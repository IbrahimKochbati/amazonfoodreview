I've tried all sorts of bottled and canned pizza sauces for years.  None were better than mediocre and some were really awful.  I would always go back to my "polpo" which I make with a base of Muir Glen diced tomatoes   tasty but still would dump too much water on the crust while baking.  Finally tried the Pastorelli.  BOY IS IT GOOD!!!!     Good tomatoey flavor, not over herbed or garliced, not salty, and it held together when cooking rather than soggying up my crust.  My new best tomato friend.  2TB or so wii suffice for a pizza.  Great stuff!!!
