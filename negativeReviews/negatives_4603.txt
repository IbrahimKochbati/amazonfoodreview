Of course, the problem that we have, my wife and I, is the fact that we are Belgians and lived the first 25 years of our lifes in Liege (born and raised). So when I get pearl sugar online for our Liege waffles, like this one, pretending to be "belgian pearl sugar" (it's written on the box!), we can only be disappointed. I guess it's good enough for those who never been in Belgium or those who just passed by there...Those swedish made pearl sugar   at least they are not the rocky sugar   are too big, melt during cooking, give a taste of caramel instead, making the waffle chewy. Oh well...I'm sure one day we'll find the real belgian pearl sugar somewhere online...
