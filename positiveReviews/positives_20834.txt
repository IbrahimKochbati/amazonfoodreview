I am the proud owner of a dog with multiple allergy issues!  She is allergic to the bulk of the ingredients found in most commercial dog foods sold in stores...beef, pork, corn, carrots, flax, oats...and the list goes on!  Thankfully this product showed up on the market!  She loves it and I don't have to worry about if what I am cooking for her (which I had to do for a while) has everything she needs in it!  Will definitely be keeping her on this!
