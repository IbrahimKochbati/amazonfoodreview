This seemed like a great toy, until my dogs had in for 10 seconds.     The end the treats come out of has rubber parts (which smell strongly of, well, rubber) and the opposite end (that no treats ever come out of) has little holes drilled in it.     This makes the smell of the treats MUCH stronger from the WRONG END of the toy.     Both of my dogs were scratching and licking at the end that they could actually SMELL the treats through, and actually backed away from the strong smell of the rubber.     The other treat dispensing toys have been too easy for my dogs, but this one does not seem to be made for an animal that relies so heavily on it's sense of smell.
