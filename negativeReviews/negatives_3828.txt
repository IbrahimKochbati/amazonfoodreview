I'm not a huge soft drink consumer, but I thought I would give this a try since it's being touted as a "healthy soda alternative."          The Switch is a low sugar carbonated drink that tastes fairly well, but is not as sweet as regular soft drinks or juices.  It felt a lot like a soft drink (that kind of weird filled up feeling) but lacked pizazz when it came to taste   there wasn't a lot to the strawberry or the kiwi side and just made the drink feel a little flat.  I don't like super sweet foods, but I do like tons of flavor, so the drink didn't impress me too much.  This drink might be more of an acquired taste.          I'd say sample this at your local grocery store or at a friend's house before buying.
