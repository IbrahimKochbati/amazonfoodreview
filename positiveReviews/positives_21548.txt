My son loves Maple Brown Sugar Cream of Wheat so when I was offered to try the Quaker Maple Brown Sugar Oatmeal I jumped at the chance to offer him something different.  It was a huge hit!  It was super easy to prepare.  I put the oatmeal in a bowl with 2 3 cup of milk (he won't drink milk so this is one of the only ways we get it into him) and put it in the microwave for one minute and he ate it up almost as quick as it was made!          Great price for this box of instant oatmeal too   if you do the subscribe and save you can save even more and cancel or change your shipment at anytime!
