After a lifetime of tea drinking, I can honestly say that this is the best Earl Grey I have ever tasted.  I have ordered it a number of times, and each batch is consistently excellent. I have even given it as a gift, as its container is superb for keeping loose tea fresh.  The metal canister has an inner lid that is lifted with its own attached knob, so the tea stays dry and fresh for the length of time it takes to use it up.  Do yourself a favor, if you like Earl Grey, and treat yourself to this tea.
