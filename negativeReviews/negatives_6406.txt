It's a bit odd that this particular flavor of Salada green tea is even titled decaffeinated, but NO where on the actual box does it state that it is decaffeinated. Salada's website says their green teas are decaffeinated   but if so, why not state it on the box itself? Some of their flavored teas (eg, purple antioxidants) DO come with a decaffeinated label on the box. This one does not, whether purchased at Amazon or in my local supermarket.
