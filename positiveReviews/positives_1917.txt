Since I had been recuperating from a 24 hour flu bug that lasted a     week, I knew I was low on electrolytes.  I opted for this product,     as some products tend to further aggravate my stomach and     acid reflux.  This worked out extremely well, and the taste     is good.  I WILL keep it on hand from now on!
