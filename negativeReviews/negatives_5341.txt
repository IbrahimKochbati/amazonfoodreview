I got this as a gift for my girlfriend's mother who had mentioned getting heart burn from coffee   even though she loves coffee.  I thought this might make a reasonable fix to the situation.  After trying though she seemed to be a little less worried with the heart burn and little more concerned with the taste.  She didn't have heartburn, but she also didn't drink very much either   due to taste.  She thought it tasted a little stale and bland.  Maybe it was just a bad batch, but seems the process to limit the acid also limits the flavor.  Too bad, I had hoped this was going to be a big winner.
