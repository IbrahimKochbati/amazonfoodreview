"Erythritol" has become our sugar substitute of choice since I became diabetic a few months ago. In crystal form, it seems about 70% as sweet as regular sugar. My wife uses a little bit of added sugar to  ing the sweetness up for the rest of the family in things that need it, but I am happy with it as a one to one replacement for sugar in most things.          I have not noticed any glycemic impact to my blood sugar or "laxative" effects seen with other sugar alcohol sweeteners (which is a very important consideration : )          Highly recommended!
