This would have gotten 4 or 5 stars if the manufacturer hadn't caused me major frustration today with one of the recipes on the bag.          The  ead made from this mix is okay, not REAL  ead but close as one can get without wheat.          Pizza crust was fine too.          I used it to make pie crust, following the recipe on the bag.  What a disaster.  IMPOSSIBLE to get the pie dough transferred to the pan, kept falling apart.  No way I could get the top crust on in one piece.  I ended up cutting strips.  Tastes okay but very frustrating to make.          Also, the recipe is for a tart crust, not a pie crust as that it insists you use butter.  Makes the crust REALLY rich, even substituting half shortening as the allows.
