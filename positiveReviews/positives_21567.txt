I start out each morning with a bowl of instant oatmeal. My favorite...Maple Brown Sugar. I love to add ground flaxseed. It adds extra flavor. Both are so good for you, why not start out your morning right. If you think oatmeal is for colder months only, think again. It goes great with my morning coffee. It's quick and easy, and very handy to take on trips. Most places have a microwave. Just heat up a little water, pour, and it's ready to eat.
