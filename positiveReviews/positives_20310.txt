I'm a health food nut, I eat clean, fresh and as much organic as my wallet allows.  I nurse my 6 mo old and make his baby food.  I wanted a cereal that I felt was as clean as his organic baby food I was making and as my milk is...I LOVE this cereal...he digests it easily, it never constipated him...I think thats due to the additives this particular cereal has.  I will never try another cereal.  I am excited to try the oatmeal though!
