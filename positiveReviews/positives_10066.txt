I probably had my first cup of Melitta back in college, considering it a more sophisticated option than Yuban. That's due to its  anding (which has remained consistent for as long as I can remember) and its promise of a "European" experience which once you get to Europe, you realize is a pretty  oad and meaningless term.          But no matter. The coffee's good. It's for you if you like mainstream flavor blends and a medium roast but want to step up in quality. $6 for 11 ounces (one bag) is a fair price and it gets more affordable if you do the subscribe and save deal which comes with free shipping. The vacuum bag makes for a compact package when you're storing it before use and seals tight after you open it; the quality is a cut above from some other vacuum bags I've tried that leak coffee grounds, making a mess in the pantry.          One odd thing, my three pack came with just one bag coffee in a wasteful big cardboard shipper. I was getting it for review so can't complain, but this is not typical of Amazon.
