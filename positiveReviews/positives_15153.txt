I know my review is a little out dated from its earlier posts but, I love this food for my 2 labs.  I have never fed them anything else. I am giving it 4 stars due to the increase in price and decrease in size. I used to by it when it was a 40 lb bag for $38 or so.  Now it is 35lb bag and $42, atleast in my neck of the woods.  I know you can buy a 44lb bag, but that doesn't fit in my container.          I started feeding this about 10 years ago to one of my other labs because he had cancer and I wanted to give him the best nutrition possible with out  eaking the bank.  He thrived on this food.  He has since passed and now I have 2 more labs.  My labs are 7 and 5, and I have not heard of any change in formula, nor have I ever fed anything else.  I do remember a dog food recall a couple years back where dogs were getting very sick due to a contamination of sorts, but Canidae was never part of the recalled list, as far as I know.  I know all about gas, I have labs, no matter what you feed them they have some sort of gas.  I do not feed my dogs table scraps and use Milk Bones for treats.  As far as I am concerned a little gas is fine as long as it is coming out and is not stuck inside, that is when it becomes a problem.  All mammals have gas, it is a fact of life, to think you can prevent dogs from gas is crazy!          I feel terrible for the dog owners that had sick pets.  I hope you found an alternative that you were happy with feeding.
