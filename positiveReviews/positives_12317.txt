I love walnuts and tried these at a friend's house.  I was hooked.  But, I had also heard that walnuts are good for cholesterol issues.  I have always struggled with keeping my LDL (bad) cholesterol down while keeping my good (HDL) cholesterol up.  I eat a healthy diet, I exercise, and do everything I can, but after adding these walnuts to my diet (I eat a handful a day), the results have been incredible! For the first time in my life, my cholesterol is so great that my doctor doesn't try to get me to take medicine for it anymore. (I always refused to take it).  My LDL is way down and my HDL is so high it's off the charts (108)!  The best thing is that the nuts taste wonderful and are a great afternoon snack!!!
