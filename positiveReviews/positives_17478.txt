I got this Dinner of the Month Club pasta meal as a gift from a very special person back in CT where I used to live  I believe they are one of the leading gourmet presents companies nationwide.     The pasta is ready literally within 15 minutes  a quick meal is a good thing, especially for a single guy like me who doesn't have the time of day to cook complicated stuff  and not only that, it tastes excellent! (I added some parmesan cheese to the sauces that I got in my fridge and it made it even better). Honestly I wasn't expecting it to taste this good. As an Italian food fan, I was pretty satisfied with this gift. If you don't want to leave the house or what to stay home to watch the game, it's a perfect gift. Do I recommend their food and services? Absolutely! Giving gifts like these are a good idea for single people like me, so I am thinking returning the favor and sending these to some people I know for the upcoming holidays.
