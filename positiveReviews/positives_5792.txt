Months ago I had my first butternut squash soup, hand made at a fancy restaurant. I do not like canned soups... but I saw this in our local grocers, and remembering the soup I had at the restaurant, I decided to try it. It was delicious! It is my favorite lunch go to now. I have added shredded roasted turkey to make it heartier, but as for taste it is wonderful. I order the case on Amazon, which is cheaper than my local store. I also tried their french onion soup which is really good. I have avoided the others simply because in their best form, I don't like chicken noodles and tomato soups, but for the 2 I do like and have tried, they really made something from canned soups, and I'd recommend them.
