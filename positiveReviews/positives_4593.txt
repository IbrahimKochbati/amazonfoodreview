If you follow the cooking directions, in my opinion, you have wallpaper paste.  Cut the cooking time from 30 minutes to 20 minutes, and it is much better   a little chewy, but that's how I like it!  Breakfast takes more planning now, since it's a longer cooking time than my old  and   but good taste and worth it.
