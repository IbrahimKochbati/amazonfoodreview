Drank an instant green tea from a major producer for several years. Then they changed production and began using sucralose which I don't tolerate well.     Tried several different teas before I found Stash's instant green tea. I like it best with a little fresh lemon lime juice. I can drink all I want  don't even need sweetener. Plus as I understand it, it's just made from dried, pulverized green tea leaves  no chemical process. Also it's very coolby I get a discount forn having it delivered by monthly subscription. Phil K.
