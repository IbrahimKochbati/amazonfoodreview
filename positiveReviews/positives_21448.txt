After trying multiple  ands and flavors of granola, this one tops them all.  I mix this granola with fresh fruit every day for  eakfast. Very low sugar content. No cinnamon, raisins, or nuts, no flavors to interfere with the fruit.  When a plain granola sells out every week in a cowboy town in Texas  you know its' good stuff!  Buying it in bulk from Amazon from now on!
