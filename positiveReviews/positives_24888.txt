My dog is only 2 but has a bad front leg. I wanted to give her a treat that she will love but will also help her leg for years to come. This seems like it's the one! She absolutely loves these treats and I feel good giving them to her. I have not met a dog yet that doesn't like the taste. The 6 pack is the way to go   SO MUCH CHEAPER than buying them in the store. Bone appetite!
