Things I love about this product:      Only 1 gram of sugar per serving      Tastes great      Made with decaffeinated chocolate      Only 21 calories          It's great for both kids and adults who love chocolate milk but want something healthier. It tastes like ovaltine to me and that just makes it even better!
