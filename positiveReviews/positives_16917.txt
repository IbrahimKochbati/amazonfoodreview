My 6 month old puppy loves this toy. We use it when we need to leave him home alone to keep him entertained. He has worked out how to get the treats out pretty quickly now, but he still enjoys the game of getting them out. He will  ing it over to me when it's empty and want it refilled. Good toy for $10.
