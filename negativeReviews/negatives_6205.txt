I agree with other reviews that the taste is good. But the image on the package suggests mostly lentils with some sauce. It's not, it's mostly sauce with few lentils. You could fix this by adding some canned lentils, but you shouldn't have to. See my picture. It's like a  oth with a tablespoon on beans.
