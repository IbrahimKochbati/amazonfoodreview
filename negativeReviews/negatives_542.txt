Too mild for me... I like a strong flavor. My wife likes this coffee. Has enough flavor and boldness to keep it enjoyable and not feeling like water downed coffee. If you like strong, bold coffee, you will be disappointed. For a mild coffee, I found this good, but not good enough to warrant the higher cost over many of the other  ands.          I will not be re ordering Caribou Mahogany. My wife prefers Donut Shop  and over this. Again, not strong enough for me, but still makes a good cup of coffee.
