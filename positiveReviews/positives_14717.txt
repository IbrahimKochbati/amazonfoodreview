I just love Hershey's chocolate anyway, so it's pretty hard for them to totally muck up something enough to have me dislike it.  These guys are just awesome!  I love almonds and well, they're supposed to be pretty healthy and when combined with chocolate, well, what an excuse to eat healthy! They do provide a bit of protein so if you're starving, they help somewhat to alleviate that.  They're just awesome on their own   highly recommend!
