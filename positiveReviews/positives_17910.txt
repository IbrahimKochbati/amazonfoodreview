I have been using Shake `n Bake with my chicken for year but never thought to use it with pork chops until they released the Original Pork flavor.  This product is as easy to use as their other products: pour the Shake `n Bake into a sealable bag: put the pork chops individual, shake and then put them in the oven.  The package says it can be used from four to six pork chops and after using it with four I would not be surprised if I could have been able to coat four more pork chops with one package.  The taste is so similar to the chicken version there were some bites when I forgot I was eating pork chops and was eating chicken with Shake `n Bake on it.  Much like the chicken version, the  eading can fall off while cutting, but that is really the only negative I can say about the product.
