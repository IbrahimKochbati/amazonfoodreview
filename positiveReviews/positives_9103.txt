Until I found this item, I was taking up valuable storage space in my overhead cabinet with 3 boxes of K cups.  (I like variety!)  This tray is sturdy, holds plenty of K cups, and basically disappears from view once you put it under your Keurig.  I love it so much that I ordered one for my cousin   we both grew up reciting "a place for everything, and everything in it's place"   guess what?  She loves it, too!  If you're lamenting having bought the carousel, simply sell it at your next garage sale and give this tray a try!
