I learned about this product from the shelter where I adopted my newest cat who is 3 years old.  They recommended it strongly, so I introduced it to my 14 year old who preferred it over Science Diet. Now I can feed both age groups the same food. I like the fact that the ingredients are all natural and healthy.  It's hard to find the 15 lb bag, so I like buying this from Amazon.
