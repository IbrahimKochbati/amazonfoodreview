This is a very good coffee, and I am one who loves his coffee. Why do I love this coffee? Well, I loved it so because it was strong, but not overly simplistic. It had hints of many different flavors, and they were blended together to form a symphony of taste. In fact, it was as strong as starbucks, but not pedestrian and simplistic. It also  ewed very nicely in my Mr.Coffee  ewer, as well as my camp percolator. Anyway, a great coffee.
