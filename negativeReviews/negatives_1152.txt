I really wanted to like these.          First off, these cookies are about the size of a half dollar and aren't that thick. And they are more like fudge that cookies. Look at the ingredients. They are nut flour held together with honey. They need some egg or something. They are gooey and sticky. They are extremely sweet and pack a whopping 10 15g carbs each and yes that is not counting the fiber.          I'm sorry I appreciate the effort guys but in my option these are a novetly. They are too expensive and too non functional to be a serious part of your regular diet.
