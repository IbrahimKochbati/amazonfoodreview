First let me say that the product arrived quickly and was as described. Now, I have had Quinoa a number of times and several different ways, but I had never actually cooked it myself. I have wanted to, since this grain is immeasurably better for you than just about any other grain but I was fearful of what would happen when I did cook with it. There is NO NEED to fear it. This stuff is a  eeze to cook. Easier than rice on the stovetop (PLUS  It cooks well in a rice cooker). I have been trying it many ways and am ready to order more.
