Initially I was so excited to find this gift basket   it "seemed" perfect for a reasonable price.  I received the product today and was terribly disappointed when seeing it.  Honestly  it looks like yunk that you MIGHT buy for $12 to $15 but CERTAINLY NOT $50!!  I will be sending this back ASAP and recommend that others do not waste their time and money on this cheap, tacky product.
