British food is often poorly regarded by comparison to the cuisine of our European neighbours: France, Italy, Germany and Spain. Yet in some areas Britain truly leads the world   where would we be without the sandwich, for example?          Another area of British culinary pre eminence is the steamed pudding, amongst which the Spotted Dick is king. As a pudding fan, I am deeply saddened that several, rather puerile, reviewers find this name mildly amusing. I doubt they would stoop to such pathetic attempts at humour if they had bothered to taste it first.          Take my word for it: nothing tastes better than a mouthful of dick, especially if it comes with a load of hot custard.
