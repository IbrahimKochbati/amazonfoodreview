We really like the Happy Bellies cereal, but this time, it came at a price! It arrived smelling like cigarette smoke! I won't even feed it to my baby! The box smelled horrible, and I just figured it was the delivery driver.  Then when I opened it up, the canisters smelled too.  I don't think this is standard practice as we've ordered the cereal in the past with no problems.
