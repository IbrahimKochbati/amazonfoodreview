I chose this food for my dog because it was the only one without a "filler" ingredient high in the list.  Although I've been feeding cheaper  ands to dogs in the past, I've since learned about the potential pet health impacts of doing so.  Overall, it's working out but not as well as it could be with my picky eater.          My dog's a fan of several different varieties of the kibble, but *not* the LifeSource Bits (the little  own kibbles that have all the antioxidants that are one of the main benefits).  He picks them out and will only eat them when he's *really* hungry.  I've read plenty of reviews on pet oriented sites about dogs who do the same.          If your dog is not a picky eater, the kind who never finds the pill you hide in the food, you'll probably have no issues with this  and.  If your dog picks out the "bits," you may have to feed him a little less or choose a different  and.
