This is delicious tea, with or without milk and or sugar. I drink it for  eakfast, lunch, dinner and iced on hot summer afternoons. I drink the decaf version with midnight snacks. IMO, this tea tastes every bit as good as the English Breakfast tea from Peet's or Starbuck's. I use a "strainer" (infuser)  with very small holes, like the Teeli Brew Basket or Swissgold Tea Filter. Amazon sells both. Get it wet before you put in the tea. Enjoy your cuppa!
