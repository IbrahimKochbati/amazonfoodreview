My wife is on the low carb diet, well WE are on the low carb diet   which means: "small  eakfast" if you do not have time to make eggs and bacon. "It is hard to get the coffee down without peanut butter" she says. We have been using crackers like these Kavli crisp eads to "get down the peanut butter" since before I can remember   I think it was when Dan and Mary Eads published: "Protien Power Plan" in the late 1990s. Many years ago we found these to be the best. We could only find them in Wegmans grocery store in NE Pennsylvania, and now that the Army has moved us (again) to Fort Knox, KY we can only find them at Kroger. Recently we cannot seem to find them there either, so we order them. They come fast, not  oken, and they are fresh. Also, they are not any more costly to purchase online and pay for delivery than to waste time looking for them. One note: My wife hates opnening things, and we found the best way to do so with these is to cut off the end of the cellophane(?) with scissors   prevents cracks of this thin  ead!
