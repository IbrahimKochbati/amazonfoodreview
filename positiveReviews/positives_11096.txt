This is some of the very best raw goat's milk cheese on the market.  It has a mild cheddar flavor which is different from the often very strong taste of other goat cheeses.  This mildness makes it very suitable for cooking and baking as well.  I definitely recommend it.  It is tasty and since it is made of raw milk it is very healthy too.
