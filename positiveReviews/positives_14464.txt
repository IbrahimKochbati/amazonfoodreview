I know how healthy oatmeal is supposed to be for you, but I have never found a  and with a flavor much less a texture that I could ever tolerate. No matter how much I doctored it up, it was still slimy stuff with pieces of other stuff in it.       I thought I would give it one more try, and lo and behold, this is the best oatmeal I have EVER EATEN in my ENTIRE LIFE. And I am in my 60's!!!! If you have ever had an aversion to oatmeal as I have, you WILL be able to eat this oatmeal.  Perhaps it is the mixture of the barley and dried fruit that does it.       My first cup I tried straight up, and it was sweet and delightful.  Next cup I tried adding some  own sugar, but you know, I think it was a bit too sweet, and I decided it was just fine all on its own.       The portion is large and very filling, it makes a satisfying  eakfast.     Bottom line, I am hooked for life on this stuff.  Give it a try, you will not be disappointed. 8 )
