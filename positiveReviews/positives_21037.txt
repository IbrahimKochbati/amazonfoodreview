I am an East coast transplant living in Indianapolis and have a hard time finding quality pasta sauces.  After trying almost all that was offered here, I decided to try this, and am so glad I did.  It is so good, almost as good as mine, but I don't have the time to cook sauce all day.  I add a few ingrediants like Romano cheese and spices, but you don't have to add anything to it.     I have a feeling that my store will not be carrying this too much longer as I am the only one buying it, so I am glad to see that Amazon has it for me.  Thank you so much Amazon!!!  You scored a big one with this product.
