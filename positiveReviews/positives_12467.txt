So, for some god awful reason, I opened one of the care packages I'd received and this was in there. I only ate it on a dare, and I am glad I did. It smells inticing and salty and one taste of it and I was hooked. It has the consistency of cream of wheat, except it felt like small bits of sand, and the beef flavor is just mildly infused. Now I am hooked and will probably order a bunch of it. In fact, I sure hope I'll never have a child, because s he isn't going to be left with any food. I am eating it all!
