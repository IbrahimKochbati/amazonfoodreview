I was glad to find an assortment of the basic flavors of Sugar Free Torani.  I'd only tried two of the in the past because of limited availability of the products in my area, so I was able to try new flavors.  As usual, Torani SF syrups are great tasting, easy to use and add to recipes, and the bottle size was perfect. I'm glad to have found this great deal.
