I remember the Shake n Bake from a long time ago! I had tried the chicken in the past but not the pork. When I saw this offer I decided to give it a try since I had pork chops in the freezer. Well, I wasn't as impressed with it as I am with the chicken one. It just didn't have as good a flavor. I supposed you could add extra spices to it but I wanted to try it "as is". You can't beat the ease of the Shake n Bake products! Love that aspect. But, unfortunately, this pork one just wasn't my families favorite. But don't let my review keep you from trying it. Your taste buds might be different from ours!
