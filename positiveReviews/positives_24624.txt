Receive several dented cans   I have ordered this product several times.  It is wonderful to be used in animal diets.  I have been working with animals and it has been a life saver for many animals that I have helped     I believe that it would be unfair to fault the product or the manufacturer.  From what I understand from the UPS driver, it Amazon who is at fault for extremely  poor packaging practices.  For some strange reason Amazon seems to be very cheap with its use of packing tape as well as internal packing.
