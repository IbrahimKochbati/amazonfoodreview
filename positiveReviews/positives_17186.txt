For Hi Protein carb food, these pretzels are the best!  Crisp texture, and a nicely well cooked (burnt) flavor which  ings out the best in a pretzel, you can't go wrong with these.  I like them better than any other pretzel I've have to date. If you think they are too salty, just rub the bag before opening and a lot of the salt falls off.  I'm on my second order :)
