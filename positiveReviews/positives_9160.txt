this is the best snack on the planet. every little molecule of this item is vi ating with the love that comes from growing, harvesting, making and distributing it in harmony with nature. it is soooo good. people think that just because it costs a little more than a bag of monocultured corn chips it's expensive, but in terms of the taste, of the nutrition, of the total value, it is not expensive. it's not cheap, but nothing green is, or should be.
