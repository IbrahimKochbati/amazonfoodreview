I have purchased about 12 of Keurig coffee makers for friends and family as presents.  I really enjoy the coffee makers.  All my recipients do.  My favorite variety of coffee is Caribou.  It is bold yet not harsh or bitter. I have tried a lot of varieties and find this the best.  Orders take a day or so more to come but the wait is worth it.
