Since flowers are mostly bought either for or by women, it seems self destructive to support someone who denigrates your entire customer base.  Not all of us have bought into the conservative war on women's health led by Rush and his Republican cronies., nor will we continue to support companies that do.          The personal attack made on a college student is unacceptable and I do not accept any apology from this misogynist bully.     I imagine my daughter in this position and go ballistic! All women are someone's daughter, wife or mother. How would you feel if these comments were made about your wife, mother or daughter?          Rush Limbaugh has been getting away with these kind of personal attacks for years... well no more.  The climate in this country is changing and we will not stand for this any more.
