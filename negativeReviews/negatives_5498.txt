Blue Sky Organic Root Beer is absolutely revolting, and tastes like cough medicine. A truly bad experience.     This beverage is beyond just awful, the taste and smell is so strange and bitter, that it is alarming! I was even wondering if I was having allergic reactions to it! It made me feel nauseas and sick to my stomach. And strangely, I wondered if it raised my blood pressure? I just read that too much licorice can do that.  Well, if that is the case, then there must be way too much licorice root in this stuff. So much licorice in fact, that the liquid is very thick (almost chewy) and dark  own in color. I felt excited for hours after drinking it. Whatever the nebulous "natural root beer flavor" is, it could very well be some type of rare herb that is dangerous to some people, like Ephedra or St. John's Wort for example. (Beware of potential drug interactions with unidentified herbs).     It was a surprise to drink this, because it doesn't taste like root beer to me at all. It tastes like crap. I could barely drink this stuff. I had to choke it down, and quite frankly, I felt like I was going to regurgitate it back up. I bought a whole 24 pack of it from Amazon before even testing it. A huge waste of money. I will never ever in my life by this product again, nor recommend it to anyone. What I do recommend though is:     A), never buy Blue sky Organic Root Beer.     B), Do some research first on root beer before buying it over the internet.     Subsequent to my purchase, I discovered several websites that rate the flavor of root beer on the internet, and Blue sky Organic Root Beer was at the bottom of every one. I have true "buyer's remorse" and regret after purchasing this product. I rate this product triple F !!!
