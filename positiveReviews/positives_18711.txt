I became addicted to this tea when the student run coffee shop chain started carrying it, and I being a lover of mango ordered this tea. It smells like vanilla, kicks like a black tea, and tastes like sweet am osia of the gods. It's not super fruity, but it's wonderfully complex for a tea. If you want something that tastes more mango, go with a straight fruit tea, or a white tea with mango, but for those of us that need a steady drip of C8H10N4O2, this is one of the most pleasant ways to consume it I've ever tasted.
