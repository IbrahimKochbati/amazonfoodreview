Bought this popcorn along with the Elite Popcorn maker.  Great taste, I like the fact that it has three separate pouches so you can vary the seasoning (I like mine salty so I use it all).  Can't be any easier to use, no measuring, popcorn & oil stay fresh because they are sealed.          Came back to add my review and got some great tips.  Such as actually heating the oil first instead of dumping it all in at once.  Also liked the tips of adding the oil before turning on the popper (always worried about melting plastic or burning my hand) and pouring the popcorn seasoning into a scoop to add to the popper.  Thanks to those who took the time to post the tips!
