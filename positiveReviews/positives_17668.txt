I love coffee and I usually drink dark roast.  This coffee is as good as any I have tasted.  Apparently, you do not have to sacrifice taste to get low acid. I gave some to my  other in law who has acid re flux.  He was impressed and would consider buying this  and in the future.  Now he can have a cup of coffee late in the evening instead of abstaining to avoid an uncomfortable night sleep.
