I really like this product to add to water so that I don't have to drink so much Gatorade and sweetened acidic beverages.  I use this because I have very low sodium levels and my doctors do not want me drinking "free water".          The only complaint I have is that it didn't arrive when promised and I didn't have it in time to take with me on vacation.
