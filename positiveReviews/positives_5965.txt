I have been a vegetarian for 15 years and have a meat eating husband.  For years, I have been looking for a good ground beef substitute.  I finally found one.  This one had a good taste and texture when cooked.  My meat eating husband is even happy with it when I use it.  One of the things I love is that I use this to make meatballs, and they stay together.  In the past, they never stayed together.  This is a great product, and I'm happy I found it.
