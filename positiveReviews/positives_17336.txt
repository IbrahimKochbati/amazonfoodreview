i ran across this over the winter and spread about 1 3 of it over a block of cream cheese and served it with crackers. guests ate it up and asked where i got it.          i quickly ran out and inadvertently threw the jar away before jotting down the name. went back to where i got it (an emporium), and it was gone. just found it again, and i am ordering several to have for parties as well as to give as gifts.          this stuff is fantastic!!!          i, too, am not a fan of spicy, but when you serve it on cream cheese, it keeps it calm for the palate.          highly recommended!!!
