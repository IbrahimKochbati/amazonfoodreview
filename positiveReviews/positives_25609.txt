The hibiscus tea is exactly as described and Amazon shipped the item very quickly. This newer packaging appears to be mylar or aluminum lined. This helps to keep the tea fresh between  ewings.          I bought it for its positive health benefits. Since drinking 3 to 4 cups a day my diastolic bp has decreased about 10 points and my cystolic bp has dropped about 8 points. To be completely transparent I am also drinking the same amount of Davison's Bulk Rooibos Tea per day.          Both teas taste great. The hibiscus smells like fragrant flowers and tastes just a bit sour but that's fine.  The rooibos has a different frangrance and tastes smoother and more delicate compared to the hibiscus.          I just ordered more rooibos tea and will order more hibiscus when the bag gets low.
