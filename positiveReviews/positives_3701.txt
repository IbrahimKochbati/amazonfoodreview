I am very happy I switched from a very popular dog food, sold in a lot of vets offices to Newmans about 3 years ago after a bout of stomach distress. All has been well with my fur baby ever since ; ) And to have it  ought right to my front door for cheaper than I can get it at the local store, how can you beat that?
