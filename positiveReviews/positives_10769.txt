I tried these out on my mom's older dog.  She is 13 years old and honestly, I think she would eat anything that doesn't eat her first.  Of course, she loved them.  She had no problem, despite her age, chewing these.  She is a Bichon Frise, so she's a small dog, but not a mini.          I also tried these on my sister's dog who is 1.5 years old. This dog is much pickier.  She has snubbed many treats in the past.  However, she LOVES these and gobbled them up.  She begins whining as soon as she sees you get the package out.  She is a Schnoodle (mini poodle mixed with schnauzer).  She is also a small dog, but not miniature.          I love that these treats are actually healthy for the dogs, and do not have a foul odor.  Doggy  eath is bad enough without stinky treats!
