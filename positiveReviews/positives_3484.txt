Boy , this was good. The aroma when you first open the package leaves one with great anticipation that you will soon be enjoying a great cup of java. Too often times , the result does not meet the expectations. Not so with the Melitta Cafe Collection ! The coffee was amongst the best I have ever tasted. Treat yourself to a fantastic splurge !
