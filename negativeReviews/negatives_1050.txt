First of all, when I opened my bag of Melitta decaf, it didn't have that strong, amazing rich coffee smell that my usual coffee has.  I  ewed up a pot in my drip coffeemaker, and while it was ok, there was nothing outstanding about the taste.  It was bland and unremarkable compared to the coffee I normally drink.
