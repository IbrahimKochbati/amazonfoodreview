The tea smell fresh while open the package, small portion is pretty enough. I soaked the petals into hot water without boiling and hoping to keep the ingredients alive, it turns out to be tasting so great that I need to add water for dilution, proving the product is originally ( well preserved) plus organic, can't complain. Highly recommend it.
