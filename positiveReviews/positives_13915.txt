As a regular all natural peanut butter eater, this product intrigued me with its low calories, and much lower fat. While the fat in natural peanut butter is the good kind (mono and poly) its nice to have a peanut butter that you can eat in larger quantities if desired without adding 40 grams of fat to your daily intake. I love th&eacute; cooking possibilities with this powder. It really tastes almost as good as other peanut butter... There's a slight difference I just can't put my finger on. But I enjoy it and recommend it.
