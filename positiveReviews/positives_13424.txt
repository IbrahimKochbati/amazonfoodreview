The first time I tried Newman's Own Organic Extra Bold K cup, I had used 10 ounces of water and thought the coffee to have a nice flavor but a little on the weak side.  Then one day I  ewed a cup of this coffee and forgot to set the water level to 10 ounces and with my Cuisinart coffee maker, 8 ounces is the default.  The result was a perfect cup of coffee, absolutely no bitterness, with a nice bold flavor that is not overwhelming.  I just wish it would taste like that with 10 ounces
