My two black labs love this, I mix the Eagle Pack in with their dry food and they eat like they are starving.  I was looking for canned dog food that I could order online and have delivered quickly.  Shipping was fast and I tried the Eagle Pack beef right away (before I had used up my other  and cans).  I found out about it on one of the dog food reviews that listed five star and down dog foods.  My dogs had been leaving food in their bowls and it wasn't like them so I started looking at reviews and ingredients and pricing.  This was one of the best for everything.  Doesn't matter what I think, my dogs love it and they look healthier! Another plus was that two of the flavors were Amazon Prime eligible.  Fast and convenient.
