I have occasional problems with heartburn, so when I saw that Puroast had released a coffee specially designed to be low acid, I was eager to try it, and I enlisted my husband as a willing co investigator.  Our verdict:  The coffee does indeed have a noticeably smoother, less acidy taste.  That's the good part.  However, I would characterize the taste  and I'm trying to be diplomatic here  as reminiscent of a slightly old coffee foil pack found in a three star hotel.  I'll admit to being somewhat of a Starbucks addict, and I don't think the Puroast will convince me to change.  However, I think it would be a good option to have on hand for times when my stomach is acting up but I still need my morning caffeine fix, and if my stomach forced me to where I had to choose between the Puroast low acid coffee or no coffee at all, I'd gratefully drink the Puroast.
