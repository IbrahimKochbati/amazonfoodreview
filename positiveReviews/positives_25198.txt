This was my original statement, but until Canada stops the  utal killings of the baby seals there I am boycotting all products from Canada. (I was so happy to find this organic maple syrup at such a reasonable price.  Pure maple syrup is so much better to use and being organic makes it even better.  Thank you for a great product at a great price!)
