I introduced this to my daughter and she ate it, no problems!  I certainly recommend it.  One suggestion which I believe helped me was that I DID warm this up. I realize it states you can serve these meal pouches "as is", however, I see a difference in my daughter's eagerness when I warm up the food vs. serving it at room temperature. I am very pleased with this product!
