This extract is perfect for adding heat in increments to recipies. It's not over kill like the 5 million 357 sauce but it can make it as hot as you can stand! My only complaint is that it is so dark in color that it tinges everything red. But hey, beggers cant be choosers. I use a eye dropper to give me fine controll over how much I use. for smaller batches of food three drops usually does good. Where I might use five with larger quantities like a jamabalya. There is is pleanty of room to adjust as your heat tolerance grows. At this rate the bottle should last a year or so. By the time I am done maybee I will be ready for the 357.
