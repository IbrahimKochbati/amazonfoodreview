I grew up eating sourpower straws belts as a child with my best friends, and it came to my surprise that Amazon even sold these. I quickly purchased it ($15 for 150, that's only 10 cents each!) and the shipping was fast as usual. 150 sourpower belts that are individually wrapped is more than worth the price tag. It had the same great taste and sourness that only sourpower could provide. Highly RECOMMEND these to anyone who likes sourpower products or sour tasting candy.
