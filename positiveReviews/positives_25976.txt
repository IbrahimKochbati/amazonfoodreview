My wife can't eat popcorn because of the hulls.  However, we found Pirates Booty with White Cheddar (there are other flavors too) which tasts just about like popcorn with white cheddar on it.  This stuff is great.  Seems like the stores are always out, so we bought it by mail order.  12, 4 oz. bags.  Say, thats a big box.  But really, they are crisp, tasty, baked so there's no oily fingers.  We both highly recommend it.  Check them out: [...].
