Deep River Salt & Vinegar chips are thick and crunchy.  Very tart.  So tart that I can't eat them alone. They are perfect with a sandwich though. These chips are well coated with the seasonings, maybe too much seasonings for some folks tastes.  I suggest buying a small bag before purchasing a large quantity of these.  They aren't for everyone.  Enjoy!
