This is some of the worst stuff I've ever tried to drink. It's even worse than that awful stuff that comes out of those machines where the cup drops down and fills it. I tried it on the various cup size settings with my Keurig machine and it just goes from bad to horrible when going from the larger size to the smallest.          It's a complete waste of money.          I just tried another  and that's similar and it's no good either. If you like chocolate water, buy these. If you have it in mind that you are buying "Hot Chocolate" with a milky or creamy flavor... that's not what this stuff is.          Yuck!
