Pretty close to the taste of a freshly opened coconut.  I'd like to know more about the process for obtaining this water to understand what the "natural coconut water" means.  The tasty juicy bits of pulp in the product add an extra complexity and make this a very refreshing beverage.  The fresh coconut is jelly like and not so pulpy, but it's still tasty.
