The first box 12 pack i ordered seemed not as crisp as what i had purchased in a store. But the next box was clearly uncrunchey, stale, soggy tasting. I see 2003 mentioned on the packages. Although i very much like the product normally, i'd be afraid to order it from Amazon again, as there are no returns on foods. I couldn't find an Amazon address for complaints, which is why i'm doing the review. The product obviously sat too long in someones warehouse.          Amazon quickly replaced my order with a box of fresh crunchy crunchitos. Very good. I'll probably order again.
