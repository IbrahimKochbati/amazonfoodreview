I bought this jerky for my husband because he loves jerky and spicy food (this one seemed like a no  ainer based on the reviews). To be honest, he was thrown off by the very  ight red color when he originally got it and let the jerky sit for a few days while he worked up the courage to try it ( ight red, chipotle, habanero, it was a little intimidating). Once he tried it, he fell in love. It's soft, tender, flavorful, not too salty, in essence, in his words, it's like "spicy carne asada, and not the junk, tough carne asada you get at the tex mex places". It's all he can do to only eat one piece, he loves it!  Well worth the price.
