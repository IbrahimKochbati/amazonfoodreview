My daughter came home a few days ago from a playdate with a another couple of six year olds. One of the moms had these in a few flavors and they were a hit. They mainly taste of the seasoning, and if someone gave you one blindfolded, you swear it was just some normal bit of chex mix.          I'd rather my kiddo was eating bugs with some nutrition, vs. the same amount of candy.          I say give it a try, what the hey!
