This coffee is just great.  Not overpowering, but still relatively complete, even when  ewed as a "large" cup, or even 2X small    many of the K cups come out tasting thin when you do this, but not this one!  It's so mellow that some may find it to be lacking in unique personality, and I suppose that being a "medium bodied" blend, it doesn't shout out anything at the drinker.  Still, this is a very nice, all around coffee that is great for everyday drinking.
