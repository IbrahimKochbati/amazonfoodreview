Just discovered this great tasting healthy crunchy snack & recommend it to anyone who wants a tasty addition to their veggie beans peas legumes options. For this recently diagnosed Diabetic, it's perfect   ingredients list is short & recognizable with no added sugars, carbs are only what naturally occurs in the peas, & a just right hot spice blend of garlic & peppers.  The 1st green peas I've ever loved!  Even more impressive, my health food resistant pre teen agrees.
