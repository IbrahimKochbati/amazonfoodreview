The packaging was not what I expected. Mine came in a  own paper bag, not foil like the picture indicates. For freshness I thought it would come in the foil. What I did for freshness is I had to buy a airtight dark container for mine and transfer it over to it. Keeping it in the  own paper bag was and is a stealer of freshness.
