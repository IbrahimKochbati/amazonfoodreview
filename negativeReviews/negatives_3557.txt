This was not your usual granola bar looking snack.  It was somewhat misshapen making it look more home made.  It was soft which was a plus.  I liked the coconut.  My son, two of my grandchildren and my wife did not like the coconut.  On first glance it seemed yummy, what is not to like about oat, chocolate and coconut?  Obviously in my family the coconut was a negative.  Son liked the taste but not the coconut. Wife didn't like the taste and neither did the 5 & 7 year old grandchildren.  If you are looking for a gluten free non dairy snack and have no issues with coconut or calories this is a good choice.  The 180 calories put it about 40 calories higher than our favorite granola bar and 80 calories higher than my favorite snack bar.  Uber sensitive son was dismayed with the lack of protein and he was concerned about the 9grams of fat.          Wrapping it up, for a gluten free snack it is pretty good but if you are not concerned about gluten you probably will want a different snack.          Addendum:the counter woman at my favorite pizza place is on a gluten free diet and loved them.  So that confirms it, as a gluten free snack it got the prize!
