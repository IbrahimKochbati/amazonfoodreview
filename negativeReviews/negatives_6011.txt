I love making Thai food, so I use fish sauce fairly often. I'm used to using Thai Kitchen  and, but I recently moved and my local grocery stores don't carry it, so I picked up A Taste of Thai since it was the only fish sauce I could easily find.  All I can say is that this stuff is SO salty that I could barely eat the food I made.  That's pretty bad considering I used less than the amount I usually use because I wasn't sure what to expect.  If you buy this  and and you aren't used to it, be aware that you will need to start with JUST A TINY AMOUNT and then taste your food.  Do not add what a recipe calls for or what you're used to adding, because you will ruin your meal!
