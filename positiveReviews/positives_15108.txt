I searched for a food that wasn't full of preservatives and fillers, and didn't cost $5 a pound.  I did alot of research and read alot of labels.  I have a Siberian Husky pup, and Canidae has really proven itself to me.  As a former conissour of cheap discount store dog foods, I have finally realized the advantages of feeding a natural premium food.  My dogs poop doesnt really stink!  True!  Poop is still poop, but the smell is minimal.  I have noticed it also quickly disinigrates into the ground when it rains.  With the cheap food, it smelled like rank dog poop! Would make you retch and gag!  And there was so much of it!  Less poop, firmer stools with barely any odor, less food consumed per day.  AND NO BAD BREATH from your dog! A food that swells up when wet is also undesirable.  Flint River Ranch  and and Canidae both stay intact, avoiding the bloat factor. I learned, you can learn too!  It's also an excellent value   Try Canidae, you'll see!
