We love this  ead. It is so easy to make, tastey, and a lot less expensive to buy than pre made hamburger or hot dog buns. The  ead is a little chewy, which we love, but soft enough for a child to enjoy. I buy Chebe on Amazon because I can buy several boxes at a time at a price cheaper than a grocery store.
