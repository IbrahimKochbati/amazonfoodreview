I don't enjoy this blend much, but as another reviewer mentioned perhaps it needs a Melitta coffee maker for it's full potential.          I've made 3 pots:          First I followed the instructions (2 level teaspoons per 6 ounces). I got  own colored water.          Then I doubled it. Tasted kind of like a cheap grocery store canned  and.          Finally I filled a #4 filter about 1 3 full to about 9 oz of water. That produced the best results, but I still just wasn't thrilled with the flavor.          So you know where my taste in coffee is coming from, I normally drink medium roast (which this is), so that isn't the issue. I do normally grind my own, but again pre ground won't cause that big of a difference. My preferred daily coffee is Safeway house  and medium roast Colombian, but lately due to finances I've been drinking a dollar store  and called "Eight O'Clock" that's of similar (though different) quality to the Melitta.          My suggestion is if you'd like a quality coffee in this price range look at Seattle's Best (Starbucks milder step child) or if you have a Safeway their house  and beans are quite good.          Edit: I compared the Melitta today with a similar Millstone (Medium Roast Colombian Supremo). The Millstone was much better.
