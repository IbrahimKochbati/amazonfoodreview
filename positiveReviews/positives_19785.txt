I am on a highly salt restricted diet (and potassium too.) I have End Stage Renal Failure, or kidney failure, so on dialysis. Also diabetic so my overall diet is extremely restricted. This is the first 'salt' substitute that acctually has a salty taste. Most others use potassium which is a poor substitute, or various herbs and spices to make up for the missing salt. They add flavors to be sure, but still no salt like kick of flavor enhancement. It's too bad Amazon doesn't also sell the 1 pound package, that has to be obtained from the small manufacturer, which right now is extremely backlogged. Took me 4 months to get my direct order of the 1 pound package, but a great price saving for everyday use. If it is hard giving up salt, try Table Tasty, I think you will like it.
