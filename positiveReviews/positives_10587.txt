These pork rinds taste very good and it's a great value. I have found that the trick to cooking these is to not put too many on a plate at once. Literally 10   12 "disks" is the max I cook at once and they turn out great. I have found that if I try to cook too many at once they either take a very long time to puff up (5 minutes) or when they cook, they don't puff all the way, leaving the hardened bits that previous reviewers mentioned. Once you get the cooking down right, they're a great snack!
