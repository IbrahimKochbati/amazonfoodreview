I purchased a hot air popcorn popper because my kids love popcorn, and it's a healthy snack.          I 'accidentally' ordered the white popcorn, having no idea what I was doing, and I have to say that no other popcorn compares. We went through the entire container. When I re ordered, I decided to try the regular yellow popcorn, and it just wasn't the same. If I could describe the difference, I would say that yellow popcorn tastes 'stale' in comparison. The white popcorn tastes crisper and more fresh.          As for the flavor, well, we use Kernel Seasons seasoning generously, so we don't taste much more than the cheddar cheese :)          I'm considering giving the rest of this yellow popcorn tub away so I have an excuse to buy another tub of the white popcorn.          For how we eat it, this popcorn is absolutely the best!          NOTE: I also recommend the Misto oil spray. We use this and Kernel seasons as a healthy alternative to butter.
