Light and refreshing.  But if you are looking for an alternative to soda,  sorry, but this is pretty much soda. I appreciate the fact that it is 100% natural, and has a full complement of Vitamin C. And I actually like the fact that it isn't too sweet, nor too tart. No added sugar, but plenty of "fruit sugars". In the end, though . . it's a soda. My 6 year old loved it.
