After 3 weeks the result is very good.  I have 2 cockpoos, who both developed food allergies at the same time.  One ear infections and the other diarrhea.  We bought allergy ZD for 2 years until deciding, we needed to try something less expensive.  Avoderm seems to be the food for them. Solid normal colored bowel movements and knock on wood no ear infections.  Fingers crossed.
