Having spent the last couple of years working toward a whole foods and organic diet we still need a few more things.  Sometimes the price is very prohibitive, and we still don't know if it's worth the cost.  After looking at the reviews on this product, I went for it.  I'm very glad I did.  Making my own cheap version of maple syrup might do in a pinch, but it will never replace the great taste of this syrup and I will definitely buy it again.  I like the fact that if you must have sweets, something a bit more pure is well worth it.  Especially when it comes to children.  My little toddler grandson was very ill, including an emergency ambulance ride to the local hospital.  We had great difficulty feeding him anything.  I used a loaf of soaked grain  ead to make an egg milk mixture of baked french toast casserole.  Of course I topped it off with this great syrup.  Everyone was amazed that I helped him get his appetite back, but really, after the third plate, I think it was the syrup that did it.  Just a light drizzle swirled over the top made it perfect.  The only thing I would change about this is if I could buy it in a 20 gallon bucket.
