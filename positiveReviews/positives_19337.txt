These are not as chewy as the ones I have bought in bulk from the store, but that is likely due to the packaging and being fresh (not sitting in open bulk bins).  They taste great though; they made me make a pucker face, and as they are individually wrapped I am not over eating them till my tongue is sore like I do with bulk belts.  I was trying to find a product that I could take on road trips, and that is not made with high fructose corn syrup or made in China. These Sour Power belts are made in Holland and distributed through Dorval Trading in NY. The size of each belt is 3 4 x 7.5 inches. The ingredients listed on this page are exactly what is on the product label.
