Let me start out by saying that one can of Switch just wasn't enough...at least not when you're sharing it!! In order to properly review this, I had my children join me in a little taste test of this product. Well, the best litmus test of whether something is good or not...is if your kids want more. And mine both did...but I wasn't sharing any more of this delicious drink. No sir, I'm happy to report that the remainder of this libation was imbibed by yours truly.          I'm not generally of big fan of the carbonated juice drinks, but Switch could switch my mind. The kiwi strawberry taste was just right...not too sweet and blended well with the carbonation for a drink that was tasty and refreshing. In fact, this drink would be great for a hot day or after a workout when you want something with some bite and don't really want or need another soda.          This is good stuff...get some.
