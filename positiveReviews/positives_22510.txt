This popcorn not only tastes great but pops very well.  There are some unpopped kernels, but I believe that's normal with any  and.  In reading a few of the other reviews, some noted it didn't pop well.  I went through that phase too but found out it was a problem with my popper.  Once that was fixed, the popcorn popped up a storm!  Many friends who have visited my home theater have commented on what good flavor the Great Northern Popcorn has  and it has a great price too.  Highly recommended.
