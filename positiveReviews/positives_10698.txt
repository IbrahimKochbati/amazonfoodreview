My PBGV enjoys these dog treats. After he sits to get one, he carries it off to another room to eat it. This is because the cookie is a bit large and he wants to enjoy it in private. That, as far as I can see, is the only downside to this product. It would be better if the treats were smaller and could be handed out more frequently. The would be better at about 1 6 the current size.
