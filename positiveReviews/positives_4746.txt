Found these at a local grocery store and just about fell in love with them.  Their taste is fresher and most of the seeds live up to their name.  I got original, ranch and sizzlin bacon   they're all great!  When my grocery store told me they got Bigs as a one time deal, I was happy to find them at Amazon.  If you're a seeder you've gotta try these.
