This has a full, lush flavor.  I'm no expert but I've tried many varieties and I really like Pompeian.  Like someone else said, I too got a great price at the time of purchase, just under ten bucks.  A different reviewer said she was so sad this  and wasn't available at her local grocery store.  I'M so sad I didn't buy more from Amazon when the price was so good.
