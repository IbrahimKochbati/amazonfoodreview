I found this dog food after doing research to help my dogs allergies (2 goldens).          My dog had terrible allergies,  she has been on Canidae all life stages for about 5 weeks now.          No more itching, scratching, ear infections and vomiting. Their fur is silky & they are so happy & healthy.          Use the food cost calculator. your dog eats less of this than many of the garbage filled  ands. They also offer coupons on their web site. It really isn't that expensive.          If you have cats we have switched ours to the felidae and can also highly recommend it.
