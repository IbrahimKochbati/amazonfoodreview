This is one of the few cereals that I find very tasty just on its own as a snack or as dessert. Crunchy with a  nice cinnamon flavor. It is very sweet, however   I prefer to mix it with something such as Cheerios when eating it for  eakfast since the sugar can be overpowering as you get close to the bottom of the bowl.          Good value if you can get it on an Amazon price dip and or when they run a promo.
