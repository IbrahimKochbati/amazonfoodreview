I used to have the worst heartburn when I drank coffee. I know how bad it can be when you are craving the  ew but don't want heartburn, acid reflux or stomach irritation problems. This Puroast Low Acid Coffee is a wonderful alternative to other the other coffees out there. The taste is smooth and is far from bitter. I would recommend making it just a bit stronger but mainly that's because how I like my coffee. You could also add your own extra flavoring, to each their own. I think it works good as a base coffee. If you are looking to still have a cup of coffee without sacrificing your health give this one a try!
