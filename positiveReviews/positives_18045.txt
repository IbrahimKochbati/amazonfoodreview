                   Update 08 20 2012                 I'm still drinking this same k cup on a daily basis.  It is still my favorite                                                                    I got to say that I was initially not a huge fan of the idea of k cups.  I didn't like the "pod" coffee and I thought it would just be a passing phase.  When I saw Keurig machines and K Cups, I immediately snubbed them and marked them off as silly waste of counter space and could not hold a torch to the tried and true drip coffee maker.          I could go on for quite some time about why I purchased a Keurig, but you aren't here reading these reviews because you want to know if you want one, you already got one and you are now searching for a strong solid cup of day to day coffee.  No "french vanilla" or "tiger mint" or whatever, you just want a cup of black stuff that would make the Marlboro man crack a smile and say "Damn, that's a fine cup of joe you  ewed Mr."          I  ew this on a small cup setting (standard cup size), no creme or sugar, and usually have 1 a day on my way to work and 2 on the weekends.  I don't know how well it tastes with sugar creme but it tastes fantastic without.  If you aren't sure what to expect, think of what a house blend would taste like if McDonald's coffee and Starbucks coffee beans were mixed together.  There is no aftertaste but it still has a thick bite to it.  Hard to explain.          This can be found for a relatively good price, I buy them at roughly .41cents a cup which is fine with me, only spending $200 on coffee a year is a great habit in my opinion.  I was paying more each year on beans by the bag.  I could have spread the beans out more but I never had good luck with  ewing small cups on a drip coffeemaker.          .41 cents vs. going to a coffeshop and spending well over twice that   win, plus it tastes great  D          Definitely add this k cup to your collection if you are a fan of house blends
