These are good, but a bit skimpy on the candy coating. The ones I get at my supermarket have a thicker layer of "yogurt" coating, but the store doesn't carry them that often. So I keep these on hand just in case the urge strikes and my local store is out.  I love the combination of crispy salty pretzel with creamy yogurt flavored candy coating.
