I eat  own rice at least 4 times a week. This product was definitely an excellent buy for my needs. However there are two things you should consider: do you eat rice as much as I do? If not, you can expect your  own rice to go rancid in about 4 6 months.          Secondly and most importantly, DO NOT ORDER THIS FROM AMAZON. They have jacked the price up. Order directly from the honeyvillgrain website... Also their shipping is only $4.49 anywhere in the U.S (no matter the weight or size)...
