I love the sweet ginger peach tea. I drink a cup every morning before I go to work and every night before I go to bed. I love it so much that when all of the local grocery stores stopped carrying it, I drove to another city to buy it. And when that store stopped carrying it, I bought it here on Amazon, or so I thought.          Turns out that only half of the boxes actually contained Sweet Ginger Peach Tea. Inside of each box is a sealed bag.     Last night I opened a box of tea, and opened the bag, made a cup of tea, and promptly spit it out.     It wasn't Sweet Ginger Peach tea at all. I couldn't figure it out. I pulled the bag out of the box to find out my box had been filled with a bag of Earl Grey Lavendar tea. Gross.          I promptly opened another box to find the same thing. Out of the case of tea, half of it was Earl Grey Lavendar.          If this case had been the Sweet Ginger Peach Tea, I would rate it five stars and tell everyone how lovely and soothing it is. But since the order was filled with boxes whose contents had been switched with something completely different, all I can do is say, save your money and your time and order elsewhere.          EDIT!! After reading my complaint, Amazon refunded the full cost of the tea to my charge card. Their e mail stated that they are going to investigate the issue with the packaging. I did not expect such a quick response. Hopefully they will get the issues straightened out and I can once again order this lovely tea!! Love AMAZON
