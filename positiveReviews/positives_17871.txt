It has been a heck of a long time since I have had a Shake n Bake anything, and I forgot how easy they are to make.  You just get some thinly sliced pork chops, put them plus the shake n bake in a sealed container, shake it to apply a good coating, then pop it in the oven.  The result is a nice chop that has a little coating like it was "fried" without the "fry" greasy component.  It's also pretty tasty.  If you are in a hurry and   or want to try something a little different, give this a try.          My young kids thought this was great and something different than the 8 or so meals we seem to rotate with during the month: it's hard enough to get them to try something new, and I was glad they liked it so now we can add this to some sort of dinner rotation.          About the only "complaint" I have is it is a little salty   combined with the salt portions in pork, I woke up pretty thirsty in the middle of the night.
