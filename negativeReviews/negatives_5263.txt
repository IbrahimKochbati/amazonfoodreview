I wanted to like the Whole Wheat Shells & Cheddar.  I really did.  But the sauce really is quite watery and bland, even with adding the optional butter margarine.  Alone, cooked per instructions, my kids wouldn't eat this.  I certainly couldn't feed it to kid guests used to traditional mac n cheese.  But I discovered that if I mixed in some leftover spaghetti sauce it becomes quite tasty.  I use a jarred sauce added to  owned ground beef.  Now that makes a very hearty and tasty meal.
