I picked up a couple of these while I was visiting my  other in LA. When I took my first bite, I thought, "Hey, these kind of taste like a ritz cracker! Cool!"          The second and third cracker though, I noticed a really starchy, floury taste coming through. I looked at the ingredients. Corn starch was the first ingredient.          I tend not to like gluten free products made mostly from corn starch. They are light, sure, but kind of flavorless and powdery if you chew for any length of time.          Brown rice flour or millet gives such a great depth of flavor, and it's an actual whole grain, not just a grain after all the protein and nutrients are taken out. Even white rice flour would be better.          Corn starch, however is cheaper so I think that's why it gets used a lot.          If you liked white flour, starchy foods before you went gluten free you might like these. If you prefer whole grains or even actual flour (not just the starch) I would try something else. I like Christie's multigrain crackers or  own rice thins.
