This doesn't taste as addicting as the real fried potato chips, but it's still very good.     Considering it's low in calories and it's only popped..  it taste much better than the ones that are freeze dried.     These pops taste as light as the rice crispy treats, but with a good amount of flavor and crunch.     I like it, a small little pack that you can just grab when you feel like having something quick.     I keep then in my room in case if I ever get the cravings for chips.     All the flavors that come in are good too, no complains.          The package also arrived fast and it's pretty cheap, I would recommend people who is watching calories to get this!
