I'm going to be honest here, I was intrigued by the marketing, packaging and general assumption that this treat would at least somewhat taste like peanut butter, after all, I only give my dog the best. I consider myself a first line of defense of sorts for my dog. After purchasing this product, I was sitting in my car and my curiosity got the better of me. I tried one. It didn't taste bad, but it definitely didn't taste like peanut butter AT ALL. Zero peanut butter taste. How does a company get away with such blatant false advertisement like this. It's shocking, shocking I say.          But in all seriousness, there is no peanut butter flavor at all. Why say it when it's not true?          Dog still loves them though. But then again, the only thing he doesn't like is olives.
