So I am the proud owner of an almost 80 lb. 1 year old lab mix whose sole mission in life is to seek and destroy.  I have been looking for toys that would hold his interest longer than the 5 minutes it takes him to rip them to pieces, and saw this at my local pet store, but in the small size.  I was thrilled to see the larger size on Amazon, and ordered it.  This is a toy for smart dogs, and, of course, I like to think my dog is smart.  However, he may be too smart.  Gave it to my dog tonight.  It was interesting to watch him try to figure out how to get the treats out, and he seemed occupied.  I walked away to leave him to his work.  10 minutes later, he had chewed through the rope coming out of the top of the bottle.  He cheated.  This had potential to be an awesome, time consuming toy to same some of my sanity.  Unfortunately, if you have a strong chewer, or a dog who can figure out the short cuts, save your money.
