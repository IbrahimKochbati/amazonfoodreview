I had been making roasted potatos with lipton onion dip mix and was concerned since the sodium levels were so high, I tried this product since it was low in sodium 4 of these packs equal sodium of 1 lipton pack.  I had to use 2 packs of this product to get same taste but it was still a healthier verison.  I would buy again
