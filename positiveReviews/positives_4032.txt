I've had luck with this seed and all the other packets I've purchased from Botanical Interests (the company that makes it).     Right now, the packet's over a year old and I recently planted another pot and had a high germination rate in about two days and it was about three inches tall in four days.     The cats love it. They ate so much I planted yet another pot.     Having the grass around deters our cats from gnawing on strange things, like plastic, especially when they are having digestive problems.
