My baby loves this food.  At whole foods they sell the same flat for 10.99 and thats retail.  I ordered this and just received it today.  I hadn't even opened package and I could smell a rotten smell coming from box. I opened it to find jar smashed and mold everywhere! I'm so disgusted and can't believe I waited over a week for this to arrive.  What a waste of my time.  The worst part is I ordered the fruit flat as well and also a  oken jar and rotten mold everywhere.  I don't get how this happens the  shipping box isn't dented or damaged neither is the flat box.  So what someone packaged and sent a smashed and rotting shipment? Not a happy customer!
