This coffee has a robust flavor with hints of chocolate undertones and a somewhat earthy nose. It's not  ight or winey like Kenya or Columbian coffees, but it's also not as heavy as a Sumatra. Classique is called a medium blend, and it would be a good after dinner coffee. I drank the coffee by itself, but it would have the body to stand up to a sweet dessert. The mouthfeel was a bit on the heavy side, but the coffee did not leave a bitter taste in my mouth. I think Classique is a little on the heavy side for a  eakfast coffee, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. A 5 star coffee would be good to drink at any time.
