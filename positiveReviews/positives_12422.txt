I can honestly say that this is THE BEST oatmeal I have ever eaten.  I am having a hard time locating it in NC.  Costco used to carry it but doesn't carry it any longer.  The shipping charges on the company's website are too high, hopefully I'll find it somewhere in my travels.  I HIGHLY recommend it.
