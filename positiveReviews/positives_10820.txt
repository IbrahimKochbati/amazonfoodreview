I spend plenty of time looking for healthy organic snacks for my wife & myself, so why not do the same for the family dog? Mom's toy poodle Beau took to these Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats straightaway. Most of his treats are quite soft, so he got a kick out of crunch from these hard biscuits. Further, all his treats to date have been beef flavored, so the organic lamb & barley taste is a very nice change of pace. The ingredients are all natural, with no fillers or junk to be found, which made us all very pleased. Our Beau is a little guy, so we did find we needed to  eak the biscuits up so he could really enjoy them & you may want to do the same if you have a smaller  eed dog. Otherwise, these Newman's Own dog treats are very highly recommended! Leave it to "Pa" and Nell Newman to go all the way to New Zealand to find a great snack for dogs!!
