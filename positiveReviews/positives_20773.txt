I was a bit nervous buying something in bulk when I didn't know what it might taste like, but I've had NOH products before, and they didn't sell the Korean BBQ marinade in the Chinatown stores I frequent.          The first time I made it (with red meat) my husband said he loved it, but I didn't get to taste it until a couple days later. Bad idea, he confirmed. The taste was so completely different than when first cooked. Probably could've given myself food poisoning, too.          The second and third and fourth time, we grilled the chicken after marinating it overnight. Bad idea. I still had no clue on taste because the charcoal taste overpowered it completely. Waste of marinade.          This week, I tried marinating chicken and placed in freezer for 2 weeks. Let thaw and marinate for 2 days in fridge. This time I just baked it. The aroma and flavor was tremendous. My picky 2 year old even loved it. And this time, two days later, it was still super tasty.          My only warning is that the packet STINKS when it's first opened. That's not how it tastes, nor how it smells once it is reconstituted with water. That first whiff is just horrible, but the flavor is great.          Is it true Korean BBQ? Um...it's the Hawaiian version of it. Still super tasty, but maybe not 100% authentic.
