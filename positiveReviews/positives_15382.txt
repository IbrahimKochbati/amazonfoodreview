When my cat Tyger was diagnosed with Feline Bladder Disorder, there were many limits on the foods he could eat. He also would not eat anything that wasn't pate formulated.  Then I found Indoor Chicken Pate which he loves and also his sister loves.  Thank goodness for Amazon as none of the stores in my area carry this product.   "
