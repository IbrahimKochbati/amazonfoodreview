If you like your coffee more than your coffe likes you, then Puroast Low Acid French Roast is worth trying.  The  ew is clean and you can really taste the difference between this and regular coffee.  This  ew is dark, like a good French Roast, but maybe not as strong as regular French Roast, so try using a little less water.
