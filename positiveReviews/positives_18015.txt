This is a great product for those of us that want to kick start the day without the extra poundage. My first order was flawless. However, my second order never got here. After a month and a half of waiting I rated the experience with two stars. The vendor, responded promptly and resent the order overnight. I have no problem moving the rating back up to 5 stars with this type of customer care.          And, the formula for this great morning kick start?     1 cup skim milk in blender     2 heaping tablespoons of Hill Bros. Skinny Latte     Put the blender on mix     Use a sixteen ounce glass     After 40 seconds add 6 ice cubes and blend for a minute     Pour into glass. Add a dolop of Hersey's liquid chocolate     Top with fat free Reddiwip if desired.     Kick back and let your taste buds do the talking!
