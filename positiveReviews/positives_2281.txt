I used this mix to make a 9x13 cake in a glass pan using grapeseed oil, spring water, and free range eggs.  I thought the cake had a nice flavor to it but it was not what I was expecting.  I was craving a white cake (like wedding cake) and went to my local store to find something wheat free, gluten free and dairy free; I purchased this vanilla cake mix.  I think it is a very good mix.  I couldn't really taste the vanilla flavor but thought it had a nice flavor.  The cake is yellow, dense (but not like a pound cake) and texture y like  own rice has more texture than white rice.  I thought the sweetness was just right.  I think I would purchase again but would make pineapple upside down cake with it.
