While I didn't like this flavor as well as the black cherry, it was still quite good.  Had a nice fruity taste and not overly sweet, probably because there is no added sugar.  You won't miss the sugar and neither will your kids.  This is a good alternative to regular soda for the kids because it doesn't have all the additives that soda does.  It's basically carbonated fruit juice.  It's 100% juice, so you get a nice dose of Vitamin C (100% daily allowance according to the can).  Adults will enjoy it too.  The can is 8.3 oz., which is smaller than a 12 oz soft drink, but it is just enough to satisfy your soda craving, without filling you or your kids up too much.  Sugar is sugar whether naturally occurring in juice or added, so these are not health drinks, but are great alternatives to the much more sugar and additive laden sodas.
