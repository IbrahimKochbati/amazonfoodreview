My dog is 3 and he has been chewing and licking his paws for as long as I can remember.  Probably half his day was spent chewing and licking.  He has had many steroid shots and has been taking claritin twice a day for several months.  Nothing has worked....I decided to try this dog food before taking him to a specialist and it has been amazing.  He has been eating the salmon and potatoes formula exclusively for about a week and a half and now he is hardly ever licking his paws!!!  Today I even skipped his claritin and he has not licked his paws all day.  No more grains for my dog!
