Loved the original!  Hate this new recipe.  It was fine to have alternative recipes   weight control (BS BTW), less sugar.  But, to make the alternative the only option a consumer can buy??? Horrible decision and even worse product.  I could not even eat one bowl of this mess.  it is so far off the mark that I would rather go hungry than attempt to eat this crap!  My dog could make a better batch of oatmeal with some kibbles and her butt!  This product is a disgrace and should be taken off the store shelves   never allowed to return!
