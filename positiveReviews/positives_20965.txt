My husband and I love this tea because of its rich, tangy flavor and fragrant aroma.  We are also watching our weight and find that a mug of this tea helps curb our appetites; it gives us the feeling of being full and also is so enjoyable to drink. In addition, it's caffeine free and we can have a cup late into the evening without concern about being kept awake.
