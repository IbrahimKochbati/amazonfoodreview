It's not a traditional BBQ sauce in terms of flavor, but you could easily use it for that. It's very thick and has a strong hotness (not too hot   but hotter than most spicy BBQ sauce) and it's made from much better ingredients than most BBQ or sweet hot sauces. It tastes very fruity rather than sugary sweet. It would be great on almost anything grilled or stir fried, and it's incredible in pork and beans. Don't let the price scare you away from this outstanding condiment.
