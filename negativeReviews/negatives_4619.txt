My boxer enjoyed the treat, though after eating it she drank a bowl full of water.  Maybe it had a lot of sodium.  The real surprise came the next day though when she suffered a loss of bowel control; she's never went #2 in the house since we got her over a year ago.  Afterwards, we took her on a hike and she couldn't seem to stop "going", had 7 bowel movements on a 2 mile hike; and they were very watery.  She's still not acting back to her normal self.  I guess it makes sense; I wouldn't trust a butcher from a group of people whom I know to be cannibals, why should I trust dog treats made in countries that eat dogs?
