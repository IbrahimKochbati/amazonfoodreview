The other reviews of the Walden Farms BBQ Sauce made it sound like something you would scrape off the bottom of your shoe, wipe on your meat and promptly barf.  I, however was pleasantly surprised to find the Original Sauce to be very tasty.  The spice level was well balanced with the acidity and sweetness.  No chemical aftertaste of Splenda.  I am a foodie, but my doctor has me on a ridiculously low calorie diet for the next few months.  After the past three weeks, I was desperate for variety and this fit the bill perfectly!  Bare in mind, this is NOT regular barbeque sauce though.  It is thinner, but what would you expect from a no calorie, no carb sauce?  If you are needing variety in your menu, give this a try.  You might just find an unexpected delight!
