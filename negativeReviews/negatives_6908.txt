This is my opinion. I was hoping that it would taste like a knock off Mountain Dew. Much to my surprise it tasted like an energy drink. If you think Mountain Dew and Red Bull taste the same you are nuts. I am not a fan to the taste of energy drinks that is the reason of the low score. To finish the bottle I have mixing it with Jagermeister. I do enjoy there other energy flavor    "
