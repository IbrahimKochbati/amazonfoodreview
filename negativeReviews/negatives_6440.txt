The ryvita was still within the "best enjoyed before" date of 12.2010 but is not crisp. I am having to put it in the oven to crisp it up. However it was purchased at a reduced price so for future purchases I shall be wary of "sale" items.     I do love ryvita though and love the order coming to my door so quickly.
