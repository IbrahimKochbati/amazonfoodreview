Exactly what I wanted. My parents have an upgraded version, but I'm perfectly content with this mid range unit.          One thing to note, if you look at the picture of the box, there's a coupon there for a free box of coffee, which you cannot use   it's to be used only in conjunction with a physical purchase of the unit, which is kind of a bummer, to be honest.  But to be fair, it's not listed as part of the description, only something you'd notice if, like me, you looked at the picture of the box very closely before your purchase.          I'm hoping it holds up well, because all of a sudden I am drinking A LOT more coffee!          UPDATE: GRRR! So. Many. Problems.  First problem was all of a sudden it started making super weak coffee   Xtra bold, french roast, whatever, it was weak.  A little googling suggested that maybe the seal wasn't tight at the top needle. A bit of fiddling with the silicon doughnut seal seemed to fix that. I was back in love.  (FWIW, Keurig's customer service just sent me a free box of coffee as their "fix.") Now in the last week it's begun the dreaded "half cup" syndrome.  I've only had it about a month and had already descaled (attempting to fix the weak coffee problem from before), but descaled again and cleaned the needles, and that seems to help, for about four cups. Then the damn thing  ews half cups again. Grrrrr.  I suspect it'll be on its way back to Keurig this week   thank goodness I remembered to register & kept the box.          I'm sorry folks, but for the price of these things I expect better. Much better   like a unit that works. Imagine how picky I am.
