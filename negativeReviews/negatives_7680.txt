I am a big fan of home made cookies, particularly chocolate and oatmeal cookies. I also will eat an occasional Chips Ahoy cookie. The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Chocolate Almond is okay but I would likely never buy them. The taste is not as good as the homemade or Chips Ahoy and I not fond of the texture as well. They are a bit bland and not that soft. They are also filled with the usual large list of chemicals found in most commercial products of this type. I realize they must be preserved to last for months and must retain their softer texture through artificial means. I will likely finish the box I have, but cannot really recommend them.
