She didn't like slicked food, or bits, etc. unless I chopped them more. The pate is perfect consistancy tho I still have to add a little hot water and make it a bit more soupy. I don't know if she has bad teeth or just wants her food the temperature of a dead critter. However she will eat any of the pates and thats a miracle.
