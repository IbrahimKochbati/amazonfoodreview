I have loved Honey Nut Cheerios for as long as I can remember. They  ought my little childhood tummy so much joy. Now, as a full grown man, they serve as nostalgic snack and perfect sponge to my evening's frivolous consumption of whiskey, enabling me to wake up the next morning clear headed...and ready for a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios.
