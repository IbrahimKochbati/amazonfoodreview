This is a pretty substantial cookie with a decent amount of fiber conveniently packaged for work or school. At 180 calories per cookie (1 per pack) it's not a diet food in my opinion, and it's not a gourmet treat (nothing like, say, a Pepperdige Farm cookie in the taste department). It is a dry, soft cookie with pleasant chocolate and almond flavor. Decent choice for a school lunch or on th go snack, but unlikely to satisfy a cookie lover wanting a treat.
