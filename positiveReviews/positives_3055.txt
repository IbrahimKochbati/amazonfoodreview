Needed the soap b 4 weekend. Ordered on Thurs and paid the extra next day shipping (even though I'm Prime) because no delivery here on Sat). Stuff came s promised on Friday and in good package. The price of the soap, like lots of other stuff nowadays on Amazon, was higher than local stores so ck prices first. Amazon aint the lowest, usually, anymore.
