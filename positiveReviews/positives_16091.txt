In this cereal, there are muligrain flakes, pecans, and the raisins and dates add sweetness naturally.  I like sweet cereals but don't like the sugar that comes with them.  There is still sugar added ( own and regular both), but there is less due to the dried fruits in the cereal.  Good taste, good texture and visually appealing    what a great combination.          It's very filling and often a bowl of this and a piece of fresh fruit are my choices for lunch during the week.
