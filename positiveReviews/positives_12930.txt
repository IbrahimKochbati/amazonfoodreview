Not too sweet, this very natural flavored drink received an immediate "Wow!" from this taster, as it did with both my wife and 5 yr. old. (This latter can often deliver the death blow to food or beverage items adults deem worthy, so respect for this product was a definite plus!) Very refreshing, it seemed more like a professionally prepared light smoothie rather than a canned beverage. I wanted more!
