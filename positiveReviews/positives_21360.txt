I ordered these flowers on the internet from the UK via Amazon in America and it couldn't have been simpler, they were ordered in a few clicks, and on there way.           I had never ordered flowers like this before or from Amazon but they are a company I trust implicity. The Bouquet arrived exactly at its destination when I was told it would, and was apparently beautifully and impecibly packaged with a lovely message card, also inside were all the care instruction for the flowers and flower food etc. My friend has told me "You could not have walked and picked these flowers from a field any fresher" that they are an enormous arrangement with so many flowers and colours it was hard for her to describe, and best of all is they are sented, and very beautifully sented. My friends were just so overwhelmed by the package and are frightened I've spent to much, I've told her to look on line because I am so thrilled with the service. And certainly my friends in the States are going to be using this service and Falcon Farms for sending flowers to there loved ones now.     To get this kind of Bouquet delivered here within the UK would have cost about Â£ 80(at the very least) and I kid not. I'm just jelous now that I can't experience the Falcon Farms flowers over here!!!!          Thank you for letting me send a token of love this way, and making it a pleasure, I would definitely use this service again.
