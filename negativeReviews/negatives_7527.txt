This is literally the first "real" maple syrup our family ever tried.     It was a good deal on Amazon, and I'm always looking for more natural choices to feed my family.  Overall, I like it.     My kids and hubby, however, have their reservations.  It is much thinner than standard "syrup" their used to, and the Grade B definitely has a strong maple flavor.  So if you like that, this is the syrup for you.          Once this is all used up (I plan on baking with it as well), I plan on re ordering the same  and,     only the Grade A.  Maybe that will ease them into true maple syrup a little easier!          All in all, a great price and good syrup.  My family just isn't quite ready for the strong maple kick!  Three (and a half) stars.  Minus one star for super strong maple flavor and 1 2 star for too thin of consistency (for my tastes).  Best part is, the ingredient label!  If you force your picky husband to review his current imitation syrup in comparison to this, he'll be shocked.  100% pure maple syrup vs. Corn syrup, sugar, imitation flavorings colorings, etc...  Go natural   buy real syrup!
