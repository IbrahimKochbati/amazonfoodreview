I had some at PF Changs and raved about it so my daughter who is a gifted giver picked up on it and gave me some along with a cast iron tea set for my birthday. I keep a box at work and  ew it in a cup and it tastes just fine, but it really does taste better when  ewed in a cast iron teapot and sipped from a small cast iron cup. The teapot and cups are enameled on the inside so it must be a temperature thing because the tea never touches the iron. I have tried it with honey but usually just drink it plain.     There are other ingredients besides green tea, mostly natural, plus "pineapple flavor" whatever that is. Good tasting green tea is rare, so I ordered half a dozen boxes myself and enjoy it whenever I get a chance.
