Don't let the stories of tough preparation fool you; these are no more difficult to prepare than regular pasta. I rinse it in a colander to get rid of the musty smell and throw into boiling water for a couple of minutes. Then I pan fry them with sauce, spinach, garlic, mushrooms  whatever I'm in the mood for. It's a great meal for under 100 calories.
