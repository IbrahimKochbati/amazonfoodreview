I was excited about my high protein pretzels but when i opened and tasted it, it tasted burned. I inspected the rest of the bags in the package and they all look dark  own. I don't know if i just received a bad batch as i also ordered the spelt pretzels from Vitacost ( lower priced; not like here where the price suddenly got jacked up after being featured in Yahoo from $30 to $49!) and it tasted fine, no burnt taste.          I am trying to return the package as i don't know what to do with 12 bags of burnt pretzels. But you can only return unopened one ( i already opened one bag) and within 7 days. After paying for the shipping fees and half refund, if ever they accepted the item for refund, its not worth the effort.          So if you are still considering buying the Hi Protein Pretzel, buy at your own risk.
