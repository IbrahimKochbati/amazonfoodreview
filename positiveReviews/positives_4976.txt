So, I moved from Europe to the US, I settled in my apartment etc, and after a week or so I decided that I wanted some candy. I went to the supermarket and started looking for some M&M's. Then this weird *red* bag caught my eye and I thought, hah!, this country is funny, they put an 's' instead of an 'm' on their M&M's here, and the bag is all different too.          So I took one bag home to try it. I grabbed a handful of the presumed M&M's and ... what a surprise. This was obviously not what I had bargained for, and I considered ditching this wrong purchase, but instead I figured I'd give this weird stuff another chance at some other time.          Do you realize that my mortal soul could _still_ have been saved, at that point ??          It was only in the next few days that the addiction set in. I found myself longing for more of that flavor when the bag was through; I wouldn't have reckoned at first, that I would actually buy many more of these bags on purpose.          Now my willpower has been eternally challenged. My stomach will never be like before. My jaw is numb from the endless compulsive chewing. And I can just feel my teeth desintegrating right when I take another dose. Why do I forever ache for that soothing acidic taste ? They're so delicious they ought to be outlawed !
