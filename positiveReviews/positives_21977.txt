I ordered regular Revv not knowing if it was all a gimmick and was very pleased with the coffee. I work overnights so I figured the Revv Pulse would be a plus so why not try it! Wow, this K Cup really delivers on taste and yes it did give me a boost! I cant fake the funk at work all night and a couple cups of Revv Pulse (over ice with creamer is my preffered way to enjoy coffee) had me alert and awake for my whole shift! Both Revv & Revv Pulse are strong coffees so if you are looking for something light this isnt it. Its bold but not bitter which is what I enjoy and stands up great against a full glass of ice. I wasnt able to taste anything strange or any type of herbal tastes. I am very happy with both my Revv & Revv Pulse purchases. Side note: I bought Revv Pulse here through Amazon only because both Green Mountain and Keurig.com are sold out of it at the moment. Its cheaper by almost 10.00 on the other sites.
