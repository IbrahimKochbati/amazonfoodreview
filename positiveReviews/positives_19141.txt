After purchasing a Keurig coffee  ewer, I wanted to try many different flavors of coffee (and  ands).  In the past, I had purchased chocolate raspberry coffee beans and ground my own, so I knew I liked the flavor.  Of the varieties I purchased (15+), this  and flavor is my absolute favorite!  A cup of this in the morning and the day is good!
