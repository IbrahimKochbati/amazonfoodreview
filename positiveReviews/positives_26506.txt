We love Amore Pesto Paste because it is the only pesto I've found without 1)parmesan (which we are allergic to) and 2)soybean oil (which we are allergic to).  The only reason I gave it four stars rather than five is I think it lacks a bit of flavor.  But when we add salt to our finished product, it is quite good.
