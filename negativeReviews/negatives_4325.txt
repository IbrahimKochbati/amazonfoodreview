I have used  various sports supplements over the years in biking, skiing and hockey. None created any problems. I decided to try the Sports Beans and use them when I do my 4 hour road bike rides. They would have been more convient and bulky then food or other products. I comsumed three bags. I noticed no energy benefit and in fact road only three hours instead of four. The worst was yet to come. At 2 am in the morning I awoke with severe teeth acres. This product had caused my teeth to become infected and I ended up going an Urgent Care for pain meds and amoxicillin. Looking closely at the ingredients the top two are EVAPORATED CANE JUICE and TAPIOCA SYRUP. Jelly Belly is a candy company not into sports nutrition and that's what this product is. Candy misrepresented as a sports supplement. BEWARE. Avoid unless you have bullet proof teeth. Many better and safer products on the market.
