I've been a chai afficionado for a while, and even more so since my trip to Nepal 2 years ago. There I was able to taste chai both in restaurants and in homes, and I have to say that Yogi's chai is the best and most authentic one I've ever tried.          I steep it directly in milk every morning, it's a very comforting way to start the day.          For a non caffeinated version, check out the Redbush chai.
