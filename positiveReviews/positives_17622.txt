This wasn't perhaps the finest cuppa joe I've ever tasted, but there was certainly nothing wrong with it and it'd be perfectly fine as a day to day morning coffee. The low acidity that is Puroast's selling point isn't really noticeable in the taste, of course. Because I don't have a big problem with coffee generated acidic reflux    and have a generous store built up of my own natural bitterness besides    it's hard to assess the effectiveness of that low acidity in making for a more pleasant environment in your digestive system. Maybe drinking this for several days in a row would produce a marked change even for the less afflicted? I hope it does work well for folks who need this benefit.
