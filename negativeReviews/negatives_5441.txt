Let me begin with a disclaimer; I can't even drink some popular kinds of coffee, like Starbucks. I'm afraid that the Puroast fits into a similar category. I do prefer low acid coffee, but I was hoping for less bitterness as well. No amount of milk or sweetener was able to render it palatable for my tender taste buds. I would suggest that, if you like strong, bitter coffee, it may be worth a try   but y'all can have my share.
