My 18 month old grandson only eats organic foods, and I was looking for a treat to give him when he visits. He loves these candies, and I don't feel too guilty because they are in a tiny packet with only a few in each one. They stay at Grandma's and Grandpa's house! (Of course we  ush his teeth afterwards.)
