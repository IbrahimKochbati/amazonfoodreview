I see that there are a lot of reviews complaining that there is a new recipe for this product and that it's not as good as the old one. Unfortunately, I haven't tried the "old" recipe so I can't make a comparison. The box I received says "Classic Recipe" so it may be that they have gone back to the old recipe? I'm not sure.          I made this oatmeal with milk and found it to average. I don't mind eating it but I've had better. Even though sugar is second on the ingredient list, I didn't think that this oatmeal had a very sweet taste. I could just barely taste  own sugar and I couldn't taste a maple flavor at all. If I'm going to eat something with a lot of added sugar then I want it to taste sweet! This was very filling and kept me full until lunch time.
