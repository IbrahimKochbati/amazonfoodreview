Don't get me wrong, I wanted to try the holiday sampler (mostly coffee) but I ordered the summer sampler with teas.  There were just a couple peach teas, sweet teas, and unsweetened black teas.  I didn't send it back because I wanted to try the holiday sampler.  Almost everything I got was the eggnog coffee, apple ciders, ginger  ead coffee, and french toast coffee.  The box was labeled summer sampler, so I'm sure that this was an accident.  I didn't contact the seller because I ordered it while I was gearing up for finals and now there is no contact seller button.  So seller, if you see this review message me and we can talk.
