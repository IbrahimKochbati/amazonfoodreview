I used to eat Nong Shim Shin Noodle Ramyun for years and that remains my favorite, however it has beef stock in it and I can't eat it anymore.  I checked out the whole Nong Shim line at my grocer for a vegetarian noodle and this cup is all I could find.  It tastes virtually identical to the bowl but is vegetarian.  Its spicy, and the noodle is of a better quality than the 20 cent Maruchan packages I grew up on.  You cant go wrong with Nong Shim but I thought that vegetarians should know about this soup.          So I just read on the description that it contains beef but the cup that is in my hands right now does not say that.  I may post a picture as proof.
