The Ingredients aren't from Nantucket, the blend is not smooth. Too heavy  or something maybe too much arabica.          then today I learn Green Mountain Coffee is involved with this:     Burlington, Vermont   October 25, 2010          Could a routine inquiry into accounting practices at Green Mountain Coffee Roasters lead to an insider trading investigation? A Wall Street whistleblower believes it's possible after reviewing documents from the Securities Exchange Commission.          The SEC is already conducting an informal inquiry into Green Mountain's "revenue recognition practices." And now Sam Antar, a securities expert who has worked with federal investigators, says public documents show a company executive sold thousands of shares just before the company publicly disclosed the SEC inquiry. The announcement of the inquiry was followed by a 16 percent drop in Green Mountain's stock price.          A group of shareholders are already suing the company, alleging executives artificially inflated the stock price and cashed in before the price drop. And Antar says the timing of the stock sale is the kind of thing that could trigger an insider trading investigation.          Not recommending this at all. Try the Donut Shop Kuerig Coffee its a lot better blend..
