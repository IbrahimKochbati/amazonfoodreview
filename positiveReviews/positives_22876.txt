Ok, I'm very biased.  I love this tea.  I've been drinking it since high school or even earlier for over [mumble, mumble] twenty years.  When the stores in my area stopped carrying it, I went to Amazon.  Great price    and I can get six boxes at a time.  Great for the tea addict.          No, it's not as trendy as some of the other teas out there, but it's smooth and not acidic.  It has a nice cinnamon flavor    not overpoweringly so either.  It's not sweet like many of the orange and cinnamon teas I've tried but couldn't choke down.  A very smooth, palatable tea.
