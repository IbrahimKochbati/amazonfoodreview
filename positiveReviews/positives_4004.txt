I have the coolest different cats ever with some exotic in them and this stuff is amazing and really they seem to love it! It does not make the poo smell bad and the digestive system of some of mine do not tolerate much grain or gluten so that is VERY much a PLUS!  The price on amazon is better for a large can (amount   per ounce) than i can find at local pet shops or stores.  So when you can get the free shipping it is REALLY awesome to have pet foods at your door service too! I hope Amazon will just continue to make pet food   supplies to your home affordable and at a top price!  Sometimes though when i go to try to re order cannot find (the same deals)available.  So I just lurk and watch and wait sometimes til it is Offered again to make it affordable. Not sure why  that happens but i know i have to (watch it) to make sure i don't end up with a high shipping fee in my cart prior to purchase.
