We had a friend come to stay with us for week.  We found out she ate Gluten Free just days before she arrived.  I quickly got onto Amazon and found various products I thought worth giving a try.  She LOVED these cookies!  THANK YOU!  Unfortunately, she did not get to eat too many AS WE ALL LOVED THEM!!!!
