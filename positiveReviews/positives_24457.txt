This stuff tastes good, settles one's stomach and has few calories.  I used to chew a role really fast but now I stopped chewing and they last a lot longer.  I also love it that they're organic without crud one usually sees like high fructose corn syrup which I do not buy.  Buying them here costs less than buying them in the store and I prefer it but they're not always available here.
