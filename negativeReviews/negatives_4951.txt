This bottle is big!  You can put lots of food in here which comes out a little too easy.  When I put treats in it's very difficult to get out and my husband thinks that's mean.  The dogs only like this toy when there are treats inside.  Otherwise I think they don't get the rope and the bottle is big and akward.
