I switch between Kellogg's and Post's respective versions of raisin  an since each has its pluses. Post has the flake portion down pat   large flakes with a nice crunch. In contrast, the Kellogg's flakes are smaller and more fiber tasting. (As an aside, the Kellogg's flakes work better than Post when using the cereal as an add in for baking multi grain  eads or oatmeal cookies).          But raisins are part of the equation as well. Kellogg's seems to have more raisins and, more importantly, they taste better   plumper and less chewy than the ones in Post.          I usually get Kellogg's since I can live with their less than great flakes, and they usually cost less (good sales on Amazon, plus I can get the jumbo boxes at Sam's Club). But, if only these two companies would collaborate   flakes by Post, raisins by Kellogg's. That would be perfect
