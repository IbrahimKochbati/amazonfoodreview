OKay, I must admit I'm reviewing this because somehow the idea of reviewing COFFEE seems ridiculous and funny and sort of pretentious, like those people who get into the subtle, indiscernible differences in wines.  So I"m going to act like a real connoisseur of coffee and tell you that, yes it's BOLD, with subtle notes of  . . . . of . . . well, of caffeine!  OH, I can't even pretend to be a connoisseur.  But I will tell you this.  I LOVE Starbucks coffee.  And this is BY FAR the least expensive Starbucks I've ever found anywhere.  I bought EIGHT BAGS.  Seriously.     Enjoy!
