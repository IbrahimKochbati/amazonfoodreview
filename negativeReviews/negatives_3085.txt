I received the two "Mission Pack Space Food Sampler with Astronaut Ice Cream and Space Food Sticks" packs I purchased in the mail today. I initially panicked when I saw them   both were packaged in "Astronaut Mission Pack" boxes that said they contained "3 Assorted Freeze Dried Space Foods." This is not the packaging shown in the picture, and there is nothing on the box about Space Food Sticks (I wasn't too concerned about the magnet). The Space Food Sticks were the whole reason I ordered these samplers, as a surprise gift of nostalgia for a friend. When I finally opened the boxes, I saw that 2 Space Food Sticks and a magnet had been added each, so I DID receive the product that was promised. However, I still feel a bit cheated and deceived   I was expecting a fun gift box to present to my friend, as shown in the picture, and the boxes had some tears on them, perhaps from being opened to add the additional Space Food Sticks and magnet.          In terms of the food items themselves   pretty much what I expected and I'm happy with them(and definitely what I was prepared for based on what other reviewers said).          On a side note   because many of the older reviews for this product refer to additional items that are no longer included, it would be nice if they were updated or removed. I was sort of bummed to learn that this product used to come with freeze dried food (that many reviewers seemed to love!) that are no longer included.          Overall, I'm OK with the product   I got the food items I was expecting and most wanted   but the product picture needs to be updated, and the reviews should match the product currently available.
