Tinkyada makes the best gluten free pasta I have tasted, and I like the fusilli the best.  They are not at all gritty or mushy, like many gluten free pastas tend to be.  This pasta is best if you cook it using the "energy saving method" described on the front of the package, and I only cook it for 3 4 of the time listed (15 minutes).  This way, you get a truly al dente pasta    and you won't even miss the wheat!
