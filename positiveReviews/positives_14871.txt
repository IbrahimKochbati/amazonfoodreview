I received a tin of this admittedly not inexpensive tea for Christmas in 2006, and used it sparingly through the year. Then for Christmas 2007 I ordered a package of three tins, I love it so much! The tea flavor is not overpowered by the bergamot essence that makes this Earl Grey, yet it's a gentle tea, not overly tannic.  I'm a daily tea drinker and this is my favorite.
