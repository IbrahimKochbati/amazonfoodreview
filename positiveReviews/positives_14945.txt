I was trying to tell my 91 year old auntie who lives in the desert near 29 Palms about "Bubble tea"  She just didn't get it.  One day we were shopping in the other desert near Palm Springs and I saw a stand up sign for "bubble tea" at the food court.  We walked the entire length of the shopping mall so I could buy her a bubble tea, and the STAND WAS CLOSED !!  When I saw that Amazon (my favorite place) had bubble tea kits, I ordered one of each.  I sent the kits to my sister in Desert Hot Springs so she could make and take the bubble tea to Aunt Ruth.  Thank you for allowing me to fulfill another item on her bucket list !!
