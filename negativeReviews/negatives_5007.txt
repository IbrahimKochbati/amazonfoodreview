I got this toy for my Border Collies and they had one really good play session with it before they tore it up.  The bottle itself survived, but the rest of it was ruined, so you couldn't use it as a treat dispenser which was the point.  I was hoping it would keep them busy entertained. I think it would be okay for dogs that aren't as aggressive though.  My dogs can tear up pretty much anything though! lol
