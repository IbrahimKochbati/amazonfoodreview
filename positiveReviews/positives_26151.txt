I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the  and I chose.          Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth.          I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.          Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening.
