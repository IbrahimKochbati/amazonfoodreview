*****     Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass   not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher end teas. Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.          Everything in this tea is organic   the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable   a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.          Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.          I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!          Highly recommended.     *****
