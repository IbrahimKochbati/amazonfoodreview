I received this tea today, a wet, chilly, dreary day with no promise but rain and sniffles; I immediately came home and opened it and got the hot pot going. The aroma that escaped upwards from the can was heavenly; delicate, alluring, definitely Earl Grey but with whispers of bergamot, a lemony, citrusy warmth that made me feel good immediately. I put aside all other endeavours for a time and gave myself up to a retreat with this wonderful light tea. Don't  ew it more than 4 minutes; let the essence of the bergamot exude from the tea. Both your sense of taste and your sense of smell will be the better for having indulged in this tea. A lovely cap on a grey, ugly day.          Rishi Earl Grey Tea is 100% Organic Fair Trade tea, grown by and harvested by the ethnic peoples of the Yunnan Province of China from tea trees planted in 696 A.D. By buying Fair Trade teas, the minority peoples who grow the tea benefit, through community developments and direct trade. The benefit to the purchaser is in knowing that they are doing a good thing for the earth and for the small farmer. I've just started seeing Fair Trade items coming onto the market, and I try to patronize the small farmer. You won't be cutting any corners by drinking this tea; it's truly a great beverage. It also says on the can that one serving can be used multiple times, so don't cavalierly throw it out after the first cup. Very recommended.
