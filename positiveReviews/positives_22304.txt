This is the best drink I've ever drunk in my life. The only problem I have with this is the product hasn't been given the "go ahead" to be sold worldwide by the Pepsi Company.          I don't know if I'd get the pear version of this product, but I would definitely get an IZZE for a drink after all my chores be done or any other time that I can relax and enjoy myself.
