I wondered why my 10 month olds liked this one so much when the other reviews weren't so promising.  Then I noted that it has twice the calories as the green bean casserole and sweet ingredients that are proven winners with my kids.          Here's the ingredient list: Water, Organic Carrots, Organic Mango Puree, Organic Finely Ground Chicken, Organic Whole Grain Brown Rice Flour, Organic Yellow Split Pea Flakes, Calcium Carbonate.          Anything that starts with carrots and mango is going to be fairly sweet, and this one is sweet.  The consistency seemed very normal, perhaps because it has plenty of water   that's the first ingredient.  Unlike most Earth Best flavor  ands, this one has calcium.  The stated amount is 35% of their daily needs.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.          I recommend this particular one, Chicken Mango Risotto, because I think babies will tend to like it as mine did.          These cases are being delivered to my home constantly, different varieties of Earth's Best subscriptions.  On occasion a case will arrive in a mess with one or more  oken jars. Over time I figured out it would cost the vendor too much to package these jars well enough to ensure no  eakage. Now when a case arrives with one or more  oken jars, I report it and can get credited for the  oken ones only. Of course it's messy when a jar is  oken, but I don't have a store nearby that sells this product except one that lists it at a higher price.
