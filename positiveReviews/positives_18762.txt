I think Zevia rocks period so maybe I am biased but whatever :)     This is my favorite flavor they have. Tastes just like regular grape soda minus the 76 grams of sugar hfcs, artificial flavors and colors. I was honestly a bit shocked as to how good it tasted.     Love the fact that it is not purple either, rad.     Certified vegan to top it off, can't go wrong.
