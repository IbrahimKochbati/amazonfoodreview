They're ok I guess but each bag has about a pound of salt in it. You'll find yourself  ushing away salt from each piece just for it to taste somewhat decent. Also, no matter what you set the timer on the microwave, you will have little burn hardened pieces. So you're not even getting a whole lot out of one bag.
