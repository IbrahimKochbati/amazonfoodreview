When you live by yourself, a pot of coffee is a waste of money.  These little sticks fit the bill though.  No need to wash a big ol' coffee pot or have it take up counter space and nothing to plug in, just pour water and drink.  You can make it as strong or as weak as you want.  Thanks Tasters Choice!
