I recently bought a Keurig Coffee maker because my husband and I love our coffee and tea, but sometimes want different drinks on certain days and this coffee maker fit the bill. We both enjoy this hot cocoa as much as do our grandchildren. Likely the best hot cocoa K cup that we have tried so far. They arrived sooner than expected and arrived as described. Happy with the service and the product.     Comment Comment  Permalink
