Unfortunately, I'm much too frugal to throw away something I've spent perfectly good money on, so I'm continuing to use these suckers until they're gone (hopefully in a few weeks). I thought I was buying a decent  and of coffee, given the Wolfgang Puck name, but alas, I was wrong. Using the middle cup size on my Keurig coffeemaker, these k cups make a weak cup of coffee... more like  own water. No taste, no nothing. I switched to the smallest size cup and it's marginally better, but still barely drinkable. I wouldn't serve these to guests EVER. I can't wait to be done with these boxes of junk so I can order something with some taste. Please don't waste your money.
