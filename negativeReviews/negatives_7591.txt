The Coconut Palm Sugar wasn't too bad as a substitute for baking, however, it is significantly less sweet then  white sugar. I enjoyed that it wasn't as sweet but for those that want a sweet pastry, you may need to readjust the amount when using the coconut palm sugar. Also, it is hard to make a syrup out of it and melts quite a bit faster than white sugar.
