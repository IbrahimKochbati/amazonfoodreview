This coffee is better than McDonalds, StarBucks, Atlanta Bread, Folgers, Maxwell House and almost as good as Standard Coffee that is served in up scale restaurants only and cannot be purchased privately.  It has a great smooth taste. We have a hard time finding it in SC.  It is manufactured in CA on the west coast.  I called Yuban today and they could tell me what stores in my area have sold it in the last 30 days.     You can also purchase it on line is what I did for 12 cans.  The price beat the price I pay at the grocery store and I had free shipping!!!!!WooHoo!!!!!! Enough to last the rest of the winter and spring.  Try it!  You will Love it!
