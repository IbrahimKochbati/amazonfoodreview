I loved this  ead. I have used some other  ands before but this one is the best for me. I have now made 6 loaves of it and have been pleased every time. The taste is good and so is the texture. I love  ead and when I found out I had a wheat allergy and could not eat regular  ead anymore my heart sank. But since I found Pamela's Wheat Free & Gluten Free Bread Mix I am one happy Grandma again
