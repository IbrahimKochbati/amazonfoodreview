as mentioned...give this a try!  instant party food, frozen meatballs and this sauce... great on chicken, you name it...anything party snack happy hour food that you put sauce on would work with this.          however the prices from some of the vendors OBSCENE.  $19 for 2 25oz bottles??  This stuff is $1.50 1.75 for the 10oz bottle at any asian grocery....
