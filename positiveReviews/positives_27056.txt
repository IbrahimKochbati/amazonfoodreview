I didn't go into this box with much expectation since most cereals that try to mimic others are off a bit.  This cereal is spot on.  It tastes like Golden Grahams, but is truly better.  It maintains the consistency I like once milk goes on  not too crisp but not soggy either.  I have no complaints at all.  It's less expensive in my local supermarket by a couple bucks and I'm totally satisfied.  I plan to try the other Mom's Best now.
