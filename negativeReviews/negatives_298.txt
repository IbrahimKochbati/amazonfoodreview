Ya know, when you're on a gluten free diet, you YEARN for those forbidden treats   like licorice! (and malted milk!) Realizing that true licorice on this challenging diet is in the past and not likely to ever be repeated in the near future, we need to alter our expectations for this treat.          I had tried this company's raspberry laces and strawberry laces   pretty good, although not easy to chew (think bubblegum).  Not REAL licorice you understand, but pretty doggone good as an alternative.          So I thought I try these too   how bad could they be?  I found them pleasant to chew   not tough at all.  But the taste?  Nasty and medicinal cough syrup with an aftertaste that is truly awful.          So I'm stuck with 11 packs.          See if you can't find a source where you can buy just ONE pack to try out.  Your tastes may be different than mine, and you might enjoy them.
