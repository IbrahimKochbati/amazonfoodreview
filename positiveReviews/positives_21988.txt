i tried this at the beginning of the summer after a long bike ride. it was so refreshing and amazing.I went out on a limb when i bought this hoping it may be good.I am so glad i did because this stuff is AMAZING! Its healthy! Delicious! and good for your skin! :) alo is packed with vitamins and other natural minerals to deliver the best drink you will ever try. i buy them at my local grocery store and have probably bought over 75 over the summer . definitely worth a try:)
