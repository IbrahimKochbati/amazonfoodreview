I use this on everything it seems.  Makes great chili, add it to rice, sprinkle over chicken or turkey for flavor.  Adds great flavor without added salt or calories.  My kids ask for "spicy rice"  all the time.  The price on Amazon, when I purchased on subscribe, was better than my local healthy market.  Only one place near me carries this  and, and it is better tasting than all the others I have tried.
