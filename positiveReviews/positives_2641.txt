We have a new hot beverage cooker. This thing is the closest thing to the futuristic "replicators", made know via Star Trek movies and series of various efforts.          We love our hot beverage  ewer and have added a higher end unit to our own home environment.          We've used such a device and various coffee and tea pods over the last few years, but this kit tops that experience.          I especially like the Hot Chocolate and Tea beverages apart from the hundreds of coffee options.          Do consider buying one of their devices and also sample the so very many flavors of coffees, teas and other hot beverages attached to the  ewing station.
