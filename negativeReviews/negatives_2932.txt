The title says it.  Some of the cookies arrived with the chocolate melted.  Others were stuck together or had the wafer separated and stuck to the chocolate top of the cookie below.  It appears that the box was a little overheated and banged around somewhere along the way here.  It was 65F here when the package was delivered.
