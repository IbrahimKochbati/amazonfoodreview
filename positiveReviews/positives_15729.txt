I have one finicky cat and one food hog cat. Both of them like this food. First ingredient is chicken, good. Next few ingredients are also good, but this is not "natural" cat food and thus, includes preservatives and taste enhancers (that I generally avoid). Also, the packaging is cute, but excessive. You get a case of 24 cans, but within that case, are 6 smaller boxes that hold 4 cans each. None the less, the quality is superior to "fancy feast" or other bottom rung cat foods. This food is a solid "medium quality". The food is what I call "gravy" style as opposed to "loaf" style, meaning you are paying for a decent amount of gravy in each can as opposed to meat and other real food. To their credit though, the chicken is REAL white meat chicken, not processed chicken parts made to look like "shredded chicken". The cats love it and the packaging (though excessive) makes it convenient for storing little cans in your cupboard.
