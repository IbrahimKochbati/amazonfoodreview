I purchased seven (7) varieties of the Organix organic dog food from my local whole foods market for $2.79 2.99 plus $2.31 tax   $37.79  12 12.7 oz cans.          There are two types of Organix organic dog food grain free, and those that have grain products such as flaxseed meal.          My two ShihTzus Darby and Hampshire prefer turkey and chicken over beef and lamb so I purchased the following formulas:  chicken & vegetable; turkey, carrot & potato; chicken & organic  own rice; turkey & vegetable, chicken &  own rice; turkey vegetable; turkey & vegetable (grain free); and chicken & vegetable (grain free).          Darby and Hampshire's typical diet is roast chicken with  own rice and mix vegetables.          Their snacks normally consist of non nitrate hot dogs, pan fried chicken livers, butter fried sweet potatoes or mashed sweet potatoes, turkey meatballs, cheese wedges, Bullies, Merrick sesame sticks, 2 TBS of Haagen Daz vanilla or butter pecan ice cream, and the occasional non nitrate cold cut.          After tropical storm Debbie swept through Central Florida, I knew I needed to find a nonperishable dog food to stock for the hurricane season in preparation for power outages.          I had searched for years for a high quality nontoxic and reasonably priced dog food that Darby and Hampshire would actually eat.  The Organix organic dog food was a hit.  When they see the cans they stand up and take notice.          When I opened the can, I could clearly see the difference in quality, and I could certainly smell the difference.  A can of Organix organic dog food is 95% organic, and made is the USA!          A typical can contains 7.5% crude protein, 6% crude fat, 1% crude fiber, and 78% moisture.  The feeding recommendations are 3 4 to 1 1 4 per 15 lbs. body weight per day.  The dog food also contains several vitamins (Vitamin E, A, B12, & D3)and minerals.          Several of the varities contain organic garlic and thiamine mononitrate which is a synthetic form of vitamin B1.          I am so very pleased with this find.  After 4 years, and many bad purchases I've finally found the right food for Darby and Hampshire.  What an awesome dog food.  It really smells and looks like human grade food.          I also purchased the Organix dry dog food but Hampshire and Darby both had a week of uncontrollable diareau, and Darby was also vomiting.  I returned the Organix dry food to the store, and they gave me a full refund.          The Organix dry dog food made their feces very dark and running and the stains were more difficult than normal to remove.  Darby is 4.6 years and Hampshire is 3.11 years.
