This is an OK product for occasional use but not something that adds much to the preparation or improvement of the meal.  The pork chops were adequately crisp on the outside, moist and tender inside and the coating added a blandly salty and vaguely processed flavor.  I did not use gigantic pieces of meat and barely had enough to coat 4 chops.  It is cheaper, easier, more versatile and healthier to toss together my own ingredients for chicken or pork.
