I have a husband who could bathe in Pace picante salsa, I wish amazon would put it on their subscribe and save program. I ordered two bottles and during shipment one of the lids  oke and salsa went everywhere. Amazon immediately gave me my money back, I'm surprised my husband didn't eat the salsa soaked box for dinner.
