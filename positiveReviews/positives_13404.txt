Recently purchased the Keurig Single Cup Brewer. Love the convenience and no filter or pot to wash. Tried the sample K cups included. All were good but the Newman's extra bold was outstanding. I had been buying an organic blend that I thought was good until I tried this. I was hooked but this was almost like buying printer ink, very expensive. The 80 pk is about two pounds of coffee. Amazon pricing is $48 dollars which equals $24 dollars a pound. This is pricey, you are paying for the convenience. Other retailers mark this up even more making Amazon look cheap. I found this at BJ's wholesale club for $37 dollars. Not that much cheaper but it is a savings. Bottom Line: The Keurig Brewer is a fantastic coffee machine that works best with the K cups. Newman's extra bold is an organic coffee that is superlative to other  ands and worth the money. My advise is to shop around for the best price.
