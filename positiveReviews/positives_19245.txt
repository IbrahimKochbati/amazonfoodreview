I have two rat terriers, and they did not understand instantly what they had to do.  They actually had to think and use their powers of deductive reasoning to figure out how to get to the treats.  Their main drive in life is to eat, and then play, so this was perfect.  I loaded the treat compartments with their favorite chicken stick treats and then rotated the base and put the plastic puzzle pieces in.  It took them about 10 15 minutes of playing, barking and trying to get to the treats.  Eventually they figured out that the puzzle pieces ALL had to be removed before they could spin the base and reach their goal.  It was so much fun to watch.  Great toy Kyjen!
