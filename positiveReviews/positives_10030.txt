My wife is the coffee drinker in the family, a longtime fanatic of the bean.  These days she keeps a large can of Folger's French Roast Medium Dark in the fridge, and takes a foray into the more premium blends on a regular basis as a treat.  When I got the Melitta Classique Supreme for her as a trial, the yummy sounds could be heard throughout the house.  "Even fuller, richer, and more robust," are her exact words.  Great stocking stuffer, at the least, and don't be surprised if it becomes your favorite.
