Before my oldest golden started eating this food he got a lot of ear infections. He ate grain free food, but he still got them. Both my dogs like this food and their coats are nice and shiny and their ears are super clean. I really recommend it.          While you can get it for $1 cheaper on other sites, you pay $18 for shipping.          I only wish Amazon had more than 3 bags of it each time!
