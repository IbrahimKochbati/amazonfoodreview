Puroast Low Acid Coffee Low Acid Coffee French Roast, 3 Ounce Bags            I suffer from acid reflux and heartburn after eating and drinking certain foods.  I have always loved coffee but I just could not handle the heartburn and other stomach problems after drinking coffee. I was so excited to see this available because I would love to start drinking coffee again on a more regular basis.          I have a 12 pot coffee maker and I only used 10 cups to  ew for this pot of coffee and it was too potent for me. The aroma is wonderful but with 3ozs of coffee I needed to add more water. After adding additional water to the pot I found that it was drinkable for me. There is a mouthful of flavor in every sip with absolutely no aftertaste. No major coffee  eath!     French roast has a naturally burnt smokey taste to begin with and in this coffee you can really taste it. I just think I prefer a different roast type.       As far as the low acidity I was really happy about not having to suffer after a cup or several cups of coffee. Since this coffee comes in different roasts and flavors, I would seriously consider buying it to alleviate the negative side effects from drinking regular coffee.
