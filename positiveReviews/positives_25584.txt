I use the hibiscus flower tea thus:          In a slightly larger than two quart (half gallon) container place 3 4 to 1 cup hibiscus flowers and 3 4 1 tablespoon dried stevia leaves.          Add two quarts of boiling water.          Let sit for at least 10 minutes.  Drink some hot (if you like).  When it is cool, strain through a fine sieve or mesh into a refrigerator container and enjoy cold.          My daughters (12 & 14) enjoy drinking this cold over ice instead of soda and take it to school in the morning in their water bottles.  I drink it cold after running, working in the yard, or going to the gym as it is extraordinarily refreshing cold.  It also tends to keep me from snacking between meals.  We go through about 2 3 gallons week, mostly cold.          Other recommendations:  It stains, so pour it over the sink or something that won't stain.  It is very convenient online, but can also be purchased from many local Mexican markets from the same section as dried peppers.  Consider keeping in a sealed container (I use Lock & Lock) for freshness and to keep from getting wet (again because it will stain). Stevia leaves are not the same as Stevia powder (the powder is much stronger).          update:     I've used the "Frontier Bulk Stevia Herb Powder(Green), CERTIFIED ORGANIC, 1 lb. package" from Amazon instead of the dried stevia leaves from my garden. While  ewing 1 2 gallon (2 quarts) of tea, I still used 1 cup of dried hibiscus flowers and 1 level teaspoon of stevia herb powder. Tastes the same as when I use the dried leaves from my garden.  Note:  green stevia powder is not the same as stevia extract.
