When i got this for my dog, Hilde, i gave it to her and then left for about half an hour.  It had her  eakfast kibble in it.  When i came back to check up on her she was trying to use it but couldn't figure it out.  There was also the same amount of food when i came back.  I had to try to help her with it and it was still hard for her.  It was pretty sad because she was going ballistic because she couldn't get the food out.  It seemed like a good idea at first but i dont think my dog very much liked it.  There are scent holes at the bottom and she could see the treats inside so she would try to eat the plastic!  Either this wasnt a very well thought out toy or my dog is dumb! Hope this review helps.
