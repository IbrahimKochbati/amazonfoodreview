I bought the 2 lb bottle for use in microbio experiments & I haven't really eaten any of it...yet, so I can't comment on the taste or anything like that.     But for growing things, it's great.     Since it's a powder it's easy to measure out & use, unlike those annoying flaky bars.     After the agar sets, it's quite clear which is nice.
