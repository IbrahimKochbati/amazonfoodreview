I'm kind of disappointed in this coffee. Touted to be so wonderfu.  Not all it's cracked up to be. First off the grind is too fine. Second, very hot water makes it bitter. Won't order it again. I wish I had been able to order just one box just to try it first, instead of having to order a set of three. I was looking to find the taste of the coffee in the restaurant.     They should sell the liquid like they use in restaurants. What a tease.
