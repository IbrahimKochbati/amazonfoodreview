Usually I buy spicy Shake N' Bake seasonings, so I was prepared to be a little disappointed when I tried my sample of the Original Pork  eading. It turned out to be pretty tasty   the crispy  eading added a subtle flavor to the pork and didn't overpower it. Add some rice or pasta and a side of vegetables and you've got yourself a healthy, home cooked meal with little hassle. I'll make a note to buy more of the original flavor in the future.
