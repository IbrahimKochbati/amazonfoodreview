I have two dogs, a pitbull mix and a toy fox terrier. Neither one are accustomed to receiving dog treats on a regular basis, just not something I do. (They get plenty of attention though, trust me!)     These treats are the stiff biscuit type. I'm not really sure what they mean by "Ranch Style". It made me think they were going to smell like ranch dressing...but they didn't. At first neither one of my dogs ate the treats, but then, ofcourse, there was the whole "You gonna eat that?" showdown so they had to eat the treats just to keep the each other from getting theirs. After they ate them they came back to the pantry to beg for more. Now when I get the bag out they like them enough to catch them when I toss the treats in the air and gobble them down immediately.     I like that these are all natural. With a lot of dog food products on the market, the stuff that goes into them is so nasty that I don't even want to touch it with me bare hands. Not a problem with these.
