These seasonings (other flavors: Sicilian & Rosa Maria) there is also a Parmasan blend, but the first 3 are my personal favorites, are absolutely DELICIOUS!!! They are also very versatile, you can have them with olive oil for  ead dipping or better yet, use them to cook chicken, ground turkey burgers, fish, just about anything you can think of. I've tried a few other seasonings at the supermarket but they are waste of money, you get a lot more seasoning and a TON of delicious flavor with the Dean Jacob's seasoning collection.
