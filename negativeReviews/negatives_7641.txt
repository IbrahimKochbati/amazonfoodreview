If you are expecting Grandma's soft and deliciously moist cookies, you will be seriously disappointed. 6 small cookies come in the package. Out of the six, two did not have even ONE chocolate chip on them. For size and content, please take a look at the pictures I have uploaded.      The flavor leaves a lot to be desired. While they are soft, they are very dry if that makes sense. You feel the need to drink a LOT of milk or water with them. Out of our family of four, two of us thought they were horrible tasting and two thought they were okay. Price wise   just not worth it.
