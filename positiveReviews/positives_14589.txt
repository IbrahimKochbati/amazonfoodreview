I'm a freak for ginger, so when I got my first case of this stuff and felt that awesome gingery bite, I was in love. I went through a couple more cases of it and continued to love every sip    occasionally poured over some decent bourbon.          Another reviewer mentioned that the product had recently gotten less gingery, and I am dismayed to confirm this report. The most recent case I received (August 2011) is substantially less spicy.          I still like it enough to give it 4 stars. It's still more gingery than your standard ginger ale (or Zevia ginger ale, which is quite bland by comparison,) but for a ginger lover like me it's a disappointment. If I had never tasted the more gingery version, I'd probably tell you this is damn fine ginger ale, but the "Jamaican Ginger Ale" moniker is now a bit overblown.          Hopefully they just made a weak batch and the next case will be back to gently burning the mouths and tummies of thirsty travelers worldwide.
