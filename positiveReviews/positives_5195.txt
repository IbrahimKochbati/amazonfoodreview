This relatively expensive convenience packaged item is 100 percent juice and contains 140 calories worth of concentrated apple, grape, tangerine, orange, and acerola juice reconstituted with carbonated water; acacia gum; some soy; and added vitamin C to provide 100 percent of the adult minimum daily requirement. There are no artificial flavors or additives which allows the manufacturer to describe this as a "natural" beverage.          I often mix juice with seltzer water, and I like the combination quite cold. The Switch Orange Tangerine tasted more like orange soda with a tangerine chaser than what I am used to as juice flavor.          The carbonation makes the drink seem lighter than juice, but not as light and refreshing to the mouth as juice and seltzer.          The tangerine flavor made the taste seem more appealing than orange soda, but the orange and tangerine flavors don't last as long as soda flavors do on the palate.          I would drink this again on a hot day if I could buy it inexpensively enough.
