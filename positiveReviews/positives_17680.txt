I got a trial packet of this low acid coffee throught the Amazon vine review program.  The packet contains 2.25oz of this low acid ground coffee (not sure if the retial package is 2.25oz or 3oz each).  I  ew my coffee using a simple french coffee press.  This coffee tastes fine with plenty of real coffee aroma, not like the de caf varieties.  There is some bitter after taste though.  For me, if I drink a cup (12oz) of regular coffee in the morning and a can of coke (12oz) during lunch, I usually will have some degree of heart burn in the evening.  With this low acid coffee in the morning and a can of coke during lunch the heart burn has not happened so far.
