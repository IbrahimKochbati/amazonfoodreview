Love original flavor PopChips, it reminds me so much of Munchos.  I love that there is a healthier alternative that actually truly tastes good!  BBQ flavor is excellent too.  Although I love salt and vinegar chips, I wasn't crazy about their version.  The sour cream and onion and the cheddar were also so so.  Out of all the flavors, original is my favorite.  You don't feel you're compromising anything with this alternative chip.  Way to go PopChips!
