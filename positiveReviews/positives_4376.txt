I have been using this Peppered Gravy Mix for years. I found it at a Wonder Bread discount store at least 15 years ago. It is the best you could ever make. I always made from scratch, but I believe this is even better. Unless I tell them, no one knows it wasn't made from scratch. So easy, and can use it for pork sausage, chicken, even ground beef. If you haven't tried it, you don't know what you are missing. Good price, best taste.
