Buyers of a certain age who are looking for old fashioned horehound candy will be sorely disappointed in these bland lozenges which have no real flavor at all.          The horehound root has an alkaloid which numbs the nerve endings, and that made horehound drops or candy useful when one was afflicted with a sore throat. As kids, we'd buy it in large squares, and it would numb one's mouth like novocaine. (It was likely the first dope I took.)          Now that I have a sore throat, I'd like relief from real horehound candy, but these lozenges apparently contain no horehound extract whatsoever. Instead of horehound, they should be sold as the favorite flavor of Ned Flanders    "plain."
