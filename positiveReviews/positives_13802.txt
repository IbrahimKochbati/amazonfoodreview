This stuff is great because of the fat and calorie content. It still contains some protein like normal peanut butter which is good. Normally I would say that the added salt and sugar isn't neccassary but in this case it definetly is because without it it woud probably be pretty gross. As far as the texture goes don't expect it to be like full fat peanut butter as the texture is sort of "gluey" but not unpleasant. I like to eat it on toast or with red grapes.
