Yes I had the original Turkish Taffy   No this is nothing like it   The people who are writing the positive reviews are probably shills for the company that bought the  and name.  This is made with artificial flavor, mono and di glycerides, and egg albumin   it's soft and tastes fake.  Any wax wrapped taffy that you buy in the store (although not the Bonomo style) wil probably be much better quality than this.  Don't waste your time.
