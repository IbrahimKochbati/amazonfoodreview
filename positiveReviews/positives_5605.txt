This product is great tasting! I was eating the pepitas at half the price due to not finding USA made pumpkin seeds. The pepitas tasted bitter and were much larger.  I hope Red Mill continues to make their pumpkin seeds in the USA. It's worth the higher price for excellent quality and supporting local USA companies.
