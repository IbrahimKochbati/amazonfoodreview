Ok, so I got these cause they were cheap. First time I ordered they were great! They tasted like all other dried goji berries I had tasted. Second time, they tasted a little bit musty. It is like they have been stored in plastic for a while, and now they taste artificial. They also have a very suspicious  ight red color to them. Am I getting what I paid for?
