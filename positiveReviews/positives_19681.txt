This is just simply delicious! I have so far tried the Texas BBQ and the Mesquite Lime and I can't describe how tasty it is! I've never had real beef jerky before so the only way I could see someone giving this a bad review, is if it doesn't taste how someone would expect but whatever it taste like believe me, it's delicious! The jerky is not dry, because they seal in the perfect amount of sauce so its not wet, but moist!          The particular packages I tried however looked different than the picture amazon has here so I'm not sure if Primal Spirit has changed their marketing recently and these are old pictures, or if when you order it, it will actually look like the picture shown. If you go to their website, the pictures on the website are exactly what I purchased from Whole Foods. I'd love to buy them online for the convenience but, I'd like to be sure they are the same packaging and not an older version          Anyway, great product! Hope to try all the flavors soon!
