My dogs love these treats.  There are a number of other lower quality  and treats in our "treat cabinet", but both of my dogs start trying to get to the Newman's Own bag whenever I open the cabinet door.  I can definitely tell they like them the most.  And shhhh, don't tell them... but it is probably the healthiest choice for them from all the treats in that cabinet.          The treats sort of smell nice... dare I say "fresh".  I am almost tempted to  eak off a small piece and try it myself (ALMOST, but not quite).          I think I will stop buying the cheaper, unhealthier  and treats from now on and go with the Newman's Own Organics line.  It will be a nice compliment to their quality dog food,    "
