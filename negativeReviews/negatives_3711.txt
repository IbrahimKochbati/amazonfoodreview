If you find this stuff TOO delicious, and can't stop eating it, my suggestion is to read: "The Voice in the Night", a short story by William Hope Hodgeson.  I can practically GUARANTEE you will NEVER want to eat Heinz Spotted Dick Sponge Pudding, 10 ounce can, pack of 6, (or any other size), after reading this story, ever in your life again!          Instead, have something healthy and wholesome   like Tuscan Milk!  : )
