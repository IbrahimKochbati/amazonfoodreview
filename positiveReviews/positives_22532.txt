This stuff is the real deal folks! You simply cannot get any closer to real, movie theater popcorn, even if you were in the theater! This stuff is that good! And at about .77 ea pack, a great deal too. I honestly have no reason to go to the theater any more! With this popcorn and the theater size candy packs available cheap at the grocery store Wal Mart, a case of pop and you are there for pennies on the dollar! Oh, the best part, used a plain old dutch oven on the stove top to pop the corn and it came out perfect. Literally, the BEST popcorn I have ever made, hands down.
