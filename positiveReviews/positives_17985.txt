This is the best Chai Tea Latte I have ever found.  I use skim milk instead of water, although water is fine, but I find that the skim milk give it the Starbucks taste.  I also use 2 cups of milk instead of the recommend 1 cup as it is to sweet for my taste with only 1 cup.  The tea latte taste is still there but I think it's the milk that makes it.  I would recommend this to anyone as I have not found any better
