I had hoped that this would still have a rich flavor without an acidic burn, but it just tasted bland, old, and stale.  I actually couldn't drink an entire cup and threw out the rest of the package I got as a vine member. I typically prefer a rich, strong flavor but often bold coffees have too much acid. This had no richness or flavor.
