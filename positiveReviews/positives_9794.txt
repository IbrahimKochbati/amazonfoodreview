I'm just a droolin' fool thinkin' about these tasty cakes! For all day long it's cakes, cakes, cakes!          "Japanese  ead crumbs they use", says Master Yoda. And such thoughtfulness shows, for all about my ever expanding waistline is cakes, cakes, cakes! Fresh creamery thighs and chunky lumpy rump!          My social services caseworker asks, "Where is all your SSI going? For you'll soon be out on the streets, a bigger burden on society than you are now!" And all I can do is reply, "Cakes, cakes, cakes!"          I'm just a crustacean junky, strung out on Bangor white! All them succulent chunks of Maine reef roaches infesting my soul! Thick luscious claws pinch off my sanity! I crave the gastronomic release of innumerable patties!          Oh, Santa! God! Please! Deliver unto me all of them sweet delectable cakes, cakes, cakes!
