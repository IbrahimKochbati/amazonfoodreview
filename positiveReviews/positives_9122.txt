I decided to give these a try, but was a little nervous about the flavor    I normally go with chocolate or oatmeal raisin. These are great! Kind of fruity, but very good.     I think these are perfect for mornings where I don't have time for  eakfast and want something I can grab and eat while driving or once I'm at the office.
