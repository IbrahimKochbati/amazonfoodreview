Like another reviewer, I too fell in love with the beverage while in France.  I was overjoyed when, a few months after my return a found that it was available in an expensive grocery store near me.  Unfortunately, the kind of Orangina sold in the US is not the same beverage that is available in Europe.  The ingredients are totally different.  Since this product page says "Made in the US", I can only assume this is the American recipe, which is not as tasty (but probably has a longer shelf life).  Just thought I'd give a heads up to anyone who was expecting the European version!     I miss my Orangina
