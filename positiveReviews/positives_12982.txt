I loved the Switch Kiwi Berry drink. It really does quench my thirst, leaves no after taste, and is not overly sweet. I hope the company can speed up its distribution of this product inasmuch as it's difficult to find in the grocery stores where I live. I think it's really a healthful drink, and am looking forward to finding it in my local grocery store. Oh, it just occurred to me to phone them and see if they will start carrying the product. Thank you Amazon for providing this product for us to try out.
