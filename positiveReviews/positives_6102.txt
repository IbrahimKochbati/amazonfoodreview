You know, this stuff is really amazing. You can actually create a fresh  ewed cup of Starbucks coffee in your own home for less than half the price of store bought. The quality of the coffee is very high, and the taste is almost an exact replica of the real thing. They have really done a great job with this product.          When I first saw it on the shelves, I thought, "Starbucks instant for over a $1.00 a serving? Yeah, right!" But I decided to try it anyway, and what do you know? It really tastes great. You really cannot tell much of a difference, (I suppose you could if you had them both side by side,) but the reality is this: once you load down your coffee with foam, cream, flavoring and whatnot, and you let it cool off a bit, the two are almost identical. Very, very little meaningful difference.          So, I can make myself a tasty cup of Starbucks at my own home, with my own cup, anytime I want. It saves me from having to go down to Starbucks and spend almost $1 more. The quality and flavor are good, and the price is actually right.          I recommend.
