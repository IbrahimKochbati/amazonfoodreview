This is a great price on these gummy frogs at $13.00! The cheapest I've seen them. They are all lime flavored. I bought these at the request of a friend of mine whose husband loves them, so I bought myself a bag too. They are a little too chewy for my taste, but my friend and her husband just love them. Seem to be a lot chewier than a regular gummy which is why I give them 4 stars.
