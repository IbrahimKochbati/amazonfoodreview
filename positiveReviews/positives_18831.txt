These delightfully crunchy, light, flavorful, cinnamon sugar coated pecans are heavenly. This is one of my favorite nutty snacks. Anyone with whom I have shared them loved them too.     So this year, I bought two cases to add as a stocking stuffer at Christmas. They were a hit, and a whole new group of mashuga nut lovers were born! From now on, they will make a yearly appearance in the Christmas stockings.
