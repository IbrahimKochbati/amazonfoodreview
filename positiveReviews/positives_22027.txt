I was introduced to this product about 8 years ago by a friend and it has been the ONLY popcorn in my house ever since.  I am unable to get it consistantly in my "friendly" neighborhood grocery store so I chose to buy it on line where I can get two cases if I want.     Thank you Black Jewell.          Popcorn Lover but only this one,     Susan
