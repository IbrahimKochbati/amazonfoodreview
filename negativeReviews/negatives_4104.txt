I was so excited to receive this. Thought I would cut down on the calories. I didn't like the taste at all. We baked a banana  ead and we threw it out. I am going to try again with  ownies and add a little bit more. Maybe I just did not add enough. I thought it had an after taste though. I will still use it up and try once more.
