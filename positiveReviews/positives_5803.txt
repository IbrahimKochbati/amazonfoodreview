No long, frightening lists of chemical additives, either. Nice to find something quick and easy that I don't have to feel guilty giving my kids from time to time. I have no problem paying a little bit of a premium for Annie's, it's well worth it.          Oh, and for anyone who is getting lumps, take the package directions at face value and mix the cheese separately, then add the pasta.
