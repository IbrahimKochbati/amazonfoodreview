Oh MY, do I love these! These are SO. DELICIOUS. They are soft and fresh because of its packaging. While that packaging is a bit wasteful, they really keep me in check. If they weren't individually packaged, I would probably have finished off the box within a week. As it is, when I see the carnage of all the packaging, it ususally shames me into slowing me down. LOL.          Other similar sour candies are not sour enough for me. But these ones have the perfect balance of sour and sweetness. YUM!          Five of these sour power candies have 191 calories, 45 grams of carbs and 32 grams of sugar. Ouch. There is nothing nutritional about these suckers. BUT they are delicious and with some moderation, aren't TOO too bad as far as junk goes. After I eat them, I always drink some water to help rinse some of the sugar off of my teeth OR  ush my teeth, if possible.          I have had the box for about 4 months and because they are individually packaged, I can take my time eating them. I expect that in another 4 months, I will probably be finished.
