I should have known when I saw corn syrup as the first ingredient.  This is glorified jelly.  I hoped there would be more whole raspberries or at least pieces in the filling but could not find many (if any) in two cans.  Admittedly, I purchased this to use as a topping for cottage cheese instead of baked goods.  It is terrible in that capacity.  I prefer Comstock pie fillings, which have actual fruit instead of a bunch of congealed syrup.          UPDATE: I found I enjoyed this very much as a topping for greek yogurt.  It is still too high in sugar to enjoy regularly though.
