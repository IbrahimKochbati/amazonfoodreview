I originally found this Roasted Garlic Juice at one of those roadside shops that sell a variety of foodstuffs, plants and ice cream. That was about a year ago and unfortunately, the place is now out of business. I was getting low on it and was glad to find it here on Amazon, as I couldn't find anything even close at any grocery store in a 50 mile radius. Store Managers were saying they never heard of pure garlic juice. I told them if they carried it, they would sell a lot.          I have used this product for many dishes and marinades and the flavor can't be beat! It is pungent yet smooth and will  ing out the flavor in any meat or dish you can imagine. I prefer the Roasted over the Cold Pressed, but both are great in their own way. It's nice to be able to pour or spray.          Bottom line: If you are a garlic lover, buy this!!!!!
