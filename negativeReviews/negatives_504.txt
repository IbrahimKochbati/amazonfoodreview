I've used Cento San Marzano DOP certified tomatoes many times in the past and was always pleased with the quality of these great tomatoes.     That said, this is the 1st time I've ordered this item from Amazon and ALL 12 cans arrived completely dented and banged up!     Terrible presentation for an expensive item.     As an aside, none of the cans I received has a "DOP CERTIFIED" label but only "CERTIFIED" and no serial # on the side of the cans so I'm not sure if these tomatoes are actually DOP certified or not???
