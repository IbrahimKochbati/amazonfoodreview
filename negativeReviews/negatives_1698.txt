I got coffee grounds in my cup 4 out of the 5 times I used these. Very disappointed because I would like to use my coffee. The hole punctured in the bottom is larger than the one punched out with the regular K cups, probably due to the design on the bottom of the cup. I have to flush the system each time I have used this product, wasting time and water.
