Newman's Own  and "ranch style" dog treats are a fine addition to my pantry. First, my two dogs love the taste of this particular treat; it makes for a great, high level reward for good behavior, following commands, etc.          Second, the treats are easily dividable into one  or two bite snacks. A distinct cleavage runs down the middle of each treat, which means you can decide whether to reward your dog with the "full" treat or half of it. This is especially good for me, since my dogs are of different sizes weights and can expect different treats for their rewards.          Finally, and perhaps best of all, the treats are completely odorless. I didn't put my nose up against each snack, but I couldn't detect any odor whatsoever from them, or the bag they came in. This makes the treat a win win for me and my dogs.
