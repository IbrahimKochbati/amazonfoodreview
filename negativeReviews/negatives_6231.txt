The expiration date says Oct 2013, but smells like rancid oil upon opening.  This is the SECOND container I have purchased from two different stores (the first one ALSO smelled horrible and I threw it out).  This tells me if it is a bad batch, it must be a HUGE bad batch.  I am going to look for another cereal for my baby.
