I do not eat potato chips very much anymore so I bought Popchips to see if it was a good product. After eating two bags and giving a few to friends co workers I think they are above average. My friends co workers liked them.     Still processed food but better for you than regular, oily potato chips. For what they are they work.     The price is OK. Maybe they are more expensive to make so not a big hit here.
