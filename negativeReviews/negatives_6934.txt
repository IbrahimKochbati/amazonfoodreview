When my son and I were diagnosed with Celiac's Disease, I was on the hunt for a  ead mix that would make good bagels. I finally found it with Pamela's baking mix. Always enjoying the texture and taste up until January 2011. When I baked up some bagels with the new batch something changed in their mix...and I just couldn't quite figure it out. The color was lighter and the bagels would no longer rise as they used to. The smell was nauseating while it baked and left me with a bad aftertaste and sour stomach. The texture was not chewy and the bagels did not have that beautiful golden  own color to them anymore. I was so disappointed and upset that they changed their mix which was Amazing just the way it was!  The company may receive their flour from another manufacture or they may have changed flour ratio. Whatever they have done, PLEASE change the flour back to the way it used to be! You have lost a dedicated customer! Such a Shame!  (
