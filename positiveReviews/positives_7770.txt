I have also tried the regular Lowrey's microwavable rinds, and both are good!  I love that they can sit on the shelf for weeks and then be microwaved quickly into a warm snack.  The hot and spicy isn't overdone   there is some heat, but you can still taste the rinds.  The heat is just enough to slow you down so you don't consume the whole bag in less than five minutes.          I also love to hear the crackle sound when you pull them from the microwave.  It adds to the experience.  :)
