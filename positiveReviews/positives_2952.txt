I don't drink a lot of sugary drinks and soft drinks.  I try to watch sugar intake and dislike overly sweet drinks.  By chance, I tried one of the Slenderize drinks and was amazed.  The drink is truly lightly sweet, using natural fruit juices, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose as sweeteners.  Would definitely recommend to anyone who would like a soft drink replacement that still isn't as sweet as a typical "diet" drink.
