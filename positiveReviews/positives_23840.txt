I like Popchips.  Sea Salt & Vinegar are one of my favorite.  It may be an aquired taste, but I feel it's superior to baked and healthier than fried.  The subscription serivce is wonderful.  I get it quarterly and since I know my eating habits, they seems to arrive just when I run out.  Recommended.
