I absolutely love this tea! Even before you have a sip, you can just tell that this is one awesome tea because of the smell. The mint flavor is noticeable, but not definitely not a flavor that steals the spotlight. The flavors of the tea blend together beautifully. I would definitely recommend this tea to anyone and everyone!
