A very good quality gundpowder tea. The canisters are very nice, though rather wasteful if you don't reuse them. Fortunately they are very useful. I keep some in a hardware drawer for nails, tacks, etc. I keep a dozen in a drawer next to the stove for loose herbs from my garden or spices bought bulk. The containers keep a good seal for freshness, yet are easy to open. I label the tops and keep a "disposable" plastic spoon inside each for measuring. If you can't use them, give them away ( Freecycle, Craigslist).
