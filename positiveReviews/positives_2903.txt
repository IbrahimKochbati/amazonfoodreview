I was surprised to learn that Amazon sells Gevalia coffee, which led me to search Amazon for other household items at great prices. I wish all shopping could be this easy.          Update: 12 24 11.  How can the price go from $15.00 to over $47.00. Yikes I guess no more Gevalia for me if that price is correct?
