Obviously if you're reading this you've probably already had M&M's   so don't let that stop you from buying this package!  I love the size of this bag because it fills a candy dish that I have out completely with a few left over for me to eat up right away.  They last for a while   though not as long as they should   in my house, but I'll keep ordering them as they are a delicious treat.
