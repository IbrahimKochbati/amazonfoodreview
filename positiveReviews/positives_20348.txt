This cereal has a nice texture and taste (yep, I tried it!), and doesn't make my baby constipated, the way rice cereals do.  It's very easy to mix up   use formula,  east milk, or water.  I also add other fruit or vegetable purees or mashes.  The baby gobbles it up, and I love knowing that it's organic.
