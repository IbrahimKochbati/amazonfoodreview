Okay, I'll admit it; I'm spoiled when it comes to pasta.  Having  lived in Italy for two years, my tastebuds found the 'real deal' and upon returning to the US, I've been searching for something even remotely approaching the velvety luciousness of a good Roman pasta product.  No dice.  Most pasta products I've tried end up a little too gluey glutinous.  Other than the 'gourmet'  ands which can be purchased via Dean & Deluca or similar outlets (for similar, mind boggling prices) I've had to settle.          Not anymore!          My fiance' was diagnosed with Type2 diabetes a few years ago.  When we started dating, I began modifying my pantry accordingly, figuring it might not be such a bad idea for me to start watching my carbs as well.  I found Carba Nada while searching for a good pasta, which though low in carbs, might still *hopefully* taste even remotely like pasta, without that 'stewed tennis shoe' taste and texture (Think of Chaplain's famous scene, eating a boiled boot and twirling the shoelaces, a'la Romana).          Skepticism turned to stunned disbelief   the taste is amazing, truly a wonderful, slightly egg flour y, slightly nutty and naturally buttery.  The texture is perfection, light and springy and never, 'shoe lacy' chewy.  Top it with a bit of light butter, butter substitute, garlic and romano and you have heaven on Earth.  A bit of light cream based alfredo sauce and you have pure Heaven.  Partner it full tilt with your best hearty meat based sauces and you are in Orbit Houston We Have Tastebud Liftoff.          Have I made it clear that this is truly GOOD stuff?          put the water on, I'll get the cheese grater.          Nancy Harding, St. Louis, MO.
