I like the quality of La Tourangelle and buy alot of sesame oil. I decided to try the avacado oil as I like to experiment with different ingredients..I don't eat meat. Avacaco oil was a first for me..and probably the last. And that has nothing to do with this oil...which I consider very good..it's very light...I restrict my oil intake and I perfer the flavor of sesame seed oil. I do recommend this oil if this is what you need.
