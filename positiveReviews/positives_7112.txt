I love, love, love, this coffee.  It's easy on my stomach yet it has a rich medium roasted flavor which, in my opinion is not bland at all.  It's such a delicious cup of coffee.  I have told everyone about these, I've even converted Green Mountain lovers over to Wolfgang Puck Rodeo Drive  and.  If you like your coffee fully flavorful and delicious, but not too robust or bold, this coffee is for you.  I have tried MANY K cup  ands, Tully's, Green Mountain, Emeril's, Donut Shop, etc... and this  and is equal to Green Mountain, possibly even a bit BETTER. :)
