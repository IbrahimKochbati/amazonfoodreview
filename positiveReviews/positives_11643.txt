My 12 year old Tonkinese cat not only loves this food, but she seems to feel better and be healthier after a few weeks on it. We'll see if there is enough fiber to keep the hairballs away, but for now I'm very pleased with this food. If hairballs become a problem, I'll mix in some of the Royal Canin intense hairball food.
