I just started using coconut sugar as a substitute for regular sugar in my cookies and sweet  ead. I love the caramelized flavor. I also sprinkle it on my lattes and oat meal...sooo yummy. Now I don't feel bad that my kids want to add "sugar" to their cereals and fruit since coconut sugar has naturally occurring vitamins and minerals. Love this new product!!!
