I've ordered these maybe 4 times now. I see a lot of comments talking about how they burst open during shipping. The most recent shipment I got had maybe 1 or two burst open, not hard to clean.          This is a great price, shelf stable and tastes just like the dairy french vanilla creamer. I would highly recommend it  I'm addicted. This is great to take to work and it makes others jealous!
