Baby loves this.  She is 14 months old and I scoop it into her bowl and she feeds herself.  I love that it is salmon, which I don't buy for the family, so she is eating healthier than we do! It would be nice it this food were a little easier removed from the package to ensure getting every ounce of goodness, but still love the pouches better than other packages for travel and storing ease.  My older children are always asking to have some of the baby's food.
