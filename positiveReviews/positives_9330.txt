I have given these treats to an array of doggies: english bulldogs, a boston terrier, a hound mix, and several mutt  eeds...the overall consensus? Two very enthusiastic paws up! Not one of the dogs turned it down. Pretty impressive. No matter how fussy your dog, or how limited his or her dietary restrictions, these treats not only drive them wild, but have added goodies to improve their health. Ya' can't go wrong! I also would try the other varieties (heart health,  eathies, vitality) each has a lil' something to address your dog's specific needs, and above all, they will love 'em.
