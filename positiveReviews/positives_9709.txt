I love this shake! While it doesn't look like the "chocolate milkshake" on the cover of the bottle, it's a great healthy shake. I make it with 20 oz. of almond milk and I love the flavor. It had a slightly "mocha ish" flavor and it really is awesome to me. Mixing it with double the amount of liquid, adding a tiny bit of chocolate syrup and lots of ice and shaking it up in my Black 28 Oz. Blender Bottle W wire Shaker Ball makes for a super easy  eakfast and it keeps me full for several hours! I absolutely love this flavor! I hope they come out with a simple vanilla flavor as well!
