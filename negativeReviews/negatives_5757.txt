As others have noted, these treats are made in China as clearly stated on the bag. I didn't like that, but the news gets worse.          On the back of the bag is a statement: "Not for human consumption. Wash hands with soap and water after handling."          If I have to wash my hands after handling these things, I'm sure as hell not going to feed them to my Yorkies!          As expected, Amazon graciously accepted a return.
