I've been doing a bit of experimentation with making pho at home, with varying degrees of success.  While the  oth preparation is by far the most important, you simply can't toss in any kind of rice noodle and hope it will turn out ok.  Admittedly, I was a little worried about these noodles when ordering; the  anding on the outside seems to cater directly to westerners, so I had fears that it would be an "Americanized", and thus flawed take on rice noodles.  Luckily I was wrong.          These are pretty good noodles; they are not that fragile, so you don't need to worry about them  eaking apart during preparation or boiling.  Thai Kitchen is an American owned  and, manufactured in China, but it is apparent (and important) that they have a higher standard for quality as I've struggled to find a single  oken noodle strand in the boxes I've opened.  Some of the cheaper quality 'mystery  and' chantaboon rice stick noodles I've used in the past have  oken when looked at incorrectly.  These noodles are a little bit thicker @ 3mm wide, but a little on the short side @ around 12" in length.  They take flavors very well and are appropriate for many types of dishes; perfect for stir fry, as the packaging indicates.          The only reason I am knocking a star off of these is due to the aforementioned shorter length and because they are a bit starchy, requiring some rinsing (lest you intend to thicken cloud your sauces and  oths).          If you have no real asian markets (international isle at Vons doesn't count) near you, these are the ones to get.  If you do have an asian market near you, try a few other  ands as well as this one.  You may find that you prefer these.  If you're wondering why someone with a very American name as mine is speaking about these with any kind of authority, it's because I'm asian american and grew up with no shortage of fantastic, authentic asian cooking at restaurants and at home.  Enjoy, and don't forget the    "
