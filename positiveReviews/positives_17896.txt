Shake n' Bake is a classic staple that has been around since 1965 (I believe). The idea behind this product is to mimic fried foods without frying.  Simply take the "Shake n' Bake" and put it in a plastic bag, add your meat, in the case of this product pork and literally shake the bag to coat the pork and bake it.  Once the pork is cooked it is crispy and juicy just as if it were fried.          This product is still wonderful after all of these years.  With regards to this review I utilized pork when I prepared it and it tasted great, a nice crisp and seasoned taste without being over powering.  Now if somebody wanted to "doctor up" this seasoning it could be done.  Just add some extra spices while you are "shaking".  In addition, there isn't a reason why a cook would have to be limited to pork.  Chicken and or fish certainly could be used and would taste magnificent.  This is a healthy alternative to frying food and really leaves little room for improvement.  I would highly suggest this product to both the novice cook and the "seasoned" chef.
