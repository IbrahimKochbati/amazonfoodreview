We've been struggling to move our kids from processed foods to healthier alternatives over the last couple of years, and Annie's whole wheat macaroni and cheese has been a big element of our success in this campaign... They love the taste and we feel good about the nutritional value, the quality of the food, and the relative "social conscience" that the company espouses.          By the way: it really is tasty stuff.  I try not to eat a lot of carbs these days, but I always steal a few bites when I make them lunch.  The creamy cheese sauce is more reminiscent of a good, light alfredo than of the nasty, gluey, neon orange stuff you get from the big  ands, and whole wheat macaroni is mildly flavored (and therefore and easier transition for kids and processed wheat addicts).
