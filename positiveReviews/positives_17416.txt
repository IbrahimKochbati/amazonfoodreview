I have had this for 2 weeks now and have tried various methods of consumption, the tea tastes terrible very bitter, although if you plan to make tea use lots of cinnamon to mask and maybe some honey as well. the best method (for my self) is gelatin capsules. you wont have to deal with any bitterness and this is the only thing that gave me any results. i believe it effects everyone differently, as for my self about 4 5 caps to notice any effect (more caps   greater effect). i had rather long detailed dreams that seemed to be much more real as compared to non calea dreams. I remember waking up after my first experience with the capsules and having to think really hard to determine weather or not i had just been dreaming or if what had just happened was real. The amount of dreams i experienced in one night with at least 5 caps was double if not triple what i normally have, although no lucid dreams yet and I'm not sure if it helps my ability to lucid dream since it makes my dreams seem even more real. but this did not work right away, and i would not expect any thing super crazy to happen. start off small to gauge your own personal reaction to it and go from there. the effects of this are very subtle, but it will change your dreams I'm sure of it.
