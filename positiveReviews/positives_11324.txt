The coffee itself is quite dark and rich. What's even greater is the good price. It's a little cheaper (if you compare price per ounce) than you could even get at Walmart with their large size can of the same coffee. The fact Amazon sells the small cans in a pack of six is an added bonus because the coffee stays fresh longer.
