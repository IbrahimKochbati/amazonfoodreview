Ok i have been eating this since i was a kid and this is one of the things i never get tired of eating          once when i could not get it (not always in stock) i tried Amy's Chili and IMO Amy's is watered down Salsa with beans its NOT A MEAT ALTERNATIVE CHILI          Worthingtons Chili is very thick and is very meat like if you put a spoon in a can of Worthington Chili it will not move     with Amy's the spoon will fall over and is NOTHING LIKE MEAT more like a dip          I make it with a bed of Brown Rice and topped off with cheese          Oh and its Kosher (D)          only problem i have is finding it     and i like it so much i end up eating the whole 20 ounce can with the rice
