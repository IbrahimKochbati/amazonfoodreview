love it. eating it has got to be a ritual. taste is well balanced, nice and chewy without being overly sticky, leave a great lingering aftertaste.          compared to gimbal's scottish dogs, these taste and feel more traditional, and much healthier too, given that only four ingredients go into them.          out in the midwest, ann abor to be specific, i found these in the candy aisle for around $2.80 per resealable bag of 170g.
