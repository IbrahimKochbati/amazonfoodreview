First, I expected this to be like dry jerky.  This was wet and soggy with a spongy texture.  There is something so off putting about the flavor, it's like wet dog food.  The first bite seemed okay, but I could not finish it even though it was small.  Regretfully, I decided to buy this anyway based on the reviews... I read all the one star reviews and thought "Heyyyy now, it can't be that bad! These people must be clueless. they must be expecting it to taste like real jerky, of course it's not!"  I was soooo wrong.
