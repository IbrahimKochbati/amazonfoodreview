The first thing you notice about the New Guinea bean is the size. These are large, heavy beans and I had to turn the air to full on my roaster to get the beans to circulate. Not a problem as long as your roaster can handle it. I didn't experience any burned beans.          I gave it a full roast and the results were quite good: full bodied, well balanced complex flavors. The taste is similar to the Sumatra beans (one of my favorites) so if you like Asian beans in general you won't be disappointed, especially at the price. I'll be buying this one again after I exhaust this bag.
