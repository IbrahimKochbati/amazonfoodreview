This is a very good deal. The coffee goes without saying. A perfect cup every time.  I have had a Keurig for a few years now, and to me there is nothing out there that can touch it. A fabulous, fresh cup every time. I never go to Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks anymore.          The offer is a good one. I bought 5 boxes of 24 for $10.95 each and shipping was free! I saw another review where the guy said this was "high" compared to prices locally. I have yet to find the same deal locally. Supermarkets rob you for 12 pods and Bed, Bath and Beyond gives you 16 or 18 for $9.99 at last check (and it could have gone up) as coffee has gone up. I also used to get the same coffee at the same price a couple of years ago at "CoffeeforLess.com. Their prices have increased dramatically recently. I don't see where there are any better values around online or locally.
