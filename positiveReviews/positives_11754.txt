These pancakes are the absolute best. They are so light, not dense like a lot of whole grain pancakes. I don't know how they do it but I'm hooked. And they almost smell like malted milk when they cook, sweet and toasty. And so easy. Don't have any milk or soy milk or eggs in the house? No problem, since you only need water. Great to pack if you are traveling and staying in a place with a kitchenette. I hope they make this mix FOREVER!!!
