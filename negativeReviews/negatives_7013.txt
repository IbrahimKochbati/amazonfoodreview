Our cats ran to their bowls to try their first bits of Avoderm dry food, properly mixed in with their regular fancy kibble. Being Maine Coons with crafty little paws and ambitious little  ains, they managed to pick out the Avoderm bits and eat those first.          Yum, a hit! It smells meaty and clearly appeals to them.          But we won't be buying Avoderm again....the poo is horrific. Wet, runny, stinky beyond belief. My big boy, who did mind his manners and ate a graduated amount of the mix over a week as the bag described, had the worst reaction of all. Poor guy cried as he pooped, had diarrhea everywhere, and calmly climbed into the laundry sink for washing as if he understood he was a stinky boy.          So yes, it is tasty and priced well, but the aftermath is not worth it. 12 paws and two thumbs down.
