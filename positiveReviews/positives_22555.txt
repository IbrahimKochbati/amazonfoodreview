Popcorn has excellent flavor and nearly all kernels pop every time.  It is easy to make.  Just dump everything in the popper and fire it up.  I can see where some might say it's too salty, but if it is for you, just don't dump in all the salt!  It's definitely more expensive than bagged popcorn, but for the ease of making it and the flavor, it's probably worth it.
