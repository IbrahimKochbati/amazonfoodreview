We use a good  and drip coffee maker and tend to prefer darker roasts.  We have made a habit of buying what is on sale, but preferring Colombian or French Roast.  We tried Folgers Black Silk, and now we can't go back to the other options anymore.  It is the best we have tried short of grinding it fresh from quality beans.
