These chips are excellent! They stopped carrying them at my local Costco, but I was so happy to find them here!          I guess they ran out of the plain kind because it said they were available when I ordered them... they are listed on my order sheet and Amazon invoice as "Original"... and lo and behold, I received "Sea Salt and Vinegar", not "Original".          Still a good product, but wish I had a courtesy e mail or something to tell me they ran out of "Original". I'm not a huge fan of salt vinegar chips, but at least it keeps me from eating them quickly (it lets me nibble).
