I purchased this item for my mom who has type 2 diabetes. Her glucose level for the most part, remained in the normal range using this product as a sweetener in her tea. Although this product appears to work well in preventing sugar spikes, my two issues with it is, (1) the ridiculous shipping cost and (2)it does not have a favorable taste with all tea. I have not tried using it in baking goods, so I can not comment on that, at this time.
