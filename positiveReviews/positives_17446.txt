These short ead biscuits by Walkers of Scotland are some of the finest I've ever encountered. Their adherence to a time honored recipe, with pure, traditional, and preservative free ingredients, likely explains the superb quality of their baked goods. These cookies have a nice, fresh, buttery taste, a slightly crumbly consistency [as expected], and a delightful aroma. Be forewarned, however, these things are highly addictive! Our little Sheltie girl [coincidentally, also from the Scottish Highlands] will willingly attest to this fact...she's crazy for them! The devilish truth is, that these biscuits come in at seventy calories and four saturated fat grams apiece...hence, the reluctant 4 star rating.
