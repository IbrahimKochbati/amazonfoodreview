I have one of these first thing in the morning while I get ready (so as to not keep my metabolism waiting before a morning kick start) and might have another one in the afternoon as a snack. They tastes good and I like that fact that no sugar is added. Just like apples would, some batches come out sweeter than others. In general, a good item even if you are not a huge fan of apples. Very convenient to have in the car or to take a healthy snack while traveling.
