I made this last night for dinner. It was very good. I substituted the cheese topping they provide with real cheese and then used the casserole as burrito filling. It made 14 burritos (8 inch), so it goes a long way.          If you like spicy stuff it is a little bland but that is expected with boxed meals. On the other hand, if you don't like spicy, then it is a little hot...so that could go either way.          As a side note  there isn't much meat in this so if you are wanting lots of hamburger, you would be better off with something else.
