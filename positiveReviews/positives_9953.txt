I first experienced Arrowhead spring water in Las Vegas.  I couldn't believe how good it tasted, so it made sense that when I returned home to Pennsylvania I'd load up on it.  To my chagrin you can't buy it anywhere East of Nevada. Thank goodness I could order it through Amazon.  My problem now becomes one of economics.  It's impractical to pay what I paid to get water here on a regular basis.  When I'm in Vegas I'll find a cheaper way to get it back, but I HAVE TO HAVE ARROWHEAD!!
