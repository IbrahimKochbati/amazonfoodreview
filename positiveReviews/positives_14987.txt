I bought this as a gift for Valentine's Day. My girlfriend and I were very pleased with the chocolate roses in its presentation and taste. The chocolate definitely did not disappoint; they were very delicious. I believe it was well worth the cost and even though it wasn't eligible for Amazon Prime, it arrived within five days.
