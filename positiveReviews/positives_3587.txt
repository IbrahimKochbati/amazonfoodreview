I have been buying this delicious crisp ead for many years, but for some reason it is no longer available in stores. It's an all rye product with only natural ingredients and is just a few calories per cracker. Because it's so thin it doesn't overwhelm the flavour of cheese or tapenade, which is my favourite thing to have with the crackers. I thought maybe I'd overdone it by buying two cases, but I'm already into the second box after just a week.
