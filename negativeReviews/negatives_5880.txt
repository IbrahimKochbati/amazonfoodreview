It's a good feeding mechanism for my dog who scarfs food, but as far as a toy that challenges her, it's a cakewalk.  It's a great start for Kyjen to start marketing to people that love Nina Ottoson but don't want can't spend $40 on one toy.  I will definitely try the other Kyjen games and see if they are more challenging.
