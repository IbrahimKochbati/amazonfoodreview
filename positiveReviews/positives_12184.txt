The name is not very exciting, but don't let that deter you from tyring it. It is a great cup of coffee. It is not overly strong but absolutely not weak. No bitterness and no aftertaste. It has some very subtle flavors that I can't quite identify and that makes it a unique experience. This is one of my "go to" blends and I keep more of it on hand than the other varieties.
