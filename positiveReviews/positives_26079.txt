Natural Balance is a great product.  Our cats love, love, love it.  The only problem I have with it is that I now have to buy it locally because Amazon will only allow a customer to buy a total of three bags.  And that's a total of three bags forever.  Oh well.  Their loss because I continue to purchase it somewhere else.  My guys love it too much for me to allow Amazon to stop me from buying it.
