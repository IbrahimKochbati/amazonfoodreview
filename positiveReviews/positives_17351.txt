Ever since I flew on Japan Airlines and had delicious Sencha tea I've been looking for it.  Some of the teas I've bought have a weak taste, but this particular tea has a great smell and a strong taste and can be re steeped 3 times.  The price is high for better sencha, but the price on this Rishi Tea seemed fairly reasonable considering how good the tea tastes.
