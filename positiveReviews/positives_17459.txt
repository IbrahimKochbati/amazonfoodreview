I adopted a 6 ish month puppy last month from a local shelter. He had loose bowels for a month and no amount of antibiotics and veterinarian prescribed food helped.          Pupster had been on a high quality puppy food that included the color blue and wilderness. I love that food. However, I began to wonder if he had a sensitivity to beef and chicken, as well as high percentages of protein...          Within one meal of eating this product, his stools were improved. Within two meals, I could pick up his stools, rather than wipe them off the ground. I never thought I would be so happy to pick up poop!          I definitely recommend for anyone who thinks their dog may have a food allergy. It is also good for a puppy that needs a lower protein food.
