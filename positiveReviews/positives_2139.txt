This is clearly the best canned clam chowder I have tasted. It is refreshing to have a canned soup without all the unnecessary preservatives and artificial flavoring. The can is supposed to be "Condensed", but if you like a hearty thick soup, it is better just heated without adding milk or water. The clams are perfect, and not over cooked. I will order again, and look forward to trying out some of the other products they have on Amazon.
