I've tried just about every kind of canned food there is and the only kind I can get my cats to eat is very expensive. I tried this and all three of my cats gobbled it up...in fact one was snorting while eating it. Even the picky little one loved it. The first ingredient is boneless white chicken, which is what my vet says to look for. Lots of vitamins including taurine which cats need. It has little bits of veggies and I thought they would just leave that in the dish, but they all ate that too. In fact it looks good enough for me to eat. I'm still trying other flavors, I've tried this and chicken with veggies and  own rice. They liked that one also. I also like how I can order straight from Amazon and not have to make a special trip to the out of the way Pet food store.
