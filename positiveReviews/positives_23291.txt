I have been using this  ead mix for about a year now, I really like it.  It has been the best tasting GF  ead mix I have used so far.  I have found that when the  ead cools it may have a slight grainy texture, but compared to some of the other mixes I think that Pamela's is head and shoulders above the rest. I also like the cake mixes, the baking and pancake mix, and the  ownie mix.  I use them all the time, and my kids and hubby like them too.  Check out the Pamela's website for a ton of recipes.
