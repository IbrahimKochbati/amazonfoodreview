The last bag of these I got from Amazon had a lot of hollow bisquits.  It was weird ......  they just weren't solid like they should be.  I'm going to switch to another  and of grain free dog bisquits now as there's no sense in paying for something I'm not getting (and these are expensive!)  And if it wasn't for the good packaging I'd wonder if bugs had gotten to them..... but I don't think that's possible.
