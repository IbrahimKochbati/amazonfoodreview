These USED to be whole pig ears two years ago.... but now?     They are just pig ear pieces!!  What a total RIP OFF!!     What is next?  Pig ear "chips"??     This is an embarrassment to the marketing industry... cheating     the customer.  And, it doesn't matter whether they were bought     on Amazon    or at Sam's.... the result is the same.     If the package says "25 PIG EARS"... then to package 'pieces'     is a total FRAUD.  I wonder if a lawsuit against the company would help??
