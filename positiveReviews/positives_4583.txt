These are excellent snack crackers, but you need a really good set of teeth to bite into them!  We have eaten them plain but they are probably excellent with cheese also.  The interesting thing is that once you manage to bite a piece off they are not hard to chew!          Chock full of healthy seeds, these are great for either a snack or to accompany a bowl of soup or a salad.
