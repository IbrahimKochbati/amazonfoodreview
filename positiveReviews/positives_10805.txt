To properly test this product, I had to go to my experts   our dog and her walking friend.  Most mornings, after their walk with their moms, they return to our house to play in the yard.  My role is to greet them with a tasty treat   usually a Gravy Bone, which they love.  This week I've been mixing in these treats and, based on the experts' reaction, they are quite popular.  They seem to come from a safe source and have good ingredients.  So, get some for your pup.  Hurry up, will you?  They're waiting.
