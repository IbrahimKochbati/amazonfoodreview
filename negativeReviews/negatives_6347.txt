I m a fan of this soup maker; I have purchased Bear Creek Creamy Potato and Brocolli Cheddar in large cans, each sufficient for 24 servings. Bear Creek shipped them directly to me, but their phone no longer works nor does their email address.They were well priced at 10.00, kept forever, and much could be done to these soups to make a short and simple meal fancy enough for friends. So, as a trial, I ordered this soup in a sack from Amazon. The shipping box had no padding; soup was spilled from a couple of the sacks....and there seems to be teeth marks in the sacks of soup....so,upon openning the package, I immediately,emailed Amazon asking them to get this soup out of my kitchen. They never replied. I do not recommend any Bear Creek in a sack products....not only because of a critter problem but also since they are far more expensive than the large cans.
