I love these light, airy crackers. Three of them are only 60 calories on WW, just 1 pt! Spread with reduced fat peanut butter, just 3 pts. A light part of a light lunch! I used to buy them at the supermarket, but they don't always have them. When I found them on Amazon, I was thrilled! And using the automatic reorder feature, saved me 15% and no cost shipping! Woo hoo!. Might I add, you can change the frequency of that at any time.
