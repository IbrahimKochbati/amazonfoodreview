This past December my 7 year old son was diagnosed with allergic to wheat. This is a little guy that LOVES  ead !!! He is also allergic to dairy. So, I searched and tried many kinds of wheat free  ead mix recipes and he might eat 2 bites and then stopped with sad face or he would cry. He said "it's yucky, grainy, tasted bad...". I often hid my tears, 'cause I knew I needed to be strong for him. Once I even ordered a  ead from a bakery chef, $6.50 loaf, and my son took one bite and that's it!          Then in June I checked out Amazon, and found this product. The review said it's moist and not grainy, and I was so desperate, so I ordered a box of 6! That ended my search!!          When I put the 1st loaf on the dining table, my son could not stop eating it (and of course, I cried secretly in the kitchen!). I also ordered the cake mix, and chocolate chip cookies mix. I can't express how thankful I am to see my son's  ight eyes as he enjoys his  ead. By the way, I like it too. Thank you to the people that make Pamela's Products !!!!
