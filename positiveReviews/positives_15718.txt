I am careful about the food that I select for my cats because I want them to be healthy.  Unlike dogs, cats are strict carnivores, so any fillers in cat food are unnecessary and potentially harmful.  Also, cats have a very short digestive tract, so though fiber is good for humans, it is not important for cats.  Finding a cat food that meets these stipulations takes quite a bit of research.          Petite Cuisine makes the mark.  The first three ingredients in each of the formulations in these variety packs are fish  oth, and two different fish meats.  There is no trace of any grain fillers, and of course no wheat gluten, which was the source of the melanine tainting that has now killed and sickened humans as well as pets.          The guaranteed analysis on the cat foods is crude protein   13% min, crude fat   1.5% min, crude fiber   1% max, moisture   85% max, ash   3% max, and taurine 0.1% min.          My cats of course love it.  They even seem to take a little time to savor the meal, and the food has caused zero digestive difficulties.          The consistency is similar to a can of BumbleBee tuna, with fish chunks in a  oth.  In fact, I could probably use this cat food to make a tuna fish salad, and no human would be the wiser (except for the accusatory and incriminating looks of the cats.)          The recommended daily ration for this cat food for an adult cat is 1 2 cans per 2 1 2 pounds of body weight, which is a bit higher than my other canned cat food.          Overall, this is the finest cat food that I've come across so far.  I'll probably use it as a supplement to  and that I feed as a mainstay.
