I had been eying the Popchips  and for some time but I they seemed too expensive and I passed. So, when I got the opportunity to review them, I was so excited to try them out. Unfortunately they did not live up to any expectations that I had from the good things I heard about them. The bags are hard to open but once you finally open them, of course the bag is less than half full. In my case that was a good thing. The texture is strange and light but I could get used to that. The chili lime "flavor" is terrible! Mostly what I taste is lime and salt. I like lime, but not that much. The so called "chili" flavor is almost non existent and not enjoyable. It doesn't add anything in my opinion. Despite my experience these chips have good reviews. That tells me that I just need to try other flavors. This one needs improvement.
