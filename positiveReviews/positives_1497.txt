Yes people, these things are healthier than the average chip and not only have flavor, but they taste good! I am not a big health food person, I'll take the grease if it makes it taste better. These are 100x better than those baked chips. My  other tried them while he was visiting and liked them so much it was one of the things he asked I mail him while deployed. Only draw back to these chips, they are definitely not for dipping.
