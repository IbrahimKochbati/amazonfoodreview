I love this flavor but wish it were 11.2 ounces like most coconut waters out there, I wouldn't feel it was so spendy if it were larger.  If you don't care about size you will be delighted by the fresh fruit flavor!  I drank these through morning sickness and they helped me so much when i couldn't keep plain water down.  Good gift for newly preggo lady in your life ;)
