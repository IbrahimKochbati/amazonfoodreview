Olives are yummy and a good diet snack, but I just can't quite give this 5 stars. Why?          Because first of all, the flavor is occasionally too overly strong with some of the packs I've picked up. I love the taste of chili powder mixed with olives, but sometimes the flavor just isn't as consistent from pack to pack. I'm fine with some changes in taste, but some packs have it packed on while others have been fairly weak. This isn't enough to keep me away from this flavor, but it can be aggravating.          The only other issue I have is that I wish that this was resealable. I don't often eat all of these in one sitting and I don't really like having to  ing a second bag with me in order to seal up the portion I don't eat. It would be nice if the bag was resealable via a ziplock top or a small piece of adhesive fixed to the bag. I didn't deduct a star for this, but it's something I'd like to see.          Otherwise this is a great product. The olives are always freshly kept in the bag and are of a good size. There's no puny little olives here, which I like because it's easy to get full when I eat these as a snack.
