The first thing I noticed, after  ewing a pot of this coffee, was that it did not have the wonderful coffee smell that I love so much. When I first started drinking it, I didn't like the flavor, it is full bodies, but there was definitely something missing. By my second cup, it was starting to taste better, not bad actually. So I guess when you first start drinking this coffee you will notice it's not the same as the coffee you might be use to. But after you drink only this coffee, you get use to the flavor and it becomes a good alternative to regular coffee.
