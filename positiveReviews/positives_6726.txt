I was introduced to this product a few years ago and was floored by how tasty and depending on the amount and type of milk added (2% or whole), how chocolaty the flavor could even be.  I've recently moved and don't know where to find it locally so I'm trying the online purchasing option   I'm almost out of it!          This is a very nice option for those of us who don't drink coffee all that often but want to have something of quality in the kitchen cupboard.  Goes great with Trader Joes hot chocolate powder too
