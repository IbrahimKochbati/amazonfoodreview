I was on the hunt for a Swiss Water Process decaf and happened to come across this low acid variety from HealthWise. I am very, very happy with my choice. I also purchased a Melita decaf as well, and thought it to be too strong. This coffee is as decaffeinated as it gets! No jitters, even on those days I have more than 2 cups. I highly recommend it to any coffee lovers who can no longer enjoy the caffeine and who would like to avoid the chemicals associated with traditional decaf.
