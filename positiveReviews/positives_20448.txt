Beans were well packaged, clean and minimal de is. I typically roast 7 scoops  4 days worth outside on my bbq grill's side burner in a Whirley Pop with thermometer to "full city". I grind them just before use each morning in a Kyocera conical burr manual grinder to a fine consistency (like granulated sugar). Finally, I make espresso in a Gaggia Classic using the non pressurized portafilter and froth milk to end up with a cappucino. Heaven. Starbuck's, eat your heart out.
