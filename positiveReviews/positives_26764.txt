I never dreamed a waffle could be sooo good!! The chocolate malt mix is divine. Reminds me of German chocolate cake. The texture is heavenly. Crisp on the outside and cake like on the inside. Add bananas, strawberries, ice cream, whipped cream, hot fudge or just about anything for a fabulous goof proof dessert. I will be buying more for gifts. Love this mix!!
