As others have said, these are a little dry, but they have a very nice flavour, and they are very healthy. Other  ands of oatcakes can contain sugar and more fat, these contain no added sugar. The organic oatcakes can be eaten on their own, but they are excellent with a thin slice of cheese, or spread with a little hummus. I prefer Nairns Cheese Oatcakes for eating on their own, but because they contain cheese they do have more fat and less fiber than the organic variety.
