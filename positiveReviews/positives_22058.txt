I have a Wasabi Pea addiction. Its not pretty, but its true.          Having tried all kinds of Wasabi Peas, here's my review of these in context:            Hot 7 10       Salty 7 10       Wasabi Flavor 7 10       Crunch          Other than my annoyance that these peas have food coloring in them to make them look more Green, and the fact that they do not score the highest on the Flavor scale (meaning "how much does it taste like actual Wasabi...is the flavor well rounded, etc), they are          "PRETTY DARN GOOD." (7 10)          The 5Lb bag probably would have been large enough to have let some of them go stale if you didn't divide it up into smaller bags...but I ate them in 1 month, and the flavor did not suffer in that time.          Enjoy!
