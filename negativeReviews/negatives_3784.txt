I am disappointed since regular wheat thins don't have MSG, but this variety does.  I need to stay away from MSG, since I get migraines.     I am sure Nabisco can find a way to make a flavorful cracker without MSG.     These crackers have a very strong taste, and I found that the taste stayed in my mouth for a long time.     I prefer the original, unflavored wheat things.
