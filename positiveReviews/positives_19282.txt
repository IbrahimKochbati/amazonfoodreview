The good:     1. This tastes really good to me. One of the better truly low carb pastas that I've tried.     2. So easy to cook   it only takes 5 minutes.     3. With regular pasta, I dislike al dente because it's usually too firm for my taste but with this, al dente is just right. It's not too firm and not mushy.     4. Only 24 grams of carbs + 6 grams of fiber and you get an entire 1.5 cups which is a much larger serving for way fewer carbs than regular pasta.     5. The subscribe and save price was very reasonable I felt and it's great to have it delivered right to your door.          The Bad:     1. Unfortunately this made my blood glucose rise from about 100 to about 150 within about 45 minutes of eating and it stayed up there for almost 90 minutes. Next time I eat this I'll know to exercise within 30 minutes or so of ingesting and I think that might take care of the blood glucose spike. Worth it to have some decent pasta.          I'd also like to point out that my husband had a bigger serving than I did and it didn't spike his blood glucose as many points as it did me most likely because he's more muscular and more active than I am.          I gave this 4.5 stars because I think it tastes really good, it has a good mouth feel, the price is reasonable and you get a good sized portion. Even though it spiked my blood glucose, I'm still going to keep this on the menu at least once a month.
