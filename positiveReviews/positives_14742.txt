Not sure what the previous reviewer is talking about.  This root beer tasted fine.  Not the best I've ever had, but husband has a bad reaction to artificial sweeteners EXCEPT for Truvia.  He drank most of the 24 pack that we bought and wants me to buy 48 more cans, which I will after I post this.  It's a bit expensive, but the Truvia is worth it for us.
