Yup, no stray pieces, just whole  own almonds. Which is to say that these are not "blanched"   blanching being the process that removes the actual skin of the almond (not the husk) and leaves a pale buff colored product. And the description of "lightly salted" is accurate. I can barely taste it. The can says the ingredients are almonds, vegetable oil (canola, safflower and or sunflower) and salt. That's it. Gluten free. Interestingly enough, there is no indication on either the can or their website whether these are raw or roasted. And I couldn't tell by eating them. But Blue Diamond responded to my email query, saying they are in fact oil roasted   have to be "Pasteurized", per a new California law. [You might want to know that this is a "light" roasting. I would say that it goes part way to a roasted flavor, remaining as healthy as possible while conforming to the legislation I mentioned. My taste preference is actually for the flavor of a fully roasted almond, bad me.]          They taste fresh and almondy, as they should. They make a wonderful addition in both taste and appearance, to my just created Nonpareil Trail Mix which is lo carb and gluten free as I am trying even harder to follow this kind of diet. I'm pleased to report that these Blue Diamond Almonds are properly dated: on the bottom of the can it says "BEST BEFORE JUL 20 14". That gives plenty of time to use up six little cans.          And about the cans, they seem to be metal bottom and sides, making them superior for storage although the plastic replaceable top with sealed metallic foil under it might be  eachable by the ubiquitous rodent. The little cans are nicely reusable.
