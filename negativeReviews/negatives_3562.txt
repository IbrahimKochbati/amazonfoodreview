This product has many claims, making it appear healthy. A quick look at the nutritional information, however, shows somewhat otherwise. Each bar is 180 calories, which is a good mid morning or mid afternoon snack. Total fat, though, is 9g, with 2g saturated fat. Fortunately, it provides 2g of fiber and 2g of protein. Everybody's needs are different, but this product is just outside my range of what I consider a "healthy snack".          Most of the ingredients are "organic", which is a plus. They are also sweetened with agave and coconut sugar. However, for my personal taste    and I have quite a sweet tooth    this product is too sweet for me. Perhaps it's the chocolate, or one of the other sweetening ingredients, but by the time I finish the bar, I'm reaching for something to drink to cut the sweetness. The benefit of this is that the bar is a good candy substitute if you are craving a sweet treat in the afternoon hours.          The texture is good    this bar is like a heavy oatmeal cookie. There's nothing hard or crunchy in it. It's very soft and chewy.          If it weren't for what I characterize as an extreme sweetness, I could give this product a higher rating.
