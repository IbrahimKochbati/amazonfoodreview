SOYBEANS?!          The whole attraction to cooking with duck fat (besides the flavor) is that it's a natural, healthy animal fat. Why on earth does this product need to contain soybeans (processed, not healthy)? Oh that's right, because the government subsidizes soybean farms and so soybean products must now appear in everything Americans eat. Reprehensible.
