We can't have any kind of coffee maker at work, so we're forced to buy at the in house coffee shop or Starbuck's across the street. In this economy, no one wants to pay those high prices, so we started a coffee club. 20 of us buy these coffee bags and separate creamer and enjoy fresh, hot, tasty coffee every day without paying the coffee shop prices. thanks Folgers!!!
