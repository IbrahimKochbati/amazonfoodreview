BEWARE the changing descriptions here in Amazon folks...when I first viewed this item, admittedly a convenient item to have in the pantry for a snowy day, the descriptions was for THIRTY TWO (32) 1 quart (32 oz) cartons for around $33...NOT 12 cartons as the description NOW reads. I thought a dollar per carton was a pretty good price, but I NEVER would have ordered it at almost 3 dollars a carton...that's highway robbery.          I am going to complain to Amazon, don't expect to get any satisfaction, but will try anyway.          So be careful: anytime something here in Amazon sounds too good to be true it probably is.
