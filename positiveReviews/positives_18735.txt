There's a reason Shake N Bake has been around for so long and used by so many   because it's a delicious, versatile product. It works wonders with chicken & pork, keeping it moist and providing a slight crunch with just the right amount of flavor to keep things interesting, but not overpower the flavor of the meat. It's also a tasty addition to meatloaf, or as a topping for casseroles. Sure, it's a little more expensive than just buying  ead crumbs, but in my opinion it's worth it. Good stuff!
