I hate returns.  FDA product recall come out after product was received.  In order to get a refund, product was to be shipped to Manufacture.  Someone at Amazon was able to refund the purchase without this hassle.  For that I'm greatful.  If I had to box, ship and now deal with a third party and the paperwork involved.  I would not have been a happy camper.  Customers should never have to go through a third party with recall issues.  I didn't, hope none of your other customers had to go through a maze to return product.          Note:  Product tastes good.  At least when I have bought it at health food stores.  Didn't get to try my order from Amazon due to recall.
