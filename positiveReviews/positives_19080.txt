I tried a couple of spoonfuls with this by itself. The first few were like a shot of Vodka...straight. Yeah...Baby! All my boyfriend could think and say was "fish eggs", and "Yuck, not me". Where I come from, that just means all the more for me. I got the 4 pk subscription. It is almost as if there is no salt at all, but the vodka may be strong for some. Since I am the only one who has the taste for it in my home, one jar can last for 2 days. By the way...NOT FOR KIDS.
