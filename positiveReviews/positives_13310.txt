These are soooooooo delicious!  I just baked these this evening and they were a huge hit.  We all agreed that they taste just as good if not better than some of the best wheat flour  ownie mixes out there.  They were moist and very rich with a crunchy (but not hard, just right) top. I cut back a little on the margarine.  It calls for 7 tablespoons of butter but instead I used 4 tablespoons of Earth Balance with 3 tablespoons of applesauce.  Also, I baked them in cupcake liners because I like to freeze them and take them out as needed.  It tasted perfect this way but I can't comment on how this modification compares to the original recipe since I haven't tried it the other way.  I will be sure to stock my pantry with this mix!
