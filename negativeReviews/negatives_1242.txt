Google "propylene glycol" to find out why.  I bought this product, along with several others, without running the ingredients by my wife first (a nurse of 30 years) she     was surprised when she noticed it.. we went a googling, and poured my $50 order down the drain afterwards.  There's "pure" and then there's "not so much".....          from the website:  [...]          Propylene Glycol          A cosmetic form of mineral oil found in automatic  ake and hydraulic fluid and industrial antifreeze. In the skin and hair, propylene glycol works as a humescent, which causes retention of moisture content of skin or cosmetic products by preventing the escape of moisture or water. The Material Safety Data Sheet warns users to avoid skin contact with propylene glycol as this strong skin irritant can cause liver abnormalities and kidney damage.     Also used in:            Tyre sealant       Rubber cleaner       De icer       Stain removers       Fa ic softener       Degreaser       Paint       Adhesive       Wallpaper stripper          I wrote the company about this concern and they never responded....
