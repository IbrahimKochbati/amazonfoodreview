After figuring out that I was gluten intolerant about 3 years ago, I tried a bunch of  eads (mostly frozen) available in specialty grocery stores, and a couple from dedicated GF bakeries, but didn't really like any of them.  I made my own GF  ead for a while, using a Bette Hagman (Gluten Free Gourmet) recipe, and that was good, but quite time consuming.  Once my baby was born and I had no time to bake  ead from scratch, I discovered Pamela's GF  ead mix.  It's very easy to throw it in the  ead machine, and it comes out great.  The house smells good, the  ead is fairly soft, and it keeps longer on the shelf than the  ead I used to bake.  (I still usually freeze 1 3 of each loaf, because it does start getting stale after several days.)  Now, I usually add 1 4 cup of flax seed meal and 2 T water to the mix for Omega 3s.
