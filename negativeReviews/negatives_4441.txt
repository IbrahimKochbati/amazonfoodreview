i have just  ought one small package of Canidea from my oversea agent 2weeks ago, before my puppy only tried a french  and. First i was just mixed them together and seems ok, but then the old finished there is something weird happened to her, she started eating the stools??!!  :( yes and also vomited white yellowish foam and coughing after totally swished into this  and, even sent her to vet checking blood, taking pills and medical treat which i was thinking she might catch cold. anyway only feel lucky is vet cost much cheaper here...     then now she refuse to eat it or only a little if really hungry. most of time she'd rather biting a bone, glad saw the comments here, i will change it to other  and asap :)
