The scent upon opening this can of loose Earl Grey Tea is delicious in and of itself but once  ewed....it's amazingly scrumptious!!  I like tea but I've tried a lot of varieties and  ands only to find many have weak flavors (despite their initial scent) or are bitter, especially if too much tea leaf is used.....but not this one.  I experimented with different quantities of leaves in the same size cup and each and every cup ALWAYS tasted fantastic with great flavor and NO bitterness.  Of course it's the Earl Grey flavor which I love but I will be trying Rishi's other flavors after drinking this one.  If you are a tea lover and like this flavor, give this one a try....you'll like it!
