This product is very rich and delicious. It adds a wonderful traditional flavor to our our gluten grain free waffles and pancakes. It's about a 1 3rd of the price here on amazon.com than it is at stores for this size container too. It lasts long in this house since we only use a pinch at a time but a little goes a long way! That's why we happily chose the auto ship option too.
