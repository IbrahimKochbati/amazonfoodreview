Yes, this is delicious vanilla chai...the best I've tasted. However, the product description says "99% caffeine free" and this simply can't be true. I ordered the single serving packets of this product and the package clearly states the caffeine amount. Each serving actually contains 65mg of caffeine per serving. That's almost as much caffeine as a tall Starbucks espresso based drink. Almost twice the amount of caffeine in a can of Coke!          If you need the caffeine boost, enjoy! But if you're watching your caffeine intake for whatever reason, be aware!
