I wanted to have "sized" portions of chip type product that would be tasty and filling.  I tried at least 6 different  ands of popcorn type snack packages (unfortunately, most came in 24 36 item packages).  After receiving the first 5  ands, I felt they were total waste of money.... 2 had texture of light styrofoam peanuts, with almost no flavor.  A couple others had reasonably nice flavor, BUT only had a couple small handfuls of popcorn in each bag so way overpriced and I definitely did not feel satisfied after 1 bag.          Then I received the variety pack of PopChips.  I first tried the barbeque, which turned out to be my favorite.  They have nice strong bbq flavor, nice texture, and each bag has enough to feel satisfying.  The Original and Sour Cream and Onion came in lower second, but most of the others were just ok to fair  (not worth eating for my tastes but interesting).          Best of all, the nutrition counts are good, with each bag only having 100 cals, 3 grams fat and 15g carbs (0 Cholesterol).          I would definitely recommend this product (and above flavors) over all the other popcorn types I tried.          P.S.  PopCorners White Cheddar  and came in SECOND.  Nice crunchy texture and pleasant cheddar flavor
