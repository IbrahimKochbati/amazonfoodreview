I have tried other gluten free  eads from the store.  They are not that good.  I used this mix to make regular rolls and cinnamin rolls(recipe on the package).  It is different tasting, but very quickly I got use to it and really liked it. It has somewhat a egg taste to it.  It is not dry, which is nice.  I will continue to purchase it and recommend it to anyone on a Gluten free diet.     ps. I mix and knead it by hand.  No need for  ead machine.
