Amazon doesn't list the ingredients of this, but it does contain lots of high fructose corn syrup and regular corn syrup.  Corn syrup, especially the high fructose variety, is quite bad for you.  It's cheap for manufacturers, that's partly why they use it.  I'm disappointed in Heinz about his.  Due to this, it has 4 grams of sugar per 1 Tbsp serving, double the sugar of another bottle of regular ketchup I have.  Since most of us use at least 2 Tbsp per serving this is quite a bit of sugar.          Second, this uses Potassium Chloride, the main ingredient of No Salt salt substitute.  This can be fine for many people (used in moderation) but it is a strict no no for people taking certain blood pressure medications, such as myself (I think many medications in the ACE inhibitor family especially).          I should have somehow found the ingredients list from Heinz itself (or somewhere on the net) before buying this.  Maybe I tried, I forget.  At any rate, for your convenience, here is the list of ingredients, in this exact order from the label:     "INGREDIENTS: TOMATOE CONCENTRATE MADE FROM RED RIPE TOMATOES, DISTILLED VINEGAR, HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, *POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, SPICE, ONION POWDER, GARLIC POWDER, NATURAL FLAVORING.  * NOT IN REGULAR KETCHUP"          Interestingly, this did not come in a case, even though 9 is the minumum order.  It came as loose bottles in a box.  Also, there was a barcode description label sticker over part of the manufacturer ingredients list and nutrition info label in the exact same place on each bottle.  This was probably for internal Amazon purposes.  I bit of a pain to peel back to read underneath, but you only really need to do this on one bottle anyway, so not that big of a deal.          I hope this review is helpful.
