The following is just my opinion so take it for what it's worth.  I suppose some reviewers actually liked this, but I have to say without any doubt whatsoever, this is absolutely the WORST jerky I've ever tried.  I've grown up on the stuff, and I like a real cowboy beef jerky.  This stuff is soft, kind of falls apart in your mouth, and I'm sorry just plain TERRIBLE.  If you like a good jerky that you can chew on a while, this isn't it.
