I bought my  ewer last Sunday. I have been waiting a long time to buy it, and I'm really satisfied of my purchase! I could taste plastic in my first cup of coffee, but I ran a cycle with water and vinegar, and then a few cycles only with water, and it fixed the problem. I can't wait to receive my free k cups from Keurig! I'm so satisfied I think I will buy a Keurig Mini to use at work!!          If I had something negative to say, it would be the choice of cup sizes. If I want to fill a travel mug, I have to  ew two cups, one large and one small cup. But otherwise, I'm completely sold to this product. Sure, I would like the k cups to be less expensive, but if you buy them on the internet instead of the grocery store, you can save a lot. Also, you can buy a reusable plastic k cup to  ew your own coffee. I would recommend this machine to any coffee lover :)
