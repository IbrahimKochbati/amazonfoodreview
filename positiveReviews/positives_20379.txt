I recently started my 18 month old son on this cereal and both he and I are very happy with it   I wish I had found it sooner! It is gluten free and provides 60% of his required iron (as well as a lot of other things he needs to grow well). He likes the taste and it mixes easily.          My only complaint has less to do with the product itself than the packaging; the cans are only 3 4 full, which is a blatant and shameful waste on the part of the manufacturer.
