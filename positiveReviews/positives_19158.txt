I just love this coffee. It is very complex in tastes. I got a few through a trade and kept putting off ordering it. I would say it is a light medium roast. I really hate dark chocolate but in this coffee it is amazing. The raspberry and dark chocolate are "true" in taste. I use sugar and cream creamer and it is like a dessert without the calories. I don't want to be without it in my cupboard. Which is why I wish it were on subscribe and save program here on Amazon (hint).
