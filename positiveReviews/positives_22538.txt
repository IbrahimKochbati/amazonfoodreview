We have been using this product for over a year now and that should speak volumes because we are a popcorn loving bunch!  The convenience of having everything measured and ready to go at a minute's notice is great.  I have a popcorn machine in the media room and so we love to munch popcorn while watching movies.....we feel we are at a theater eating the "real deal".  I will continue to purchase even though it isn't the most figure friendly popcorn....taste outweighs the waist....tee he.
