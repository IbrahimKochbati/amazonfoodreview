This is one of the few products my spoiled  ats really appreciate. I look for bargains and sometimes I find cheaper elsewhere. This product is from petfooddirect.com and often they offer coupons through email. My kitties only like the elegant medleys and basically refuse all else and they only like a few of these too. I am stuck spending all my dough to feed the felines. Oh well ...
