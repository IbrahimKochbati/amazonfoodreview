I wanted to have an instant coffee for work.  I don't like the standard company coffee at work. I came across Medaglia D'Oro in a HEB store in Houston.  It just looks more interesting than coffee.  I was actually hoping it wouldn't be as strong as espresso but not as watered down as instant coffee. I am glad I bought it.  It has the same consistency at espresso but not as strong in taste.  I am probably using more water that what is suggested on the directions.  I work 3rd shift, so I think it is fitting the bill of keeping me awake!  True espresso drinkers may think it is kind of weak but it would do in a pinch.  I will use this for flavoring drinks & desserts also.
