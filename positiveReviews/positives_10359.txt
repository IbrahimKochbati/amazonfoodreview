I really  like this dental treat and my dogs love them.  They are wheat free which is great for my German short hair pointer who is wheat intolerant.  Only problem is it is hard to find this product in my local pet stores and on line.  I even contacted the manufacturer, who was not very helpful in locating it and just referred me back to my local pet store who hasn't had this in stock for EVER.  I have since given up on finding it.
