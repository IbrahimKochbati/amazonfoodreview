Summary:  way too sweet, no berry kiwi flavor, small serving.          Upon first taste, both of us found this juice to be excessively concentrated sweetness.  Additionally, both of us detected no hint of berry or kiwi flavor.  Neither of these problems is surprising when looking at the ingredients.  It is made from juice concentrates + water to reconstitute, and the first two juices are apple and grape, so no wonder it tastes like apple (or white grape).  The mild carbonation that is there is insufficient to cut the excessive sugariness of this juice, which makes it have a very think and non refreshing mouth feel.  I think it needs more carbonated water (or serve with crushed ice and let it melt for a while), and it definitely needs more actual  kiwi and berry fruit flavor.          Next we compared Switch Kiwi Berry to Trader Joe's similar Strawberry Kiwi Juice.  The Trader Joe's juice actually tastes like strawberry & kiwi, and is not too sweet, and not too thick on the tongue to be refreshing.  So it is possible to make a juice of these flavors that is actually good.          Finally, it is in a very stylish slim can, which means that it does not hold very much: 8 oz specifically (the usual canned soft drink contains 12 oz).          By the way, fruit sugar (fructose) is still sugar, and this drink is full of it.  When they say "no *added* sugar", that means they didn't add any *more* to the overly sweet apple and grape concentrates they were using, which is not the same thing as saying "no sugar" or "no sucrose" (table sugar).          disclaimer: we do not drink sugary soft drinks, so if you do, you may like this one.
