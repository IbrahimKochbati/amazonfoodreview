My son has autism and is on the GFCF diet.  He loves this mix made into cookies.  I remove the chocolate chunks ( trying to keep them as low in sugar as possible)  and I add 8 tspns benefiber and 1 4 cup baby rice cereal to boost the nutrition.  Then I add 1 4 cup flax oil and 1 4 cup olive oil and bake on a pizza stone   they never burn on the pizza stone   might burn if cooked on conventional bakeware.  My son love these and he is a very very picky eater.  The  ownies that this mix makes are fabulous, too.  Great for birthday parties.
