I ordered these for a friend who has a chow golden retriever mix.  This dog is about the same size as a typical golden retriever.  He LOVES these treats.  Absolutely loves them.  I've never seen so much tail waggin'!          It's great to know that treats don't have to be junk food.  Just look at the ingredients in these and you'll see that they're probably healthier than most of the "people food" we eat.
