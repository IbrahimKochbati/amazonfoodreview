We have three dogs. One (Shaunty) is a Bishon Frise. Shaunty has had a tendency of developing "hot spots", a dermatitis type problem. Our vet recommended we switch to a duck and potato dog food, which we did. All three dogs love the  duck and potato dog food so the switch was easy...although the dog food is expensive. Anyway, when I saw these duck jerky treats I had to try them. We've been buying them monthly on Amazon's subscribe and save program and all our dogs look forward to their daily treat. You can buy this product with confidence.
