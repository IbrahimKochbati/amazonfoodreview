I love this tea! I've been on a raspberry flavor kick for eons and as with everything else that has many variations and  ands representing the same flavor, there are lots of hits and misses. I tried Bigelow's other raspberry (caffeinated)tea as well as a few others and they didn't have the punch that this decaffeinated one has. I add some sugar to a tall 18oz mug for my hot tea and I'm in heaven! Since this is made with "hibiscus, rose hips, apples, elderberries, natural & artificial raspberry flavors. Gluten free" might be why it's taste is more pronounced and might upset tea purists, I really don't care. I buy this for the great flavor. I would love if there were large single bags for ice tea pitcher filling as I wouldn't want to use up a box of bags in just a couple of pitchers, so they will remain only for my hot tea use.
