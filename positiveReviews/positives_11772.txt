Kodiak Cakes Buttermilk & Honey pancake mix is by FAR the best tasting pancake mix I've ever used.  The fact that it is 100% whole grain and all natural is a major bonus. I feel very good about feeding this to my son. If you check the company's website you can find some great recipes. My son loves the one for pumpkin pancakes. Do not hesitate to buy this mix. You won't be disappointed and the subscribe & save price can't be beat!
