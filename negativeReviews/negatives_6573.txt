I'm 35yo and I remember eating this stuff for  eakfast all throughout my youth.  I loved it.  Loved it to the point that there were days that I would eat it for  eakfast and dinner if I could get away with it.  For some reason I stopped eating it.  I saw this and decided it was time start it up again.  I'M SO DISAPPOINTED!!!  The flavor is completely different.  The end product is soupy and letting it sit for a bit doesn't help.  The portions sizes do seem like they might be a bit bigger but that's the only good thing I can come up with.  It might be a healthy choice but I think I'll just stick to my fresh fruit  eakfasts.  This is just bad.
