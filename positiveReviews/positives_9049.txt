This was a gift for our daughter. She loves it,since it holds more cups than the carousel. She loads in her favorites in the front part, and less used flavors in the rear. The only drawback might be is that if your cabinets hang low over your countertop, you may have difficulty with the added inch or two in height, since the  ewer sits on top of the drawer.
