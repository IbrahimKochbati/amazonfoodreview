We were using a kong treat dispenser ball before which our dog would just toss until all the treats came out and if they didn't come out easily she would just stop playing with it.          The tug a jug is great because it requires a more complicated effort on the dog's part to get the treat out.  She finally figure out how to put it upright, knock it over, and then pull on the rope to pull the treat out.  the clear container and the smell holes keep her interested in the toy.          the only thing that isn't good about it is that it can be noise on a hard floor.
