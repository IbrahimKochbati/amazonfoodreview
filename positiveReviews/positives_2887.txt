This is the BEST!     Years ago, I used it & loved it! Moved & could not find it again. I have purchased many hot sweet sauces over the years, trying to find this flavor. Recently, I found it again at World Market....now I'm addicted! Everyone has mentioned great ways to use it.     My favorite....I use it on my salads, along with a little fat free dressing. Now, I eat tasty salads every day, (without the cheese!).          Sodium is 200 mg per tablespoon....and the amount of added flavor is worth every mg!
