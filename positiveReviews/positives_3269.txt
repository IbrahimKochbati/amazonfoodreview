My Mom's Impossible Veggie Pie was a staple in our house   especially once I became a vegetarian as a teen.  As an adult I served it regularly to my family.  Ten years ago when my celiac was diagnosed it was bye bye veggie pie.  I do try to eat less processed foods but I really did rejoice when I heard about the GF Bisquick.  We had Impossible Broccoli Pie last night for the first time in a decade and it was wonderful.  The mix is just as easy to use as the non GF alternative and produces the same results.  No crumbles!  How often do you see that in a GF product?  I bought a box at the grocer to test, then went directly to subscribe & save here.  This will be a staple in my GF kitchen.
