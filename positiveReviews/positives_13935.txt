I really like this product!  I first read about it in my Diabetic Living magazine and since I love peanut butter, wanted to give it a try.  While it will never replace the real thing, it had a really good roasted peanut flavor and a smooth, creamy texture.  I ate it smeared over two Corn Thin cakes, with 1 2 tbsp of reduced sugar jam and it was really satisfying, all for 104 calories! I probably won't eat this by the spoonful, like I love to do with peanut butter, but it will be great in sandwiches or with apples as a healthy snack.  I am very satisfied with the taste and texture of this peanut butter.  Yay!
