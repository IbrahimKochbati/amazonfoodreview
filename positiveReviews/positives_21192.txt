I grew up eating this, so for me it's a comfort food. BUT my (meat eating) family can't live without it! Don't see anything interesting in the fridge? Open a can of Chili! My adult children still  ing their friends by to ask 'Hey mom, where's that website you buy this?, s he wants some too!' If you're unfamiliar with this vege stuff, try it first with tacos. The beauty is that the chili has no heat  you add your own preference.
