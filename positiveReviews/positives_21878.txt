I can't describe fully the immense calmness this tea  ings to you. It is as good as being immersed in a warm bubble bath listening to Kenny G. No? Ok, how about as good as lying in bed on a Spring morn feeling the sun warm you and at the same time a wonderful Spring  eeze blow across you...     Seriously folks, this tea is fantastic and very soothing, a real treat of fruity tastes but not overwhelming. Love , love , love it! You won't be disapointed.
