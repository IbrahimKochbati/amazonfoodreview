I would have to say that my dog is a picky eater. I have tried all types of different  ands of food and finally found one that she loves. She also suffers from skin allergies and even though she is on meds I think this food has helped a bit with her dry skin. I only have one issue her  eath smells really fishy after she eats but thats not even a big deal anymore. Also the price is cheaper than other online stores like petco and petsmart plus free delivery. All in all If Mona's happy so am I.
