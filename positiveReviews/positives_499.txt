This is a delicious tea!          I'm just now becoming a tea geek and really exploring the stuff I like, and Earl Grey is amongst the top, especially with bergamot.          The problem I find is the amount of bergamot added is usually too little, or too much.          This one is perfect! I really like the balance in the flavor. I don't add anything to this tea, just a part of a teaspoon in a cup and in 2 3 minutes it's ready.          Tastes like an expensive tea but priced like Lipton. Definitely recommend it for fans of Earl Grey with a kick!
