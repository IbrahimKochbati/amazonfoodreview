I'm having some of this for lunch & wow. I'm not a great cook but this makes me look like a chef!. This rice, first batch, is fluffy & light, The aroma & taste are light & fresh like rice from the Asian market. The whole kitchen smells delicious. This rice doesn't seem even distantly related to the usual grocery store rice.     The product is very clean in a beautifully prepared sealed bag.     Will order this again!
