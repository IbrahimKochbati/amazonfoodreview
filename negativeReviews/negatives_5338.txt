First, I have to confess I LIKE coffee! However, there are times it simply doesn't like me. That's why I was excited to try the Puroast Low Acid Coffee French Roast. Finally, maybe I would find a less acid y coffee that tasted like coffee without the side effects. Unfortunately, this one wasnt it. When I set it to  ew, I was waiting for that pungent aroma of coffee to waft through the kitchen. I waited. I waited. Finally, a small hint of coffee aroma. OK, so if I couldn't have coffee aroma, I'd settle for coffee flavor. Unfortunately, I was again disappointed. If this were put to the blindfold taste test, one would be hard pressed to identify it as coffee. It had an odd, almost chemical taste that wasn't exactly pleasant. I thought it might 'grow' on me and even forced myself to drink a second cup. It didn't grow on me, sorry to say, although I didn't feel any acid after effects like I often do with regular coffee. Puroast upheld the low acid portion of the bargain admirably . . I just wish they'd have upheld the coffee part as well. I wont be buying this as a coffee substitute; I'll either deal with the acid and have both the taste and smell of coffee or do without.
