This honey is delicious!  Wonderful range of flavors going very deep.  The jar says it was processed at a temperature not exceeding 115Â°.  It is a product of Brazil and certified organic by Oregon Tilth.  The jar also says:  "This South American Honey is harvested by communities of bee keepers from Brazil.  Fear the killer bee, prolific and hardy pollinators known for aggressively protecting their hives, but have no fear of the wonderfully rich taste."  This honey gives less of a sugar high and more of a sustained endurance joy.
