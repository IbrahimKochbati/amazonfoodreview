This pub mix is really a cut above your average snack to be sure.  I tend to pick up a tub of it at the local Walmart here anytime I venture there.  The flavor of it is really hard to pin down.  It's sorta a salty, garlic onion whatever type of blend that truly works deliciously.  I'm a self confessed snack a holic that has tried just about everything around, and personally I have not tasted anything that is quite like this blend.  It's really good with your favorite beer, or just by itself and I highly recommend it.  The only down side to this stuff is the price.  Which is not something usually cared about or taken into account with UTZ products, which tend to be very reasonably priced for the most part.  Unfortunately like a lot of things that are really good, this mix is not easily found locally.  I see it only at the local Walmart here in the small 20 oz size that carries a hefty price.  I buy it anyway on occasion for its so good, but make no mistake about it, its not cheap as snack chips go.  And unfortunately I do not recommend buying this mix on Amazon in any size.  It's way too expensive here for any deal currently being offered.  If you wanna try it or like it already, I suggest you search it out locally at your big department stores, (it's never found in supermarkets 'round these parts), spring for the price, and grab an ice cold beer and enjoy...
