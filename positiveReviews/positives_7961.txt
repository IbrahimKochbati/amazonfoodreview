Bel Paese Cheese is an excellent soft Italian cream cheese.  These medallions arrived in excellent condition and were allowed to rest for a day under refrigeration.  The taste, while a bit bland, was very good and was spreadable on water wafer crackers.  The ordering process through Amazon.com was a troubling and difficult to complete, but the shipping was relatively quick.  I would recommend this product.
