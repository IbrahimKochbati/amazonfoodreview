Pops up light and fluffy, and tastes just like what you get at the theatre.  If you have purchased a home popcorn machine as we have, you will appreciate the convenience of the pre measured packets.  No guess work involved; just great popcorn every time.  We buy it by the case in 4oz and 8oz packages.  This way if it's just my husband and myself, we make a 4oz package, and if we have company over, we can use the 8oz.  I'm sure it would be cheaper to get plain popcorn and oil, but this is well worth the cost, and isn't the popcorn what you like about going to the movies anyway?
