I have a chihuahua that is the pickiest eater in the world!  I could not find any treat that this dog liked.  I finally tried the Pro Treat Liver treats for dogs and she loves them!!  I actually have to give them to her at different times on different days, or she will get use to when she will get them.  Example, I was giving them to her when I got up every morning, so every morning she would wake me up at like 3:00 am so she could have a treat!          These are the best treats and they are good for her!  It's a win win situation!
