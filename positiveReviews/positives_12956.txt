This stuff is surprisingly good. A lightly carbonated fruit drink, it's got a tangy sweet flavor that's really unique. The cans themselves are awfully small, but the taste is truly big. It's made from 100% juice with no added sugar, corn syrup, or artifical sweeteners, yet plenty sweet enough naturally for most people's taste I'd think. My 12 year old son loves it too. A terrific, natural drink. Ingredients include apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, rasberry, and strawberry juice concentrates reconstitued with filtered, sparkling water. It's all natural though they have added vitamin C so that it provides 100% RDA. A most excellent drink I'll continue buying for a very long time.
