While no instant coffee will ever taste as good as a freshly ground then  ewed cup with filtered or spring water, this is as good as it gets otherwise.  While pricey, the packets are handy and convenient, the directions are easy (just add 8 oz of hot water and stir), and the taste is smooth.  I even got a bit of a caffeine buzz.  These instant blends are not as bold or strong as getting a regular cup of columbian or Italian roast at a Starbucks location, but still a very good cup on the go.  I really like this instant coffee and will continue to purchase them.
