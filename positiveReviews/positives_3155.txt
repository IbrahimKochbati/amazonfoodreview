We've only had the Blue Icicle 1 week, but my daughter loves it, and is working with it every day.          How good is it ?  My daughter is 18, and turned down $25,000 a year in scholarship money to Pepperdine's Music program as a coluratura soprano.  Her voice is so perfectly re produced using a Shure 57 and the Icicle, that I can not tell when she sings and when she plays it back through the computer, an off the shelf Dell, using a pair of $30 JBL computer speakers for sound.          The icicle is really good.          Now they can replace the old TV commercial, from "Is it live, or is it Memorex ?"     to  "Is it live, or is it Blue ?"
