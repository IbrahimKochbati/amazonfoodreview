This could possibly be the best tasting chip I have ever eaten. It has a nice smokey bacon flavor. I would make sure this item was always stocked in my pantry if the price was not so high for the amount you get, or if they would sell this "AMAZING" chip here in the states. I would highly recomend someone paying the price one time just to try this.
