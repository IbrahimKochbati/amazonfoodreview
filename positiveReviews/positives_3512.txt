I am not much of a coffee drinker, mainly because I do not drink caffeine, and because I have never acquired the taste for coffee. However, I was tempted to try this product, and I was really surprised by how good it tasted.  It did not have any of the bitter after taste, and more importantly, I could not tell that it was decaffeinated.  This is important because most decaf coffees have an "odd" taste to me, but that "oddness" was missing from this product.          Furthermore, I had to ask a coffee lover for an opinion, so I asked my mother in law, who drinks all kinds of coffees from all over the world almost 5 times a day.  She was skeptical at first, because she refuses to drink decaf.  However, after a few sips of this coffee, she said that although it is a "mild" coffee, it was in fact very tasty and nothing hinted at its decaf origins.  She liked it so much, she poured another cup.          Between the two of us, we have almost finished the bag.  It should pass the test from even the pickiest coffee drinkers.  I positively recommend this product, and I hope you enjoy your next cup of coffee from this company.
