It's all natural, no artificial color, no weird ingredients . . . but it also has no taste. The sauce is thin and runny and doesn't have much flavor. If you need a boxed dinner in a pinch, then by all means use a product with natural ingredients. But if you want good mac and cheese, stick with homemade.
