For those allergic to peanuts and tree nuts, seeds from flowers such as these are a good, safe alternative  but not all the time.  Flower seeds too are often processed in a facility that manufacturers peanuts, leaving them unsafe to eat as well.  This  and, however, has no allergen warnings and solve that dilemma.  I use this in place of peanuts to make "sunflower"  ittle.  I also use these in granola mixes bars,  eads, toppings for fruit crisps, etc., knowing my granddaughter will be able to enjoy them  safely.  When I bought these, they came in a 3 pack, now it's a 12 pack.
