I purchased 6 boxes as gifts at $21 per box.  I spent over $120.00 and none could be used.  Every piece was  oken and could not be used for the Seder.  Sending a gift that is  oken and can't be used is very embarrassing.  Also the return window is April 18th which is ridiculous since the matzo was for the first Seder which was on April 18th at night.
