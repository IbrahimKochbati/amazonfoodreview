I have been searching for a tasty gluten free cookie cookie for several years, a taste that was equal to the cookies of regular eating days.  Lucy's Oatmeal Cookies ended the quest.  They are DELICIOUS!!! They are also a perfect size for a quick snack and ever so satisfying.  The calorie content is also good.  I am anxious to try other varieties.
