We NEVER run out of Greenies! My little baby loves these treats. It is an added bonus that they are good for dental care as well.  Greenies got a bad rap for a while but they have been reformulated and are chewier now. We buy the teenie size for her because she is only ten pounds. My Mia dances for these treats and leads (herds) us to the treat jar for her daily fix!  Amazon has the best price for this quantity and shipping was fast!
