Lately my husband and I have found our taste in coffee changing so that we tend to like darker, richer coffees. However, after using a very dark roast, strong coffee for a while (I don't want to give the  and because I'm not slamming it or anything) we both noticed we were getting more heartburn than usual. So when I saw this product available through the Amazon Vine program I decided to try it. This coffee is very finely ground and and very dark in color. I noticed it has a slightly different smell than other coffees, though I can't  describe it well. It's  a sweeter and less sharp odor than most coffees have. However, when we  ewed it, we found it made a dark, smooth, very flavorful coffee. Both of us knew what it was, so I can't say for sure if we would have noticed anything different about it if we hadn't known ahead of time what we were drinking. We both liked it and thought it tasted as good if not better than other coffee  ands we've tried (and we've tried most every popular  and: our favorites are Starbucks and Folgers). What I can't answer yet is the question of whether or not this coffee would be a better choice for those with recurring heartburn.Neither of us had any heartburn after drinking it, but we only got enough to make two small pots through the Vine program, and we haven't purchased any more.  If you find coffee is giving you heartburn but you don't want to give it up, I would definitely recommend you try this coffee as it tastes as good as other  ands on the market that are not lower in acid.
