Arrived within time frame and as stated.  My dog loves these chews given once a day, and reminds me when it's time for them (I'm sure she would want them more often if I let her) and the vet notices cleaner teeth.  They should always have owner supervision when eating these though to prevent any choking accidents.  Good to do business with.
