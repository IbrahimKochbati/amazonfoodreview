This is very good maple syrup, but like most pure maple syrup, it is very expensive. My husband and I duped ourselves when purchasing this product. We did the math wrong, and though that we were paying about $25 for a half gallon rather than only 32 oz.  Man was I surprised to see how small the jug was when it came in the mail!
