This cereal is LOVED by everyone in the house as well as anyone who comes to visit.  Even my 6 year old and 4 year old nephew.  The best price is on the subscription order.  Costco used to carry, then quit, and I found on here was by far the cheapest price.  Once in a while you can get a coupon for other places but for all time price is here.          The cereal is loaded with the Omega's you need as well as the fiber.          You can't go wrong but watch out you'll be hooked.
