My Experience:          It's very translucent, with just a light golden color. It smells like you'd expect a peach to smell, but the taste hints of a white grape juice, though it has no grape in it and tastes more peachy over time, especially as it warms up. It's tingly on the tongue, but doesn't foam up. It's slightly drier than your average juice, with a hint of bitterness, probably from the carbonation.          Did I Like it: Yes, though not as much as their offering in Pomegranate Apple, a 6 out of 10. My wife doesn't like it so much.
