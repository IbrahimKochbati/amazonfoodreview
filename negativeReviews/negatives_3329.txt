Little things to know   these biscuits are rock hard   if your dog has fragile teeth avoid them, if your dog devours everything in sight you might find they work.  They are about 1" square and 1 4" thick with a 2 biscuits stuck together   they even put a score line in the 2"x1" pair so you can  eak them with your hand.          They don't have a strong odor   in trainging my dog right now we've had several tests where we put down yummy treats and teach the dogs to walk in an oval avoiding the treats.  This particular one was ignored by all dogs   it doesn't smell good which seems to be the key to a treat working well   hot dogs were preferred 10 0 over these biscuits by the dogs in the class.          I am presently training a pure ead (3 generation 1 2 german 1 2 american) german shepherd dog and treats are an essential part of the process when your dog is food motivated.  The Lamb and Barley flavors don't really attract the attention of the dog when working with it and build attention  .  This dog is spoiled rotten getting a kong stuffed with peanut butter frozen overnight and fed GSD dog feed designed for the nutritional needs of a GSD.          Training involves repeating the command and holding the treat in front of the dog's nose to get them to learn the commands   these worked the first time then not so well  I had to find something that smelt better as the dog would igore the treat.  Presently my dog is 6 months old and in a weekly training class with other dogs   we use chicken pieces, turkey pieces, and hot dog slugs to entise the dog into behaving well.  These were nowhere as motivating as the hot dog pieces which seemed to get the most attention.          I am pleased that they are organic in nature but they lack a strong odor for the pet.  The pouch they come in is helpful to keep on your belt when training as well.  I don't see a real value in the product for dog training   they are almost too big for even big dogs, so hard to  eak they are pre scored to 1x1, and just don't get the interest of the dogs   we tried a malamute, a husky, and my dog and they were only effective if the dog was really hungry!  Also the price is kinda high   I found a 10 pack of hotdogs next door for $2.50 which included a zipper pouch too.
