I just made my first mocha, and this is the the most amazing coffee! I can really taste the espresso along with the chocolate. This is going to make a wonderful  ew in the mornings. A definite improvement over what I was drinking, and I was drinking some pretty good stuff, and certainly a lot cheaper than Starbucks! I would put this on par with the Starbucks, and they have just raised their prices again. This is where I will be buying my coffee from now on.
