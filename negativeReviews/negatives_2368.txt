An otherwise good gum reduced to a three star review by really mind boggling packaging. I fail to see the advantage of the foil covered capsule approach. I lose approximately one piece a pack by pressing just the wrong way and having the gum shoot out of the package like a cannon, forever lost.          The gum itself is decent, lasts for slightly less than a twenty five minute car drive, packs a comfortable punch, and improves  eath. Still, it's not outstanding, and doesn't overcome the poor packaging, so won't be buying any more.
