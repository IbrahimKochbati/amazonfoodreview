I ordered this for my father who always gets heartburn from certain types of foods, including regular coffee. Basically it's a great find if your digestion doesn't handle coffee   he didn't have any problem at all from this blend. As others have commented, the flavor tastes very light and may be too weak for some, though it depends on whether you're used to overpowered Starbucks or more subtle  ews. It's also not cheap but he said it was worth the extra cost to enjoy a cup of morning joe again!
