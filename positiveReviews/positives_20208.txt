Our Siberian Husky is overweight and on a diet.  She also is great at building placque and tartar on her teeth   baad  eath! She has a touchy stomach on top of it all.  Tried these bones in all flavors and she loves them.  They help with her teeth and  eath.  She gets one bone for her lunch (she's a 3 meals a day gal).  Her other meals are now canned green beans with either yogurt (plain) or low fat cottage cheese.  She has lost about 11 lbs and is doing great!  No more throwing up her food!
