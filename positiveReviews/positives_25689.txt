We regularly take Yerba mate as our tea and this particular  and is what we consume. It is easily  available at our local supermarkets.          I would like to see subscribe and save of amazon become more popular and useful as it allows us to simplify things. But boy, someone at Amazon needs to listen to the customers and understand that the customers are educated.          Many many of your grocery prices are silly when compared with local market prices in US. This product is a perfect example. It sells at normal MSRP for $9.99 lb in Austin TX in WholeFoods or SunHarvest, yet amazon price is $16.67 lb for a bulk pack? In fact this trend is true in many of the departments. Amazon needs to start showing prices that are real rather than try to "show" a big discount. A good mindset to follow would be that of Costco Sams rather than a shady pawn show.          Fix it, and amazon's subscription business for groceries & household utilities will take off like you wouldn't belove it. I  for one would be happy to shift *all* of my reoccurring, non perishable food supply to Amazon.
