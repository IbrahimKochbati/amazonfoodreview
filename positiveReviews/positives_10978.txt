I love these crackers and even serve them to non Gluten Free eaters with great success.  The multi grain crackers have fennel seeds in them so if you don't like the taste of fennel be sure you get one of the other two flavors.  The original flavor tastes like a cross between a saltine and a ritz cracker and those were my two favorite crackers before I found out I couldn't have gluten.
