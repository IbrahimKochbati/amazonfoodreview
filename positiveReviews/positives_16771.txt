I was skeptical for a long time about agave nectar and finally gave in and bought this!  Wow!  Wow!  This is so yummy.  I have been baking with it following Elana's Pantry recipes and everything has turned out wonderful.  It is fantastic in salad dressings, smoothies, frostings, cupcakes, and on hot and cold cereal.  AND it is so yummy, you just want to eat it plain! I love that it has a low glycemic index.  This is definitely a new staple in my pantry..and the great price on Amazon makes that possible!
