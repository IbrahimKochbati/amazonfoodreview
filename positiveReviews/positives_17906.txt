Shake and Bake is a popular coating and has been loved for years.  This packet is the same, and provides a crunchy and flavorful coating for the pork chops.  I generally use boneless, but have tried this on think boned pork chops also.          I like the taste, and I feel the crunchy coating keeps the flavor in.  For leftovers, this makes a quick run and go snack.          Tasty!  .....Rizzo
