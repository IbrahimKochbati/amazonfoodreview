There's something wonky with the product description.  It's a single bone, not "3 slices per bag."  And apparently there's no uniformity with this product.  Another reviewer said their bone was small, 4 inches.  The bone I got was HUGE, way too big for my dog.  I gave it to my friend's mastiff who enjoyed it but that's how big this bone was.  If you're a fan of roulette, proceed.
