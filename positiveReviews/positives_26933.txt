If you are one of the beef jerky lovers who really enjoys the soft tangyness of beef jerky that is most resembled in terriaki flavored beef jerky, you should know that it is extremely hard to find such kinds. Sometimes it's just sheer luck that you get a bag of the same texture you want. To me, I felt that this beef jerky wasn't as good as some of them but definitely better than a lot of the main  ands out there. This bag, has a LOT of beef jerky, and it is somewhat soft. However, it isn't like chewy tangy and is still a little dry. Some people like it, but to me the texture is not great. The flavor profile though is delicious.
