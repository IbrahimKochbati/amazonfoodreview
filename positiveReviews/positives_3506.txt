I've tried to give up my coffee habit, but it just hasn't been easy.  DH and I did manage to switch to decaf a couple years ago, so I suppose that's something.  I'm a moderate coffee drinker  I like 1 2 cups of hot joe to get me started in the morning, and *love* a nice chilly iced coffee on a hot afternoon.  This Melitta "Riviera Sunset" decaf is smooth and doesn't have the bitter aftertaste that I dislike in one of the leading coffeeshop  ands.  The flavor is great and I've enjoyed it both hot and iced.
