Arrived timely no problems with the cans ,they were packaged securely. I feed my dogs frozen nuggets from this same company and I have them special ordered to a local pet store. We are going to travel this summer, so I wanted to see how she would do on he canned before I ordered a whole case from the supplier. It is great food. No diarrhea !
