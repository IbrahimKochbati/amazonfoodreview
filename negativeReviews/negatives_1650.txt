I gave this a try because I love carbonated juice stuff like bottled cranberry, apple, grape from Welch's and the like.          Personally I liked this pretty well, though not as much as some other  ands.  To me, it tastes and smells like tangerine, and I felt like I could kind of taste some of the component flavors making it up the flavor is more complex than you'd get from a fruit flavored soda.  The carbonation is pretty light          I definitely wouldn't mind trying some of `The Switch's other flavors...BUT, I split some of the tangerine flavor with a relative, and she thought it smelled like Jell O, and didn't care for it she said she'd rather have regular juice.          I definitely liked this better than orange soda though!
