I bought the Med size for my Mini Dachshund to keep her happy when i go out for a few hours and she is in her crate. I know she loves somthing when she does the little dance and bolts to her crate waiting for the nutrident. Other chew leave gooey messes on the carpet and come apart easily however this one i have never found any evidence that she ever even had one. Highly recomend the vet says her teeth are in tip top shape because she gets one a day
