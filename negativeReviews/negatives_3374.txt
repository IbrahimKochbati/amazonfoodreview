Amazon's excellent customer service allowed me to receive a replacement box of these crackers when I started opening the bags and finding tiny pieces of crackers.          However, the second box came exactly the same way.          The taste of the Original crackers is a lot like a water cracker. Not much to it but it's absolutely perfect for whatever topping or filling you're using.          I would order them constantly if they were not all  oken upon arrival.
