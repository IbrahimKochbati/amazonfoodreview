This is the second time I've purchased Coombs Family Farms Grade B Maple Syrup and when we empty this jug, I'll buy another. It's difficult to find Grade B maple syrup where I live, so having it available for purchase via Amazon is great. Grade B syrup is thicker and more flavorful than Grade A, I find, and I prefer it on my pancakes.
