Besides the fact that these sardines are an excellent source of omega 3 fat (at 1.6g per can), these sardines are just plain yummy. I think of them as "raw material:" Crushed in a bowl and mixed with ranch dressing, they make 1 1 2 excellent sandwiches. Eaten from the can with beet greens, fresh oregano and a bit of Himalayan sea salt, they make an entree that dirties exactly one fork!          Besides being delicious, these sardines were a bargain at $1.37 per can. With a Prime subscription like I have (in order to stream Prime TV and video to my TV via my Roku) the $1.37 per can includes shipping. Speaking of shipping, the box that held my dozen tins of sardines was too nice to throw away...
