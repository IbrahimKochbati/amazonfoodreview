A short while ago, my doctor looked me in the eye and said, "Buddy, you got acid reflux real bad."  (My dentist said the same   only he was able to make his announcement a bit more colorful by showing `worst case scenario' pictures of teeth on battery acid. He put me off coffee for a week.)  So, with that double whammy in mind, I've lately been trying to cut back on acidic foods.  Hence my decision to go the low acid coffee route.          And like the headline says, this coffee is a good news bad news situation.          First, the good news: Puroast Coffee does in fact appear to be legitimately low acid.  I've noticed a distinct reduction in acid reflux activity after drinking it.          Now, the bad news: this coffee is kinda bad.  I should note, this isn't the opinion of a coffee snob:  while I like a good cup of Peet's Coffee as much as the next guy, I'm a okay with a batch of Folger's or the basic house  and of whatever chain store I happen to be shopping in.  I'm usually just looking for a pleasant kick start in the morning at a price that isn't highway robbery.          Alas, for all of its low acidity (and decent price), this coffee ain't that pleasant kick start.  There's an unpleasant flavor to it that is rather hard to describe   other than to say that Puroast doesn't really taste like French Roast coffee.  Even doctored up with cinnamon and milk, the unpleasant flavor remains.          So yes, this coffee is effective, if you absolutely need to have coffee.  But if you're looking for a pleasant, low acid kick start to your day, black tea might be a better, tastier option.
