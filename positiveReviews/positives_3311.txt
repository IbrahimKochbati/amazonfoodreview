I bought this on a whim because I was craving strawberry shortcake... wow! The biscuits can be a bit crumbly, but the texture is not objectionable. The taste was great! I use this for sweet and regular biscuits.          We also use this for pancakes, and they are almost indistinguishable from regular pancakes. I add vanilla, a touch of  own sugar and cinnamon for a treat. Yum!          Tip   I've found that most gluten free " ead" products work better if you let the batter sit for about 15 minutes after mixing the dry and wet ingredients. It seems to activate the batter, which makes the resulting stuff lighter and more moist.
