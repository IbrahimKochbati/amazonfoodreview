I empty the coffee from my K cups into a container to use on my lawn and after opening these K Cups little white specs caught my attention because I have been doing this for months and have never seen anything white in my coffee before. Upon further inspection I noticed that they look a lot like larva and then I was horrified as I saw larger bugs in my coffee grounds.          I am very upset about this, I use to love coffee from my  ewer but have had a very hard time trying to drink a cup now, knowing that I could be drinking another cup of bug juice, makes me want to gag really. I do not understand how this was allowed to happen. You would think The Green Mountain Coffee Company would have a quality control department?
