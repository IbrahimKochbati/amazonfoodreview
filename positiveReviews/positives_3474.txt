First off,  let me state that I am not a fan of decaffeinated coffee of any type.  But I often have guests over who ask for de caf, so I gave this a try.          While I agree with some other reviewers who have stated that there is a certain "different" taste about this blend, for me, it was not a bitter taste, but instead, a good, strong flavor that mimicked the strong (real) coffee taste I enjoy.  I had a second cup, and the flavor grew on me even more, and I thought: "it really is delicious for a decaf."          The aroma isn't truly satisfying (why does this always happen with decaf?) but I think many decaf drinkers will be used to that lack.          The package had to be snipped open with scissors   this is tightly packed!   and then I just poured it into a zip loc for storage in the fridge.          I'll stick with regular coffee, but I'm sure my de caf loving friends will enjoy this.
