Be sure to do your homework re: this product before purchasing.  I have three dogs, and they were all getting sick once Canidae changed their "formula" late summer to early fall.  Once I googled the product and read the many complaints, all with dogs with the same symptoms, I immediately took my dogs off of the food, and they've been healthy again since.  I'll never trust this product again, and had been a loyal customer for 3+ years.
