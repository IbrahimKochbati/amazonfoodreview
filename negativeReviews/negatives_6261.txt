Our baby has been eating the oatmeal cereal for about five months now. Just opened up a recent case from Amazon and the first two cans out are definately different than what this product has been in the past. It is not white in color, but green gray, it is also not as 'fluffy'. The rancid   acrid smell is definately present. It smells like a two year old can of holiday nuts that went stale long ago. I am somewhat shocked at the number of reviews and comments that have had a similar issue. The Manufacturer does not list a phone number on their website and e mail is the only contact method. I got an auto response e mail with a 718 number that is no longer in service.....not inspiring much confidence in this  and.
