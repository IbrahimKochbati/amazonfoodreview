First thing first, my dog goes absolutely nuts over this!     She can smell the roast beef flavor from another room.          I originally bought this as a healthy alternative to rawhides for my dogs teeth.     But after reading the ingredients, there is really nothing healthy about it.          It's nice the product is fortified with vitamins, but not so nice when it's full of grains and fillers as the base ingredients.     I went with Sam's Yam's Sweet Potato Raw Hides, as they are truly "natural".          But for those who are feeding low grain or no grain dog food, this should be ok as a once in a while treat.     But if your dog is on a more generic dog food, then there is absolutely no place for even more grains in their treats.
