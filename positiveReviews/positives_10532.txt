Out of all of the McDougall soup's this is my favorite flavor. It does take the full 5 min or more to get fully hydrated with the pasta, but its so flavorful I really enjoy it and eat it everyday for lunch. McDougall's soups have helped me stay with my vegan diet and I never feel like I give up taste or quality.
