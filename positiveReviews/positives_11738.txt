We have several relatives with dietary restrictions in my family, including gluten and dairy sensitivity, so I was happy to try these Pamela's "Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut" snack bars. These taste good, with well balanced chocolate and coconut flavors, and have a pleasant moist consistency similar to most other oat bars we have tried.          Since these are gluten and dairy free, everyone in my family can enjoy these without worrying about the effects.          UPDATE: We like these so much that we have now reorder these for family and friends.          Recommended!          CFH
