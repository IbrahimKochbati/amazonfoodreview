I bought both the Creme Caramel and this Hazelnut kcup and I couldn't tell them apart even if my life depended on it... The flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too and unlike the Caramel one, this one has a nasty bitter aftertaste like the flavor is artificial.  Yeah, I know it's artificial but I hate that it actually tastes like a chemical!  Yuk...          This is one of those coffees you can serve to company who doesn't know good coffee or people you don't want to have come to your house any more as one cup of this and they won't be your friends after it!  It really is quite bad.
