I wish I could buy this rice blend in my local store.  RiceSelect Royal Blend rice is for those of us who like flavorful mixed grains, with the firmer consistency only possible with long cook rice.  The nutrition in this grain combo is phenomenal and the taste is fabulous.  I buy the 4 jar package and it comes out cheaper than if I could actually talk my grocer into carrying it.  The flavors complement a gumbo,  ish rice,  a bacon ham and pecan casserole, or anything with a stronger flavor even oriental and indian dishes.  For milder dishes like Indian Butter Chicken, you might like your regular white, basmati, or jasmine rices, although I generally use these whole grains for almost everything.  Jars were package very well, packed for shipping very well, and shipped promptly.  Rice lovers will love this product.
