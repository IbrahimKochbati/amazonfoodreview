I ordered a couple of tines of these dark chocolate dipped glazed apricots.  They were totally delicious.  My only dissapointment was the presentation. The apricots are not in individual paper wax cups, to prevent them from mushing together in the cans.  I would certainly buy these again for my family, but would not reccommend them as a gift.
