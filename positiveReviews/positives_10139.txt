I LOVE these noodles.  You HAVE to cook them right, drain and rinse or they WON'T be tasty.  I drain them and rinse until very little scent of soy is left then add to HOT pan with a little coconut oil. I add garlic, onion, red pepper flakes and a little salt and cook for a while then i eat em like ramen with a slice of cheese .  Very good diet food.
