This is advertised as garlic mayonnaise on Amazon, but on the other side of the jar, it clearly states in French "sauce aioli" in case you were wondering. This was delivered with Amazon prime shipping without the added expense of shipping when buying from Eurogrocer. I hope it comes back in stock, as it goes great with seafood.
