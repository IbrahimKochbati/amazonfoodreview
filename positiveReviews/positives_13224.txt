I was recently in Mexico where I sampled this for the first time.  Not quite sure why I'd never tried it before as I go there every year...but, WOW, this was an eye opener.  It's all the best flavors of the Yucatan in a bottle!  Lime, chili (but not too much) and salt, with a few others thrown in for good measure.  It's tangy, zippy, salty and wicked good on almost anything.  We roasted chicken with it, put it on the guacamole, stirred it into black beans and even used it to rim Margarita glasses.  I'd call it the best seasoning ever.
