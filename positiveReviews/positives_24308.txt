I used to buy Big Train Vanilla Chai all the time from a local coffee shop when I lived in the mountains of North Carolina. However, after I moved I could not find anything that compared to it. All the usual chain coffee shops just couldn't match their quality. So I decided to start buying my own. If I am using a cup that holds 12 oz of liquid, I usually heat 6 oz of water, 6 oz of milk, and add 2 scoops of chai for an excellent combination.
