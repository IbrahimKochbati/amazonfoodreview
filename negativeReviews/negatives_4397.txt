I normally use Senseo, but since Amazon is not a distributer anymore, I thought I try Baronet Decaf. Even with an exp. date of 12 13, it smelled old and tasted old. I thought it was perhaps one package, but no, all 3 packs were the same. I hate to be wasteful, but I had to throw them out. I do not recommend this item.
