This product is the best choice for adding calcium+vitD and protein in your diet. Cow's milk gives me stomach trouble whereas this doesn't. I drink it regularly myself. I also add the powder in my home made baby food for my son starting around 6 months. Powdered form has an additional benefit. You can reconstitute it into whatever concentration you'd like. Yum!
