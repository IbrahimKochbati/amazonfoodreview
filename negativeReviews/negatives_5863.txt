The title says it all, the flavor is just ok, no real OOOOO factor.     It doesn't really taste like creme  ulee, for those who know that that tastes like.     It's kind of caramel ish with a burnt aftertaste, not my favorite.     We're stuck with a whole extra box that we'll probably only drink when we're desperate.     If you want a GREAT cup of dessert coffee go with Timothy's German Chocolate Cake, you wont be disappointed!
