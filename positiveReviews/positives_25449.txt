I bought this cherry juice from a local Harris Twitter and loved it.  It taste very fresh, clearly better than juice reconstituted from concentrate.  But it's too expensive here at Amazon!  I think I bought it for $6 7 bottle from the local store.  Was hoping to find it here cheaper but quite the opposite.  Disappointed.
