This is the very best maple syrup you can buy commercially.  Vermont has the strictest laws governing their maple syrup, which relates to the amount of water (basically cooked down so that it is less thin and more pure taste).  Whenever I've tried maple syrup from Canada or any state other than Vermont, the syrup has more water and much less flavor.  This does need to be refrigerated, so spoil your family if you want to make them feel special...simmer the amount you'll use in a pan with some fresh orange zest and a smidge of Korintje cinnamon and Double Strength Madagascar Bourbin Vanilla, and fresh orange zest.
