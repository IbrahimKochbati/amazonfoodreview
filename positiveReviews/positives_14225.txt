I ordered this as I do not like feeding my dogs junk.  I read the ingredients and decided that even though it's pricey it would be worth it for the pooches.  I have to say, they are crazy about it right away.  The smell is a bit powerful when the bag is opened, which immediately attracted their attention.  They each took a taste and I swear, they smiled!  I also ordered the duck formula; can't wait for that to arrive too!          I have a Chihuahua, a Maltese, and a Beagle.  Each of them thinks this is absolutely divine. My dogs are self feeders, meaning there is always a bowl of dry food available to them.  They share one bowl quite happily.  A nibble here, a nibble there.  They are so pleased and I am too, knowing that they are eating something that is both nutritious and healthy.  None of them has a grain issue, I just prefer feeding them more meat than fillers.  Buy it, your dogs will love it!          Now, to keep the cats away...
