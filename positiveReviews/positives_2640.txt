I haven't actually tried drinking these just as hot cocoa but I know the peppermint flavor is great as a creamer for the Van Houtte Mexican coffee...I'm ordering another box as this adds just the right amount of chocolate to my coffee.  Been trying to find a coffee flavor that does that but so far adding these to the coffee has worked out better : ) I usually have 14 oz at a time so I run 4 oz through as hot chocolate and the other 10 as coffee. I did try another  and of kcup hot cocoa and it wasn't as good as this  and.
