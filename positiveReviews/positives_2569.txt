Of the few Hot Cocoa flavors we've tried, this is the best so far.  It has the richest flavor and I dont notice the artificial taste that others have commented on.  Its also very affordable compared to other k cups right now.  I thought that the k cup making process must have gotten more expensive over the last year, but now I know they are truely sticking it to us since these are still reasonable priced.
