These two dogs, Red & Zazu, are very tolerant of visitors, ready to offer a lazy tail wag for a friendly hello. Today I went in with the closed and sealed bag of Newman's Treats  The minute I opened the door, both dogs were on their feet, wagging all over, to greet me.  I have never seen these pups so excited to see me!  Was it my new haircut?  I think not!          Each dog was delighted to get a treat... and another treat... and another treat, until I decided I'd better put the bag away or see them both explode.          Newman's Treats are definitely doggie approved.
