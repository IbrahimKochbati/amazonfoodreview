I am giving it a 3 star review because the product was nothing like I was expecting. Yes, they were raw peanuts, but they were halves and pieces not whole shelled raw peanuts like the picture is leading to believe. I make candied nuts and wanted to try a new  and of peanut. Overall, they tasted fine but were not the peanuts I wanted.
