It is always fun to experience nostalgia and that is what happens whenever I eat one of these bars. I searched for them for years, they were a favorite of my mothers in the fifties and mine also. I found out they stopped being made in 1981. What a letdown. Then I discovered them in a catalog that deals in nostalgia. I don't know when they started making them again.Of course, I checked on line and found them much cheaper at Amazon. The price is right and the candy great. You smack the bar on a counter to crack it up to eat. It comes in other flavors, too. Only problem for me is that I would prefer to buy a box of assorted flavors instead of one box of 24 of one flavor, but since it's vanilla it's okay for now.
