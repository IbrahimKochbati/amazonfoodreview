Janie Marie Appleseed prefers the Chinese chicken to the pot pie, and especially laps up its saucy goodness, so score one from the kitty's POV. Me, kitty Mama? I think it would be cool if they were available as one or the other to the box. Or even singly, but guess that probably wouldn't make sense through Amazon. I like that Petite Cuisine is available in small cans, as she never finishes a 6 oz. meal in a single sitting, but wish there was a little plastic lid the right size to fit when she doesn't even finish 3 oz. Also, for my druthers, it's overkill on the packaging. Lose the inner boxes, just stick the 24 cans in the one outer box. Oh, kudos on no food coloring.
