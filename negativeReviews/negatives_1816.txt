My golden retriever loves these bones!  I ordered them and they arrived in a timely manner.  However, when I opened the box, they were old   meaning the filling was somewhat dried and didn't completely fill the hoof due to shrinkage.  Once the plastic is removed, the filling pretty much falls out.  Very disappointing!
