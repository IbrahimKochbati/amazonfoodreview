Before you turn to other name  ands out there, give these a try. Although the Maui Onion can be a bit salty at times, i can still say these are amongst the crunchiest and tastiest chips I have ever had. Now i have tried both the barbeque and Asian style flavor, but still I must say these are the best. If you are looking for something to snack on that tastes good, these are the ones for you. Its better than the pringle's commercial, since these are harder to put down once you start.
