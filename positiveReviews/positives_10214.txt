I have seen these for awhile, but hadn't tried them until now.  And now I will always have a package on hand!  It makes doggy pill giving SO easy   they love 'em.  One of our Irish Setters sometimes needs buffered aspirin, and while they are supposed to be beef flavored, we had to hide them in tuna or something else for her to take them.  Now, it's a  eeze!  And our younger setter is on a month of large capsules for Lyme, and these Greenies Pill pockets are the best!
