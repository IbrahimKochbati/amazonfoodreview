Finding great tasting steel oats that cook as quickly as processed oatmeal is not easy to do. These oats can even be microwaved and never get gummy. I originally found these in California while visiting family and could not find them in Virginia when I returned home. You have to purchase two big bags minimum when getting them from the Internet,  and they are big bags, but I intend to share one with friends.
