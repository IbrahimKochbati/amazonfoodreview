I purchased this item for our 11 year old dog on the recommendation of our vet. Our dog loves these treats, and they seem to help her joint discomfort. They are a good size for a treat. I give her one or two a day and have noticed an improvement in the way she moves around less limping. Try them. Your dog will love you for it and you'll like what it does for your dog!
