We are disappointed with the Great Northern popcorn for our new machine.     It seems stale.....and 'chewy'.     We have a popcorn machine up north and it pops beautifully and tastes like theater popcorn.     However, the popcorn we have just received seems old.  We're very disappointed....and wind up not making popcorn very often.
