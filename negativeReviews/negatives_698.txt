I ordered this thinking it would be a yellow cake mix.  It is a heavy cake and is  own. That said, it comes in handy to make streusel coffee cake, upside down cake and other augmented recipes because it is a basic mix and in those recipes the heaviness isn't a problem.  Plain cake though was disappointing.  So get creative instead.
