If you live near a lake, pond, ocean, etc., don't buy this.  It has a warning right on the label that it's dangerous to fish and should not be used where it might run off into lakes or streams.  I guess if you live in the middle of the desert, you might be OK, but otherwise?  I'd pass.  I have a storm drain right behind my house that empties right into the local body of water, so I had to send this back.
