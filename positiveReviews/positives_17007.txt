My 4 month old Standard Schnauzer really loves this toy so far. It's quite large for her and I almost waited to introduce it to her until she got bigger, but she'll take the rope in her mouth and drag it all around! (Mine has the purple and white rope which seems better quality than the older style solid purple rope that  eaks easily.) She knows the kibble is in there but can't seem to figure out how to make it fall out. But we play with it together and she's getting the hang of it. It's a fun toy for the both of us to play with now and once she gets older and can figure out how to get the kibble out on her own, she'll love to play with it as a distraction until I return home. High quality, very sturdy, I am very pleased!
