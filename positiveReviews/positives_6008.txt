Very tasty but my only complaint is that it's very oily.  If you let it sit and cool, it develops a fatty "skin," and my plastic spoon gets a film on it while I'm eating.  I gave it 5 stars anyway b c it's still the best canned chicken and rice soup I've ever tasted.. but outside of canned soup, homemade is always better.
