Started out OK, but after a few weeks my dog decided she didn't like the taste all that much, became picky and wouldn't finish her feedings. I ended up discarding a half bag and switching to Wellness  and Puppy mix. Canidae does produce very dense, dark stools so if you have to pick up poop this makes it easy. With a 1 acre fenced yard I don't bother.
