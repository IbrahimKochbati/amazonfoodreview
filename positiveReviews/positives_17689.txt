I only got to drink one cup of this to make this review, but I thought it tasted great.  What I like about good coffee flavor is that earthy, rich coffee taste that comes from quality coffee and just being fresh  ewed.  I tested this right after the coffee maker had finished so it was as fresh as it could be.  I like a little honey and fresh cream in mine and I was sad I only got to have just one cup.  I had to share with others at home and they all liked it as well.  I couldn't tell if anything tasted different since it is supposed to be low acid.  It tasted like regular coffee to me.
