I bought this to make my own version of Starbucks' passion tea at home. It's really yummy!          You get A LOT of hibiscus flowers. The tea itself it tangy and fragrant. I make according to the directions but double or triple the flowers to make a concentrate to pour over ice. I add the Starbucks melon syrup to it. If you can't find the Starbucks syrup, the tea still tastes great with honey, agave or enjoyed plain. I also quickly rinse my hibiscus before  ewing.          I've never purchased hibiscus before so I can't tell if this is good quality or not, but I'm really happy with my purchase.
