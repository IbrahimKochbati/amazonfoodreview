First off, I am a Dunkin Donuts coffee guy.  I like it the best out of major  ands, either from the local franchise (cream and sugar) or made at home (black).  Dunkin Donuts' coffee is not for everyone, as it has a heavily roasted taste.  At work, we purchase Starbucks Sumatra from the local coffee delivery distributor (it's actually cheaper than DD or other  ands!).  Starbucks House Blend used to be what we bought, but everyone in the office (myself included) felt it was one of the most acidic coffees to drink.  Their Sumatra is stronger but less acidic.  I'm no coffee expert, but the last couple years has definitely opened my eyes to the nuances of coffee flavor.  With that experience, I was interested to try this product.          The flavor, off the bat, is certainly less acidic.  I drank it black, as I don't typically add anything to my coffee.  It has a fuller coffee taste than many decafs I've tried, but there is a bit of a dull taste to it.  I made it at home, and have a very clean coffee maker, but it was just a little off.  I prefer it to Dunkin decaf, but not by much.  If you require a non decaf coffee with low acid, this is a fine choice.  It may improve with sugar or creamer too.  There may be better choices out there for this type of product, or coffees which are full flavor but less acidic.  I am not extremely sensitive to the acid content in coffee, but if you are, this should be a good choice for you.
