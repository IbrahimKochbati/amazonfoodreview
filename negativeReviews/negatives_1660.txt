I sampled this product with some reservations. Carbonated fruit juice? My wife said that it would probably be something like Orangina, but since I'm not particularly fond of Orangina that didn't help me much. I then remembered that I had no problem drinking sparkling grape juice so this might not be so bad after all. I sampled this product cold, as warm fruit juice and warm soda are both bad ideas no matter what the flavor.          I was very surprised to discover that I enjoyed this quite a bit. I expected there to be some acidity to it, given the orange and tangerine combination, and found none. I did find it surprisingly sweet considering that there's no added sugar. It was not, in fact, entirely unlike your garden variety orange soda with a smoother finish. There was a slight and very  ief metallic aftertaste which I first assumed was from drinking it right from the can, but after a second taste from a drinking glass the aftertaste remained. Still, it's not enough to put me off from drinking it.          The one thing that did put me off was the price. I'll admit that I'm something of a "cheap drinker"   I have a hard time, for example, going to the grocery store and buying a half gallon of lemonade for $2.50 when I can buy a $2 bottle of lemon juice and a $2.50 bag of sugar and make two gallons of lemonade and still have three pounds of sugar left over. I *always* do the math and price out what I'm drinking. (Do you have ANY idea how much money Coke makes off those 20 oz bottles?!?) So for this product, $23 for a 24 pack comes out to 96¢ per 8.3 ounce can, or about 12¢ per ounce. A half gallon of Tropicana orange tangerine juice at the local supermarket is $3.80, or about 6¢ per ounce. I happen to have a carbonator and chargers are about 40 cents apiece, and it would take 2 3 chargers to do the entire half gallon, so all said and done it would cost me about 8¢ per ounce to make my own carbonated orange tangerine drink, so it's about 2 3 the cost to make it myself. (No, I didn't factor in the cost of the carbonator itself so that could be considered loading the dice.)          So I guess the bottom line here is, if you're really big on the whole carbonated orange tangerine thing then you can either buy this product and not be disappointed, or you can make a very close approximation of it yourself for about 65% of the cost (assuming you have a carbonator). Or, you can buy a two liter bottle of house  and orange soda for a buck at your local supermarket and get much the same experience while saving about $22 in the process.
