I'm using Celsius for 2 weeks. Taking it half an hour before gym.     It gets me flying through the workout and post workout cardio. No post workout crash, really feel like I could go to gym again in an hour.     Orange flavour is decent.     I'm sweating much more during workout, but it's expected, since Celsius is supposed to be thermogenic.
