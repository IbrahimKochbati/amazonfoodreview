I really like the Mueslix cereal, but the Amazon price is awful.     $22.73 for a 5 pack is over $4.50 a box.     This product RETAILS in the stores here for around $4 a box (Publix, Kroger, Ingles).     So the Amazon price is higher than retail.          Mueslix is almost never on sale though, unlike other Kellogg's cereals.     1 2 times per year, Publix grocery has all Kellogg's cereals for half price.     $2 box is an incredible price and we stock up for the next several weeks.          I expected the Amazon price to be more like $3 box, since it was a 5 pack.     But boy was I wrong.
