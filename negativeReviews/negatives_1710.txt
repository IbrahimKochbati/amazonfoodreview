I was really hoping that your product would solve my discontent with the Keurig coffe maker that I received for Xmas.  I am a coffee and chicory drinker so of course I wanted to have the same great coffee thru the Keurig machine.  The mesh filter that I bought first left a slimed residue in the  ew....so I believed that the paper filter you created would do the job....well it does it's work properly but it is a little large for the Keurig device....so water and grinds sort of go everywhere.......I dont think your product isnt good ...the whole Keurig experience is a great disappointment!
