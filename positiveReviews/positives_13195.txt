I am so excited Amazon sells this!My husband  ought this coffee, among others, back from a backpacking trip to Costa Rica. By far this is my favorite. It is complex, nutty with a toasty, chocolate like finish. It is not too dark, does not have that burned bean Starbucks taste, and has a nice body and mouth feel. I am very picky about coffee and like Kenya AA, Kona and Costa Rica Tazzaru. If you like any of these, you might like this coffee too.
