We enjoyed these, as they have a light taste unencumbered by heavy oils and the byproducts of frying. No doubt they're much healthier than your standard potato chips, though I will say that Terra's sweet potato chips blow these away for taste, but then they're fried.          The main issue here is value. These chips weigh about half what a bag of good chips cost, for the same money. Healthy or not, there needs to be some value, and at a buck for well under an ounce, I'm not sure these have that; I need to eat two bags to feel like I've had a snack. If you only need a tiny bit of something to make you feel full, then this might be perfect, though.          But if you want to crunch a lot, don't want fried food, and prefer the sensation of eating a lot to actually eating a lot (dieters!), this would be a fine snack, and a unique taste.
