With any low fat or low calorie food, you're going to sacrifice taste of portion size.  With this product, you sacrifice both.          It's a good idea, which was done well with the Oreos and others in this series of "100 calorie" snacks, but I think you're better off with a single cookie from the regular Chips Ahoy box than a whole bag of these.
