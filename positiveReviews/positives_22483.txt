I love popcorn so I have tried every name  and of popcorn in the store. I bought a Great Northern popcorn popper and tried the popcorn and I was hooked. It is very easy and simple to make. Every function I have at home, I pull out the popcorn popper and popcorn and everybody have a good time. The best popcorn ever! Love It! Thanks
