I expected a quality product and got it. I also purchased an adapter that allows me to use loose coffee and tea, I have even used coffee pods in the adapter that I had on hand from my previous  ewer. Having this ability adds both flexibility and a lower cost alternative to the more expensive prefilled cups. I use both and am happy with the results.
