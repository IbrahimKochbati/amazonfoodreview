these cookies were very good.  i grew up in  ooklyn and there was a jewish store on bay parkway that had the most delious black and white cookies, as well as other danish, like chesse and cinnamon that was the best i ever had.  i used to go about 3 times a week for a cookie.  i really miss the food in that area in bensonhurst.it  spoils you for good food, the pizza at l&b is the best.  you could really get some of the best food right around you,  get very spoiled when you leave  you don't know what you got unitl you lose it.  thats the part about growing there i miss the most. well these are ok as a sub but i miss the other ones.
