The cats should love these little jars of different wet flavors, and even you cats who are accustomed to dry food should like this.  You feel like you're giving them something healthful and gourmet when you serve them this.  The food is quite liquidly, which could be a good or bad thing depending on their and your preference.  Open a jar and serve it to them, and don't mistake it for tuna for yourself!
