I've found this product (Bob's Red Mill Bicarbonate of Soda or Soda Bicarb without Aluminum) to be just as I'd hoped.  I use it in a 3 to 1 (Pure Maple Syrup to Bob's Soda Bicarb) ration, respectively, as an anti cancer holistic therapy approach to a recent rise in my (16 year) post op PSA.  I don't have the results yet, as I'm only in my third week of use.  My next PSA lab test will tell the story.  (These tests should be conducted by the same laboratory, as differing labs employ different reagents and the results may vary to some degree.)        "
