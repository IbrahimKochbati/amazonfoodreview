We have two cats in our family. One will try just about anything the other one typically will only eat dry food.  My dry catfood eater could not get to the dish fast enough and he ate every last bite of it which is unusual for him.  My try anything cat also loved the food as well. It was a great treat for them.     Upon opening the can of food it smells like fresh fish, almost good enough to eat.     Try it, you and your cats will not be disappointed.  You won't have to worry about throwing any unused food away because they will lick the dish clean.
