If you're setting out a whole can at once or transferring some of it to a container for later use, flip the can over and use a can opener to remove the bottom of the can. You can then pop the top of the can, releasing the vacuum holding the food in place and the whole thing will slide out cleanly. Much easier and tidier than scraping out the can with a spoon!
