Like others, we've ordered these excellent cookies before and been disappointed by Amazon's packaging. But the good price kept us coming back, and now it appears that Amazon has listened to everyone's complaints. Our recent order arrived with the 6 rolls of cookies arranged in the shipping box in a clever way that prevented damage, so there's no  oken end pieces. Kudos, Amazon!
