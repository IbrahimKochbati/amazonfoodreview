The toy got a lot of interest, but I eventually had to take it away because of the way my dogs chose to play with it. They would grab it by the rope and shake their heads to release this treats, subsequently beating walls (or worse, human legs) that were near them. It appeared to be sturdy, and probably would have been a good toy otherwise.
