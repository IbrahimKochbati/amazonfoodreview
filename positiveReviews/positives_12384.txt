I'd give this a five star rating except for the fact that it's just a little too spicy. A stick in the back of your throat FIRE kind of spicy. It was easy to prepare and is a large serving, the noodles cook to perfection when you follow the instructions. There are even chunks of real chicken in there! Good value for the money, a nice product to have on hand for a quick meal. I wouldn't serve it to children though, it's probably too hot for them.
