Two stars is kind. I am not sure what is going on here as I have been using this dog food for some time now.... but the bag I just opened (from Amazon) is not the same as the last ten bag of this stuff. First off it is a different color??? and second the soft bits are hardly in this bag. The soft bits that are in the bag are hard and crumble in my hand. Now this may not be Amazon fault.... it could have been store wrong... or Purina has change the blend. Either way I am not happy nor is my dog. I will be calling Purina first thing tomorrow morning and ask for my money back and then buy a local bag and see what is what. So right now buyer beware.          10 04 2012 Just an update .... called Purina and the are sending me a coupon for a free bag and an additional discount coupon for my trouble .... but it will take 7 to ten days. My wife went to walmart today to get a new bag so my dog will eat again ; )
