To me, this tastes more like pineapple juice than coconut.  There is an underlying hint of coconut, I know the water isn't strongly flavored, but I wasn't expecting so much pineapple.  This is tangy and sweet.  It is alright.  Package is smaller, but I don't think I could handle too much more of it in one sitting.  I am not thrilled with their unflavored coconut water, it is too tangy sour to me, so with the pineapple it helps cover up that funkiness for me.  Not sure I'd buy this again.  Still in search of the one I first tried and fell in love with, but so far not finding anything as light and fresh tasting.
