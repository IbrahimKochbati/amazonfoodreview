I love this tea!! It is so flavorful yet there is no cut grass or off flavor as with some green teas. It is so mild that even left steeping it does not become bitter.It has a very mellow flavor that my kids enjoy too.It's great without sweeteners.      It is a loose leaf tea and when steeped the leaves unfurl,long and slender. A little tea goes a long way. Enjoy!
