This is my first time with the miracle berries in general. We got a bunch of friends over and everyone  ought something. Oranges taste like the orange slice candies. And lemons taste like lemon drops. My favorite is the Christmas Beers that are available this time of year, they were almost like apple cider. Everyone had fun. Everything arrived fast, great seller. 5 STARS!!!
