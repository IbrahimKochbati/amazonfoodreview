I thought I would write a review because I have seen some negative ones out there. In particular, ones about dogs vomitting green sponges after eating them.          My girlfriend and I have a little maltese (Dexter). He's a little over two years old and loves greenies. Absolutely loves them. They're his favorite treat. He loves to hide them and then go back for them later.          A couple things to watch for... the package says to only feed them one a day. We were feeding him like 3 or 4 a day. We thought it was like a dental treat and couldn't hurt. We've cut it back to one a day and every once and awhile we'll give him two.          Another thing, they can be messy. When we first got him and he was tiny, it would take him awhile to eat them. Once they get wet, they tend to stick to things. Now that he's older, he eats them pretty fast so there's no problem.          We've never had him vomit from them, ever. Even when we were giving him 4 a day. He loves them and has never gotten ill from them. One time, he got into the package when we weren't paying attention and hid them all over the house so he probably has a secret stash somewhere.          I would stick to the product recommendations (if you can) and if your dog is like ours, he'll love them.
