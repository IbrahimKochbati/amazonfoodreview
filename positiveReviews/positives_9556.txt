I've been using this travel bag at the gym for over a mth. but the color of the bag bled onto my white shirt (pink)....I can't get the stain out and now the shirt is ruined. And now the bag where it's pink is fading onto the white.  I really like the bag, the color and style though.  I just contacted Amazon and they were awesome about sending me out another one free of charge. It has room for your poof ball, shampoo, conditioner, razor, facial cleanser & soap in trial size bottles.
