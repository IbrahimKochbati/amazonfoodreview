I have been using Stash teas for years but this is the first organic tea I have tried. The only thing that I can say that is different, other than the fantastic pure taste, is that it takes a little longer to  ew it. Which tells me that it is about as natural as you can get! A 5 star rating is not good enough for this tea, but it is the highest I could give it here. *smile*
