I've been using the PB2 in my protein shakes and I've been quite pleased. When mixed in, the flavor profile is different than traditional PB such as Skippy or JIF, but still tastes like a quality, full flavored peanut butter. The flavor is potent, and one half serving is usually sufficient to flavor a smoothie made with 1.5cups milk banana whey. It mixes well and produces a consistency similar to that of regular peanut butter. At 45calories I've found it an excellent replacement.
