This is a really great coffee that doesn't upset my stomach, unlike many robust coffees. The aroma is fantastic and fills the house with that wonderful coffee smell all coffee addicts love first thing in the morning. The flavor is rich, but not over the top or so heavy you have to put a lot of milk to dilute it. My husband loves a really heavy coffee flavor, but I find it overwhelming if it's too thick, so it was nice to have a rich robust bean that got along with my taste buds. I plan to look for the whole beans in this  and so I can have that lovely thick aroma permeate my kitchen! This particular rich aroma reminded me of my grandmother's house (a fond memory). This low acid coffee is definitely for the coffee drinker who loves a rich, heavy smell but needs something that's easy on the stomach. Perfect blend!
