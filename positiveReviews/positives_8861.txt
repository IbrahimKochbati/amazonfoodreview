I can't believe I'm reviewing steak sauce here. But here goes. The best steaks don't need any sauce. But when you are dining on something below the sirloin cut, A1 is a mealsaver. Nothing beats it. It's also good on tenderloin, ribeye, or filet mignon,  but if the meat is top quality, you want to taste the meat, not the sauce.          A1 is very good on hamburgers when you want a little zip. I especially like it on 95% lean ground sirloin burgers. The leaner the meat, the more you need a little something else to give it some zip. Ketchup gets the job done, but A1 is a nice detour from the ordinary.
