I buy this product because I am gluten intolerant and have not found gluten free ready made deserts that I will eat.  I don't always have time to bake homemade BUT this  ownie mix tastes like homemade and it's so moist and yummy!  The rest of my family can eat regular  ownies BUT they can't tell that these are gluten free.  The only bad thing about these  ownies, is they don't stick around long at my house.  TRY them, you won't be sorry.
