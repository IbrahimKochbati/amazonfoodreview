Used this piece of junk to stuff olives with blue cheese for martinis. After two olives it bacame clear that the Olivator was not up to the task. It's poorly designed (falls apart) and much slower than stuffing the olives by hand. It cannot handle sticky material like blue cheese and then you have to clean it.
