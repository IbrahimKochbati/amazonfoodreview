I think it tastes pretty darn good.     I was a Diet Dr. Pepper addict at one point in my life.  I gave it up for the aspartame and sodium it contained.     It is nice to have an alternative that is 0 calories and I look forward to the day that Soda stream creates a diet line that is sweetened with stevia  instead of sucralose.  For now it is a better, greener alternative.
