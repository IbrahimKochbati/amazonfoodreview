I've enjoyed several of the Bar Harbor fish and shellfish soups and thought highly of them. As such, I thought I'd try their New England Style Corn Chowder. It was good. I enjoyed it. But, for the same price, I'd prefer their fish and shellfish soups' The sodium content is way to high, in my estimation, and then they say you can add salt if you like. This was an acceptable soup, but I probably won't buy it again.          Gary Peterson
