This is the only  and I've been able to buy from any market that uses EXTRA VIRGIN Olive Oil. Most  ands use cheaper non virgin olive oil.          I use a can of this stuff over leafy green salad and throw in a few cherry tomatoes. Shake it up and you have delicious high protein salad with no need for saturated fat carb stuffed dressings.          As for the other reviewers, they are entitled to their opinions, but I need to throw out a bit of education: The reason that these Sardines are not processed in the United States is because THERE ARE NO MORE SARDINE processors in the United States. The last one was in Maine and it closed down in 2010   this was big news already. The reasons for this are multiple: California's Sardine processing crashed after overfishing of California Sardines ruined the industry in CA for a while. The cost of buying American processed Sardines was too high of a price for Americans, who simply opted to buy the stuff processed in Morocco and Portugal.          Blaming this particular company for sending off the fish to Vietnam is misplaced criticism. Blame yourselves for not buying American to save money only to complain about it later.          Seriously people.
