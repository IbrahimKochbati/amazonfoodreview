I bought this for my dog that doesn't play, but loves to eat.  So I was hoping this would entertain him, but even this wouldn't do the trick.          HOWEVER, I  oke it back out after I adopted a new dog for Christmas.  She eats her food much too fast, and in return has horrible gas.  So, I started filling this with her kibble, and it slows her down, and keeps her busy for a good ten minutes.  My older dog still won't play with it, but he will indeed follow her around and pick up any kibble left behind! lol
