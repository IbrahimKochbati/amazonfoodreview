I have been a fan of Wintergreen Altoids for years.  When my last 12 pack ran out, I picked up a 2 pack of tins at a local store.  These taste nothing like they used to, and in fact taste nothing like wintergreen at all.  This flavour is like a combination of peppermint and ozone.  I will not be buying any more until they follow Coca Cola's example and  ing back a "Classic" formulation.  Neither will I be consuming the remainder of this most recent package.
