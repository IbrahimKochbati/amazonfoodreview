These pork rinds are a great alternative to the bagged variety in the stores.  Out of the microwave in less than 2 minutes they are warm and have a great smoky flavor.  Follow the directions, making sure you shake the bag horizontally to distribute the pieces as evenly as possible.  Watch the bag.  If you have a powerful microwave like I do past 1600 it will take less than 2 minutes.  The little pop and crackling noise when I pour them out reminds me of pop rocks!  They are a great low carb snack.
