My only complaint is that it could come with a *little* more cheese, and I could also do without seeing the word "manure" on the back of the box...that's not necessarily something I want to think about when I'm about to eat!          EDIT 10 30 11: One year ago I placed multiple orders of this stuff for $12.97 per 6 pack (S&S price).  Now they're asking $21 for it with S&S!?  I understand there is some inflation in food prices lately, but a 62% increase??  For some dried pasta shells and a packet of cheese powder, gimme a  eak.  Out of control!!!  For this reason I'm knocking my 5* review down to 3* and I've placed my last order for this stuff.  It was fun while it lasted, Annie!  Pigs get slaughtered.
