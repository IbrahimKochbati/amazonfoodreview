I found these great little cookies looking for anything low salt in the cookies cakes pastry line.  I will admit that eating one is not exactly the same ecstatic experience as eating a really top quality  ownie.          But that's a good thing, I've decided!  They are delicious but don't seem to bulldoze willpower in the way that a super sweet, buttery rich treat does.  They are very crispy, similar to a hard biscotti but still easy and pleasant to munch on because they are thin and bite off easily.          And not only are they low in salt, they are also quite low in calories.  I like a little something sweet with my coffee in the mornings.  A couple of these cookies gets it done for me for at a remarkable 67 calories!  I have never before felt satisfied with any accompaniment to my coffee at anywhere near that number of calories.          Now let's not be crazy: This is not a substitute for an egg mcmuffin or any kind of traditional  eakfast.  But for what is essentially a light, tea biscuit, it goes an awfully long way.  And I ~love~ them!          Edit, 9 9 12: I just placed an order for 4 x 6 packs, i.e., eighty bucks worth of cookies, more or less.  It became just too much of a burden to repeatedly order them 2 x 6.  Someone complained about them being  oken up.  That's a problem...they  eak.  I've bought them  oken up at the grocery store, too.  Realistically, this is not much of a problem unless you are serving them at an elegant "tea."  I don't have a problem with a lot of them being in bite sized bits.          Amazon's price is a little higher than it once was.  Not sure what is happening with the price at the grocery store.  I mostly order them so that I don't have to hunt them in the grocery store...they are a bit of a category buster and can be hard to find even in stores that have them.  One day I went to Trader Joe's where I had been buying them; their shelf location was unchanged but they only had a couple of packs left.  I'm Amazon Prime and Brown  ings them right to my door in two days.  What's not to like.
