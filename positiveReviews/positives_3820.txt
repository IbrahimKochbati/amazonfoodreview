6 Hour Power's ingredients are pretty much the same as its rival, 5 Hour Energy's, so obviously the effect is pretty much the same. Yet, this cost me $18 for 12 while the other cost me $8 for 2 at the nearest store.          Great savings even if you only need these just a couple times a week.          The taste isn't as tangy and addictive as 5 Hour Energy's berry flavor. A bit bland in comparison, but it's still nowhere close to bad.
