I love yoo hoo.  it's one of my favorite 'gas station' buys...meaning, i don't buy it from the store, but if i'm going on a trip or something, i'll pick up a yoo hoo.          I was super surprised to find this drink mix.  It was cheap and I thought the kids and i would like making our own yoo hoo at home.  i was totally disappointed.  it does not taste like yoo hoo. it tastes nasty.  almost too sweet?  and it doesn't dissolve well in milk.  you can stir and stir, and you still have nasty clumps floating on the top of your milk.          i did give it two stars because...well, it's drinkable.  and my kids kind of like it.
