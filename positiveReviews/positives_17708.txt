I'm more of a Folgers drinker than a connoisseur of fine coffee, and like to taste the coffee instead of that roasted taste you get at Starbucks.  That said, this does taste like a smoother version of that sort of roasted coffee.  I thought the coffee taste was reduced, and the roast taste enhanced, compared to what I'm used to.  I believe this is partly due to the acid reduction.          The acidity is reduced (unnoticeable!) and I love this aspect.  I sometimes have heartburn, and this low acidity coffee was simply more comfortable to enjoy.  I drank the entire half pot of coffee produced by this packet in about an hour, and I have absolutely no stomach trouble at all.  If I drank that much Folgers so quickly, I would feel significant pain.          The grind was on the finer side, but just barely coarse enough to be used in a coffee press.  Actually, it's the perfect size of grind, which I am quite picky about.  It would work fine in a standard percolator too, of course.          Regardless, it is tasty coffee that is precisely as advertised.  If you like roast coffee and need low acid coffee, this is exactly what you wanted.          I am only deducting a star because it isn't a strong value for the price.  Yet I will probably buy a single box of this, and only drink it when I'm having heartburn.
