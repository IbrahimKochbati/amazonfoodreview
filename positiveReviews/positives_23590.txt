If you read the first review and then read the company literature it will become obvious that the 1st review was either written by an employee or was copied from the literature. I will say the cheese straws are the best I have ever tasted. From the flavor to the crunchy feel in my mouth, I am addicted to Aunt Lizzies cheese straws. The negative? Customer service is non existent. An order that was placed on the internet was subsequently lost, even though I received a confirmation via email. I was offered no discount or upgraded shipping, no additional product with my order, no discount on my next order, not even an apology for the 7 day delay. Just an excuse that the email order was lost and that her IT guy would be on the problem tomorrow. Personally, I can count the number of times an email has been lost over the last 10 years on one hand. This is not the first problem I have had with an order. They do not give a tracking number with each order and when asked for one after the order is placed the odds of getting one are 50 50. I have had so many problems with my orders I will go without my Aunt Lizzies cheese straws. I will miss them greatly however I need the hassle associated with ordering them less than I need the cheese straws. ANN, I wish you the best in the future and suggest you participate in customer service training classes to refrain from losing additional customers in the future. FOLLOW UP: I just received an email notifying me that my order shipped on the Aug 9th. I have not placed an order! What more can they do?
