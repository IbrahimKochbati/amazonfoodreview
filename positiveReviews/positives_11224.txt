I recently was diagnosed with Celiac, and tried these  ownies. I LOVE THEM! They have a bit of a gritty texture as compared to regular  ownies, and they are SUPER chocolatey. It is the most intense chocolate flavor I've ever had in a  ownie. But I like that kind of thing, so I love 'em! Plus, they don't have a ton of fat and they have fewer calories than non GF  ownies, and because they are so chocolatey, they satisfy me quicker than what I remember with non GF  ownies. The ingredients are all organic too, which is nice.          Highly recommended. :)
