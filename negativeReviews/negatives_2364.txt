I love liquor filled chocolates.  I received these as a gift and found the gel like liquor not to be very strong.  It was almost as if the liquor had been cut with sweet syrup and all the alcohol cooked out. A young child wouldn't even get a buzz from these.  The chocolate itself was OK    better than Hershey's and Nestle but not as good as Godiva or Lindt.
