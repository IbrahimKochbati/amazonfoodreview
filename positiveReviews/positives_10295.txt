I have been making my baby food since she was 6 months old.  These trays are fantastic and allow me to make large batches of baby food and freeze for reheating throughout the week.  I originally purchased two trays, but my 8 month old baby is eating two servings for lunch and dinner, so I ordered two more trays.  Not only are they colorful and fun, but so easy to clean and the frozen baby food pops right out after running the tray under warm water for a few seconds.  Although these trays are kind of expensive, they are totally worth the money if you only feed your baby homemade food.  I wish that these trays would have been on the market back when my son was a baby, as I had the entire door of my freeze full of small tupperwear with baby food and these trays would have made my life easier back then.  By the way, if you want to save more space in your freezer, you can just pop the baby food out of the trays and store in a freezer bag.  I absolutely love them and I highly recommend this product.
