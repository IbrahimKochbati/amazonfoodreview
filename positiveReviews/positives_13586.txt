My 14 month old son is CRAZY about solids. :)  It isn't always convenient to be carrying fresh fruits and veggies around with me so these are a great alternative. He loves playing with them and feeding himself without getting his hands all sticky.  He especially likes it when he finds a blueberry!  These are great. Organic, non GMO, and really neat & convenient. I couldn't ask for more.
