I bought this because I was looking for something with probiotics.  I have purchased a similar product from Plum Organics (contained Pro and prebiotics).  I have purchased several items from HappyBellies before and have been pleased with them all.  I ordered this despite the reviews from others that commented on the rancid smell.  I assume this has to do with the added DHA.  I bought 6 containers.  Opened all 6 and they ALL smelled rancid.  I would never feed this to my child.  Ended up contacting Amazon because there was no return available for this product.  Save yourself the hassle.  Buy Plum Organics Multi grain cereal.
