This is the perfect snack food to keep in your purse, office and car.  It's really low cal and high protein, so you don't have to feel guilty.          I would give it 5 stars but it is a bit dry and chewy, that aspect could be improved upon.  Still, I just ordered a bunch more and it's my favourite snack.
