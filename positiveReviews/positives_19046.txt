I love this product, its excellent and can be used in a zillion ways from pizza crust, scones, pancakes, bars, etc etc I love it and it has been a lifesaver as a diabetic. The rest of my family can't tell when I use this that its low carb! Makes a great Red Lobster cheddar bay bisquet!! Better than RL. BUT people please shop around, this price is outragous.     I love you Amazon and you have given me hundreds of great deals but not on this. Go to Netrition.com and its only 11.99 for exactly the same amount. A huge savings! I just hate to see people not try this product because of the price on this site.
