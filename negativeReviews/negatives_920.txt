I don't enjoy giving products a bad review but I was so disappointed I had to.  I've tried quite a few teas and I've been able to drink teas that others say taste like dirty dish water so I can get down some pretty harsh teas.  I usually don't use any type of sweeteners either because I drink my tea right before bed.  I've tried to give this tea a chance.  Ive tried it with sugar, honey and lemon and masking the flavor with vanilla and a little milk.  To me, this tea smells like dirty feet and probably tastes like them too.  I've also tried straight chamomile teas before too so I know it's not that.  I would rather eat the plant itself than drink this tea.  I haven't tried any other Twinings products so this review is strictly for this product.
