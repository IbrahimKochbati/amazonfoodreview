I enjoyed my Manicardi #8 vinegar I bought in Italy. I thought I was buying and even better quality with this product as it is advertised as #12. I was able compare them side by side and this #12 is not close to the same good flavor. I did some research and found that it is actually a lower quality cleverly described by the manufacturer as a 3 barrel formally #12 to confuse the buyer. The description is correct per the manufacturer's label so I can't say that olio2go has a deceptive advertisement. It points out that it is actually "grape must" and a condiment quality. But including the #12 designation does mislead. So I gave it one star based on the easily confused product. It was not what I was expecting so I am unhappy with the result. Others may enjoy the flavor but the real thing is much better.
