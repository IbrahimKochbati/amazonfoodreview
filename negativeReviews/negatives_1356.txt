I bought this bag and found it 50% cheaper at smart and final. It was also old and and white. This was terrible! I bought it to put in the candy canisters I give to co workers. So I didn't find out it was OLD till a co worker informed me. I was so embarrassed. Do not buy this candy. It all ended up in the trash. Very disappointed!
