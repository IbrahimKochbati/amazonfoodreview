I generally grill pork chops, but this was a nice change. The Shake 'n Bake didn't stick quite as well as I remembered when Mom made it as a kid, and since other reviewers have no mention of the problem, I'm chalking that up to my lack of culinary skill. Still, the taste was a really nice change of pace. I generally don't like sauces or gravies or anything that changes the flavor of my meat considerably, and this didn't. It was a nice departure from normal, but not so much that I tasted Shake 'n Bake and not my chops. It added to the flavor of the meat instead of overpowering it. I'm glad I rediscovered this old favorite and will use it again soon.
