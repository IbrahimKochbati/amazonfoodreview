This was not bad at all. I had a bad experience with VitaCoco acai and pomegranate and it was horrible!!! It had that strong coconut flavor that I do not like. I had already bought this so I was nervous to try it. I was surprised when it barely tasted like coconut. It doesn't have that typical strong coconut taste. I usually stay away from anything coconut. Candy, food, beverages, etc. For some reason it gets me sick. But I wanted to try this, because I heard coconut water is good for you. I already tried the mango, pineapple, and pink guava flavors. They are delicious. Pink guava is my favorite. O.N.E.  and is my favorite. As long as I don't really taste that strong coconut flavor, then I will keep drinking this.
