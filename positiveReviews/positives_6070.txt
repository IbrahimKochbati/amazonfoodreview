Been buying ground Habanero from American Spice for years, decided to try someone else with their price going up up up, and not satisfied with consistency of heat.  This stuff had the right flavor and more heat than anything beside fresh, it will make you sweat.  Better price and value than any Habanero experience in 20 years of buying the stuff, will buy from this vendor again.
