I'm sure that I have written a review before, so this may be redundant...     This is by far the best gum I have ever had the pleasure of endulging in.     The flavor lasts and last.  The gum never gets hard or like leather.     It is a shame that it isn't easier to come by in the retail world.  Very few stores actually stock this gum, so I will continue to purchase via Amazon...     Thank you Amazon!
