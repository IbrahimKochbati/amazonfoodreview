We just LOVE this popcorn. We got introduced to it when I bought my wife a true popcorn machine (Great Norther 4oz Chaplain Popper and Cart). The popper and popcorn have been a wonderful addition to our home for the last 4 years and I have no plans to change any time soon.          The simplicity of the popcorn kit packaging is great. Premeasured popcorn, salt (with butter flavor), and oil (which is solid at normal ambient room temperature make this such an easy job of making popcorn any time we want it.          Turn on the kettle and let it heat up for 3 5 min. Squeeze out the oil and add the salt. I will say that if you use all the salt, it's quite a salty batch. We have found that using about half of the salt is about perfect. Wait till the oil is heated through and then add the popcorn. Pull down the kettle lid and wait.          Part of the fun for us is the magic of making our own popcorn. Our kids just can't not watch the machine do the work.          Now if one wants to complain that not all the kernels pop, I would argue that it's likely a combination of both the popcorn and the dimensions of your popping kettle. Do we lose some kernels? Yes (about 10%). Do I care? No. And why don't I care...          The TASTE and Quantity! Even with loss of some kernels, this 4 oz package will feed 2 adults and 2 kids (5 and 2) for an entire movie. Just the perfect amount for us too. As for the taste   I don't know how anyone can eat any other popcorn once they've tasted Great Northern. I simply refuse to eat the microwave popcorn that we might make because we just don't want to clean the popcorn machine after use. The secret to that amazing, delicious, and addictable popcorn taste? Coconut Oil. It seems like such a simple ingredient, but the popcorn flavor that it helps to generate is simply amazing.          The price is extremely reasonable too. And when I found that you could sign up for Amazon's subscribe and save, I signed up immediately. What a way to keep our machine fully stocked with the most authentic flavored movie popcorn ready for our weekly family movie night.
