I got these anchovies as a gift for my anchovy loving boyfriend. While he liked them well enough, they were just too salty to be able to even consider getting through the entire can, even over months. We soaked them in water prior to consumption and that helped, but on the whole I think they would have been more enjoyable with about 1 16th of the salt.
