When PopChips were really hard to find, I was ordering them by the case from Amazon on a regular basis.  The price was always great and these really are my go to snack.  They are always fresh and delicious from Amazon.          I definitely prefer Original over barbecue and sour cream & onion.  I haven't tried other flavors, but Original works just fine for me because I use it for various dips and will even use dry seasonings on them if I'm in the mood.          I don't know anybody that I've offered some of these to who didn't want a bag of their own!  Highly recommended.
