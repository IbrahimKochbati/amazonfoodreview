Since my family watches both calorie and sugar content, this is an ideal product for us.  Made with fat free milk,     it's a perfect treat.  Enough flavoring that a hint  pistachio really comes through.  Looks very pretty served in a glass     dessert dish.          Our local stores don't always carry this flavor, so we order it in packs of 24, which don't seem to last long.
