Being unable to find canned pumpkin in any of my local stores, I held my  eath (after reading the mixed reviews and mentions of damaged cans), took a chance and ordered a 12 pack.  Of the 12 cans, only 2 arrived undamaged.  Another 2 had small dents, which shouldn't affect the product or make opening the cans a problem.  Unfortunately, the 8 remaining cans are too badly dented to use.  Dents deep enough to have bent the cans sideways, and in the case of top dents, probably make it difficult impossible to fully open with can opener. These will be discarded. Since some of the cans are dented on the top while others on the bottom, and the two undented cans were on an OUTSIDE row and the most severely dented on the INSIDE row, it appears that the cans were dented prior to packaging and not damaged in shipping.          It is disappointing to see that damaged product is still a problem so many months after the first reviews called attention to the issue but an Amazon customer service rep. promised that someone would look into the issue to try to ascertain just where the damage is happening.  I haven't actually tried the pumpkin in the any of the 4 'safe' cans yet, so my review isn't based on the actual quality of the pumpkin but given the outrageously bad condition of the packaging there's no way I could rate this higher.
