Tried this on a whim today and so impressed I'm writing a review   which isn't something I often do. Love it!! I made the  oth according to package directions and then added 1 can of "Chili" Rotel, 1 cup of picante sauce, 1 2 bottle of beer (Sierra Nevada Pale Ale), 1 pound of  owned ground turkey and some fresh garlic. Topped my bowl off with just a small dollop of fat free sour cream and oh my goodness this was absolutely the BEST mix chili I've ever tried. Loved the variety of beans, the rice, the flavor   and SOOOO easy   and quick!!
