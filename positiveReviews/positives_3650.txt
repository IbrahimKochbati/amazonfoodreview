I adopted a rescue dog who had an allergy to corn. I checked every bag in local stores but all main fillers were corn. I thought I would have to drive to nearest pet store (120 mile round trip)to find a corn free dog food. Then I found this  and on Amazon which listed all the ingretents. No corn! My dog loves it so much, I even use it as a trick when training her. I'll be buying again and again.
