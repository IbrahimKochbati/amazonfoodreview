I think if you need a gluten free diet this bar is for you.  But if you can eat wheat, I prefer Zone Bars (Mint) better.  I bought these after all of the good reviews but when I ate it it didn't taste like white chocolate at all and the texture is a little gross (sorry).  It also is good for fighting hunger, but so are Zone Bars so I think I will stick with them.
