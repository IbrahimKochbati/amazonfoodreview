I really enjoy trying new things, so I found the idea of this soda pleasing. It is essentially carbonated fruit juice, so it is naturally high in calories and thus comes in a small container that looks a lot like an energy drink. This might confuse some, leading to negative reviews based on the wrong preconceptions of what it is meant to be. However, I think a very valid complaint comes from some that feel this "natural" drink tastes a bit artificial. This is likely due to the use of fruit juices from concentrate, which always have a more muddled flavor.  Having tried many of the Switch flavors, I find this one, like the watermelon, a bit plain and unexciting for a drink which purports to "switch" my world around.  The flavor really reminds me of strawberry kiwi Snapple, which isn't a bad thing other than the lack of originality, and the carbonation is very pleasant.  It is an expensive treat, but would make a fun addition to  eakfast in lieu of a similarly high calorie cup of orange juice.  If this is your first try at the Switch fruit sodas, I suggest trying the tangerine variety first, as it really better encapsulates the  ight flavors of fresh fruit that I think the company is trying to achieve.
