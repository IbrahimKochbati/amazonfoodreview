I've used this flour for nearly 20 years.  It's higher protein properties lend its self nicely to perfect  ead baking.  However . . .read the product details carefully.  This is for an 80 ounce (5 lbs) bag of flour . . that's  seven times higher than the price at your local grocery store.  Furthermore, under item description, this product is listed as having a shipping weight of 41 pounds . . .so this seller is profiting on shipping by a LOT on top of the product its self.
