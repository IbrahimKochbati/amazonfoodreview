I love this product (Ojai Lemonaise) and have been using it for years.  My family loves this product.  I use it to make tuna salad and chicken salad sandwiches.  Or anything I would use plain ol' mayo for.  Our favorite is to mix it in with a little melted butter for artichoke dipping. Yummy!  The only thing I hate is having to order it and have it shipped.
