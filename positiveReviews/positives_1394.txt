These chips might seem a little expensive compared to other leading (and unhealthy I might add)chips, but I was not disappointed in my purchase. They arrived in a few days and made the perfect snack for me and my husband's lunches. Also, we checked for the closest store selling these and it was Target 50 miles away in Tulsa and would have been costly to buy them as they are more per case and the drive to get them.
