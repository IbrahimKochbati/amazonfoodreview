Caribbean Joy coconut milk offers a tempting price, lower than its competitors.  There's a good reason for its low price: by all accounts it tastes like half the visible amount is coconut milk, the rest being water.     Neither good for pina coladas or cooking, this is a poor value and I can't recommend it to anyone.
