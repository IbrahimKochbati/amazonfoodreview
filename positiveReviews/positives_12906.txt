what can i say that will actually be published about this splendid drink. It is carbonated sugar water. As per usuall the grape, apple juice content seems to always dominate in fruit drinks (unless they're suppose to taste like grapes or apples). The calories and carbs only seems high but in reality compared to a regular soda drink it is much worse since the quantity is greatly reduced in these drinks (Switch  and can 8.3oz regular can 12oz). They however make no pretensions of being a health drink with the exception of their pure juice declaration. All in all nothing shocking here, especially as we grow used to paying a lot for a little in todays economy.
