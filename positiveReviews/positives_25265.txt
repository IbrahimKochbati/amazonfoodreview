Coombs Family Farms Organic Maple Syrup is the best on the market. Sweet, clear and smooth. Amazon's price beats the local Health Food Store every time. I stock up on this and use it as a lovely sweetener with a nice flavor twist. Stores great on the shelf, but put it in the fridge after opening. Keeps well in the fridge too.
