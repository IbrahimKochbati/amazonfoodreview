I was hesitant at making the sacrifice of giving up coffee due to blood pressure issues but the chocolate flavor is  nice switch!  Its NOT true coffee but I am looking more for the morning ritual of putting coffee into a coffee maker, etc and pouring it onto a mug with half and half at the bottom. This is a nice psychological alternative PLUS, I dont miss the anxiety attacks I was getting from drinking way too much coffee!!  Good substitute. Not cheap, but worth it!
