It's a little bit difficult to review dog cookies since I can't sample them myself, but my Aussie mix, Chelsea, thinks these are just great. She chooses them over her usual Milk Bones and store  and dog cookies every time. As an older dog (twelve years), she sometimes needs an appetite stimulator, and these cookies do the trick. Amazingly, the contents of the cookies are all organic; barley, lamb, carrots, apples, palm oil, and molasses. If they weren't so hard, I might be tempted to try one! I think I'd  eak my teeth, though. Chelsea gives them a big four paws up!
