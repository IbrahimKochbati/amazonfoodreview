I'm originally from Singapore, and I used to have these for tea time (around 4 in the afternoon) with my family (a common practice back where I'm from). When we moved to the States seven years ago, I looked all over for these tea biscuits and finally found them at an upscale grocery store, selling for much more than its retailing on this site. I've been buying it from the grocers all this while mainly because I'm concerned at the packaging issues mentioned by many reviewers here.          These biscuits, though extremely tasty (sweet but not overly so, and great for dunking), are also prone to crumbling. The mildest pressure will see the biscuit crumble into itty bitty little pieces so if this is being shipped to customers, the packaging has to be able to protect the biscuits and prevent crumbling. The biscuits themselves are superior in quality and taste, no complaints!
