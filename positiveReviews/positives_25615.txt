These flowers are large, fragrant, and BEAUTIFUL. The colors are vi ant and the sizes and shapes are consistent. I bought these to make into Agua Fresca de Jamaica, but ended up drinking quite a bit of Hibiscus tea as well. Its tasty, alkalizing, and allegedly good for heart health. Also, the package is a lot larger than I thought it would be. Overall, the product exceeded my expectations.
