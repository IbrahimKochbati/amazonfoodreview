I tried Pamela's Brownie Mix on the recommendation of a relative with celiac, about a year after I was diagnosed.  I was pretty disappointed; although moist with a very  ownie like texture, there is an aftertaste I didn't like that I notice in many GF baking mixes.  Also I agree with the comment about them tasting carob y instead of chocolatey.  My non GF family & friends said they were "weird" and "different".  Not terrible, but after I tasted one, I did not want another.  I'm sticking with the flourless  ownie recipe I've been using; at least my family likes them.
