Seeing the word "tangy" on the front of the box, I had high hopes of a refreshingly tart, vi ant raspberry herbal tea.  Instead I found it less like tea and more like a weakly flavored cup of liquid raspberry J ello!  Leaving the bag in longer doesn't help either.  The first cup I made, I got distracted and the bag was left to steep 30 minutes before I took a sip.  I'll be switching back to Tazo Passion as soon as I finish the box.
