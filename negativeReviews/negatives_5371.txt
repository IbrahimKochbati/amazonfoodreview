I'm a long time coffee drinker.  I don't suffer from chronic stomach acidity, so I can't attest to it's effect on tender stomachs.  What I CAN do is attest to the smoothness and flavor, which weren't anything to write home about.  It did seem to lack acidity, so I suppose those with tender stomachs could drink this with little worry.  The question is, should they bother with this?  I don't think so.  Stick to tea or do without.  The taste doesn't justify the bother to make it low acid.
