I have a La ador Retriever who was very excited to try these. She loves them.  This isn't saying much as she pretty much eats anything.  However, I left them on the counter, my teenager accidentally tried one.  He said it wasn't too bad.  He's not willing to switch from human to dog treats but it's nice to know they have been tested on human taste buds and pass.          The size of the treats are quite large as is the size of the bag. They don't smell offensive as many dog treats do. They are organic. I don't feel like I'm giving my dog the equivalent of a doggy candy bar.  They are reasonably priced. Great product overall.
