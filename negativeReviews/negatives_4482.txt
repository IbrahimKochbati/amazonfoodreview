My baby is a wonderful eater and has loved all of the variety I've given him until this food. He tried it and vomited instantly. I tried the next day and just let him smell it and he vomited again   lol. I tried it too and it was not tasty to me at all. I had two of these packs left so I waited a couple of weeks to try again. He liked it that time. Anyway, don't give up and keep trying because they just may like it after a few tries (or even 15 tries). It's a healthy meal.
