I love peanut butter! I decided to purchase this product to try and cut a serving of regular pb in half. My favorite way to eat pb is a couple tbs. mixed into oatmeal with vanilla soymilk. So good! With PB2 I was able to use the 2tbs serving for 45 calories and then add only about 1 tsp. of regular pb(as some fat is a good thing keeps you fuller longer)and it tasted great! Would be a great addition to the diet of someone watching their weight. Though it is obviously not as delicious as regular pb it is a smart,quality product.
