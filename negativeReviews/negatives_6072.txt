I love Haribo Gold Bears and the Rolls of the disks, but the consistency of the Haribo Gummi Pink Grapefruit is very strange.  It is similar to the sugared sliced fruit, but with hard pieces throughout.  Some people love the sliced fruit candies, my husband does, but not me.  Hopefully my husband will like these otherwise they will go to waste.
