I actually only decided to write this review because all the bad ones almost prevented me from purchasing this.  Like a few other reviewers, I need this product as my dog has a tablespoon with every meal and the supermarket doesn't carry it at this time of year. All of the cans were in great condition, no problems whatsoever.
