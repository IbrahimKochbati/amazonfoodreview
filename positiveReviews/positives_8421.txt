I am leasing a 15 year old mare who is extremely stiff (and quite out of shape).  I started her on these 2 weeks ago and have noticed a big improvement with her movement.  I don't know if it is mainly because she is getting into shape or if the Glucosamine is helping.  She loves them so I plan on continuing to give these to her for the remainder of the lease and to my next horse if he she is in the older category.  It can only be good for them.
