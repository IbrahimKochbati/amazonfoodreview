Recently a friend told me to try coconut water when I told her I needed a potassium supplement. I've tried maybe a dozen  ands now and have 2 3 favorites. One is ONE. ; ) The guava really adds to the flavor. I also just tried the mango and will be ordering that soon as well. There's a lot of variation with coconut water. Some taste just like water, some have a mild sweetness, some are more coconutty than others. And some are bitter. I recommend trying several to see what suits your tastebuds and budget.
