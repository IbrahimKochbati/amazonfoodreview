I have given this product five stars because it works very well for coffee with the filters that come with it.          But my five stars come with a warning: don't use these little cups without using the little filters, especially with teas or tea based coffee substitutes (like loose "Teeccino").  The tea leaves swell to a far greater extent than water logged, ground coffee beans.  They also swell much faster, which tends to clog the small, unprotected puncture at the bottom of the little cups.  So, not using the filter is a very, very dumb idea.  If you put less tea in the little cups, the tea still clogs the system without the filters!          So.. Be wise, and use the cups with the filters.          For what it's worth, though, the Solo "My K Cup" works perfectly with all types of contents, with or without the little filters.  It's ridiculously expensive, however.  Happily, for me, who am not flowing with dough, the plastic cups (with the little filters) are an answer.
