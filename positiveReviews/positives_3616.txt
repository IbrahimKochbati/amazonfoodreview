Newman products have been used in our home for years. After researching Newman's Adult Dog food I felt confident in giving the food to our two cocapoo's. They love it! One of them wolfs it down in 4 seconds! Really, I timed it.     With so many companies recalling dog foods,I felt the Newman company being organic would be more reliable. Keeps me from worrying so much as I pour that bowl of food for them.
