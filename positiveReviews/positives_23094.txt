Honestly, I wasn't expecting much... I was expecting it to taste like gravel dust! I was seriously mistaken. This  ead is awesome! I couldn't tell that it was gluten free... tastes like homemade  ead, more like homemade dinner rolls. Even though I'm not sure I put enough water in the mix (I fluffed the eggs and it threw the measurement off) it still turned out simply wonderful. Also, this  ead has other variations you can do with the recipe, raisin  ead, pizza dough, dinner rolls, pretzels, garlic  ead, et cetera... I look forward to trying the whole lot. The only bad part... it's expensive to be gluten free, but if you've got to have  ead, this is the  ead to get.
