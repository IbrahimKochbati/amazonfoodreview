My anger tension irritability is off the scale and I have been trying anything and everything to help myself calm down. I have been using the calming and bedtime teas for the past 2 weeks and I have to say that even though I still get quite mad, I do feel that I have been calmer and not as snappish as I was. The flavors are delicious, especially with honey. I also suffer from gastrointestinal issues and it hasn't really helped in that respect, though....but I'm on some Crohn's level issues. I must say that it has helped with the severe tension headaches that work and kid give me daily, especially when trying to go to sleep. It is nice to be able to use a natural product to help myself with my anger management problems instead of loading up on medications.
