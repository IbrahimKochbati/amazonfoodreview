I use this on steamed simmered vegetables (greens, peas and beans,) roasted meat and poultry and in cold meat salads ( chicken,ham,turkey and tuna. )     It adds just the right combo of flavor with or without other spices you may want to add. Very glad amazon offers this 2 pack on the subscribe and save program.
