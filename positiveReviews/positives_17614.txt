The flavor, smell, look, and no after taste of this coffee reminded me of the stuff I used to get at the "India Coffee House" in Bangalore, India, in the sixties.  The aroma and flavor is definitely "old world" in that it is genuine, high quality coffee and not one of those flavored disasters so common today.  It is not too strong and definitely does not have an after taste that is the trademark of mixed bean coffees.          This would make a great first cup in the morning coffee. I tried it both ways   one cup with cream and one without and both were delicious.  I also tried it with a piece of Ghiradelli dark chocolate squares and the result was  'passed with Distinction'. The only factor going against this product is its cost.  At around $9.00 a pound it will probably be prohibitive for most household budgets.
