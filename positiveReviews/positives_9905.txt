Pacific Crest Sardines can be hit and miss. Sometimes I get sardines with extra scales that I literally have to wash off in order to consume.          These still taste great and you can rinse out the extra oil with a bit of hot tap water to reduce calories.          Regarding the 'smoked' flavor...I honestly taste no discernible difference in flavor from the Pacific Crest Sardines in water...just a bit richer because of being packed in soybean oil instead of water.          These sardines have 8 grams of fat per can but if you rinse them off, they probably are closer in fat content to the Pacific Crest sardines in water which only have 3 grams of fat per can.
