I ordered this pumpkin because my cat needs it in his diet. The first time I ordered many months ago, half the case was damaged, the company was having "packaging issues". But they assured me (their customer support was fantastic! Extremely nice, helpful, and friendly, and they made it right just as promised!) that they would take care of everything and they did, fast too! I originally ordered because it was "organic", which is very hard to find in the stores! I reordered when I was getting low. I received the case, the cans were perfect, and because of this product, my cat is alive and well! It was VERY important that my cat have this, so yes, I am VERY thankful they are still selling this product! I will continue to order it as long as I need it! THANK YOU VERY MUCH FARMERS MARKET FOODS!!!!!!!!!!!!!          Sincerely,     Chris
