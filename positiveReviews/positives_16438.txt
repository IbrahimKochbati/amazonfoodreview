We give Greenies ("Teenie" size) to our 12 year old miniature poodle. Her doctor has always commented on how clean and healthy her teeth and gums are and has never had to put her under for a cleaning. Her  eath is nicer, too, since we started giving her Greenies.          We give her one every day or so and she will carry it around 'protecting' it for an hour or so before settling down and devouring it. We tried other  ands but she will only accept the best. She is terrified of thunderstorms and will come out from under the bed only if we offer her her favorite treat: a Greenie.
