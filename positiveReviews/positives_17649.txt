I may not be the prime target market for this coffee as acidity has never been a problem for me. Still, I tried this out and was expecting the dead taste that you get with coffes that have had things like decaffeination done to them. But no! I screwed up my face and took a sip. Then I took another sip. Lo and behold we have a nice balanced tasting coffee roast. So, let's assume that the low acidity is something you need and that the product actually delivers on that, Then, in my opinion, it also delivers on taste.
