I opened a can and it smelled like cigarettes which I was informed was bad bacteria.  I reported this to Amazon whom I got it from and they sent me another 6 pack for replacement BUT it also smelled badly...At this point I gave up trying. I am all for organic but this stuff was poor in my opinion.  Allot of it seemed like hard rice and it smelled like cigarettes and bad bacteria.  I wouldn't buy it again.
