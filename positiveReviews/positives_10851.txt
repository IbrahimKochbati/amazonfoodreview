So these treats are very hard  My older greyhound had problems chewing them ( he is 12 and I have to wet down his food, I probably wouldn't feed these too him again unless I wet them down )  But they are full of healthy ingredients I feel good about treating my other dogs with them. They come in biscuits of two, in which you  eak apart  My dogs acted like they were prime steak and wanted more  So other then my older dog who I believe they were too hard, I feel good about feeding my other dogs these treat!
