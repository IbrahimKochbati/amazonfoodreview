for any kind of baking on a flat sheet   parchment gives even baking results and allows the product to release from the pan without any oil or grease products. I love the way I can slide the sheet off, put another one on and off I go   the quickest way to bake! Buying rolls is messy since the boxes never hold up and you may tear too much or too little. With the sheets they pop right out and there is no waste. The boxes also hold up since you are not pushing on them trying to cut. I never cook without them.
