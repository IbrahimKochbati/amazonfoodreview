These are absolutely delicious and irresistable. The taste is perfect   not heavy or overdone. It actually kind of sneaks up on you before you realize you've just finished the bag.          They seem to melt in your mouth even as you are chewing them as opposed to some  ands that make you feel like Mr. Ed (the horse). Yes,there is some salt, but it's not like someone just dumped a container of the stuff on them. This time it enhances the chip.          Everything in them is terrific except for the inclusion of maltodextrin about 2 3 down the ingredient list. It can have a kind of laxative effect on a lot of people and I just thought you should know it's in there.          Other than that   there is nothing about this product that would detract me from buying it for parties, picnics, events, or just enjoying by myself.          Seriously, they are that good.
