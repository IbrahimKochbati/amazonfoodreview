These Grove Square Hot Cocoa flavors are by far the best tasting we have found for the Keurig. We took a chance on these due to the high review ratings and it was a pleasant surprise that all three flavors are really good.          Dark Chocolate   My favorite, very good even on the "large" cup setting     Milk Chocolate   Excellent on the "small" cup and good on the "large" cup setting     Peppermint   Everyone likes this one, on either cup size setting          These do contain Sucralose in addition to sugar, I don't notice the taste but my wife does (but she still likes them).          Highly Recommended!          CFH
