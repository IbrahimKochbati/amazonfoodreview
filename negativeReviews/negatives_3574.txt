These are the oat chocolate chip coconut bars. These are a soft, cookie like bar that is wheat and gluten free and have no dairy in them. They also have Omega 3 fatty acids, whole grains, and no trans fats.          The bars taste pretty good, although I couldn't really taste the coconut in them. They had a hint of chocolate without being overpowering. The oats were a rolled oats but it was not over powering like some granola bars. The bar is about two inches by three inches and a prefect little snack.          On the downside, the bars are really crumbly, almost like there is nothing really holding them together. Because of that, I had to keep them in a container to carry them in my munchie bag.  The bars are real small and are 180 calories. And finally, for five bars, the regular price on Amazon is listed as $30 but they are now discounted to $24.          Although they might taste good, I will not be buying these. That is way too much money for three or four bites of a very crumbly cookie.          Shawn Kovacich     Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence book and DVD series.
