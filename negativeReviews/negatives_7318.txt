I am afraid this was a huge mistake.  The cardboard shrink wrapped box was wet, moldy, and falling apart.  The cans inside were bent, covered in fuzzy black mold, wet, and I couldn't get them out of the house fast enough. Our dogs eat pumpkin and we go through a lot, so I was happy to see that Amazon could provide us with a case.  I would not recommend this product   it is a health hazard!
