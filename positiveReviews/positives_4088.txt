My husband and I love this product because it is naturally sweet without the taste of artificial sweeteners.  Most peach flavored teas taste like sugar and artificial flavors but not this drink.  It is wonderfully watery to quench any thirst.  I only wish that Amazon would always sell it because we would buy it on a regular basis.
