This tea is a must for people who like a flavored tea.  It has enough spice to taste but not overpowering.  It works quickly and easily in my Keurig K Cup coffee maker.  With a couple of ice cubes it makes a delicious ice tea as well.  I have been buying this  and for several years, and now with the auto ship from Amazon, I have tea whenever I need it.
