I admit, I like my French Vanilla coffee to be heavy on the vanilla side.  This isn't.  It's a much stronger coffee  ew, meaning more sugar and creamer is needed to tone down the coffee flavor.  On the other hand, it's a reasonable alternative if my preferred  and (Van Houtte) isn't on sale or when it's occasionally out of stock.  I like that it comes in a 2 pack because our family goes through a lot of k cups and I don't have to order quite so often.
