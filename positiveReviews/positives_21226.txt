I have been using this product for about 6 months. I have had consistently good results when making yogurt with this starter. I tried to make follow up batches with yogurt I had made previously and it just never was as good as using this starter every time. One of the big secrets I have found to good yogurt is making sure that you mix in the starter thoroughly. Definitely improves the consistency.
