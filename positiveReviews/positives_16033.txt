You may think it is as hot as wasabi paste, but Kameda does a good job of really creating a spicy snack without making it too hot or too bland.          The distributor to the Asian stores in our area does not stock this item. Usually when the spouse goes to Japan is the only time we can get this variety. I actually prefer it over the traditional Kaki no tane. FYI: 'kaki" is the Japanese word for persimmon seed.
