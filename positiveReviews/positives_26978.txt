I have to tell you.          I'm a contractor working over seas in Afghanistan. I have been doing this for over 2 years now, and we have stores called "The PX" where we can buy American goodies... right, the beef jerky. They have a huge selection of beef jerky but by the time it gets here 70% of the time its tough and no longer good. But we buy it anyway.          I received a care package from a friend full of this "Wild Ride beef jerky" in it and let me tell you, It was soft, tasty delicious, not too salty, not to over flavored, and just plane old amazing! Now I'm addicted! My friends and I can now relax after a hard day of work open a bag and remember the green grass, the mountain air, and the lovely beaches of the old red, white and blue.          Sounds to good to be true, but its amazing beef jerky.          Thanks Wild Ride.
