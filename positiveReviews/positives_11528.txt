I couldn't find whole cardamom at 3 of my local supermarkets and the ethnic markets were too far. Luckily, I found whole cardamom here and it was perfect. First time I've ordered a spice online, and I'll admit it felt a bit odd at first... but after my experience, I wouldn't hesitate to do it again.
