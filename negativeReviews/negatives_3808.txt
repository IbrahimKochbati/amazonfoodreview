I tried this after reviewing another Switch product (the black cherry flavor). The Kiwi Berry is also tasty, though for the life of me I couldn't taste the kiwi    just strawberry.          The Kiwi Berry has the same problem as the Black Cherry, however; just SO much sugar! Ounce for ounce, it's as much sugar as in a regular, non diet soda. I'd definitely drink any of the Switch products again ... but I won't try to convince myself it's a health drink!
