I'm a big black tea drinker and have tried a lot of different  ands out there, and I find that PG makes the best black tea. It's nice and strong, not like crappy Lipton black tea. We've been loyal to the PG  and black tea for over a year now   it's a little pricier than other  ands, but definitely worth it if you enjoy black tea.
