I didn't like these at all.  These "dried" fruits (more like sopping wet with oil...and not just this  and) are far too oily.  I don't want sunflower oil fruit globs.  It's actually disgusting.  Hate to give something a terrible review, but it's just yuck. I like oil fine, where it belongs (french fries, maybe a salad?), but not in dried fruit.  They've managed to get rid of the sulphur and whatever else just to jam them full of sunflower oil (a preservative).  I'd rather just have the fruit dried, in a fruit drier, or sun dried.  I'd even rather the things just crumble to dust in my mouth than this.  Organic or not, it's just oily junk food.
