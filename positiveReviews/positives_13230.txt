Discovered Tajin in San Diego but have not been able to find it in New England. This is a great spice and a little bit goes a long way. It has a light spiciness to it and a good hint of lime. I use it on Salmon and other seafood and it tastes great. Caution: You get a pack of 8 which will last you a long time but the price is great.
