Although Revolution Tea's website says their Sweet Ginger Peach black tea is their most popular flavor, I feel like this and the Acai Berry Green are the best flavors in a really great line of tea.  As I've already reviewed on amazon, both of these flavors (as well as Revolution's Orange Chocolate Green tea) totally blow Lipton's Premium Tea Pyramids out of the water. The clear nylon tea bags that both  ands use let you easily compare the quality difference    whereas revolution uses long whole tea leaves, lipton uses little flakes and particles.  If you're willing to commit to 6 boxes of this tea you can buy it here on amazon for about half of what you'd pay on revolution tea's website!
