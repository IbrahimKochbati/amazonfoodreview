Here is the skinny on using this as camping food: get some reflectix insulation and make a cozy for your pot with lid.  ing pot to boil, dump this box of dried beans and rice in, stir and take off heat to put in cozy. Wait about half an hour and it is ready   saves on fuel because the simmer time is about 23 minutes over low flame.          Everyone LOVES this stuff. At home or on the trail. Add a pouch of tuna while in the woods (and maybe some dried hot peppers   pepin in the mexican section) and eat it with flour tortillas and I personally promise HEAVEN in your mouth!
