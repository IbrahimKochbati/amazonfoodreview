It makes for a quick snack, but Jeebus, this thing is salty! I usually have to eat it will something else (protein shake, etc), to dull the salty tang.     Aside from that, it's quick, convenient, and gives me a quick dose of nutrition when I least have time to prepare a healthy home cooked meal post workout.
