I'm not that into pop soda ect, but I'm glad I tried this Kiwi Berry. It isnt very carbonated, not too sweet and has no preservatives. I will add I love strawberries kiwi's so I enjoyed the fruity taste. It has allot of calories for such a small bottle...all in all I like this and will probably try it again.
