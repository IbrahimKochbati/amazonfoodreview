Pros:     This is a fairly simple product.  A metal drawer with dividers. Great for organizing all the your K cups. Less counter space than a carousel.          Cons:     EXPENSIVE...A metal drawer with dividers for almost $50.  It raises your coffee maker about 3.25".  We have a Keurig B60 and when it is placed on this product and shoved back towards the wall it will not open fully to accept the K cup because of the wall cabinets it resides under.  Its not a big deal to just pull the unit forward but I think its definitely worth mentioning.
