I am a college student of health sciences and the mother to a 3 yr old toddler. I personally show very little response to "placebo effect" situations and I am a true skeptic at heart. I originally found the "kid" version of this product for my daughter while searching for something to boost her immune system. I spent hours on the computer researching the ingredients of these products. I decided to try the adult version for myself and I can honestly say that the Amazing Grass Superfood Powders have made a huge improvement in both of our lives.           My daughter attends daycare and with that setting comes frequent colds flus, some serious. She spent the better part of each month with varying degrees of sickness. Since we have using the Superfood Powders (months), neither she nor I have gotten sick. We spent time with my parents who were both very ill while she and I remained in good health. Her time spent at daycare has not been reduced but she is now very rarely sick. I can only recall one time since we started using this product and her sneezing runny nose only lasted for one day. Since no other variable in our lives has been changed, I can only attribute this to the use of Amazing Grass.           It is difficult to make sure that a child is getting all of the necessary nutrients they need in their diet. Amazing Grass takes care of that. I feel better knowing that when my daughter goes through her "picky eating" stages, she is still getting the vitamins and nutrients her body needs to stay healthy. I mix 1 scoop of her powder with approx 8oz of milk and 1 tsp Ovaltine...I have never had any trouble getting her to drink it. She asks for her "choco milk" at least twice per day!          Overall, EXCELLENT product! I am getting ready to purchase my 4th jar!
