I purchased this as I wanted to give my baby an organic alternative to cereal found in supermarkets. I thought is was such  great idea to have multigrain cereal just like what I eat.     BIG MISTAKE.     This gave my baby the most horrible gas and it took me months to realize it was the cereal causing this. Only when my mother in law said "Boy, if I eat whole grain cereal in the evening, i act like a trumpet all night" did I think. "Waou, maybe it's the cereal".     I've stopped giving her this and no more crying, arching and farting!
