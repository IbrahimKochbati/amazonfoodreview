Wish they were stocked in stores but glad to be able to find them online. Not only food for white trash, they are low carb and make the perfect snack food. The aroma from the microwave during the cooking process is heavenly. Be sure to shake the bag per package direction. A must for the pork rind addict. After you try these, you will never go back to prepackaged rinds.
