My husband had once had a mushroom truffle macaroni & cheese at a restaurant years ago. I've never eaten anything with truffle, but decided that since truffle mushrooms are hard to find, I'll try making the same dish with truffle oil. It actually turned out really good, even despite the dish being low fat. There's no doubt I'll be making it again, with different dishes (I've heard you can use it for other pastas, etc).
