very happy with the popcorn.  I used it with my whirly popper stove top popcorn maker and just poured all the contents in the pot.  By having every bag sealed, you are sure that the popcorn is fresh and pops right.  the right amount of oil and seasoned salt.  No butter is added after, there is enough flavor from the oil and salt.
