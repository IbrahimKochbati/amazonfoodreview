This is my favorite tea of the Celestial Seasonings makers! It is a light refreshing herbal tea and it tastes perfect hot or cold. I have trouble with many teas on the market because they have so many things blended together and I take medications for high blood pressure and cholesterol. I also have some trouble with headaches and upset stomach and a warm cup of this tea at bedtime with a little bit of honey is my "cup of tea"!
