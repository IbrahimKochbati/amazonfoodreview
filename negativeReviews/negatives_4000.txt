I received these bars with great anticipation.  As I have tried the same bars only with chocolate coating.     These bars taste horrible.  It is almost a plastic like taste.  I think the shipper did not ship them properly based upon the heat of the summer.  When I took them out of the box they were really warm.     Even my children who love most things wont eat them.  So either this is a terrible product or the company shipped these in the heat of the summer and it changed them.  They are horrible.        "
