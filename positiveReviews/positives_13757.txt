This is probably the best tasting cocoa I've ever had at home.  A friend gave me a small tin of it years ago as a holiday gift.  We enjoyed every bit of it but had trouble finding more until it turned up on Amazon.  Smells great, tastes great, and is made with real ingredients (not artificial sweeteners and weird chemicals).  Really fantastic stuff.  It's also great in  ownies and cakes   adds some spices above and beyond what most people expect.  Tastes like fall, in the best way possible.  Here's a recipe to try:  a few frozen bananas (for chill and body), about a  cup of crunchy peanut butter, about half a cup of almond or regular or soy milk (more milk if you like a thinner shake), a scoop of this cocoa, and blend.  Drink it right away.  Filling, lots of vitamins, and naturally sweet.  I know people who swear by it as their daily  eakfast.  Yum!
