First off I'm a huge Heinz Ketchup fan and never thought I could like a condiment as much as that but let me tell you this ranks right up there!! I believe the balance of Mayo, Olive Oil, and Black Pepper is perfect, not too spicy like the previous reviewer stated and this is coming from me who cannot eat anything spicy at all.  Sometimes I'll combine both Heinz Ketchup and the Cracked Black Pepper Mayonaise to create a very tasty addition to plain and boring sandwiches.  I also like to add Soy Sauce or Terryaki Sauce to add it to make an Asian Style Creamy Sauce to add to Chicken or Steak dinners.  I'll just add on a closing note I was not a huge fan of Mayonaise before I tried this but I have to say I am a HUGE fan now!
