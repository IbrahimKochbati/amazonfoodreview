These don't taste any better to me than pork rinds I can buy at the store in a bag, and they are WAYYYYYY more trouble to make. A large number of them won't puff up for me at all no mater how long I cook them, either. Maybe my microwave is underpowered, I dunno, but when even the puffed ones are not somehow tastier I just don't see the point. I feel like I really wasted my money on these.
