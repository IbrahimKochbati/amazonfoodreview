Got the teenie greenies for my 16 1 2lb Shih Tzu  Lhasa Apso.  The package says that these are for dogs that range 5 15lbs, but I ordered them anyway (trying to save some money).  She loves them.  Gobbles them up straight away.          Only advice Stick to the poundage recommendation.  These treats are so small that I doubt my dog is getting the benefits of tartar control removal.  On the  ight side, she likes the taste, so they certainly work as regular daily treats.
