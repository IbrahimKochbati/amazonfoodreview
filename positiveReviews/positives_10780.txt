We have 2 dogs, a Boston terrier (22 lb) and a basset shepherd mix (55 lb).  Both have had digestives issues and we feed them a wheat free diet.  They flourish on this diet and don't have any of the problems they used to have.  That being said I wasn't certain how they'd react to these treats.  The dogs love them and we haven't had any GI tract problems.  They've had no bad reactions whatsoever to them.          The treats are 2 1" x 1" squares attached together, with a line incised between the squares so they can be  oken apart for smaller dogs.  They are fairly thick and substantial enough that it takes a few minutes for our dogs to finish them.  They don't wolf them down in one gulp which is a good thing.  The package has a good number of treats too.  I also appreciate the source of the lamb, New Zealand, and the fact they are organic.          I'll be buying these again.  They love lamb, enjoy the treats and I think they are a good value.
