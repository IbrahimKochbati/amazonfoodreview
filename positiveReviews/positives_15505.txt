this is very good it comes with a seasoning packet you can add(chicken) and it is really good. the directions are for the entire bag and makes between 3 and 4 cups.(you add 2 cups water  ing to boil and then simmer 45 minuets, although i did not time it) the one drawback is it has that one grain that bursts when you cook it and if you look to close and have never seen this before you might think that cooking it some how made "worms" grow out of it.  i was grossing my self out, mixing it in my bowl trying too make it cool enough to eat. this would probably be really good mixed in to a  ead recipe seasoned or other wise.  It does not taste like the Kasai one.
