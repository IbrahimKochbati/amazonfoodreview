Wow I was so excited to get a product that was like the product I gave my kids when they were babies.  Now that I'm a grandparent I wanted the same for my grandchild.  Every biscuit was  oken and not useful to me or the baby.  The pieces were too small for him to hold.  The product will be returned!          Another wow! I just spoke to a representative and they will be shipping new product to me asap!  Thank you for the prompt resolution! That's what I like!
