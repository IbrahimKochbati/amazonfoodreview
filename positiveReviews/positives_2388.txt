I have a history of mild moderate acid reflux, so I take it easy with coffee. I was delighted to discover Puroast, which is a reduced acid coffee that is reasonably priced. The French Roast flavor is utterly delicious. It tastes like I went to a coffee house for fancy coffee, but it's just  ewed in my drip coffee pot in my kitchen. (Even more convenient if my husband does it for me!) Try it   you won't be disappointed. The cinnamon flavor is also very, very good.
