It only takes a cursory look at my reviewing history to realize that I haven't exactly made a career out of rating gum, but this new Trident Vitality is so darn good that I thought I'd better get in a few words on it. I've tried all three of the available flavors and can't seem to choose a favorite.          The Peppermint with Ginseng flavor reviewed here is definitely pretty awesome. The gum has the physical profile of an old school Chicklet. It only takes a bite or two for the strong peppermint flavor to kick in. And man, does this gum LAST. I can usually go a good 3 4 hours and still get some flavor out of this stuff. That makes it a good value in my book for sure.          Typically retails for around $1.39 pack at my local grocer, although I've caught it on sale for under a dollar once or twice.          Highly recommended.
