Packaging is very easy to open, for me it does taste a little too salty but still enjoyable. I have a 6oz. popcorn maker however when I use the entire packet towards the end it want's to pop off the top so I may try the 4oz. next time. The only complaint I have is when I received this package due to the extreme heat we have had this summer by the time I received it some of the packets the oil butter had leaked through and was a little messy as I had to wipe off each packet and throw away a couple.
