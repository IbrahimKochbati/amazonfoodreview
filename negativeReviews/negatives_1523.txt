If you're looking for a healthy alternative to your favorite orange soda, this might be a good choice for you.          This is one of the better tasting Switch flavors, although it still tastes a bit like a flat orange Faygo or Slice drink.  It's good, but there's a bit of an aftertaste to watch out for.  It doesn't give you that weird filled up feeling that carbonated beverages seem to have, but if you're looking for some refreshment on a hot summer day (90+ degrees where I live as I write this), I'd stick to tried and true Kool Aid instead.          Decent, and a good orange soda alternative, but not life changing.
