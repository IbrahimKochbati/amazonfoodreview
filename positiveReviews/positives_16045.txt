I was looking for McVitie's Digestive Biscuits in many local supermarkets in my area, but unfortunately I couldn't find any. So I went to Amazon.com and searched for it, and here it was.. the delicious biscuits with the red and blue cover. I ordered it right away and I received it within two days. I have to admit that the biscuits were tasty, however the packaging was not vey good. Once you tear the wrapping cover you notice that the biscuits on the top and the bottom are crumbled. The problem is the biscuits crumbles very easily, so I am not sure whether it is fair to blame the packaging for the crumbled biscuits.          Would I order it again from Amazon.com? most probably yes.
