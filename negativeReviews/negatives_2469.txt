I have popped several of these bags in the past week, And every single one of them does not pop up as much as they used to. They used to pop up like a bag of popcorn does, These bags stay very flat in the microwave oven, And when you take the bag out you have to be very quick about opening it, Or it implodes and sticks together!          I used to purchase these Microwave Pork Rinds direct from the company, And had never had a problem until now.          So it's up to you to decide if you want to buy these or not, They are very tasty and very healthy for you too!
