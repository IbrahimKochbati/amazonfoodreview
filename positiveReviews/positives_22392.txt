Santa delivered a fancy popcorn popper to our house along with this pre packaged popcorn and we have been making popcorn at least twice a week since Christmas!  Very easy to use, everything is pre measured and packaged well.  My son in law says it is the best popcorn he has ever tasted!  I have to agree and I have been making popcorn for decades!!  You won't be disappointed.
