I'm a big fan of Buffalo chicken and beef jerky, so I thought I'd love the Jack Link's Flamin Buffalo Chicken Nuggets.  I was wrong.  I bought the Steak Nuggets as well, which aren't as good as Jack Link's jerky, but definitely tasted better than the Buffalo Chicken Nuggets.     To put it bluntly, they tasted like an old chunk of salty chicken with a slight Buffalo flavor.  They're not very spicy, I was expecting more of a kick.  They also smelled a little funny.  I'd give Buffalo chicken jerky a try, but I won't be buying these ever again. They're OK, but there's so many better options out there.
