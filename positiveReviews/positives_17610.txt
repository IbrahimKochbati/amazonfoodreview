Puroast  Low Acid Coffee in French Roast is excellent.  It  ews well and there is no loss of taste with it being low acid.  It     still tastes like full bodied French Roast and has a delicious smooth taste and nice color.  I have been disappointed in other low acid coffees but this met all my expectations for a full bodied cup of coffee without the acid stomach upset.
