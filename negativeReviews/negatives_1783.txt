The photo shows potato and carrot pieces in the butternut squash base but upon opening a can, there are no potato or carrot pieces to be found, unlike the cans I've bought from a local grocery store.  I guess this must be a change in Wolfgang Puck's recipe but the photo on the can does not represent the contents anymore.  Several cans out of the twelve pack were delivered dented, although none seriously.  Packing with better filling could have prevented dents in transit.
