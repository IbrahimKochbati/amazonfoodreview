We are told to improve our diet. The same is true for our pets. You are most probably not aware what crap meats and fillers are used to produce the most popular name  and foods. They are expensive because of the advertizing. Canidae is not cheap either, but it is because of the quality ingredients. My sons Collie gets it since a few month, and now the fur is much shinier, the dog does not smell and it loves the food.
