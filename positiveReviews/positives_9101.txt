Saw this at a local big box chain store, so of course I had to look for it on Amazon as soon as I got home. Received the item in 2 days (Prime really rocks, doesn't it?) and am so happy; we can finally get rid of our K cup carousel.          This drawer holds more K cups and keeps them out of sight, freeing countertop real estate. It glides open smoothly and seems very well made. It was shipped in a nice sturdy box and arrived in excellent condition. The drawer has 6 divided sections, each of which holds 6 K cups. Perfect for us, since we like variety! The drawer doesn't pull completely out, but has a built in stop; it doesn't seem to make it harder to get the last K cup out, at least for me. I'm a female with average lady fingers. YMMV. Still, I like the stop, I wouldn't want to have K cups rolling all over the kitchen floor.          Note   if you keep your machine under upper cabinets, you'll likely need to pull it out away from the wall to allow enough clearance to insert K cups and fill the reservoir. We just turned our unused kitchen desktop (it's counter is 3 4" lower) into a coffee station.          My only complaint is that Amazon doesn't carry the T disc version of this drawer, so tomorrow it's back to the store to buy one of those. Got to keep my Tassimo machine happy, too!          This product is a no  ainer!
