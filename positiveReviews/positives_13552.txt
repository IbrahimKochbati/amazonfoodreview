I have been using this product, Whisky Sour Mix, for many years.  Suddenly here in Ottawa it was no longer to be found in the grocery stores.  When I found the product listed on Amazon, I purchased a complete case.  When the case is gone I will get another case.  The price is also very reasonable buying it by the case
