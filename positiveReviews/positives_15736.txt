I read a lot of reviews before ordering this variety of cat food so I knew the pros and cons, but since it had no by products or wheat gluten, which are still my top "no nos" I decided to give it a try.  My cats LOVE the extra gravy!  They love the chicken chunks too, of course but the gravy really got them going.  I've now tried several other varieties with gravies and they couldn't be more enthusiastic.  I switched them from all dry food to mostly wet and a little dry because the oldest cat was constantly throwing up...likely from her unable to effectively chew dry food well and swallowing it whole.  I will continue to order this for them as well as some of the other Petite Cuisine varieties.
