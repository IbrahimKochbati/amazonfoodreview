I bought this item when it was heavily discounted (about $12) and it got here very promptly, since I am a Prime member. Every can has small dents. The discounted batch I ordered and recieved appears to consist entirely of factory rejects. They were bought 02 2012 and have a 12 2013 best by date, so not that big of a deal. None of the cans are punctured, just small dents. The contents are currently GTG.          I'd say if you are planning on eating these within a few months to a year or so of purchase, go ahead and do it. If not, I wouldn't trust dented cans beyond their best by date, or even really too far before then.          As for the contents, same as you buy in the store. Wife and kid love them, which is why I bought it.          The price has more than doubled since I got mine. Perhaps I just got a reject buy... Be warned.
