EDIT:  I just noticed each bag is only 1.76 pounds, not 2.2.  My review is not 2 stars instead of three.          First off, as you can probably guess by the pictures, these are sour gummies.  That isn't said in the description.  Also, each one is about 2 to 2 1 2 inches in length and 1 2 inch wide.          Texture and flavor:  The came to me soft and with the same texture as most gummies such as peach rings.  The sourness is average, not overwhelming but not too little.  Where I took off the 2 stars was the flavor (most important part).  As I chewed them, a few different flavors hit my tongue, none of which tasted that great.  I couldn't make out any of them in particular (not good at that anyways) but the combination was just plain strange.          I could see myself getting through one bag but will probably give the other 3 away to nephews niece.  After all, they will eat anything sugar coated right?
