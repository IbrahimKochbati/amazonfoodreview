We used to make our own cat food & this is a excellent substitute!  It looks & smells wonderful!  Get out your fork for the Chinese chicken or your spoon for the Chicken Pot Pie & dig in!     We have six cats & all six of them loved this!     The Chinese chicken is shredded white meat & a little bit of carrots in  oth.  Mostly shredded meat.  You can smell the sesame!     The Chicken Pot Pie has cubes of white meat in a  oth with carrots.  This isn't as filling for the kitties.  They did enjoy the  oth a lot!  Later they went back for the meat.  The Chicken Pot Pie would be perfect if for your kitty if you are trying to get kitty to get more liquids in their diet.  One of our males, Door Knob Head, had crystals & blood in his urine.  The vet said it could get really expensive if the first round of treatment didn't work.  It didn't work.  Cats can eventually die from blockage if left untreated.  I researched the condition & got him to drink tons of water.  It fushed him out & he's doing great for many years!  My life would have been a lot easier if I knew about the Chicken Pot Pie.  It would have been the perfect way to get more liquids into him!     Each 4 pack box comes with a coupon for $1 off your purchase & if you fill out your info. on that very same coupon, they will mail you another coupon for $1.00 off a future purchase.  Not too shabby!  Yeah, this stuff is pretty darn expensive.  A fine example of you get what you pay for.     My only complaint is I would like the option of purchasing one or the other, as in no variety pack.     I highly recommend this for your kitties!  Six kitties tested, two kitty parents approve....
