The title for this review says it all   "Very Delicious." I first encountered this  and at a local coffee shop in my neighborhood. I like it so much I went ahead and purchased two canisters and a frother just to be able to have a Chai Tea Latte whenever I desired.          I discovered it's a challenge to find vanilla chai. Most chai teas out there seem to be "spicy." But this  and is really smooth and is a very nice blend of many flavors, in addition to the vanilla. It's not overwhelmed by the vanilla flavor though and does not taste artificial.
