I love this cereal so much, it is my favorite right now. It's the perfect amount of cinnamon, sugar and grain. While others have a problem with the sugar content, that's what I love so much about it, there's sugar crystals in this cereal that other cereals don't have. Yeah it does get soggy pretty fast, but that's not really a bad thing because it tastes great either way you go!
