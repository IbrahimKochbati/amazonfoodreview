I think I can call myself a good Turkish Tea drinker. If you are not familiar with any of these teas, choose the cheapest one, which is the Yellow box (Turist) in general. It will give you 80 90% the same taste. The pink red box (Filiz) is supposed to be the next better one, while it is the most favorite choice for many Turkish tea lowers. The red box (Cay Cicegi) is presented as better and stronger than Filiz, and the black box (Altinbas) is best among these four tea types. However, the prices on Amazon.com are at least double of what you can find at your local ethnic food stores. See if you can find any local stores if possible. Once you find a local merchant, you will find more choices to buy with tea, like Turkish delight, baklava, halva, Turkish cookies, white (feta) cheese, black green olives, sudjook, and much more. If you come accross Turkish from  ands other than Caykur, try to choose Caykur  and.
