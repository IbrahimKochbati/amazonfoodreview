Nice alternative.  Very lightly carbonated.  I'd say if a normal carbonated drink ranges from 80 to 100 on the fizzy scale, this one's about an 11.          At 26 grams, it's still a lot of sugar (mostly from apple and grape juice, I think).  I'll order a case just 'cuz I thought it was good and I'm calling it 4 stars   but honestly, I'd rather have it 50% splenda or stevia sweetened.
