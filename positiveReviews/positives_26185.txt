Maybe this is a placebo effect however, since I have been drinking this tea, sometimes in the morning and some times at night, I have felt more calm and my mood is somewhat lifted. The taste is fine  I sometimes add a little honey but it is fine as is. I will continue to use this tea. I do think it helps with your mood.
