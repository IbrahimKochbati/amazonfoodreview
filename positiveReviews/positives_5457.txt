Oh dear, there aren't words to express my feelings for this product.  It's absolutely terrific.  The chocolate melts in your mouth revealing the perfect raisin inside.  You can let them sit in your mouth and savor the moment, or chew through two quickly before throwing more in your mouth   I usually do the latter.          I've never been able to find a comparable milk chocolate raisin product so I always end up coming back to these.  They're sold at big discount warehouses and also on Amazon.  Perfect.
