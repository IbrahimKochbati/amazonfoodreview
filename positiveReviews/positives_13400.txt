I've settled on "Newman's Own" as my regular cup of coffee every morning.  However, sometimes late in the day I want a decaf cup.  I've tried LOTS of different decaf K cups, but was never as satisfied as I wanted.  Then I thought, why not just get Newman's decaf?  So I gave it a try and sure enough   great flavor.  It's tastes very similar to the regular blend.  So   if you like the original Newman's, then you will also like the decaf.
