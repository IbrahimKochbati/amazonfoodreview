This popcorn is delicious!  I have tried different kinds of popcorn, with different kinds of flavored oils and salts, but this is the best I have ever made at home.  I would love to have a batch of fresh movie theater popcorn and a batch of this popcorn side by side, because I don't think I would be able to tell the difference.
