I was both horrified and delighted when this huge 2 x 1.5 x 1 feet box from Amazon came to the office for me. No wonder ordering it with Amazon Prime 2 day shipping still took 3 days (plus the weekend...)          So be warned, all, for $20 (or $15, or whatever the current price is), you will be getting a HUGE box, and if you ship it to work, your coworkers will all wonder what it is and you'll be forced to tell them, and then guilted into giving up a few bags to sate the hungry, curious masses!          Less Pirate Booty for you!!!!!!!
