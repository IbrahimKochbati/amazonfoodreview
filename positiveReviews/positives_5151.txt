Boy, I really loved this drink.          It tastes much like orange soda, only with no oddball aftertaste.  It's plenty sweet, but the sweetening is so naturally orangey that it doesn't seem overpowering like a coke can.  It's much smoother and easier to swallow than a conventional soda, with carbonation that is plenty strong, but not quite as strong as a can of Crush.          It's a drink that is subtle not only in tone but in flavor.  You can taste the various other fruits mixed in with the tangerine and orange, but it's still very much an orange drink with no fruit punch aspirations.          It tastes perfect, and there's no doubt that someone carefully went crazy saying 'too much!'  'not enough!' to every little facet of the drink before it was just right.          No corn syrup or other bad additives.  At 36 carbs per 8.3 ounce serving, it's still got quite a lot of sugar in it.  If you're looking for an orange soda style drink that is really just carbonated juice, this is the best possible product I am quite sure.
