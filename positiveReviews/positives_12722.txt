I am an avid coffee drinker as I have tried different blends from different country. This little known Trung Nguyen blend is definitely the BEST coffee ever! Forget about black coffee from hipsters filled Starbucks and those so called gourmet blends from D&D. Black coffee is supposed to be bold, rich in taste, and refreshing! Most coffee that you have tried are bland, sour, and SOUR. If you want the taste of real coffee, you've got to try this.     Protip: Asian supermarkets in Socal have these boxes for only $6 each. Also, buy a Vietnamese coffee filter because it's the best when it comes to extracting the goods from coffee.
