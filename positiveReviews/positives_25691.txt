I use mate with black tea to get an extra dose of caffeine in the morning. That way my  ew is not bitter and it packs a punch. This mate is the best I have had. It is fresh smelling and tasting, and it has a lot of flavor in the cup. Most mates are more in the background of the black tea in my concoction. This mate is front and center. I really enjoy it.          On top of all that, it is not expensive. In fact, for its quality it is quite a bargain. I hope I can continue to get this product at this price.          I have a gourd and I have used it once or twice.          My preferred method is to use three cups of water to two teaspoons of tea and two of mate. I cool the water for 60 to 70 seconds before pouring it over the mixed tea and mate. I'm not a purist, but I get something I like and can drink on a consistent basis. It makes a good amount of liquor and it is mild to the palate and gives a good dose of caffeine.          For tea, I use PG Tips Loose Tea.   "
