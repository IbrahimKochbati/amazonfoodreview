I have two German Shepherds, 8 years old. Every morning I give them each a CET Chew, which they enjoy. Their teeth are sparkling white, and their gums are healthy, which eliminates the need for costly dental cleaning and the dangerous anesthesia. I recommend this product without reservation as being very good for dogs.
