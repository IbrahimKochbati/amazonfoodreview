This syrup is so good. I do not usually like maple syrup but this one is delicious. It does not have an overly strong maple flavor but is very sweet. I will puchase again based on flavor,its organic,great price, made in USA Vermont. Maple Syrup just does not get any better than this. They do need to use stonger shipping boxes and wipe the jugs. I had sugar ants in my box but not in my syrup.
