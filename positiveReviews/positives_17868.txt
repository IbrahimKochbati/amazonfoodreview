Cooking Pork Chops couldn't be easier with Shake 'n' Bake Original for Pork. Just coat Pork Chops with coating mix and bake for about 10 minutes. Great when you don't have a lot of time to prepare dinner. I gave this four stars because I like my Pork Chops a little spicy. Next time I will add a spice to give it that extra kick that I like. Otherwise this is great.
