This is so far the best Hazelnut coffee for the money I have had.          Nicely flavorful ,wonderful smelling  medium blend that says "HELLO" to you in the morning.          I drink my coffee black   so taste is important to me. This has it.          I do not want a "screaming " coffee   that wants to  "attack " you in the morning...and beat you black and blue.          I am changing my delivery to a even shorter time frame as I desire a cup more often of this  and than many others.          It is not absolute top of the line....but its good enough for most and good enough for daily and good enough for me.          Don't mess with my Eight O'clock Hazlenut Coffee!
