We used Royal Canin Indoor Mature 27 Cat Food after having used Royal Canin Indoor 27 regular formula.  Not only did our cat's coat improve, but her feces do not have the unpleasant odor they used to have when she was fed other food.  She is now 13 years old and extremely healthy.  This food is expensive but worth it!!
