We are into our third can of this flavorful and easy mix and it just seems to get better and better!  Sunday is pancake day at our house, and today we had blueberry pancakes with real maple syrup.  This mix holds fresh blueberries nicely   don't over mix the ingredients and you will get nice, fluffy fruit filled (or not) pancakes that are absolutely first rate.
