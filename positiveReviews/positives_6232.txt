Bob's Red Mill Baking Soda is an excellent product for baking with or making your own toothpaste.     It is aluminum free and free of any other harmful chemicals. We use it as a safe legal product     on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet in healing my boys with ASD and healing my own fi omyalgia     as we have difficulty ridding our body of harmful toxins in foods.
