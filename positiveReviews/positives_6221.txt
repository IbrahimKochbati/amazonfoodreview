Zen  ews up to an golden amber liquor.  The aroma is sweet spearmint.  The blending of this tea is excellent  spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it.  Slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor, then you taste a hint of lemon.  The green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the intial impression of zesty spearmint and lemon modulate into a substantial potion.  Very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste.          Remember that this tea does have caffeine  however, it does not say how much on the box.  A good estimate might be 30 mg  compared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee.  Make sure you time how long you  ew this tea because if you  ew too long it becomes bitter.  Four minutes is ample.
