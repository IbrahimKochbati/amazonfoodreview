I do not like coffee too much. Actually I am very particular about coffee and I can say that this is one of my favorites. It is so smooth and flavorful,the smell is really good and I can't have enough of it.I have gone as far as skipping going to Starbucks or Dunkin for coffee.     The price is decent for this kind of product so I highly recommend it.
