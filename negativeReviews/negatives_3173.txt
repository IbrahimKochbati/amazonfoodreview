I've used this particular  and of 'white truffle oil' to make truffle butter for my steaks.  I have also drizzled over popcorn for an amazingly new taste.  So if you love the smell of truffles, then you'll probably like this product.          My gripe is with the labeling.  It makes it seem as if real truffles are somehow involved with this product, they are not.  If you look at the ingredients, there are two:  olive oil and white truffle aroma.  Well truffle aroma is just 2,4 Dithiapentane.  You are buying 'perfumed' olive oil that smells like truffles, or at least what most of us have been lead to believe truffles smell like.  So buyer beware, it tastes and smells great, but this is not a real truffle product.
