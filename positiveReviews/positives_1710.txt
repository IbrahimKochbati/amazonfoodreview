So I bought this pomegranate molasses to make Fattoush, the delicious middle eastern salad of greens, cukes, tomatoes and torn up bits of fried, leftover pita  ead.  Wowee, Fattoush is now my favorite salad, I've eaten so often lately that the tart lemon y dressing has made the corners of my mouth turn a bit pinkish and raw, youch. I tend to do that, find a food I really like, then eat it so much I almost make myself sick on it.          Anyways, the Fattoush salad dressing, with it's complex blend of Sumac, olive oil and various herbs and spices required one half teaspoon of pomegranate molasses.  I was lucky enough to find it at a Russian grocery store (YAY!).  But the store is far away and so I had to look around online to buy more, thank God for Amazon.          Now, granted, my bottle will likely last years if all I do with it is make Fattoush, one goopy half teaspon at a time, so I've used it in a few other things.  I added a teaspoon to a Lemon Chicken Marinade, a tiny glob to a bowl of greek yogurt (had to add honey too cuz it was sour!),  a tiny amount added to Christmas Salmon cream cheese log, I used it in Fesenjen, a persian stew of chicken and walnuts, I used a few tablespoons of the sticky stuff in a garlicky barbecue sauce and it was the best barbecue ever.          Just don't do what I did and try to replace the molasses in molasses cookies with pomegranate molasses, what a horrible mess, the cookies looked normal, slightly lighter than normal, but the smell!  And the taste!  Ewwww!
