I was expecting the beef stick to be like one of the pictured multipacks with a natural looking sausage type snack that is a little thick.  Instead, these individually wrapped sticks are very long but small diameter.  As such, much of the texture is the casing and not the meat.  I also wish the Original flavor was a little more peppery.
