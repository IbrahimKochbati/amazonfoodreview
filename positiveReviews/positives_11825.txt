I LOVE this stuff for grilling steak!! Pat the steak dry and then lightly spray it with bourbon. Sprinkle the seasoning to your taste   I like lots of seasoning, remember you will lose some while grilling. Flip the steak and do the other side. Let it soak while lighting the grill. Just before grilling, lightly  ush the steak with melted butter   be careful to not remove the seasoning! Make sure the grill is REALLY hot! Sear the outside and spray it again with a bit of bourbon. Flip the steak and do the other side. Flavor is similar to the Bourbon Street Steak at Applebees. My opinion is mine is a little better . . . It may take you 2 3 times to get it down pat but it is SO worth it!!!
