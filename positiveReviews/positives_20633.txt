Easy to make, and made as directed is tame enough for even the biggest wussy in your life. For the more daring, it makes a great base to experiment on top of. The simmering time on it is not long, and maybe it's just me, but seems to get better the longer it's simmered. I usually go for 3 hours.          I've officially stopped buying canned chili since stumbling across this at the store! I would recommend this to any chili fan for when you're to lazy to do it from scratch. Seems pricey here on Amazon though since i've bought mine for $4 a pack average at most stores such as Wal Mart & WinCo.
