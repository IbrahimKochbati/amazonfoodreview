One of our favorite dessert recipes calls for almond paste and the Odense tube is the best for our particular use.          Usually I buy it at Safeway, but it costs around $10 per tube there. I checked out Amazon and voil&agrave;    a six pack of these puppies comes to a little more than $5 per tube, plus it qualifies for Free SuperSaver Shipping.          Now we don't have to wait for a special occasion. We can go ahead and splurge whenever we want to!
