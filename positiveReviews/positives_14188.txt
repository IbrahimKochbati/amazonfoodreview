This is my absolute favorite tea.  So many teas just taste too bland or watery to me.  The licorice mint is delicious, needs no sweetener, is soothing to the stomach, and caffeine free.  I look forward to a cup before bed each night.  And with Subscribe & Save it's almost half the cost of buying in the local stores!
