This was a great deal cost wise. And, I've found Newmans own to be the best of the Extra Bold blends. It is an excellent full bodied delicious coffee that gets my mornings off to a great start! I'd consider it a medium dark roast on the starbucks side; only smoother, and not bitter or acidic. The seller was prompt in processing my order and it arrived faster than anticipated. I will reorder!!!
