Taste is fine but a bit bland for me. Also, noted that the tea leaf pieces are larger than usualy teabag crumbs but certainly NOT whole leaf.  I'll drink it since I like a mellow white tea to warm up though and appreciate the organic tea offering that we can find on Amazon now. I might try the cheaper version of the organic white tea next with the usual teabag crumbs since this is not whole leaf anyways.
