I drink coffee almost every day.  I sip and enjoy it rather than slamming back X number of cups required to get me through the day.  This is a nice pre ground sipping coffee. It's not an aficionado's coffee, not so much because of flavor rather than that it comes pre ground.  It kind of fits in a quirky in between niche.  Not for the Folgers crowd but not for the gourmand either.  All in all, not bad.  My biggest complaint was the packaging.  This was sealed so tightly that I pretty much had to destroy the bag to get it open.  I guess this may be symptomatic of premium pre ground coffee because they are trying to keep in as much flavor as possible.  However, as an average consumer I find it annoying.
