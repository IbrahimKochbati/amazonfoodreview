I visited a winery vineyard in Tuscany where they sold Leonardi Balsamico vinegar as well as all the wines.  The flavor of this balsamic is so difficult to describe but it is smooth! I was used to grocery store balsamic vinegar and some "specialty" store balsamic vinegars.  It's like comparing skim milk (yuk) to cream   which would you rather put in your gourmet dishes?
