Great treats, my Pitt needs weight control snacks and these treats are amazing. He loves them, and they have like sixty calories each, plus they are big, almost thr size of a pinky finger. My pup gets one after doing his business in the yard, and they satisfy him. I am glad I found this product and I will be ordering it again. Also, the bag is large so it lasts a while. A good value and an awesome item for dog owners. Perfect of medium or large  eed doggies.
