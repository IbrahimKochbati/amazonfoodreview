This coffee is surprisingly delicious. We never had a problem with the k cups bursting; maybe it is a defect on the coffee  ewer..? This coffee is a bit less strong than we normally prefer our coffee but it makes up with great taste. Look forward to my mug every morning. Would definitely recommend it and will buy it again.
