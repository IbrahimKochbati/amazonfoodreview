We don't have a dog, but we pet sit for the neighbors and were hoping these treats would be welcome.  Sadly, the hound just pushed one around the floor and then abandoned it under the table.  Is it because they're so terribly hard ?  Is it some flavor (or lack of flavor) that only dogs can sense ?  Too bad the hound can't read and can't tell why these treats should be such a good healthy treat for him.
