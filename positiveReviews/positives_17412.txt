I love strong tea. I drink it in the morning, I have a cup in the afternoon, and if I'm tired on Friday night, I have a cup before I go out. For the last two years I've been fulfilling my strong tea cravings with Twining's Irish Breakfast Tea  it's strong and has a robust flavor. I never new what I was missing out on until I bought a box of Barry's Tea at World Market last week. Barry's has the most full, satisfying flavor that I've ever experienced in a tea. I can't describe just how wonderful this tea is. If you're a tea drinker, pick up some Barry's Tea ASAP  you won't be disappointed!
