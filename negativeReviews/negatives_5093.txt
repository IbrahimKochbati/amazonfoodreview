I bought one of these last year for my pittie mix who was less than a year old, he LOVED it at first and had a great time throwing, kicking and rolling it all over the floor to get to the treats.  Then he started holding the jug down with his paws and puling up on the "rope," which didn't take long to tear in half.  I thought maybe he could still use it but that the treat would come out easier, this was not a good idea.  He started chewing on the rubber at the top of the jug and it came apart in pieces   thank goodness he didn't swallow any!  So I figured once again that maybe it would still be useful once I removed the rest of the rubber bits that were torn, again I was wrong.  He started to chew on the top of the jug itself (can't blame him it did smell like treats!) and the plastic quickly became jagged and sharp.  In less than 24 hours this toy was in pieces and in the trash.  It was definitely NOT worth the almost $20 I spent on it!
