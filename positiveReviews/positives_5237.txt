Dare I be corny and say, "Make a switch to The Switch?"  This soda has a great orange tangerine taste.  It is juice with carbonation, therefore, it can tout that it is all natural, without any added sugars.  It lacks that sickly sweet taste that soda with high fructose corn syrup tends to have, which is a bonus.          This can at 8.3 oz is following the `skinny can' trend, as well, which I think is great for packing in a cooler, your bag, or a picnic basket.  I would put these out at a party, as well, for mixed drinks, self service, and sake of ease.
