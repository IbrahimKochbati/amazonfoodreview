The meat is good but it came packed in a thin plastic wrap and put in to styrofoam packing with little protection.  When delivered the plastic wrap was ripped and in direct contact with the packing material.  The Ice pack were melted.  It would be better if packed with at least two plastic barriers and dry Ice.  I ordered meat from Ohmaha meats and I came packed in a styrofoam cooler with dry ice and in good condition.
