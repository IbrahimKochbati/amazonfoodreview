Look, I'm aware that every K cup variety has a review saying "This is the best K cup." But I know what I'm talking about, okay? We all know the kind of people whose favorite flavor is Caramel Vanilla Creme, or heaven forbid, "Cappuccino". I'm not talking to them. I don't use cutesy cliches like "cuppa joe" or "packs a punch". This is also not one of those stupid reviews that claims "This is the best cup of coffee I EVER DRANK", because we know K Cups cannot really compete with fresh roasted beans. But if you drink K Cups and you have some discriminating taste in coffee, get this one. Emeril's bold is nice and bold, dark but not too dark, the flavor has some dimension besides "burnt"...trust me.          P.S. If you did happen to  ew any of those flavored kinds in your machine, because it's a shared machine or your mom got you a variety pack or something,  ew a cup of water through first. Then look at all the stuff floating in it, and consider yourself educated.
