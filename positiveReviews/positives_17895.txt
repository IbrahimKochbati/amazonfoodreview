Some pre mixed food products are too heavy on the salt for my taste.  But shake n bake has a good balance of seasoning.  Just as an experiment, we tried using them as  eadcrumb substitute for meatballs and they were quite good as well.  This product provides a tasteful balance of seasoning and is a versatile recipe ingredient.
