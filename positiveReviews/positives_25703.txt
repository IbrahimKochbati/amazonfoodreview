We've bought probably every single "upper end" (that sounds so bad but I just mean we don't like Maxwell House etc. and I don't know how else to say it.) coffee for the Tassimo just to try new things all the time. We recently got these and it quickly became one of our absolute favorites. It has a VERY smooth taste, it's got a full flavor that is a touch fruity and is made with 100% Kenyan Arabica beans, rather than a blend like you often see in other  ands.          Negatives: This is "European style" so you should know it's a smaller cup.  If more is important to you, you might want to go with Starbucks since they seem to make the largest cups. This doesn't mean this one is stronger and that one is watered down since the Tassimo reads how much water to add to whatever  and you put in from the barcode on the disc. The Starbucks we found that is closest to this is their Kitamu. I like that the t disc makes more of that one, however we do like this taste better...it's smoother. So it's really what's important to you. Size or taste...some mornings we need the largest cup!          Conclusion: Excellent coffee. Wish it was "American sized" rather than European but it's still great!
