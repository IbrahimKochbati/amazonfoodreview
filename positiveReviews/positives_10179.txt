We have two Siberian Huskies and the oldest has to take medication every night. She hates the way it smells and will dig it out of anything else we try to hide it in   even cake.  But these are amazing.  We just put the capsule inside, push the treat together at the top, and she gobbles it up.  Completely masks the scent and both she and our younger dog actually beg for them as treats (yes, the younger dog also gets one every night, but without a pill inside).
