flavor: It doesnt really taste like anything.. When i was eating it i was wondering what the heck was in the middle of each raveoli. I used to eat theese as a kid but now i wonder what the filler is. At first I thought that was the beef inside. Though it to mushy to be beef. The inside is  own and does not taste like beef.          Anyways the beef is little chunks of beef in the SAUCE (not in the ravioli).          This is not worth it. There is no cheese BTW.
