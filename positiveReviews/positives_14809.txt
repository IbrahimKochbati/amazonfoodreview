I've always enjoyed a good cup of Earl Grey (especially when coupled with a good book) but have not really gotten loose leaf before. This Rishi Earl Grey is very nice, not overly heavy with no licorice undertones that I really find unappealing in some Earl Gery varieties. The tea takes four minutes to steep, and when done is quite aromatic. I would recommend this one without reservation.          *****Update 10 10 2009*****          I had to come update this review to express how much I LOVE this tea. It's easily one of the most enjoyable teas I've experienced (I'm drinking a cup of it as I update this review) and it always makes me happy when I  ew a cup. This is a lovely tea!
