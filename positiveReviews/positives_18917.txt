I was diagnosed with an allergy to gluten a little over a year ago and it has been challenging and frustrating to find a tasty cereal, most are very bland and I ended up adding my own nuts, fruit etc. to them.  Now that I found Bakery on Main's Fiber Power Triple Berry Granola I looked forward to  eakfast again.  I also love to grab a handfull to snack on, it is so yummy and wholesome tasting and I have no guilt since I know it's good for me.  I gave my husband a taste, and he said it was better than the "regular" cereal he has been eating, so now I have to share mine with him!!  I want to try some other flavors soon.
