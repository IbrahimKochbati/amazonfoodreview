I believe the concept and the intended combination of ingredients is nutritious and may be delicious BUT not in this little package.  My 11 month old daughter took one bite and literally spit it out.  I tasted it and it was so lacking flavor.  I'll be making this combination for her on my own in our Beaba BabyCook.  The other fruit and veggie combinations are great, but this offering missed the mark completely.
