After using the Gluten Free Pantry Favorite Sandwich Bread mix for some time (and loving it), I decided to check out other Gluten Free Pantry mixes.  I have been using the Betty Crocker Brownie Mix for over a year and have had mixed (no pun intended) and often disappointing results.  Well, I am SO glad that I gave this one a try!  The  ownies are chocolate y and just the right consistency when baked for the amount of time recommended on the package (I never knew with the Betty Crocker  ownies...sometimes they were done, sometimes they weren't).  I don't have to add extra chocolate chips to this mix to get the richness I want in a chocolate  ownie.  Another plus is that this mix works just as well with substitutions (I use canola oil instead of butter).  I even baked one batch using applesauce and yogurt instead of oil (moist, fat,  ownies were the result).  I like that I can "de fat" them if I want to do so!  I've tried almost every GF  ownie mix on the planet and this one is the BEST!  One strange recommendation in the directions is that you freeze the  ownies for an hour for best results.  Since I am always in a hurry when I bake these, I haven't done that as yet, but, it hasn't seemed to be a problem!
