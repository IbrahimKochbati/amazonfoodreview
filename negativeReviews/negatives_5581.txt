I love the taste of pop chips but, I think it is a little too salty. The manufacturer for some reason decided that it looked,tasted too healthy and decided to add extra salt to appeal to a  oad audience.     I think they woul've been better served keeping the salt content low.          I would recommend the barbecue flavor which doesn't suffer from the same problem. the worst I think is the sour cream (or something like that) flavor. This one is ok.
