This is sooo tasty and very low in calories.  So many low cal foods don't have much flavor but this one has both.  I made a couple of changes   because I love the flavor of tomatoes I decreased the water from 7 cups to 6 cups and added a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes to the water.  I also added a can of black beans (drained)to it.  I was trying to keep the calories down so didn't add meat but imagine that would be good also.  Try it....
