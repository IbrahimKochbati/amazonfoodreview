I like this Grade B product more than the Grade A product because of the stronger flavor.  Being organic, it is quite expensive.  My husband was shocked when he saw the size of the small jug.  Nonetheless, I am hoping my children are protected as much as possible from all the chemicals out there, though the degree of protection will be limited by the amount of chemical leachables from the plastic bottle.  I was disappointed that the packaging is not glass.  The product itself is very runny.  I am starting to believe that this is just the way natural syrup is.
