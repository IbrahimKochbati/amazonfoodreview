Okay, when you try to go gluten or wheat free there are many things that you miss.  A nice fresh loaf of  ead happens to be number one, but a close second is a wonderful pan of moist  ownies.  The sad thing is that many gluten free mixes end up with products that are coarse and dry...and, believe me, I've tried many.          This one, however, is fabulous.  You'd never know it was gluten free.  In fact, if you make it for people who aren't going gluten free, they'll never know.  But why do that?  They can have their regular old  ownies and you can have these...all for yourself.          Easy to make.  Moist.  Nice texture.  They don't even need frosting.  Just sprinkle some powdered sugar on top if you like (if you sprinkle it through a doily it will make a pattern for fancy events).  I've also added nuts to this mix, such as almonds, walnuts, and even  azil nuts.          Simply heaven.
