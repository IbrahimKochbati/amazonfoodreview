I love peanuts and I also love salt but these nuts have very little taste EXCEPT salt.  Believe me, there is not much that I consider "too salty" but these certainly qualify.  Also, as another reviewer mentioned, they are bland   not peanut y.  Trader Joe's "blister peanuts" are far superior to these. Indeed, I think a commercial  and like Planters is probably superior (and much cheaper).  After this purchase, I am still on the lookout for peanuts better than I can purchase in the grocery store.     Sorry I got them.
