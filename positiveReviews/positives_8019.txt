Suprisingly, I LOVE this pasta dish. When it comes to vegan macaroni and cheez products, some are delicious and others are totally not. Well, at first I wasn't sure about this one but as soon as I looked at the ingredients list and recognized EVERY item and seasoning I instantly became comfortable with the idea of this being edible; turmeric, onion powder, garlic powder, rice milk powder, etc. This may not be macaroni and cheez but Namaste is a great tasting pasta meal so Im glad I chose to try it because I love it and maybe you will, too.
