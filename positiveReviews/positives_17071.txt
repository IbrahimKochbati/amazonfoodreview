We got this toy to keep my 6 month puppy busy when we went to work. It's a great toy for dogs that inhale their food and need some stimulation so they keep out of trouble. My dog is not a light chewer so I was worried that he would chew this to pieces but after a couple of months this toy remains intact. LOVE IT!
