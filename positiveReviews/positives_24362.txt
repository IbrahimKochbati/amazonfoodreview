My mom gave me licorice tea whenever I had a bad throat, and it really was soothing to my throat.  This works just as well!          Now, if you really really dislike the flavor of licorice, you might want to stay away from this tea.  I don't typically like licorice (I can tolerate it), but this isn't too bad.  Sometimes I drink it just for the scent and flavor.
