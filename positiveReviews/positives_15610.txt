Our cat is 6 years old and has eaten (voraciously) the same  and of food in both the chow and the canned variety for all of his life.  He's not at all a picky eater (even given to nabbing a potato chip if he can).      Nonetheless, we were a bit reluctant to try a new  and of food but no worries there.  With his first can of the Petit Cuisine Chicken Pie we knew we'd found a winner.  He didn't hesitate for a second, not even the unfamiliar smell slowed him down.  He seemed to particularly enjoy the liquid, lapping every bit of it.  A full tummy, a grateful rub of my shin,  and he slept for a few hours.  What a life!      Five purrs for Petite Cuisine!
