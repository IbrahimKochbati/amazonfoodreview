I am addicted to this TEA!! I love Yogi Teas because of their inspiring sayings on each tea bag's tag... and this ORGANIC tea is SO delicious! It is so tasty and sweet, there is no need to add anything to it! It is perfect all by itself! I drink at least a cup or two a day of Breathe Deep. It keeps me feeling happy and  eathing fabulously :)          There is no sugar in it, but whenever I have a craving for something sweet, I just drop one of these tea bags into hot water! No calories, no added flavors or sugars, no guilt and the world is happy.          I highly recommend this tea to anyone interested in finding a tasty new drink that is all natural and ORGANIC!! It seems too good to be true, but Yogi is awesome! Oh yeah, and if you have a head cold or congestion, this tea works wonders as well    I love drinking it, even when I feel 100% healthy though!
