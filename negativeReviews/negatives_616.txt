Upon opening the sealed bag, I was struck by an unpleasant scent.  Looking at the ingredients I saw, in addition to the black tea and rosebuds, a "natural flavor" additive.  I believe this additive is the culprit to ruining what should have been a delightful bouquet to my nose.  Then I  ewed this tea, and could still taste that additive, but overall the tea was tasty.  I hope the Davidson family reads our reviews because I am certain that, if they would just refrain from adding the "natural flavor," I and others would find this tea to be superb, and in keeping with the other teas I have come to enjoy from Davidson's.  For example, upon opening their Darjeeling loose tea, as well as their Assam loose tea, my nose is struck with a lovely bouquet ~ this is what one wants to experience from superb teas.  I will look forward to Davidson's responding to my (and other customer's) suggestion re: this nasty flavor additive.  I've enjoyed tea with rose petals while in India, and they did not put anything other than the tea and the dried rose petals.
