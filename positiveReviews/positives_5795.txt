This is, quite simply, the best Mac 'n Cheese on the market. It is our go to meal for when we haven't gone to the grocery store and desperately need a dinner.          My tips:     + Add the "optional" butter, you know you want to.     + Personally I find that it needs just the smallest pinch of salt to  ing out its flavors     + Some fresh ground pepper rounds it out          If you like this stuff, I also highly recommend the Annie's snack mix (I think also available on Amazon). I believe Annie's makes both products with their patented Bunny Cocaine(tm). The dangerous addiction I've developed is totally worth it.
