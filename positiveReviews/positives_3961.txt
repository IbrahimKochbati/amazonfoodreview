We LOVE Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies.          That said, the small mini's are the first time that we have had a problem (PROBLEM) with about 1 3 of them being moldy or having mold on them.          Storage has not been an issue.  When we got them (within 1 2 an hour), they were placed into the freezer until use.  As we use the cookies we take them from the freezer to the microwave (for a quick warm up).  However, still I am fearful each time I rip into a small package, that I will find mold either on the top or sides of the cookie.          This is, obviously, not conducive to enjoyment while eating them.          We have NEVER had this problem with any of the the big cookie variety.          **UPDATE:**  02 15 12    Today I opened my door to find a box sent to me from Erin Baker's... and it had 2 boxes of fresh double chocolate chunk minis (the exact amount that I had found to be moldy in my original order).  AMAZING company.  Check out the comments attached to my review to see how this all came about.  TOP MARKS to this company.  Not only fabulous  eakfast cookies, but amazing customer service (which THEY volunteered   I did NOT ask for!!!)
