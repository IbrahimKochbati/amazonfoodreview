A friend recommended these bully sticks to me because it was more cost effective then the 5 a week fix I was supplying my dog.  Admittedly when I first opened the package I thought they would be too large for my 15 pound Shih Tzu mix.  I'm happy to report that she's a big fan and therefore so am I!          Additionally, I appreciate the low odor and non staining factors.          If the shipping hadn't been so expensive, I would've given it 5 stars.
