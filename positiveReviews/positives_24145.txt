My husband lives on these.  He is hungry every few hours and was gaining weight on sourdough  ead, chips, et al.  He started munching on a couple of these, and he's feeling great.  They keep him going, and sometimes he adds a slice or two of cheese.  They are crisp and yummy and healthy.  What more?
