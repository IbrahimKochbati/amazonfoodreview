This is not what one should expect from a black truffle, but we are not paying the price for a winter truffle. It is cheap, but there is a reason for that: there is no taste and no smell at all. I was disappointed when I tried this truffle, but I realized that the price was that for a reason. At least it can be used to add a colour to your dish.
