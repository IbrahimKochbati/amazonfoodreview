If you are looking for absolutely guilt free snacking, keep looking.... However, if you are craving a snack: crunchy, salty, buttery satisfaction, minus the preservatives and unhealthy ingredients of normal snack foods, Grandpa Po's is the way to go!  It is the closest you'll get to guilt free snacking that wasn't found in the fruit veg aisle in the supermarket.  4 simple ingredients make this crunchy popcorn soybean snack extremely satisfying and "not so naughty" when compared to the million other snack foods out there, not to mention the many unpronounceable "mystery" ingredients included in them   not the things you want to put in your body.  For my destination wedding, I  ought a few cases of Nutra Nuts to put in my guests' welcome bags.  Well, no one even mentioned all the other local gourmet treats that were in the bags  the Grandpa Po's were the hit!  Everyone was walking around w  their Grandpa Po's Originals pouch in hand: "these things are GREAT!"  Clever packaging allows you to reseal and keep them fresh for the next urge to snack   although usually not necessary for this customer!
