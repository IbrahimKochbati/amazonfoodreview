Happy Hips are one of my little monster's favorite treats.  She is a very finicky eater but she will obey and be sweet for a chance at these chip like treats.          This product was recommended to me by another dog owner as a healthy treat because it contains no fillers, byproducts, antibiotics, or added hormones. It also has vitamins and minerals to maintain healthy joints, which for a French Bulldog that has problems with hips and joints, is a plus.  I feel better about giving the little critter a healthy treat instead of the garbage contained in  and name treats on the market.          One huge red flag is they are made in China, which certainly gives me pause, but I will keep buying them.     I have only tried the beef liver variety and will stick with it since my little creature likes them so much.
