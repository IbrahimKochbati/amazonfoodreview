Being the "mom" of three mini wirehair doxies I spend a lot of money on a number of things.  Imagine my surprise to find such a bargain of Greenies on Amazon.  I really must make a habit of first checking any purchases to see if available on Amazon.  Hang tough on the CA sales tax issue, I live in CA and I am taxed enough already.
