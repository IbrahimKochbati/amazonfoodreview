I bought this to ship to me in Afghanistan, since it would be easier than asking my wife to go to the grocery store and then to the post office. Good price and fast shipping, but now I have to order a can opener. The item image depicts a pull tab can which was my main concern, but the package that arrived did not have these tabs. If this is your concern, like mine, then don't buy.          As for the taste or quality of the meat, well I'll just have to wait and see.
