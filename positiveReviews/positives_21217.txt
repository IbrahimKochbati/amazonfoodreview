I have been making yogurt using the Yogourmet machine and this CBA starter since 2003.  It was very easy to make successful yogurt consistently so I never switched to any other products.  It is good for both non fat and whole fat milk   although personally I prefer whole fat since it tastes original.  I use 1 2 to 2 3 of a small bag for each 1 2 gallon container of yogurt.  It always comes out right after 11 hours of "cooking" time. I will definitely recommend this product.
