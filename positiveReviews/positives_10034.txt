I am a coffee lover and quite picky about my coffees. Every coffee  and claims hand picked gourmet coffee, so it is hard to find a good bean. As with many things, coffee is a matter of personal taste. I don't like the bitter flavor of Starbucks, for example, which is the result of their trademark roast. I like flavorful coffe that is not bitter. I loved this coffee from Melitta.          It is complex and rich, very european in flavor and not bitter at all. It is surely one of my personal favorites. At any given time I have 6 to 8 coffee varieties at home (both whole beans and ground), yet I find myself choosing this Melitta coffee every time and I am not getting tired of it. You should try it.
