These packets are all you need to achieve the perfect movie theater popcorn experience!  If you love popcorn like we do look no further!  It's not to greasy and is a little on the salty side but it only makes you want to eat more!  To make, just follow the instruction on the packet by pre heating the pot then dumping the contents in.          The packets are divided into a solid oil side and a kernel salt side.  If you want to reduce the salt content, Just pinch the bottom of the packet where the salt is, holding some of the salt back from going into the pot.  Although, our family loves it just the way it is!          I highly recommend this product as I will be buying more soon through Amazon.com!
