I agree with many of these reviews.  The product tastes good   not fantastic but good.  I don't like real, greasy potato chips and prefer Baked Lays.  However if you do enjoy real, greasy potato chips, please see the review referencing Pringles and Steven Baldwin.  very funny.     Do buy these if you like an ocassional salty snack but don't want to devour a large bag of fat filled chips.  Don't buy these if you are looking for a healthy alternative to chips   eat a banana or apple instead (and not those apple chips or banana chips because they are high in sugar).     If you do get the big box   just put it some place inconvenient like the basement where you will have to exert some energy in order to get them   and if you do, BONUS! you just exerted energy and maybe earned a chip or two.
