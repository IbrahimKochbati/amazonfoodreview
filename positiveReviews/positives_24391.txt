My three siamese love to eat well. I first started them on this food about seven months ago and they simply love the taste. Since they are household bound, they get all of their proper nutrients from this food. I have noticed softer & healthier shiny fur, cleaner  eath, and more alertness in them.I would highly recommend this cat food for your cats.
