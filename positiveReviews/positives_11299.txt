My little boy is nearly two and has become an extremely picky eater.  The peas and carrots he used to love just get thrown on the floor and the little chunks of squash I give him   he spits them out and makes himself gag!  So, these pouches are my salvation!  I mix the powder with a little milk into macaroni and cheese and voila!  Now he eats macaroni and squash and cheese or macaroni and peas and cheese and we are both happy :)  The squash is also great mixed into spaghetti sauce.  It's just an added bonus that they can sit in the pantry without going bad for weeks or months so I always have some veggies on hand for him.
