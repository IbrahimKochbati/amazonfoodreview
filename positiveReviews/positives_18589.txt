My Lab is a very picky eater.  He turns his nose up at peanut butter, cheese, and deli meat.  It took a year to find a food that he would eat with a little excitement.  If food drops on the kitchen floor he will not touch it.          A friend gave my dog one of these treats and he begged for more.  I could not believe it.  He would pass up filet mignon for these treats.  I like them because they have one ingredient, chicken.
