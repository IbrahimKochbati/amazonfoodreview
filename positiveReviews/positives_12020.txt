My three month old Westie loves this treat. The only bad thing is that it's huge for training. If I command sit, it takes him 20 seconds to finish eating it and do the next trick. I recommend  eaking it into tiny pieces because the label says 1 or 2 a day only. My pup loves this treat and would do anything for it!
