I am going gluten free to test if I am sensitive to it, it is a good diet to be on anyway.          This was very tasty in a pancake it was light and fluffy.  You do need to use a little more butter than usual but that makes it even better. They  fried up with uniform color and had a nice little  own edge letting me know they were done.
