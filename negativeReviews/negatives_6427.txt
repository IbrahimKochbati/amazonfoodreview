I HAVE BOUGHT SIX PLANTS FROM HIRTS GARDENS. ONE WAS INFESTED WITH MEALY BUGS & THRIPS, 2 WERE SENT BENT ,BROKEN DUE TO NOT PACKING THE PLANT CORRECTLY, MOST OF THEM HAD BROWN DRY LEAVES AND EVEN LEAF SPOTS. IVE POSTED THIS REVIEW BEFORE AND I RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM HIRTS STATING PLEASE REMOVE MY REVIEW CAUSE IT HURTS THERE BUSINESS, I WASNT EVEN OFFERED AN APOLOGY ON ANY OF THE ISSUES. THEN I NOTICE THAT HIRTS SOME HOW HAS DELETED ALL OF THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS ON SOME PLANTS THAT I POSTED BUT HAVE NOT DELETED THE POSITIVE COMMENTS ON THE OTHER PLANTS. SO THIS IS WHY THEY HAVE SO MANY FIVE STARS BECAUSE THEY ARE TAKING OUT THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS WE AS CUSTOMERS POST. (VERY DISHONEST OF HIRTS GARDEN)
