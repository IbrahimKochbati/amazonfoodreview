My 16 year old german shepherd mix scratched all the fur off her abdomen. We  ought her to the vets and nothing worked. Switched to Avoderm Baked Lamb and Brown Rice and she stopped scratching and the fur came back gradually until now she is back to normal. She had cataracts and could hardly see and her eyes gradually cleared and she can see well enough to catch a toy thrown to her. She had arthritic hip displasia and had to stretch for 10 15 minutes in the morning before she could walk. Now she hops right up in the morning and bounces around the house with our two younger dogs (one a year old). We determined by switching around dog foods that the shepherd is allergic to chicken. Just about all other dog foods have chicken meal or something chicken added to them. The ingredients in this dog food are baked lamb (not lamb meal) and the preservative is vitamin e rather than artificial preservatives. This is the only dog food that works well with all our dogs. I have only found one other prepared dog food with as much or more protein per mass. I am not even sure that advertised claim is accurate. Although the price is high, the dogs eat less of this than regular dog food, so it really does not cost as much more as it seems.     Amazon has the cheapest price and very fresh product, but I prefer to support local pet stores and purchase it locally when it is available.
