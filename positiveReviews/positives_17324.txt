My kids and I have tried several  ands of whole wheat macaroni and cheese, and this is definitely our favorite.  You certainly can taste that it's whole grain, but we've gotten used to it and think it's quite tasty.  As a mom, I like that the cheese isn't florescent orange and is quite easy to clean up as a result.
