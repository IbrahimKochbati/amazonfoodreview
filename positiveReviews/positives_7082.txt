I was very excited when I received a Keurig coffee maker as a Christmas present, & couldn't wait to put it to use.  However, in the three months since I've had it, I have struggled to find what I think is a good cup of coffee.  Most of the  ands I've tried have either been too weak or too strong.          I am not a "Starbucks" kind of coffee drinker, or fan of fancy flavored coffees.  I just like a regular cup of coffee that smells good when it's  ewing, & tastes smooth when I drink it.  Finally, just like Goldilocks said, this one is "just right".
