So I wasn't convinced about the greatness of Popchips   until I tried them!! Now, although they are more expensive than regular chips, they are so much healthier and taste GREAT so I'm not sure I will ever buy regular chips again!          However, even though I loved the basic flavors in the 6 flavor variety I wanted to try some of the different varieties because they sounded good. The only purchase option to try some of these other flavors was to buy a whole box, and I was very skeptical to buy an entire box of 24 if I didn't like the flavor. This variety pack gave me the perfect opportunity to sample each flavor to determine my favorites! I wondered what flavors I would be getting since they were not listed in the description, so in case it matters to you:       Thai Sweet Chili (2 .8 ounce bags)       Parmesan Garlic (2 .8 ounce bags)       Jalapeno (2 .8 ounce bags)       Cheddar (2 .8 ounce bags)       Sweet Potato (2 .8 ounce bags)       Sea Salt & Vinegar (2 .8 ounce bags)       Salt & Pepper (2 .8 ounce bags)       Chili Limi (2 .8 ounce bags)       Sour Cream & Onion (2 .8 ounce bags)       Barbeque (3 .8 ounce bags)       Original (3 .8 ounce bags)     I haven't had a chance to sample all of the flavors yet, but the ones I have tried are wonderful. They taste healthy (although they aren't exactly healthy   they are the better alternative) very crunchy and full of flavor. The only flavor I don't really care for is the Original, and that's because it is pretty salty.     Don't be skeptical   try this variety pack and find your favorite flavor!
