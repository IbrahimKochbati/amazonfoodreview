A year or so ago, I use to buy these quite often because they were gluten free.  Last month I decided to order some again and this product no longer says "gluten free" on the packaging and contains wheat.  I didn't want them to go to waste, so I ate one anyway.  I became very sick.  I do enjoy this product but will not be purchasing again because of the wheat.  Just a warning for those of you who also have issues with wheat gluten.
