I just finished my first bag of this Rwandan coffee and was quite disappointed when I went to my local COSTCO and found they had none in stock.  I'm glad I can order it on Amazon.  I tried many different  ands, looking for a really good cup of coffee,  but now I'm sticking with this.  I so look forward to my big cup of Rwandan coffee in the morning!
