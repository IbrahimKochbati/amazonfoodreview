I love this bar  BUT bear in mind that I have to try hard to find a zero sugar food that's easy to grab and throw in my purse.  If you're just looking for something yummy, this may not be your favorite.  But if you're looking for zero sugar, it's almost impossible to find, and when you do find it, it usually tastes bad.  In fact, there are some chocolate or chocolate peanut butter versions of this same product, and I HATE them.  Gross.  But the white chocolate tastes great.  Caveat:  They are 230 calories per bar, which is too many calories for me, so I cut them in half and keep each half in a ziploc bag in my cupboard for a quick grab when I'm running out the door.  Then we're down to only 215 calories, but still filling.  I love this bar.
