My friend at work and I both eat sunflower seeds quite frequently. We always try new types when we find them. He came back from out of town with these a few weeks ago, and we're both hooked. They are definitely the best sunflower seeds either of us has had. Not only is the flavor fantastic, but the seeds themselves are top notch. First, they're HUGE. Second, there are surprisingly few  oken or empty shells. Third, as of yet I've never had a mushy, foul tasting seed. Sadly, we can't find anywhere around us that sells them, so I'm glad Amazon does. I'm really looking forward to trying the other flavors from this company as well. He  ought more back from out of town today...I'm eating them now, and that is what prompted me to look online for a place to order from.
