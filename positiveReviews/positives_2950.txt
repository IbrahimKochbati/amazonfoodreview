The first can that I got of this wonderful oil was packed in a poor way: an old, reused box with not enough padding.  When I complained the company was quick to respond   with an apology and a new can packed well for the mail.  I was impressed with their responsiveness.  The Merula oil itself was excellent   a great treat.
