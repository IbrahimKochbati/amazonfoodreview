Last night, I visited a friend who had bought this toy for my yellow La ador.  My dog is a very fast eater when I feed her from her bowl, so I was delighted to try this.  I've used Buster Cubes in the past, and still really like them, but my La ador has figured out how to remove the center piece that controls the difficulty so food spills out easily.  Buster Cubes aren't much of a challenge for her anymore.          When I put my dog's dinner into the Tug A Jug last night, for the first time, she looked at me as if I had played a cruel joke on her.  She saw the food in the toy, looked at me, cocked her head, and went to her food bowl.  I encouraged her to play with the toy, and she quickly figured out that she could get pieces of kibble by rolling the toy around, picking it up and dropping it, etc.  Right now, she is eating her  eakfast, tail wagging, as she manipulates the Tug A Jug to get the kibble out.  It's only her second meal from the Tug A Jug, so we'll see how long this treat dispensing toy lasts.  :)          ***UPDATE*** Today is the 4th day of use for this toy.  I have been feeding my dog 2x day by placing her kibble inside.  This morning, my 13 year old La ador figured out how to remove the end cap and eat the kibble without working it out of the narrow end.  Tonight, she bit harder than usual and the end cap snapped, just above the threads.  It's not a treat dispensing toy anymore.  I'm glad I didn't buy this car for myself, but I'm sorry my friend's gift was so short lived.
