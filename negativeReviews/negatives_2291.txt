This fondant tastes good but does not work well for decorating cupcakes. It's very soft and the more you mix in color, the softer it becomes. I added powdered sugar to help make it not stick to my mat, cookie cutters and tools, but it was a constant battle. My major complaint with this fondant is that it doesn't harden. I made decorations 3 days in advance (which I've done in the past using Wilton fondant) and they weren't drying. The morning I needed them, they were so soft that even picking them up distorted the shape. I ended up having to place a high powered fan in front of them while I went to work for 8 hours, only to come home to semi dry decorations. Because I have a ton left over, I'm going to try and mix gum paste with it to see if that helps with the stickiness and drying time. I do not recommend this product if you're trying to create flowers, stars or any type of decoration that requires tools and drying time. Needless to say, I will not be buying this product again.
