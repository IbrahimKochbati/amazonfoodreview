I foolishly purchased the HARMONY FARMS Healthy & Holistic Adult Dog Food, since it had more for the same price(why it had good reviews is beyond me). My dogs will not touch the harmony farms, yet love this dog food. My 10 wk. old pup had "slimmy poop", until the day I feed her this food. Both my dogs love it.Newman's Own Organics Adult Dog Food Formula is the way to go.
