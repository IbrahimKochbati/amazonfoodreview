At first, I really wanted to like this drink. "The Switch" tasted like tangerines and had a good aroma. The drink is carbonated, but not really strongly so. It is pleasant. However, after a few seconds, an after taste developed that was a little bitter. My wife thought this after taste was even a little "off", but she has a more sensitive palate than I do. In any case, the net effect was that I would just as soon have Orangina, and I won't be going out to buy more of "The Switch" Orange Tangerine. On the other hand, if this is what was being served at a party or gathering with few or no other choices, I wouldn't avoid it either.
