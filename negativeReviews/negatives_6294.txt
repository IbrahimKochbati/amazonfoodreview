Nespresso makes GREAT coffee and GREAT machines. I switched over to a Nespresso machine 7 years ago and have never looked back. I save a small fortune every year by making my lattes at home.          That being said, the Nespresso capsule offers posted here are from a third party who is putting a large additional margin on their price.          You can order the same products online from Nespresso for approx $0.55 each (half the price here).
