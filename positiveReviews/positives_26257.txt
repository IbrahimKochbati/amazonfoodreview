I've bought this  and at World Market for more money.  In the case I ordered, the boxes each have a free Indian CD.  This is sort of ironic because I was playing one of the free CD's from a local purchase and it got stuck in the CD player.  Now I have a replacement.          I knocked off 1 star only because these are higher calorie than some other  ands.  I also really don't like the design of the box.  They're a "triangle" design (see picture on the side) and do not stack properly.  This doesn't seem to save any room in the case when shipping.  So I don't know why they made a box this way that's inconvenient for the customer.
