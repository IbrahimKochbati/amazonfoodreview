I love the sugar free, calorie fat free syrups for my coffee.  I even put the Raspberry and Vanilla flavors in my diet soda.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's still a bit on the expensive side and I would really like to create my own variety pack and select the flavors I love most!  The variety pack is cheaper than buying the bottles individually, so I will just take what I get!
