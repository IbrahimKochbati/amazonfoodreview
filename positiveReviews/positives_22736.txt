Great product, its really more popcorn than the 4 oz kettle can handle at one time, you have to experiment with it to figure out how much to use, I use about half of the corn for two popings and use very little salt.  The oil can be divided into two batches and it works out really great.  Makes a lot of popcorn, plenty for two or three people, and has a good taste, comes packed in a handy packets and just cut small corners out to pour the oil and popcorn into a measuring cup to put into the kettle.  Use the salt sparingly, there is way to much salt if you use it all.
