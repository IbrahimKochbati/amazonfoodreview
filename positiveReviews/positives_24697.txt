I've also tried and love many energy drinks and the Green Monster cannot be beat.  The 300mg of Ginseng along with the 2gms of protein building blocks (amino acids) and the 2000gm "Energy Blend" all wrapped in the green pixie stick flavor is spectacular          RockStar, Red Bull, Amp, SoBe and many many others cannot compare.          I am know as the unpaid Monster evangelist. I even have a 6x8 green M on the hood of my car.  I actively search for replacements and or complementary beverages but one worthy cannot be found.  If anyone feels that they know of a drink more worthy then M' please post me a note so I can try it.          (I have already tried Monster Energy Hitman) loved it too!
