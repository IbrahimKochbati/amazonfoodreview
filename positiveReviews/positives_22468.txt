I bought this popcorn to use with the Whirley Popper (a highly recommended purchase) I purchased on Amazon.  This popcorn is great tasting with an ever so slight hint of coconut ... yes that is the extra something you taste in movie theater corn! It's better than the popcorn from Wabash Valley Farms (the  and that comes with the Whirley Popper), in my opinion.  It tastes just like the kind you get at the movie theater or a carnival and the smell is just fantastic.  When using my WhirleyPop I usually only get about 10 12 unpopped kernels.  The more comfortable I get using the popper I'm sure that number will decrease.  The corn pops up nice and crispy without any greasiness (as sometimes movie theater popcorn can be).          However, I do think that the popcorn is a bit too salty (thus giving it 4 stars instead of 5) for my family's taste so I use only 1 2   3 4 of the seasoning versus using the entire packet.          I think I got a great deal being that I recieved the popcorn, oil, and seasoning all for $39.99 and free shipping.  It couldn't be easier because all I do is dump it all in the popper and 'turn the crank!          A minor complaint I do have, and I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else, is that a few of the packets do leak a little bit; nothing major but enough to notice.  I will continue to purchase this  and because of the great taste and ease of use!          UPDATE***In retrospect $39.99 wasn't that great of a deal being that now, the price has gone down by $10+!  :o)  I have been using my popper with this popcorn for quite some time now and rarely get any more than 5 10 unpopped kernels.  I have tried other  ands as well, buying bulk popcorn kernels with Orvil Reddenbocker's popcorn oil and they do not even compare.  I did it to try and save a bit more money and not only did my popcorn not come out to my liking, it was quite a pain measuring the ingredients.  I will be sticking to Great American!
