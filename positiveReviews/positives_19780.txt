Peppers arrived in good shape, sourced from Olive Nation   checked the weight before opening because of other reviewer's concern and it was dead on at 8oz net, and the aroma taste were very good.  There are a few black centers still but it's much better quality than the local Asian grocery at roughly the same price.  As someone else noted 8oz. is a LOT of pepper    it may take a while to use all this up.
