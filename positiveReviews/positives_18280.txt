Wow! is an understatement.  These are (by far) the BEST barbecue potato chips on the market today    and they don't have any non food "junk" in them!  These chips taste like a cross between potato chips and barbecue pork rinds but they are low in fat and they are NOT fried!  They are really crunchy and we LOVE the barbecue seasoning that they use on these.  We're sold    we won't be buying any of those "other" potato chips anymore. I've going to end this review now because I just heard one of my kids open up another bag...
