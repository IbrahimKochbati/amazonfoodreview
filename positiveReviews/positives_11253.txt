This is good stuff, of which I have consumed an absurd amount. I keep some of these  ownies in the freezer at all times, for serving guests, or for having a little something sweet myself when I come home from an event where everyone but me (all the non celiacs) have been snarfing down the cake or cookies and I have had . . . coffee.          The first time I used this mix, I made the butter recipe, because I had always cooked with butter and was afraid it wouldn't taste good without butter. But the next time, I was in a hurry and didn't want to bother melting butter, so I made the oil version with canola oil, and it tasted just as good. And it's better for you. So that's what I make. I usually add half a cup of Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips. The flavor of the dough has a subtle richness that I think comes from being sweetened mostly with mollasses and honey. As with all  ownies, don't over cook.          I often make this to take to potlucks or other events that require "something to share," because it's easy and quick and everyone who likes chocolate likes these  ownies. They are very moist and rich; I cut them into very small squares. Unfortunately, they taste great right out of the freezer; otherwise they would last longer and I would weigh less.
