I love coffee and I drink three or four  ands of k cups depending on my mood. This coffee is strong but not too strong. Let me tell you, this is coming from someone who cannot drink coffee on an empty stomach, from someone who has trouble digesting a Starbucks mocha (i.e., it can be painful). I will put the water level on high and fill my travel mug and to me that's plenty strong. I don't go for the french roasts, etc.     As for Amazon... illiant, fast service. It's more convenient to buy k cup coffees online than to find the types and flavors you want in the store. Most stores have limited k cup offerings.
