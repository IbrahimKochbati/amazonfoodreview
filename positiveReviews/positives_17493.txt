I use this from just ordinary drinking to mixing in my steelcut oatmeal. It's delicious and tastes similar to soymilk with a nutty hint. I'm a fan of the taste of soymilk anyways, so I naturally liked this stuff, but I stopped drinking soymilk a while back; for the men out there though soy milk increases estrogen (allegedly) and I'd rather not take that risk. For those who don't like soymilk, I would not recommend this product as it is very similar in taste. Keeps well enough but I went through the entire case in less than a month (once opened each box lasts around a week).
