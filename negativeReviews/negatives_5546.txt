I've only used Shake N Bake for pork a few times in the past and decided to let my youngest (he's 10) give this a try.  While I supervised, he did all the work which to say isn't too hard.  It didn't come with a bag so we used a ziplock 1 gallon size. The product is simple to use and a quick fix if you're looking for something that requires little prep work.          The taste is the same as I remember and would have preferred something a little spicier and not so heavily coated.  The pork was fairly tender but the coating does make it a bit messy. I thought it was okay but doubt I'll get it again.
