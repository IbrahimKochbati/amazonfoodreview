Not only are these  ownies very tasty, they are very easy to make. I use a  ownie pan (11 x 7) and they come out perfect every time. I wish they made a bigger batch because they don't last long in my house. My family members, who are not on a gluten free diet, really like these  ownies. I am glad I can buy them in bulk on Amazon along with other gluten free groceries too.
