We got the sweet potato flavor through the Vine program.  I was genuinely surprised by how good these were.  Crunchy but light texture.  Just the right balance of sweet and salty.  Portion controlled bags have only a 100 calories and 95 mg of sodium.  These are definitely a healthier alternative to potato chips.  But don't mistake "healthier" for "healthy."  They have almost no nutritional value (1 g protein, 2% iron).  So don't let all the buzzwords on the packaging fool you.  Still, if you are looking for a light snack that won't ruin your diet, this is a good choice.  As an FYI, despite what the marketing and package language would lead you to believe, sweet potato is not the main ingredient here.  Rice flour is the first ingredient, followed by sweet potato flakes, tapioca starch, a blend of various oils, corn flour, seasonings, etc. Not a huge deal, but its one of those "truth in advertising" points that annoys me so I mention it.
