These are great  ownies that just happen to be gluten free!  Everyone loves them, including wheat eaters!          I have Celiacs disease and cannot eat gluten or I get very ill. I have NEVER gotten ill from these  ownies!  This means they are 100% gluten free and safe for those on gluten free diets.          NOTE: Be careful to not overcook them! It can happen quickly if you are not being observant and dry or burnt  ownies are not very palatable   P          BEST STORAGE: Do not leave them out on the counter, in a cookie jar, or in the fridge.  Gluten free foods dry out quickly. Instead you should cut them into squares while still a little warm and freeze them. Then you can defrost fresh nummy  ownies whenever you would like to eat them!          I consider these the best  ownies i have ever eaten and the only  ownies I will ever buy.
