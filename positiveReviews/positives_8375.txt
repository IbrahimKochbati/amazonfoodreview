I bought this sauce with very high expectations for heat. I was disappointed. I know something is wrong, this is supposed to be very very spicy, but when I tried it... it wasn't too bad at all. I got a bad batch or something. The taste is pretty bad, it's really earthy... dirt flavor. But I wasn't expecting good taste, just heat, which didn't deliver very well. I kept this at a high rating because it's really spicy, but I just got a bad batch.
