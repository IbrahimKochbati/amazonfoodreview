My dogs love these treats more than any other. I see that some of the ingredients are sourced outside the US, but these days it's very hard anything with a Made In America tag.     I love that the treats have the bonus of doing something for their senior hips and joints.     Overall, this is a super product and with subscribe n save there is no better price anywhere.
