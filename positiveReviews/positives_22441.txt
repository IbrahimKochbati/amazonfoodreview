I looked at the old fashioned pop corn poppers (you know, the red cart and metal popper), but those looked like they would be a lot of work to keep clean as well as take up counter space I don't have. However, I still really wanted "movie theater" or "carnival fair" popcorn. So I got the Presto popcorn popper that goes in the microwave and works either with or without oil. If you get the 2.5oz size pack of Northern popcorn, you can easily split it in half and make 2 batches. (The Presto popper is too small for a 2.5oz pkg all at once.) This stuff tastes great. Yeah, I know palm oil is horrible for your heart etc. etc., but THAT is what makes all that fake buttery taste so yummy. Like another reviewer said, the salt packet is a quite salty so I only used half (maybe even less) the salt for all of the popcorn in each packet. After looking at several online distributors, at $18.95 (subscription price) Amazon has the best price. 4 1 2 stars
