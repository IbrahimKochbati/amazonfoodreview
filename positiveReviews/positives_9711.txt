I'm a vegetarian and had been supplementing my protein intake with whey protein for a long time. It really frustrated me that there wasn't a good, competitively priced organic protein mix available. I was skeptical about using hemp protein because I had never tried it before. I was extremely surprised when I bought this chocolate hemp protein mix and found that not only did it taste great, it also has exponentially more fiber than whey protein. While the taste of this protein isn't necessarily what I would call "chocolate", it definitely is chocolate like. If I had to give a comparison, I would say maybe hot cocoa? While hot cocoa does taste similar to chocolate, it is nothing like biting into a chocolate bar. Overall, I would highly recommend this product!
