Convenient, cost effective and delicious.  I went to the local grocery store and for the same amount of money, the ingredients weighed about half the weight of Great Northern.  Worth the buy and I recommend it.          I just don't recommend following the included instructions.  Before you turn it on, add the oil, then turn it on and add the rest of the ingredients ... you won't accidentally melt the plastic package. IMHO
