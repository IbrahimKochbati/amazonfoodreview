I prefer Grade B because it has superior flavor.  I prefer organic because it doesn't utilize pesticides in the orchard or chemicals in the extraction process. I prefer Amazon because similar syrup is 30% more at the grocery store.          I purchased this as a birthday gift for my husband since he is a maple syrup addict.  I hope he enjoys it because we're going back to our frozen fruit compote  eakfast topping due to the amount of sugar in syrup. Yes, syrup *is* sugar.  But, fruit syrup is tasty too, with a side of nutrition.
