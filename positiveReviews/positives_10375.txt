Urbani is just known for  finding the best tuffles in the world and this olive oil infused with black truffles didn't disappoint at all.  I think the hard part with this is where and when to use it but we have found it great in eggs, lightly applied to steaks both during cooking and after.  The best use and when we like the best is used in pasta right after draining it just gives it a great kick and unique taste.          Great way to inexpensively get a great truffle taste
