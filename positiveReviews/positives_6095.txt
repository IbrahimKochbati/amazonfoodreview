I am a self proclaimed coffee guy. I enjoy chatting about coffee with the manager of my local Starbucks. I also have my own burr grinder, French press, espresso maker and 2 drip coffee makers (2 cup and 12 cup). So where does VIA fit into my coffee life? I typically use a VIA packet when I want a quick cup of coffee and don't want to take the time or effort to  ew a pot (12 cup or 2 cup coffee makes).     Pros:     * Fast and convenient.     * Taste great for an instant coffee   it is not quite as good as fresh  ewed but remarkably better than other instant coffee.     Cons:     * It is expensive. So watch the price on Amazon it will vary greatly over time. I tell my wife we are not "Pay the full price people". Put the item in your cart and then if u have time check your cart daily for a while. (I do this for all Amazon purchases since the price does really fluctuate for most items). For VIA I have found that watching it can save me 50% or more on Amazon   the price of this item locally never changes much.     * It is not the same as good  ewed coffee. Don't expect this to be the same as fresh  ewed coffee   all else constant (I.e. filtered water etc.)
