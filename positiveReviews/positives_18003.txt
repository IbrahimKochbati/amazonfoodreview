I love this stuff, it's delish, it's gr8 hot, easy to prepare, however, this price is INSANELY RIDICULOUS.. go to walmart, it's there on the shelf, same exact thing, 3.38 per box, hello, 8 pks. in the box, you could have 10 boxes, 80 packs for that 30plus price tag, or, a tank of gas to get to the store, either way, drive, for this item, it's cheaper
