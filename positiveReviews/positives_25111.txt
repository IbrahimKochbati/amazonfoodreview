I send my son to school with this coconut water as a healthier choice than the juice box for school snack.  Both my son and daughter love this, although it's sweeter than the regular coconut water (which they won't drink unless I make a smoothie with it).  It's a nice way to get a little hydration into kids after playing outside or sports and much better than the sports drinks too.  Very happy with it and I also like it.  It's a bit pricey though, sometimes you can find it on sale at the stores which is a better price than here on Amazon.
