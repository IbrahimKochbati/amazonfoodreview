I see that Dare has decided to cut down on the filling, the cookies tasted the same, but i like them the way there were.  This was my second order and I was truly disappointed.  I open my box to find  oken cookies and cookies that has been in heat and the middle has melted.  The quality was very poor.  I don't know who I should contact for a refund for the  oken and melted cookies.  Can you help with this?? If this is not rectified  i will not be ordering any more.  Anybody out there want a box of  oken cookies???          After making my review, I recieved an e mail from Amazon, they agreed to refund the cost of my damaged cookies.  I was shocked to see a company with compassion and honesty for their customers....they truly strive to provide good quality customer service.  This is very rare these days, but it is good to know a company out there truly cares.          Thank you,
