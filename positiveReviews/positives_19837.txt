I purchased this candy, on vacation, at a candy store in Michigan at the cost of $9.89 per pound plus tax. They are delicious and I wanted more, so I went looking on the internet. I was pleasantly surprised to find the very same candy at a much more reasonable price and they arrived fresher and even better tasting. I have offered them to several friends and family members and they are a hit. Careful, they are addictive! :o)
