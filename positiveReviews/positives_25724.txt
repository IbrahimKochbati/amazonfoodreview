In my mind, to qualify as a "cookie," a food needs to possess two ingredients: sugar and fat. If you reduce or eliminate either or both of those, you no longer have a "cookie," but a sad imitation of one, generally not worth eating. Quaker has tried to make a better for you cookie not by reducing its evil components, but by adding other virtuous ones, in this case whole grain oats. This yields a cookie with whole grain and fiber to offset, at least partially, its less nutritious aspects.          Let's look at the numbers of two very classic cookies. Three Nabisco Oreos weigh 34 grams, have 160 calories, 7 grams of fat and 1 gram of fiber. Three Chips Ahoy Chocolate Chip cookies weigh 33 grams, have 160 calories, 8 grams of fat and 1 gram of fiber.          One of these Quakers weighs 42 grams, has 180 calories, 8 grams of fat and 4 grams of fiber. So you get about 25% more cookie for about the same calories and fat, and you get 4 times the fiber. If they were as good as the other two, you'd have a hands down winner. Unfortunately, this is where reality intrudes. They aren't.          On the other hand, they're not bad at all, perhaps just a step behind the Nabiscos and Keeblers that we all love. If you're like me and have reached that stage of life where you need to be sure to get enough fiber every day, they represent a painless way to get about a sixth of what's needed. And you will feel like you've eaten a cookie and not a styrofoam imposter.
