I grew up on Tartar Sauce with Sweet Pickle Relish which is difficult to find. So finding this was a good thing at the right price including shipping...the price range varies a lot (including shipping)...shop around! Next to being disappointed via dill pickle tartar sauce is feeling ripped off by outrageous prices...shop the different sellers on Amazon for this product, OR make your own with Mayo and Sweet Relish.          We use it not just for fried seafood, but as an ingredient in Deviled Eggs, English Sweet Pea Salad, Egg Salad, Tuna Salad, Cream Cheese filling for stuffed celery, Cold Macaroni Salad. Mix it with a little ketchup and you have QUICK Russian Thousand Island Salad Dressing, the list goes on.
