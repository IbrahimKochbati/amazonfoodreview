Works great. Definitely worth the $21.38. I read another review that the drawer sticks. I ran into this problem also. Easy fix, just bend the sides of the pull out drawer in (with a little bit of pressure). I was afraid that I might  eak it, but it seems to be very sturdy. Like I said just a little bit of pressure & the drawer slides out no problem. Believe me if it had issues I would never hear the end of it from my wife. Also I have my Keurig B40 on top of it with no issues of bowing, & there is enough room on the side to fit some containers "Creamer & Sugar". Makes the counter top a lot more functional.
