I saw this product on Oprah and wanted to try it, I was impressed that it was vegetarian and lower fat then mayo. I thought it would make good "BLT's", but without the real beacon. It was just OK for me. The product does come as described and tastes OK, but something about it just tasted too fake and I didn't like the texture. It's not real creamy lake mayo, or even low cal mayo. I like low cal fry sauce a lot better. I have to say though, it's just a taste thing, and someone else might love it. I still use it on burgers, (mixed with light mayo), but no one in my family really cares for it that much.     I wasn't happy that with free shipping it took a month before it was even sent out, that seemed a little ridiculous. The packaging was good. I like that the jars are plastic and not glass. However, I would not purchase again or recommend, because the flavor is just OK.
