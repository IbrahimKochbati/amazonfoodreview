I really like the product but this is the first and last time I'll order it. The box arrived with about 2 dozen of the single serve containers busted ... a sticky mess to clean up. Don't expect multiple 24 container boxes like you see at the local store. It's 192 containers dumped in a cardboard box and sent on it's merry way to you. Good Luck!          12 2011 Update: Amazon Customer Service remedied the situation. I provided International Delight with a few packaging suggestions too AND I have purchased more product with fingers crossed :)
