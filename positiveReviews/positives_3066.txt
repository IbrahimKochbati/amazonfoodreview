The sodium and sugar (often corn syrup) in tomato sauces is frightening.  Plus, w them you eat white pasta to boot but w salsa you eat rice and beans.  Trust me   don't buy your sauces around your meals, get salsa and plan meals around it.          They arrived in a day or two and the bottles were shiny and fresh, I was afraid of warehouse dust and old stock.  The vendor did really well.
