These packs guarantee that each batch you pop is fresh (obviosuly much fresher than even theater popcorn), and of course it tastes great!  This is a perfect pack for 8oz poppers, everything is pre measured.  My wife really likes that fact that the the corn, oil and salt are all partitioned separately on these packs.  That way we can control exactly how much salt goes into the batch for popping.  Reducing the amount of salt by half still gives us great tasting popcorn.  I can vary the amount of salt in each batch based upon the preference of the people that will be eating the popcorn.  Everyone is happy this way.  Try doing that at a theater concession stand!
