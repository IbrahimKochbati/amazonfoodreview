Having lived in Spain for almost six years, I know the importance of Saffron being kept in a glass jar. Having depleted the supply I'd  ought back with me; I decided this product would be a suitable replacement. The moment I opened the shipping box, I could smell the Saffron! I knew I had something spectacular, but held off using it till I cooked a dish of Paella for a group of friends. The spice did just I felt it would, and more, imparting the lovely golden tint I love, and giving my dish a smokey taste. The mortar and pestle were perfectly sized, and I showed one friend how to use it; she was amazed! My friends had never had anything with fresh Saffron in it before, and were blown away by how wonderful it was. I will be ordering this again!
