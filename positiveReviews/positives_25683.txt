There's no way to package soft "street" pretzels in a bag you keep on the shelf(though they do come frozen).  For handy salty snacks, the factories have made so called "hard pretzels" for decades, and these are the best.  The proper blend of sweet and salt, blandness and tart, they hit the spot.  As a snack, their only handicaps are that they are very hard(only original teeth please), and they are very salty(they deliver a "wallop" of saltiness that potato chips just don't, due to the fact that their salt is on the surface and concentrated in large salt grains.)  But if you like old timey pretzels like they used to sell in the general store or your local bar, these are for you.
