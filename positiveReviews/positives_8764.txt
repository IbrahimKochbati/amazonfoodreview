This gluten free starch  is used to thicken soups and gravies.  Its main advantage over other starch thickeners is that it's a permitted ingredient for Passover, unlike cornstarch and other grain based foods. Liquids thickened with potato starch should never be boiled.  Supermarkets often stock it among the Kosher products. I have used this in cakes and in some gentle sauces.  There is no taste that comes from this so just the flavor of the ingredients comes through.  It is very silky and fine.  Remember you do not want to let your sauce boil with this starch.  Those who are on a gluten free diet may be able to use this.
