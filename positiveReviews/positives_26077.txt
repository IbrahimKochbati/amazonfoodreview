This would have been a winner if my cat's would have like it, They will eat a little of it then walk away leaveing the rest. I like that it had quality ingredients and the price is very reasonable compaired to other quality cat food. I wish my cats would like the good stuff this is the third quality cat food I have purchased and its the only one of the 3 that my cats would even touch.
