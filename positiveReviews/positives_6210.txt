Simply Splendid Chocolate Covered Cherry Cordials! Perhaps the best we have found. I went to their web site and found a large assortment of other chocolates and ordered more from there. They shipped quickly (ordered December 3rd, arrived the 7th). The candy was slightly melted (who would expect 80 degree heat on December 7th? Oh, yeah, Fort Worth, Texas). However, my wife loved them!
