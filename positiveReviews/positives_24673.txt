I was worried by other reviews that the cans might arrive mangled. However they were all completely fine, no dents whatsoever. The product itself is good quality, nice color, tasty, no obvious faults with it. Mine was not runny, it had a normal pureed texture. Might have just be a difference in the batches sources. If this product stays affordable, I will purchase it again.
