All you have to do is open the bag and enjoy the smell, nothing beats the smell of fresh Hibiscus.  The flavor is amazing... I use it for hot and iced tea and everyone enjoys it... Just give it a try you wont be disappointed... it took me three attempts to find the right seller and this is the one...
