I  ewed this in a Bodum Coffee Press. The grind is a little small for this method, but the results were worth a little "mud" at the bottom of the cup.  Rich, deep, and really delicious, this French Roast is so mellow, it's positively addictive.  If you enjoy a strong  ew but don't like the hit of acid you get from a Starbuck's or other "seattle" type coffee, you will fall in love with Puroast Low Acid French Roast.          I initially made two cups (or one big mug), but couldn't resist the temptation to use the rest immediately afterward. This is now my favorite coffee by far. The taste is incomparable, and it's nice to know you can drink as much as you like without coming down with an acid stomach. My only regret is that I did'nt save it for a Sunday morning when I could have spent more time savoring it.
