I have two cats, 1 of them a is a large bombay who used to beg for Bumble Bee Tuna whenever I ate it.  So, I saw this in the store and bought it and he loved it.  I feed it to him every morning.  This is much better than regular tuna for cats because it is full of specific nutritional vitamins for a cats diet.  My other cat is not a big fan of tuna so I feed her wellness canned chicken.
