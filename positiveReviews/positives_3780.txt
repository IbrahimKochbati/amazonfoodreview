Its allergy season which usually means large amounts of sudafed.  I don't particularly like the side affects of sudafed and have tried tons of different decongestants.  This is the first thing other than sudafed to actually work!  I have not tried it during a sinus migraine yet but for moderate congestion it works wonders.  Smells a bit off but the taste is just fine.  Make sure to seep it for 10 15 mins or it won't work.  Give it about 10 20 mins to kick in.  Seems to last for 3 4 hrs.  No side affects that I can tell.  So glad to be rid of the racing heart side affect and dry mouth  sore throat that comes with sudafed.  It works great paired with a sinus rinse or netty pot.
