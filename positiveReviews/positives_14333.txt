This is a terrific product and about as healthy as you can get.          If you're a bit ambitious you can also make your own  own rice flour at a much lower price by grinding up uncooked  own rice in a powerful blender (like a Vitamix in the dry container) until the right consistency. Use the pulse mode, however, so it doesn't get hot during the grinding process.  Can do the same with oats, white rice, whole wheat, tapioca, etc.
