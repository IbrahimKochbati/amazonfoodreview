The hot cocoa does have a sugar substitute in it, but as far as I could tell, wasn't strong enough to leave that bitter aftertaste you get when they put a lot of it in the ingredients. If you have a very very sophisticated palate perhaps you could taste it a little, but it doesn't take away from the taste of the cocoa, so as far as I'm concerned it wasn't an issue. I would say this is on par with the type of cocoa you'd get in a coffee machine, which is fine, because I don't hate coffee machine cocoa. I have only tried the peppermint so far, and it tasted like peppermint... what can I say? That's what it's supposed to taste like.
