These treats for small dogs are #1 on my dog's list of morning must haves.     She has been pestering me to give her a morning teenie chewy every day for many     months. She does not seem to tire of these unlike many treats she has tried.     I have heard that the official word is that these do not really promote good  eath.     Maybe they just limit the amount of bad  eath. Whatever. This box is a three     month supply so is a reasonably economical way to give my dog something she really likes.
