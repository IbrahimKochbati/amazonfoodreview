I guess it's a matter of tastebuds but unless this healed me for good I wouldn't drink another sip if I was paid to drink it. Okay   there might be a price that would make me drink it everyday but only one cup and the price is pretty high : ) I've tried several yogi teas and this one as well as the others are just absolutely horrible.  If I don't like something or I have an allergic reaction (which I frequently have from foods or preservatives) I usually pass it on to my mother or sister so the money isn't wasted but this, I threw away, every last package.  Another good reason for Amazon to sell food in smaller quantities. YUCK!
