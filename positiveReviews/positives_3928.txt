I was reading a news story about how lab research suggest a thyme tincture to be one of the most effective ways to fight acne (better than a prescription). I got 5 quart jars (this amount is perfect for that many), 2 cheap bottles of vodka (80 proof) filled each jar half way with thyme then topped it off with the vodka. I'm still letting it sit (it takes six weeks) before it will be complete. where I will then have to get cheese cloth and separate the thyme from the liquid and do a test run. I'll update with results mid may
