The powdered peanut butter really does taste like peanut butter, but a bit saltier.  You can change the consistency based on how much water you add, which is excellent for making peanut sauces vs peanut butter to spread on apple slices etc.  I use this powdered peanut butter for smoothies, sauces, sandwiches, and even eating it straight with a spoon.  It is more salty than I prefer, but I think most people would like that level of saltiness.  My only real complaint is that it is super expensive.  If you're using it to spread on sandwiches, it'll only last like 6 sandwiches!  That being said, I still am glad that I buy and use it.
