This is my favorite of the Mrs Bryant's apple sauces    it has a wonderful tartness that adds something special to the  pure apple taste    I have  had it cold, warm and on toast and served it with pork    and it is always a hit with everyone. I highly recommend this    although all the Mrs. Bryant's Apple Sauces are really delicious and special   this is just my personal favorite.
