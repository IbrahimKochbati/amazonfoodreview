Don't let the "Earth's Best" name fool you .. as stated in multiple reviews here   CHECK THE INGREDIENTS!  No wonder so many positive reviews here have the same theme, "My kids will only eat Earth's Best!" .. Well that's because they are all SWEETENED, which is one of the worst things you can feed to your child regularly.  They WILL develop a sweet tooth QUICKLY, and will start rejecting pure vegetables   other good things because of this.  There is no need to inject applesauce or other sweeteners into other foods.  That's just shameful, and there is only one reason for it   so the child will eat it and only want this  and.          Best advice   if you must buy pre made food, be sure the ingredients are just the main ingredient(s) and (if needed) water.  That's it.  Don't buy a vegetable that has "applesauce" or another silly ingredient added just to make the child love it and want that  and because it's sweetened.          Shame on Earth's Best as a company.  Kudos to their marketing department for creating a name whereas consumers will automatically be drawn to them because they think it's a great product based solely on the name.
