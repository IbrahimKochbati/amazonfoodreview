My vet recommended Avoderm for my dog several years ago due to the fact that he has a nail condition and could benefit from the formula this company uses for healthy skin and nails.  He is a picky eater with a sensitive stomach and we've never had any problems with this food.  I give him a mix of the vegetarian kind and the "lite" chicken and rice, both canned and dry, two meals per day.  He loves the food and at 10 1 2 years old (a large pure eed) he's healthier than he's ever been.  We've been thrilled and will never switch.
