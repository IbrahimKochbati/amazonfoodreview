This stuff is ok, not great but not bad. Trying to find anything made of real ruffle and only real truffle is futile. As far as I can tell, and from my research, no company in the world makes a truffle oil that is only made with real truffles and tastes ok. This stuff is only good for using at Olive Garden.
