My dogs eat only Blue Baffalo dry dog food. It is the best to feed your puppy or adult dog. It is very healthy and does not contain harmful preservatives that shut down body organs like most dog foods you buy in the grocery stores. I care about my babies' health, and I research the ingredients in dog foods, and this one is the best that I have came across. I recommend this product 100%. I usually purchase it at, PetSmart, but from now on, I will be buying it on line at, Amazon,com
