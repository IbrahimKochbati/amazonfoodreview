...that will take you on a short, sensory vacation.          When a family member first  ought these home, I thought the chocoloate salt combination sounded like some wacky novelty item.          My opinion changed completely when I ate this. The chocolate is delicious in its own right, and the contrasting taste and texture of the large pieces of salt make for an excellent diversion from whatever is ailing you when you sit down with a piece of it.          Try some: you won't be sorry!
