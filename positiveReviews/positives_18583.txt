Having a lactose intolerance, I've tried multiple egg proteins as well as some Whey Isolate proteins as well. This is hands down the best tasting protein powder out there. Vanilla and Chocolate are both delicious (I would stay away from Strawberry, it has a strange artificial taste to it, this was the updated formula too so they still haven't worked it out). I prefer to mix with some Vanilla Coconut milk and it's actually something I look forward to drinking (as opposed to some that I had just choked down as quickly as I could). I have also mixed in a teaspoon of cinnamon with just water and the vanilla protein and it is good as well.          Another plus is that it uses stevia instead of artificial sweeteners such as sucralose or aspartame.          If you can't handle Whey Casein protein then I would absolutely recommend this one (even if you can but want to try something else). Best bang for your buck compared to other egg proteins and the taste is actually good.
