I first discovered these as part of the fruit salad gummi mix.  When I saw these were available by themselves, I snapped them up.  They are absolutely delicious.  I've had them on my candy jar at work for four years, and people are still coming by to eat them.  The pink ones are definitely better than the white...which are way to sugary.  These are a bit more tart (but not too tart).
