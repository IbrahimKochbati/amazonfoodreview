I must admit these do work for getting your pets to take pills   2 very finicky dogs who almost always spit out their pills in any food did scarf their pills down when put in these. However, after only 2 pills (separated by 8 hours), one of my dogs (8 month old puppy) became violently ill about 2 hours after the 2nd pill pocket with numerous episodes of explosive diarrhea and vomiting (ultimately very bloody after 12 hours). It ended up costing us money for a vet visit and medicine to get the dog to get well, and a major scare that the puppy was going to die (could hardly move after 18 hrs of this). The medicine was not new, nor any thing else changed, so I presume it was due to these (certainly not going to try them again to see). Our other dog (adult) did fine, however. Maybe it should just not be used for puppies, or maybe it's just an unusual reaction, but if you google "pill pockets diarrhea", you will see this is an occasional known side effect.     Would suggest trying just one of these (or half of one) each of the first few days to make sure your pet is not intolerant of these. 1 out of 2 for me was not good odds.
