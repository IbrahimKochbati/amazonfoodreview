I drink coffee in the morning for the kick. I ordered this coffee because the low acid twist intrigued me. Promptly forgot about that aspect until it was time to reorder, which was sooner than expected because I started enjoying a second cup per day.  Yes, there's definitely something to the low acid, as my stomach can tolerate two cups per day. But, I want that second cup due to the coffee's taste!  Quite flavorful, with good depth.
