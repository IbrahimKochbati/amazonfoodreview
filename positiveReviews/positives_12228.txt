There's plenty of reviews on here talking about what the coffee is like.  Since this is subjective and you really have to try it to see if you like it, I'll talk about the quality.  There are some reviews that say they received some damages cups, torn foil, etc.  I can tell you that out of 50 cups, I received ZERO defective or damaged cups.  No problems, all 50 of them worked just fine.
