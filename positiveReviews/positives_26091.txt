My cats like this food a lot.  I am happy to give it to them because it seems to be very healthy for them.  I feed them the dry Natural Balance along with the canned which they are crazy about.  With this combination their coats are shinier and even their muscle structure is tighter and they look healthier and are doing very well.  Some former foods that I used left them always hungry.  With Natural Balance they are much more content.  As far as the cost is concerned,  I actually save money.  The food lasts longer because they eat less.  I have read this is  because they need less to meet their nutritional needs.  This does seem to be the case.  I recommend Natural Balance highly.
