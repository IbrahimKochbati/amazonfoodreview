Of all the flavors of Crystal Light, this is the flavor that no one in our family has gotten tired of.     Especially in the summer served cool it absolutely hits the spot.     Unforntunately it seems that this popularity reflects in the Amazon price, as it has become one of the more expensive Crystal Light flavors on Amazon, and after shipping there are no more savings when compared to our local markets. I used to have in as a standing order as I got a good deal on Amazon, now it is no different than the regular markets, even more expensive than the sales that markets offer.
