I wrote a REALLY long review regarding a different  and freeze dried dog food and now I'm wishing I hadn't because it probably makes this product seem not as good in comparison and nothing could be further from the truth!          When I originally read all of the reviews about this product I was a bit skeptical but VERY hopeful (despite the cost)since so many reviewers said that this was the one food that their totally picky dog would actually eat.          When I first tried giving her a nibble while out on a walk she turned her nose up at it like she does with all new things. I slowly started giving her some, mixed in with a clump of almond butter and her kibble. Eventually I got her to eat it and was happy to have something else to feed her along with the kibble and the other raw products I feed.          (I know that raw is not supposed to be mixed with kibble, but in this case I am just trying to get her to eat anything) Anyway, I continued to do this until one day she just didn't seem to want it. Finally it dawned on me that she probably JUST wanted this and nothing else and much to my surprise I was right!          She likes it so much that she will eat it without the almond butter, which is a HUGE relief to me for it's literally the FIRST and only food I've been able to skip the almondt butter with since she first stopped eating.          She will get sick of it after a few days so of course I alternate what I feed her; before she had stopped eating completely I had her on a rotation diet which I believe is better for them anyway. The only downside, of course, is the cost, especially if you have a bigger dog like I do.          It's understandable, however, since the food is imported and air dried which I imagine takes longer. I love being able to feed my dog a raw diet without the GI upset she gets with fresh raw. I finally noticed that her feces is MUCH smaller when she is on a raw only diet, and for a dog of 60+ lbs hers weren't that big to begin with.          Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I can't say how AWESOME the ZiwiPeak company is! When I first noticed and wanted to try this product I emailed them asking if I could purchase a sample anywhere. Within days I received a package of the venison product in the mail. (Their "trial size" is a good size bag!) It wasn't until after the fact that I saw that you CAN purchase that size through Amazon, and it retails for $8 $10!          Even MORE impressive to me was a few months later when I wanted to try the lamb variety. I wasn't able to find a similar trial size package of the lamb anywhere online, so I emailed them again and asked if the lamb variety was avaialble for purchase in anything smaller than the 2.2 lb bag.          Once again within a few days I receive a package in the mail from them, and this time it included a large zip lock baggie filled with the lamb variety and a scoop. Apparently they don't make the small trial bags of the lamb but that didn't stop them from sending me some! (which so far my dog seems to like!)          To put this into perspective, I have emailed other raw manufacturers asking where I can purchase sample products from, including the other company I reviewed, and many of them never even answered me much less sent me anything!          It definitely feels good to be feeding my dog something that I know she actually likes, plus feeding the benefits of a natural raw diet, PLUS a product that uses a drying process that hopefully preserves some of the natural enzymes of raw food.          Can't say enough good things about this food   if it was the ONLY food I fed my dog it wouldn't be nearly as expensive to feed her but unfortunately because of her pickiness this isn't the case.
