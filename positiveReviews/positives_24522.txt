The first order had the consistency of pureed pumpkin, like that in the individual cans that I buy (same label) from my local health food store....very good.  The second order, however, had the texture & consistency of a product to which FRUIT SUGAR or PECTIN may have been added, suggesting less quality for more profits....disappointing.  The condition of the cans on both orders has been excellent.
