I start popping a package when I can feel that wall coming on.  These are easy to open while cycling and give a decent boost within a relatively short period of time.  As always, organic is a definite positive.  Not a lot of water is needed to get these down and I haven't had any heavy stomach feelings after consuming them.  Very happy with this purchase and will get more when this case is gone.
