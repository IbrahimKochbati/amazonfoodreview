I have a Jack Russell Terrier who may be the quirkiest dog in the world. I tried giving him half of the treat and he wouldn't eat it. However, he wouldn't let go of it or let it out of his sight. I crunched it up for him on the grass and he spent about 15 minutes eating it and looking for every crumb. My dog is not a foodie so these biscuits must be good. I think that even half of the biscuit may be too big for small dogs, so just crunch them up as I did.
