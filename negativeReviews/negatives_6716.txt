In light of the glowing reviews and excellent dollar per ounce price ratio, I bought these. It shipped quickly enough, arrived in two days, and was very well packaged. (Bravo for that)          But the impressing stops here. If you are thinking these are $24 dollars for 5 lbs kind of quality, you would be mistaken. These are really $12 for 5 lbs. quality. The taste is bland and unflavorful. I should have listened to the other reviewer, who said he loves the Hapi  and but didn't like these. I, too, loves the Hapi  and, and most other Japanese  ands. These, however, just tastes like there is something missing in the flavor!          To be fair, this is exactly what it is called: peas flavored in wasabi. There is nothing wrong with the taste, but somehow, the Hapi  and just tastes so much better and more addictive. I can eat a whole small can of the Hapi ones in one sitting, once you pop one in your mouth you can't stop. But these ones are BLEGH. I don't know how I am ever going to finish that 5 lbs. bag. I had no idea how large a bag 5 lbs of peas would be, but it turns out it's about 3 macbook pros stacked on top of each other. That bag is HUGE!          Anyway, this..mundane tasting wasabi pea may be healthier and more organic, I don't know. But it most certainly won't turn any nonbeliever into fans. (And may very well turn wasabi pea addicts, e.g. me, into a nonbeliever!)
