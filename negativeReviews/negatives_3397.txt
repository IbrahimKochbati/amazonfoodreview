I was dissapointed to see this box when it arrived   right away you could tell from the wet box that the creamers had burst in transit.  Half of them were burst open, leaving the rest covered in a sticky mess.  I live in Colorado so perhaps it was due to the altitude in shipping but VERY dissapointing.  Worth the extra $$ to buy them at a local store so you know they are in good condition.
