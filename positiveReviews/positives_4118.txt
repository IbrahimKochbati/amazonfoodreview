Key lime pie is one of my all time favorite desserts. When I heard about this gum I was definitely a skeptic, I figured it'd taste more like just a standard, citrus y mint gum. I was wrong! This definitely tastes like real key lime pie filling: actual key lime flavor with a milk sweet taste that's not too overpowering. The flavor actually lasts for quite a while too (though it's much more powerful within the first 5 minutes). Try it!
