These have so far been the best option for our corgi although no replacement for  ushing teeth, our vet never seems to be able to notice :]          They are nicely textured and my dog really seems to love the way they taste.          I'm a little perturbed by the poor ratings on these treats. Like most things some common knowledge on your pet makes you a better pet owner. The reason these things have the texture is that so your dogs are encouraged to chew them.          If your dog cannot eat food without gulping it then everything can become a choking hazard.     And while I do understand the concern of concerned owners, I do not think that these are any more prone to choking than say   rawhide or a dog toy.          Please supervise accordingly.
