I am vegan and used to smoke pot and had no issues with eating stems and seeds.  I also didn't mind water with the plain hemp protein powder but this flavor made it nasty and slimy.          However, a banana and some almond milk made it taste awesome, mouth watering awesome but it is cheaper to just get the 3 lb bag IMHO.          It is healthy and wish it was more popular because maybe there would be demand for better flavor and quality but sadly, it is associated with Marijuana, the drug that is less addictive than caffeine but loaded with propaganda that make people fear using this extremely healthy food.
