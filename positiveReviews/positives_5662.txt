Talk about a versatile new product. Drink it hot on a winter morning, drink it iced on a summer afternoon, mix it with your favorite coctail, add it to a marinade, combine it with your your best herbs  I love it all! It's smooth and almost silky texture and lack of tannins make it great for anything. How has it taken so long to make it to the states!
