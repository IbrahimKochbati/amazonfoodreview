When the package says artificially flavored they really meant it.  Tastes like I'm drinking a Splenda fortified candy from the dollar store.  If you want some more unused groceries filling up your pantry these are a great buy.          If you make the coffee really strong, it'll taste a bit better but it still has the Splenda taste.
