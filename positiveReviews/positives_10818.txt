While these are a bit hard for our 17 year old (almost toothless) dog to chew, our much younger (and larger) black lab really enjoys these treats.  Lady could smell them even before I opened the bag, and she was begging for them before I got the bag opened.  Talk about an impatient dog!  These treats are hard, like a biscuit, but with a rectangle shaped (about 1 1 4" x 2"), and they're scored in the middle.  The score in the middle makes it easy to  eak in half for smaller dogs.  Those are all the reasons my dog likes these treats.          The reason I like them?  Organic ingredients make these treats healthy for my dog.  I love that I can give her a healthy treat that she loves.
