I LOVE green tea and green tea beverages. When I saw this on sale I was happy to try it. Once I received it and tasted it I was not so happy. First off tasted like the smell of dirty water. Best way I can describe it lol This has cane juice yet tastes like it doesn't have anything. Added calories for what no flavor? No Thanks. So yeah all in all pretty flavorless (beside the dirty water smell taste). Was a huge disappointment. Worse yet I bought 2 12 pk cases. Now I have to doctor the rest up. Maybe just buy some lemons and make them into a green tea lemonade? Oh well, I tried.
