I have purchased these in a can before and sometimes they seem to pick up a metal flavor.  These dolmas are amazingly yummy.  They are not packed with tons of liquid so you get a lot of product in the can.  With that in mind, a 4lb can is HUGE.  Be sure you have a plan for consumption   you do not want these beauties to go to waste.
