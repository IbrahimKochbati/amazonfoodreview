My dog usually doesn't like any type of dental chews, and all my attempts at  ushing her teeth have failed miserably.  I saw these Petrodex chews were pretty inexpensive and had good reviews, so I decided to try them out.  When I got them, I was surprised that my Boston Terrier would actually eat them.  In fact, she loves them.  Problem solved!
