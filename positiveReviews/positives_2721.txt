We live in an area that does not have a lot of stores that carry organic at reasonable prices. That said I found the product to be a good value and convenient not to have to sometimes wait for local stores to restock, if they even stocked.          Yes, some cans get dented in transit but it really was not a big problem for me. I hope the future delivery is the same or better.          It is unknown if the can lining is BPA free. I try to avoid it but until the manufactures get it out it's near impossible to buy canned goods that don't have BPA in the can lining. Pregnant women should avoid anything with BPA in it and if I had growing children I would also strive to avoid.
