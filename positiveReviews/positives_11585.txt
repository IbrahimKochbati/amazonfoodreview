i LIKE The real stuff.  This is so flavorful and REAL SYRUP.  only buy the true stuff that is regulated to not be diluted or altered.  This is real maple syrup and I love the dark amber color.  I'm now getting it shipped every month on automatic shipping.          I use this syrup in my green smoothies that I blend in my Vitamix.  Pancakes? Oh, of course I do!!!  I've used it in my marshmallows I've made (see my other reviews on the best Marshmallow cookbook I got on Amazon), the maple syrup marshmallows are to die for.          I cure and smoke my own bacon on my Weber Smoky Mountain Smoker (that I also got on Amazon) and use this syrup to cure the pork belly.  Add a bit when frying the bacon, too, for that maple goodness.          Make the best pork chops...toss a pound of chops in the nesco cooker on 250 degrees, top with a can of sourkraut and half a cup of this maple syrup and a bit of fresh black pepper.  That's it.  let it cook all day.  Ohhhhh my it's good eating.  Don't forget to make some biscuits to go with it!!!          Buy quality, this is quality and it's worth every penny.
