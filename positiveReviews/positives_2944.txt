Panda licorice is great. It is always received fresh and is much better tasting than the Red Vines or Twizzler  ands.  I highly recommend a standing order (approximately every 3 months) which reduces the overall price per box.       Amazon is a very reliable and communicative mail order company. ALOHA!
