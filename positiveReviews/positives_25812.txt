Love my Keurig Coffee Maker for convenience, but hard pressed to find a K Cup that is strong enough for my first morning cup without a bitter taste.  Tully's Italian does the job.  I drink my coffee black and like a rich coffee taste, Tully's Italian does the job. Shipment arrived promptly in good condition, although the packing box was damaged, torn and crushed.  A book was packed on the bottom without padding and was badly  uised and rumpled, but the coffee came through okay.  I complained to Amazon but never heard back from them with a sorry or offer to replace the book even though I explained it had been purchased for a gift and was now unfit to use as such.  I explained it was a poor job of packaging a soft cover book, since there was no padding or buffer under or around the book and it was jammed into the bottom of the box    Amazon never responds to complaints about damaged goods.
