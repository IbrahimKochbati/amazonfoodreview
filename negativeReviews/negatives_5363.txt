This is not a bad alternative for sensitive stomachs or for people who are overwhelmed by the acidity of coffee in general, but like the effects.  I wouldn't say that it has a robust taste, so if you're like me and like a good punch of taste first thing in the morning, this is definitely not going to hit the spot.  It advertises a more robust flavor than decaffeinated coffee, but it still doesn't compete in the flavor department with the the bolder flavors now avaialble. Like decaf, it contains a lot of sludge when you hit the bottom of the cup, but it's not strong.  The taste overall is like the weakest coffee blend you could find, so if you enjoy real french roast, this isn't even close.
