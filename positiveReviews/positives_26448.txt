I have 2 Siberian Husky puppies, now 5 months old, each weigh about 40lbs and they both have been using the C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews for over 3 months.  I've consulted with my Vet, Animal Shelter, and Obedience Trainer who trained dogs in the military for 20 years; ALL agreed that this is a good and safe product BUT like anything else you give you puppy dog SHOULD be supervised AND timed.  They also all agreed that the limit on giving these chews should be between 10 20 minutes and either taken away for future use, or the remainder thrown away.  If you are a SMART pet owner, you will be supervising the use of this product and if after 10 minutes, the product is beginning to be swallowed, I guess it makes sense to take the product away.  These work exactly for what they are intended, to reduce and remove tarter and plaque.  It is NOT a treat or toy!  As much as it CAN be digested, yes, some dogs will try to swallow too big a bite and begin to choke.  As pet owners, again, supervision is needed.  Remember, I have TWO pups, and after 15 20 minutes, all I need to say is "drop it" and they listen and do so because I am also a RESPONSIBLE pet owner and have already begun training them to listen.  If the chews aren't too badly mangled, I save for the next another day, otherwise, they get trashed.  The only other note I will also agree on is the lack of consistency in size shape of these chews.  Great product otherwise.
