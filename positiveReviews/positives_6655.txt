For years, I've been completely devoted to Dunkin Donuts  ewed at the store and at home.  I tried  ewing DD in my K cup and I also bought the Eco Brew and the actual DD k cups.  Awful!  So I was searching high and low for a new coffee.  After trying all the decaf k cups on the market, I finally found and loved Wolfgang Puck decaf coffee k cups.  This is the only place I can find them so I hope Amazon never stops selling them here.  They are mellow, medium roast and I enjoy them every day.  Any other  and is just a back up.  Try them.  I have never had any trouble with any of the cups and I'm on my third order now of 48 cups.  If they had a problem, they've fixed it.          This is an update being done on July 7, 2012.  I continue to drink at least two cups of this coffee EVERY day.  It has ruined me for other coffees as I measure every other cup against this incredible Wolfgang Puck Decaf k cup.  Please, please, PLEASE Amazon, make this part of your subscription service.  My head hurts trying to make sure that I always remember to order so as not to ever be out of this wonderful coffee.
