It is a great product. It is very nutritional and our dogs absolutely love them. My only issue is that it is outrageously expensive. It is about four times as expensive as coffee per pound, and coffee is already expensive. Liver is a very cheap meat so why $25 per pound. Our problem is our dogs will do anything to get one of these treats, so were stuck.
