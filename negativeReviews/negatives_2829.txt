I really like eggnog, especially with  andy. While the ones with  andy already in them are very good, I wanted to try this product when eggnog is usually out of season.          My experience with adding  andy to real eggnog does not create the same taste as the premixed variety. This product does not improve upon this experience.  Using a milk frother, I poured the mixture into a cup of 2% milk with about an ounce of  andy, and found that I needed about twice as much of the recommended amount of the Aspen mixture to get any eggnog flavor. The mixture will thicken in a few minutes, but the eggnog flavor is mainly sweet to me.          However, I must mention that I have no sense of smell, and therefore my experience with this product may have been largely due to my condition.
