This is a new line for Friskies and is not a "treat" as the title implies. Just another can of cat food to try! My female loves this stuff, can't wait to get it in her dish, and gets quite angry whenever she gets anything else but this or the tuna variety. My male, forget it!  He loves the shredded turkey and cheese but won't go near this one.  Weirdest thing in the world to me   thought he'd go gaga over it like he does his turkey, but he just won't touch this stuff.  Anyway, this is a bit pricey here so check around for a better price.  At least in Ohio it's a bit high!  Highly recommend!
