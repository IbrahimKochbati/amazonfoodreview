Well, I really wanted to like these but can't. The coffee itself was just ok. Faint smell of vanilla was there as was the taste. My biggest problem with these was the fact that about 1 in 4 plugged up my  ewer. I had to take out the K Cup carriage and stick a paperclip through the hole in the probe that pierces the bottom of the cup due to coffee grounds plugging it up. It seems that the built in filter in these is bad because the grounds come out and plug the machine. I have tried many other K Cups and these are the only ones that have ever done that.
