We like dark roast coffee because it has more body and tastes stronger.  This coffee is just that!  It's great that it's both organic and fair trade.  The 3 pack means you have coffee for a while, and the price is very good.  You can either recycle the can, or repurpose it around the house.  All in all, a very good deal!
