I didn't buy this so I can mix it with a liquid and create my own fat free peanut butter. I only bought this to use in green smoothies and protein shakes and for that purpose this stuff is great. I get that nice peanut butter taste added to my smoothies or my yogurt without all the extra fat and calories. I haven't bothered to try eating it plain mixed with water and don't plan to either.          I would definitely purchase it again, I am thinking of subscribing too because this price is much cheaper than any store in the area
