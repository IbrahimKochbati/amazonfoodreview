The Switch Orange Tangerine presents  an alternative to ordinary soft drinks, offering one  hundred percent of what you want in a drink and zero percent of what you don't want; or so the manufacturer claims. This is a newer  and of beverage and it follows a trend toward healthier alternatives for every day foods and drinks  a trend that has been gaining steam as more and more individuals look for ways to improve their health.          This beverage offers a taste that is refreshing, but slightly different than what I expected. Yes, you get to experience the taste of juicy oranges and tangerines, but there are other flavors present as well and I couldn't quite put my finger on these other flavors until I read the ingredients and discovered that The Switch Orange Tangerine is also made with apple and grape juices. The grape is barely noticeable, but the apple can be detected and it, along with added soy, is responsible for the interesting taste sensation that you experience in the aftertaste.          The Switch Orange Tangerine is billed as a health drink and it does, indeed, have many positive selling points in terms of composition and nutrition. There is no added sugar, no artificial colors, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. The beverage is also gluten  free and provides one  hundred percent of the USRDA for Vitamin C and twenty percent of the USRDA for Vitamin A. There is no fat and no protein, either. But there are thirty  four grams of sugars and a fairly high level of calories. Granted, these are natural sugars but thirty  four grams is still a large amount and it won't be acceptable to those on low carb diets.  And with almost seventeen calories per ounce, the caloric content is higher than that of most soft drinks.          So, are there enough reasons to make the switch to The Switch Orange Tangerine? My answer is yes, due to both its good, refreshing taste and its better than average nutritional content. It isn't the greatest tasting orange beverage I have ever tried and it is more expensive than most other drinks, including regular orange juice. But it does have enough positive points to earn it a recommendation.
