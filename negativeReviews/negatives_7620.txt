I ordered the three pack bundle on August 18, 2009 and loved it. It lasted me a long time and I drink mate almost everyday. Good taste, good sized leaves for the bombilla, organic, overall awesome stuff. However, when I ordered the 3 pack it cost me $18.28 exactly, good deal. The price now wavers around $50. What's the dealeo? I'm flabbergasted.  I was looking forward to ordering again but now I'm totally going with a better price.
