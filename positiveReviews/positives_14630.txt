These sound slightly better than they are.  They don't taste quite like regular jelly beans.  They do have a slight weird taste like most energy chews (if you have tried Chomps or Shot Bloks, you know what I mean), but they are still tasty.  It's probably good they don't taste too much like candy or I'd be bouncing off the walls after eating a bunch of them.  LOL  Worth it to try just to mix it up.
