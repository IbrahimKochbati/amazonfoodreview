I read the last few reviews indicating no dented cans and hoped for the best.  My box arrived today and I too received badly damaged, dented and unusable cans.  I'm not terribly picky but most cans are dented at the rims seams and all are badly smashed all over.  This was my last hope for canned pumpkin for my dog.  I do not believe the Amazon packaging is the problem. The cans were already dented prior to being shrink wrapped.  I do not believe stores would put these cans on their shelves and I would never buys cans with this much damage. I have never been unhappy with an Amazon purchase, but this product was a waste of my time.
