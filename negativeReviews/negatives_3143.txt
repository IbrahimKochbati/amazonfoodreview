I was so disappointed in this coffee. I guess I was fooled by the "Oooh it's more expensive than the others, there must be something special to it! I have to try it once!"I never get taken in by price!! There was absolutely nothing to it that was any better than other K cups from other  ands that sell Colombian coffee. Don't waste your money on it, not worth it...
