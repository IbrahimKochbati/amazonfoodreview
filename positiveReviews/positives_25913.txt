I've been to hell and back with a cat that hates drinking water. In the beginning my cat liked tap water, then only drank bottled water, and now refuses to drink it at all. I thought about investing in a cat water fountain but didn't want to spend the money on the fountain or the replacement filters. I read online that many cats enjoy cat sip and thought I'd give it a try...my cat went to it as soon as he saw me pouring the cat sip out of the paper pouch and started drinking right away...he's drinking it right now as I'm writing this review! My cat hasn't been drinking water for about a week. I switched him over to wet foods but didn't think that was enough, and this is perfect to keep his eyes and heart healthy, plus keep him hydrated!
