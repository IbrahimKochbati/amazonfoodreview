I think I might have tried Shake 'n Bake once when I was a kid. I didn't remember whether it was good. I was expecting this to be terrible. Suprisingly, it's actually very good, and a nice change of pace from the plain pork chops that we usually fry without seasoning. The Shake 'n Bake  eading is pleasantly mild, not overly salty or strongly seasoned as I expected it to be. Just be sure you bake the chops enough. We had to bake them an extra five minutes, otherwise they came out somewhat soggy, although they still tasted fine. Putting the Shake 'n Bake on the chops is easy. You dump the packet of S&B into a large ziplock bag, lightly wet the chops with water, and then shake each chop in the baggie. Then you put the chops in the oven for 20 minutes (15 was not enough) and don't turn them, leave them on one side. The pork comes out nicely cooked and the  eading is tasty. Shake 'n Bake is a good product and an inexpensive way to introduce variety to your suppers when you use pork chops and cutlets. We will probably try the S&B packets for chicken and other meats too.
