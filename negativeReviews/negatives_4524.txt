What HAPPYBABY needs to realize is that when you have a steady customer base, you should not change the recipe of a product!  My daughter loved this original recipe, but this recipe is COMPLETELY different.  I tried giving it to her 3 times   she refused to eat it.  I then blended it with chicken  oth and she does eat it now, so it turned out to be a texture thing.  HOWEVER, the whole reason that I purchase products such as these are for the convenience of having an organic product that can travel easily   so it is very impractical for me to travel with chicken  oth and a blender!  I'll be cancelling my subscribe and save subscription to this product.
