I always liked Orange Crush when I was a kid.  Sure, it was just sugar water with some flavoring, but it was really good flavoring...except it had a chemical whang and an aftertaste that you just had to accept.          Well, no more.  Switch Orange Tangerine drink is NOT sugar water.  It's 100% juice, the good stuff, and it's lightly carbonated, not overcarbonated like those sugary soft drinks either.  And no chemical whang!  And no aftertaste!          Vitamin C and no added sugar?  I'll take that.  Of course there's sugar content, but it's just the natural sugar that comes in the juice.  Why didn't people think of this stuff when I was a kid?
