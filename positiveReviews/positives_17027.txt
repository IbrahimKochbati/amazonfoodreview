I heard the inventor on a local radio station one day Talking about her Boston terrier who tore up all his toys and she said that's why she invented this. I was a little unsure that this would keep my little # 3 BT  busy, but it does. It also keeps #2 BT busy, but #1 BT just wants you to shake the treats out. The only problem I have is finding treats small enough to work in it. Sometimes I just put their dog food in it and they still love to play with it. I definitely would recommend this dog toy to anyone who very active dogs it does keep them busy.
