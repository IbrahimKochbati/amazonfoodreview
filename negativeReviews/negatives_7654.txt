Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are indeed soft. Individual wrapping of each cookie ensures that they stay soft and fresh until your are ready to eat them. Unfortunately, they are very bland tasting, which is a surprise for Quaker products. I wouldn't buy them if you expect a flavorful cookie. So you trade soft and fresh for flavorful. So if you are looking for cookies that excite your taste buds, I'm afraid you will have to look elsewhere.
