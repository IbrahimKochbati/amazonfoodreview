I ordered this to use with my Whirley Pop and I absolutely love it.          This pouch has a bit more stuff in it than the standard single serve pouch from Wabash Farms (8oz vs 5.5oz) so I expected some unpopped kernels and indeed ended up with a few dozen.          I have only popped one pouch so far so I plan to leave it on a few more seconds next time around, but even with the remaining kernels, the Whirley Pop was totally stuffed with popcorn.          The popcorn is delicious and tastes exactly like super fresh movie theater popcorn. The salt in the pouch gave the popcorn the perfect amount of saltiness for my tastes, but it may be a bit salty for some.          I'll probably stick with the 6oz version even when I reorder, as it's only a $2 difference (as of 08 13 09).
