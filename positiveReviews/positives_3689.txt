Prior to switching to Newman's Own Organics Dog food, my 4 year old shih tzu was crunching on Iams. Which was fine, except that every 2 3 months or so he'd have stomach problems. After switching, his poops have been firmer, no stomach issues in sight, AND his coat has gotten glossier (and much less flaky). Duncan likes his new food and so do I!
