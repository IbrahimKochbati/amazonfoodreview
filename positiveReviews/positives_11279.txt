I just started "officially" collecting hot sauces   extracts this year...2010. Although I just started collecting as a "hobby", I've been a fan of hot foods for decades. Plus, I've grown many different peppers including but not limited to jalape&ntilde;o, Cayenne, and Haba&ntilde;ero.          I thought I knew "hot"...until I tried "The Source Collectors Extract". This extract is rated at a nuclear 7,100,000 Scoville Heat Units (SHU)!! I've tried it both as a food additive and directly on my tongue (DO NOT TRY THE LATTER). This stuff is the hottest of ANY sauce   extract I've ever had...and I've had a lot. There has been a few close seconds but they just didn't quite have the same peak heat or staying power. "The Source" is hot instantly and you think, "WOW, this IS HOT", but then it creeps up on you even more until your reaching for some milk...ice cream...water...anything to make it stop!!!          This is my personal favorite and I highly recommend "The Source" to anyone who is a true hot pepper enthusiast.          Five Stars!!!
