I have purchased these chunks from Amazon for several years since most local groceries no longer carry the chunks.  I've been happy with the price and service but I noticed they have halved the size of the case and it is nearly the price of a case of 12 a year ago.  I'm not blaming Amazon for the change  I'm blaming the company for poor customer service.  What used to cost around $28 is now over $40.  Shame on you Baker's!
