okay, it's freeze dried liver cube lets.  my common sense tells me that for a lot less than the price of this treat i could buy real liver, cube it and freeze it.  it would serve the same purpose for a lot less money, and it would not be over processed.     that said, our dog would do back flips for this treat, so if you're made of money, go ahead.  you'll make your dog's day  : )
