The Switch Kiwi Berry tastes metallic and fake.  Neither my wife nor I could finish off the can because the flavor was so off.  The Watermelon Strawberry flavor was much better.  I couldn't identify any kiwi flavor at all, and the berry flavor did not taste like any berry I have ever eaten.  In fact, strawberry is the very last of the juice concentrates listed.  They mixed apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry and strawberry juices together.  I think having just one juice flavor would have been better because this mix was just bizarre.  Also, the drink contains 135 calories per 8.3 ounce serving.  At that rate, I'd rather have a Coke if I want carbonation or regular juice if I want something fruit flavored.
