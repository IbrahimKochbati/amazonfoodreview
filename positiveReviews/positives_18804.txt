I have 2 rescued MiniPoodles: Leo and Shannon.  When I initially got them it was obvious Shannon had severe allergies, which in turn limited both the FOOD and the cookies I could give her.  I read labels and searched all over for treats for these 2 pups.     Then I found these cookies, which they love and are both safe for them and they "appear" to be tasty.     I am thrilled to find them on Amazon as they are NEVER in stock at the store...once more AMAZON SCORES!
