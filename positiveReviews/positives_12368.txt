Actually pretty good, lots of noodles, good quality.  I like the noodles in the cup version [Hot and Spicy] a little better, they're more flavorful, but these were very good too.  I only put in about 1 3rd of the soup base packet, I do not like over spiced soups, and it was fine to me.          Overall, I'd recommend the same company's soup cup, vs this bowl.  Easier to eat at work.  When I was carrying this bowl from the kitchen area back to my desk, I spilled a little on my palm, since it's harder to control than the cup.
