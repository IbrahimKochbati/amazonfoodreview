I was discouraged when this seasoning was discontinued by Nantucket Off Shore.  I searched for it on many websites and finally found it on Amazon.com.  They only offered it in lots of six tins.  However, it is so good, that I was willing to buy six containers of it.  It is in sealed tins, so I suspect it has a long shelf life.  The mixture of herbs and spices is simply perfect for turkey and chicken.  When I have a chicken roasting, the aroma is out of this world, but the taste is even better.  It is the best I have ever used in my 46 years of cooking.
