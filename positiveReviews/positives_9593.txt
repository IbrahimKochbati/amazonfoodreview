I love this popcorn seasoning and it was cheaper to order through Amazon than to buy thru the local grocery store that charges $2.58 a bottle and is usually out of the product for weeks at time.  My only disapointment was that one of the bottles was  oken when it arrived. Usually items ordered from Amazon are well padded to prevent  eakage but this time there were none of the little airbags that give that extra padding. Still, I would order the product again.
