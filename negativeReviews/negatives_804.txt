I ordered this specifically b c they said "dark chocolate" so i was hoping for a rich chocolate flavor. They taste very watery, even using the lowest amount of water on the Keurig. The nutritional fact show that it only has 6 grams of sugar   where the normal store bought powder has 22 grams. I didn't like these at all. If you're going for something low sugar, they might be for you!
