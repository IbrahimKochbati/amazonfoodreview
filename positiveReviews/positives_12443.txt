This is a fantastic product. I actually like it a little better than McCann's 5 minute steel cut oats, which are also great. I agree the price is too high, considering that I bought the same bag for a third of the price at that discount store others have mentioned! I hope they still carry it the next time I go  I will stock up! :)
