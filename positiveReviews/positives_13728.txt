I am in love with this hazelnut spread made with skim milk and cocoa.  Grownups and kids both enjoy and it's a nice way to get picky eaters to consume whole grain  eads.  Don't let the healthy  eakfast commercials fool you, there is a ton of sugar in the recommended serving size.  My answer to that is that I don't indulge in the recommended serving size of two tablespoons.  You can get by with less and it's still a tasty way to start the day.  I am hooked on this stuff and my local market doesn't always have it in stock.  I went to two stores that didn't have it and resolved to buy it here on Amazon.  Big jar, twice the size of the tiny ones at my local stores.  It should last me a while but next time I'm ordering double jar package!
