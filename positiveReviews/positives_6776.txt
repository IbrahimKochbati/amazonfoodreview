When it comes to flavors in a good cup of espresso coffee, it is all in the way how the beans are roasted.  The robust flavor of this coffee should make the most desiring espresso lovers proud. And it has a little secret, which most of us Italians wouldn't admit in public, it is decaffeinated.  Wow, a double whammy.  I've been using this coffee for several years now and no other decaf pre ground coffee comes close.
