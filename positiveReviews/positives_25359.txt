I agree that there's a problem with the chews not all being equal size.  But in our family, that's not a problem.  All bags of chews, no matter the  and, seem to have this issue...thick and thin together...but we just use it to our advantage.  We have 2 dogs: the one we raised from a pup likes a big, thick chew, the other is older and a rescue, and though we take him to the dentist regularly, his teeth are just very sensitive so the smaller chews work out great for him.  The ones in the middle they share equally.          Another thing, each chew is coated differently.  The smaller more wrinkled up chews have more of it than the thicker chews which have a smoother surface.  But our boys don't seem to notice these small differences and we're happy as long as they're happy.  In fact, one of the best parts of our evening is watching them settle down beside each other, each with their respective CET chew, engaged in knawing away the time.          Is CET messing with the consumer by not correctly sizing their chews 100%?  I dunno.  But they are without a doubt the favorite treat in this household and we'll keep buying them here since we can't find a better price elsewhere!
