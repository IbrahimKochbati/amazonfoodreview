My dog will eat a lot of different treats, but it usually takes her a while to warm up to a new one.  When a new treat is introduced to her, she normally acts like she's holding out for something "better" and will try to wait me out.          When I gave her one of the Newmans Own "cookies", she grabbed it right away.  These treats are VERY hard.  After reading the reviews, I watched her while she tried to eat it.  Her first attempt didn't  eak into the treat at all and she had a strange look on her face.  She dropped the treat and immediately picked it back up and bit harder.  She loves the treats and now knows it takes more jaw power to eat these than it does her other treats.          I definitely wouldn't recommend these to somebody for a puppy, old dog with weak teeth, or a small dog (my dog is about 28 pounds and did fine).  I have to give it a 5 star rating just because of her immediate love for them, even though I can understand other dogs could possibly have issues.
