This tea punches you in the nose and then dances on your tongue.          Open the can to a strong and distinctive bergamot aroma. The flavor is less intense. Well balanced and complex but still hearty with a wonderful lingering aftertaste.          I love that you can  ew the same leaves multiple times, it increases the value. I can usually  ew this tea 4 times before it gets too weak.          They recommend a 4 minute  ew time which I've found to be too strong the first  ew. I usually go 3min 4min 4min 6min on my first through fourth  ewing.          That's just what works for me.
