We've been drinking this tea for about 2 years.  It has a very mild taste  much like regular Lipton tea bags.  When I make Iced tea, I use 2 bags of this and 4 bags of Lipton for 6 quarts of water.  Makes delicious tea.  The herbalist told me it is very healthy to drink  has iron as well.  My kids love it too as hot tea or iced tea.  This is not a raspberry flavored tea.  It is from the leaves, so you'll need to look elsewhere if you are looking for flavored tea. I like that there are no strings to deal with  or individual wrappers to peel off, just throw the whole bag in.
