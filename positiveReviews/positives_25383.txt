Our dogs have been using this product for about a year now.  We use to buy them from our vet until they didn't have the large size one month and I check Amazon and I've been ordering them from Amazon ever since (cheaper too).  The vet had been after me to have the dogs teeth cleaned but now marvels at how clean my 10 year old Fox Terrier's teeth have become... and our two year old golden retriever's are the same.  Give them one a day (the large size cut in half) in the morning after they eat.
