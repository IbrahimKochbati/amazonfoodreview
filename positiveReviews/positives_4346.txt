I love the light texture and the taste kind of reminds me of chex cereal which is a good thing. It makes a great snack, I use Laughing Cow cheese wedges spread it on and lay down some spinach or radishes with smoked sardines or tuna. Delicious! Or instead of using a crostini to make  uschetta, I use these crackers. And if I'm too lazy to make stuff, I just snack on it by itself.
