Good product for a low acid coffee.  Puroast is a smooth, even bodied  French Roast with an excellent coffee aroma.  I drink a lot of coffee and have tried literally hundreds of different types of coffees and coffee  ands, and Puroast definitely uses quality coffee beans.  You do lose some taste, bitterness and acidity (which I enjoy) with this low acid coffee, and if I had to compare Puroast to Starbucks, Dunkins' or most standard roast gourmet coffee  ands, Puroast would fall short.  Also, the coffee beans were ground, so you won't get that super fresh small batch coffee taste you find in some gourmet coffees, but the beans were not stale tasting either (freshness was similar to drinking ground coffees found in supermarkets).  Definitely not an exceptional coffee, but a good tasting, quality option for coffee lovers looking for a low acid alternative.
