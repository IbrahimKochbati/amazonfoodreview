I've always liked Salt and Vinegar chips but most of the time the stronger flavor was at the bottom of the bag. Not with these, the vinegar is overflowing right from the first chip and doesnt stop until you've finished the bag. These are very addictive. If you like salt and vinegar, these are the ultimate chips. Nothing else compares.
