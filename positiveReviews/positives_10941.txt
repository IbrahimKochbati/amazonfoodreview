.. it did NOT come in a four pack.. there were two..          But as for the product it rocked, seemed fresh smelled strong, almost like I couldn't stomach it. But it tasted great and seemed to mellow me out and make me fall asleep easy. That is what I was going for.          Fyi ... by the directions you can make six to twelve cups, times the two bags you get about 14 cups. So it's a decent price in the warehouse..
