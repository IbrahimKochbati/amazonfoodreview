I was very excited to get some hot chocolate cups for my Keurig and even happier there was a variety pack.  I read the reviews and even there were some negative ones, I went with it anyways.     I tried the milk chocolate.  It has such a weird taste to it.  But I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried another later that night.  Same weird aftertaste.  I asked my husband to try it to make sure my taste buds weren't off. He commented that it had a "hot plastic y" aftertaste to it.  Not even worth drinking.  Too bad I have 34 more cups that will go to waste.
