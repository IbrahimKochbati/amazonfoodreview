I have already communicated with the See's company about my disappointment in the item they sell as truffles.  My definition of Truffles and See's are not the same.  The candy they sent was delicious and I ate it all, but it was not what I expected i.e. round chocolates filled with various flavors of chocolate ganache.  The item See's sells as truffles was a box of assorted soft centered chocolates of various shapes.  I may buy other candy from See's in the future, but certainly not truffles.
