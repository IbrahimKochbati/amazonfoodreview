I am very involved with dog rescue   in fact I am a founding board member of a large and active rescue group that adopts 500 or more dogs per year while keeping very high standards with the placement standards.  We (as a dog rescue) have used Canidae for years and recommended it to many adopters, but recently we (personally) have seen problems with our dogs', as well as dogs throughout the rescue, stools.  We have had many cases of serious diarrhea, and when talking to local Veterinarians we use, have found that many have seen recent issues with Canidae causing their client's dogs to have similar diarrhea as we have experienced.  I know Canidae has in the past changed their formula causing problems and it appears to have happened again.  It is a shame because we have had good success with the food, but we (both personally and as a dog rescue) will no longer use this product.
