I've been using this all natural cat food for a few years when I could afford it but didn't think to shop where I buy my books.  With free shipping I only wish Amazon offered a few more flavors.  Since many commercial cat foods are made with Grade D mest (not fit for human consumption) I am delighted to have this choice.
