I enjoyed the taste... It is close to orange soda initially but then there is another sweet taste at the end of each sip.  But unlike orange soda, this is healthier and no added sugars.  Even though this product tastes like orange soda I think it would do well for  eakfast.  It may even become preferred over traditional orange juice for children and for businesses that worry about short shelf life.  On the downside, the price is a little high for such a small can when buying 24.
