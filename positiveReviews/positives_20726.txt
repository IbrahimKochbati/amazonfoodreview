These are such cute cupcake toppers!  I was a little surprised, as they appear to be made of a thick paper, which is great  so much better than plastic.  I am using them for the cupcakes at my son's preschool Halloween party, and I love that they're unique and not scary.  Some of the little ones don't like spiders and such  also safe.  The sugar sample is convenient too!  Instead of going through the hassle of adding food coloring to the frosting, I can just sprinkle some colored sugar on top.  Great item.  I recommend.
