If you like green tea that  ews for 2 minutes max and you do not "stew" your tea by just leaving the bag in until the tea is bitter, this is the tea for you! Of course, it can be done that way, but IF you have refined tea taste, then you will like this tea. I, personally, love the taste of a good green tea. I am so glad to find this  and available online. No one sells it in my area.
