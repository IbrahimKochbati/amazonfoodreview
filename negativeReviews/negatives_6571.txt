This Quaker instant oatmeal tastes good, however in order to truly feel like you have had a fulfilling meal, you need at least two of the packets as a serving. I  ought this to work so I would have something to eat when I forgot to  ing my  eakfast in. It is a little dry and the consistency is like that of paste, so I tend to add a little half and half just before serving to make it a little creamier.          It is okay in a pinch, but not something that I would want to consume on a daily basis.
