I have been trying to lose those last 10 pounds that are so hard.  I had heard about raspberry ketones on Dr. Oz and had a couple friends taking them with success.  I have used African Mango in the past and had success with that so I thought I would try something that had both in it.  This product also has green tea, acai, caffiene, apple cider vinegar and a couple other things.  So far, it seems to be working.  It gives me extra energy with the caffiene and I've lost about 5 lbs in 2 weeks.
