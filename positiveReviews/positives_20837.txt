My dog loves this food and it has really cut back on the tear staining issues.  The staining was a big problem and I did quite a bit of research to find a solution. I considered a few products that you add to the dog food or come in pill form and several of these apparently  work however many of them are actually antibiotics I am not sure it is a good idea to use very often.  My research  led me to antioxidants (like blueberries) and avoiding wheat to cut back on the tear stains and give him a healthier coat. This food is not only grain free but is also loaded with blueberries.          Yes, the first ingredient is potato however in FirstMate's defense, most companies include several non protein ingredients so that they can put them lower down on the list thus making it look like there is more protein than anything else.  Also, meat "meal" is a much more concentrated protein than regular meat (somewhere in the range of 300% more concentrated).
