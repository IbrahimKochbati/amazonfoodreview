Admittedly I normally would only use  eading or flour for my chicken, but that gets messy (what with the eggs and frying and such) and during the summer I had a handful more mouths to feed with my siblings inviting their friends over to eat every other night.  So for me Shake 'n' Bake, which I haven't had since I was at least 10 years old, was the perfect solution.          I do however caution that while this worked perfectly well with the full sized chicken  easts, everyone seemed to prefer it more when the chicken was pounded thin.  The chicken came out juicier and less dry and the coating wasn't overwhelmingly salty.          As a test group I had three 20somethings (not including myself) and two teens, and made the Shake 'n' Bake with both regular sized  easts and thin cutlets.  Excluding the time it took for me to butterfly the chicken  easts, it took maybe ten minutes total to coat the chicken to our liking and pop it in the oven.  The packaging says to cook the chicken for at least 15 minutes at 425, but I found that cooking it for 20 minutes, and letting it rest for an additional 5 minutes, worked out perfectly.          The only complaint received was the saltiness, I didn't season the chicken beforehand (for obvious reasons) and pretty much everyone had assumed I did because the coating was salty.  Point of interest, my sister made a Honey Dijon mustard sauce to dip the chicken into and the coating worked perfectly with that, balancing out some of the sweetness of the honey Dijon.
