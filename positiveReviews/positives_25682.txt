This is a great low fat snack that I eat between lunch and dinner almost every day. It has a good flavor and fills me up after just a few pieces. Buying them in bulk like this has saved me a lot of money versus buying them one or two at a time from the grocery store, and the free shipping to my door is a wonderful perk.          I do wish there was a little more seasoning on the pretzels, something between these nibblers and the "pieces" would be my ideal amount of seasoning, but that would add to the fat content. Other than that, I don't have any complaints.
