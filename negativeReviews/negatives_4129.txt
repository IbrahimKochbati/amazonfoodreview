This product is great if you like the particular spices used in the mix.  Unfortunately, although I am drinking it, I am not enjoying it as the flavors just don't jive with my palate.  If you really like the spice combination (I like cinnamon, for example, in almost everything, but in the chocolate mix it just doesn't make it for me), you'll love it.  I guess my advice is the product is fine if you like the flavor combination, but I would advise trying the mix in a small packet to determine whether or not it's for you.  I have this huge quantity to consume, and I rarely partake of it as I don't really care much for it.
