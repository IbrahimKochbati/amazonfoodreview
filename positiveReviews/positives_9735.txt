One of my most favorite things about my dog is that she loves me.  She'd follow me anywhere.  So when I go to leave for work in the morning, she gives me this look like I'm  eaking her heart and all my promises to be a good dog owner...until I give her a pupperoni.  Now, the last thing I do each time I hit the  icks is whip out a 'roni and my dog can't wait to see me go!
