I love fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. Most grapefruit drinks just don't taste like the real thing. I saw a 6 pack of San Pellegrino Pompelmo at the local Fresh Market and thought I'd give it a try. After having several cans, I have to say it is terrific. It is made with 16% grapefruit juice and, unlike most other grapefruit drinks, has a genuine grapefruit flavor. If you like their Limonata and also like grapefruit juice, I think you will enjoy this.
