I bought two of these in med lg along with Smarter Pets IQ Treat ball.  My well mannered collie mix needed company while I ran errands so we adopted a  other for him.  And this husky mix  other needed something ELSE to keep him from destroying my house (they aren't crated.... we tried with the husky but he escaped out of several different crates).  These toys, along with a peanut butter filled kong, are magnificent at distracting them while I'm away.          The tug a jug is my least favorite.  It is difficult to fill   filling is easy enough but kibble tends to dribble out as you TRY AND TRY AND TRY to match the threads and close the toy back up.  I can't emphasize how frustrating it is to close up this toy!!!          My dogs, while very rough with each other, are not rough on toys inside.  They tend to be mellow.  This toy seems to require a dog who is eager to thrash and bash the toy.  I think my dogs might be more inclined to shake it had I bought the small size.  The med lg is VERY big.  My dogs are BIG.  Not st. bernard big   but my husky mix is my tallest dog at 60lbs (frame size is that of my old 95lb malamute, he's just a year old and hasn't filled out yet!) and my golden collie mix is 75 lbs and on the large side for a golden retriever.  Also, it holds LOTS of food.  Since the kibble in the toy is a supplement to their meals I only put a half a cup in it.  I haven't measured how much it holds but it must hold upwards of 3 or 4 cups.  When it is filled less the dog must work MUCH harder to get the kibble out.  I only use this toy when I plan to be away from home for more than 3hrs.          They DO manage to empty them by carrying them upside down   and really only the husky has a large enough mouth to manage this.  They kick some out of it as they would their treat ball.  It takes them forever which suits my purpose of distracting them from my absence.          All in all, it is well constructed.  My dogs would never be able to open this.  If your dog likes to shake his toys like a wolf and his prey this toy might be a wonderful choice.  If your dogs save rough play for outdoors and you plan to provide this as an indoor diversion you MIGHT want to look elsewhere.  And keep in mind the large scale this toy is made on!!
