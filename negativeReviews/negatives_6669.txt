I used this marinade exactly as the instructions say on the label.  I marinated two pounds of chicken  east, chopped up for couscous.  Now I will admit that the marinade smells amazing when you open the bottle, but it left me disappointed.  There is so much liquid smoke in this marinade, that my chicken ended up tasting like a chicken flavored ash tray.  Perhaps if I had used a smaller amount it would have worked out better?  I don't know.  I think perhaps the company needs to modify their cooking instructions.
