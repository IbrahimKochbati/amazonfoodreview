As soon as I opened the teabag envelope, the smell was truly Divine Nasal Candy : ).  As good as the bag and the lingering scent on the envelope smelled, the tea proved to be rather bitter.  I may have steeped it too long, so will see if the bitterness abates steeping less.  However, as I prefer milk or cream products in flower teas, the bitterness was soon dispelled with a little soy creamer and an enjoyable cup was had.  Lychee is truly a wonderful flavor for tea.  I suspect the flowers added to this lychee tea may contribute to the bitterness in the straight tea.  Will definitely reorder.
