This is the fourth different type of coffee I have tried with my Keurig coffee maker. At this point, it is tied for my favorite with Starbuck's vanilla coffee (I use the attachment for ground coffee to  ew this).          Is this peoduct extra bold? It certainly has a smoother taste than that of some of the other coffees that I have tried. It does not have the acidic edge that another company's product manifests.          One of the nice things about a Keurig machine is that  through outlets such as Amazon  one can experiment with a variety of  ands and tastes to find what works best for one. And this Newman's Own K cup is a highly successful experiment!
