My 12 year old mixed  eed dog began to have itchy skin  and she would scratch until she had bald spots.  I took her to the vet and he said it was allergies. He thought it was something that I had bathed her in, but the problem persisted. I had also noticed that her  eath and fur had started to stink really bad. I thought it was her age though and didn't realize the two problems were related.  I've been giving her this food for just over a week and I already see an improvement.  Within a day or two, she began to smell much better. She has scratched some but it is so much better than it was. After only a week, she seems healthier and she is looking younger. Other people have even noticed the change.  I am hopeful that with a little more time that her itchy skin will heal completely. I just ordered a larger bag from Petco because it was a few dollars cheaper than amazon and they have free shipping for a limited time.
