I ordered this after reading other reviews and I'm so glad I     did. I use it for everything! On pancakes and waffles, on my favorite     salmon recipe, to sweeten my oatmeal. Grade b has more vitamins and minerals     that are good for you. My only complaint is with the container, it's so messy; you always will     have to clean it after every use. Anyways I order one bottle of syrup from Shady Farms which bottle     seems to perform better and after I finish it I will be putting my Coombs syrup in it! Shady farms is overpriced in my     opinion and Coombs Organic tastes great.
