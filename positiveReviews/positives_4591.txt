Perhaps some of you are like I was... wanting to take advantage of the health benefits of oatmeal, but uncertain how to prepare it so that you and your family will actually eat it. After experimenting a bit, and reading lots of recipes, I've come up with a simple, yet tasty way to prepare McCANN's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal. Give it a try, and you may decide that oatmeal can be a healthy and delicious addition to your  eakfast menu.          Recipe:            Start by  inging 3 cups of water to a boil (about 3 minutes in the microwave).       In a medium saucepot, melt 1 tablespoon of butter then add 1 cup of oats. Toast the oats on medium heat for about 3 minutes.       Add the boiling water to the toasted oats and simmer for 25 minutes. Don't stir. It should get to a soft bubbling simmer.     If it boils to hard, you stove is set too hot, so turn it down or it will burn.       Add 1 cup of milk (or can do with a mix of milk and buttermilk).       Cook an additional 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.          Makes 4 5 good size servings with excellent texture and consistency. It thickens once it sits a little bit. You can increase or decrease the milk to adjust the consistency as desired. You can also save it for up to a week in the refrigerator without much difference in taste. Just store in small sealed bowls. Each can of McCANNs oatmeal makes about 16 20 servings.          Everyone likes to top and sweeten their oatmeal differently (sugar,  own sugar, maple syrup, raisins, etc.). Only add the toppings when you're ready to eat it, not before storing in the refrigerator. For my serving, I like to add 2 tsp of  own sugar, a sprinkle of cinnamon, about 1 2 tbsp of butter, and then top with chopped pecans. Very tasty. Hope you enjoy!
