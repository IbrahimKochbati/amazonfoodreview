These tinnie greenies make the perfect "out the door"  ibe for my Cavlier King Charles Babies. I think they almost look forward to me going to work now.  Barkley is 21 lbs & Gypsy is 18 so while they are a bit larger than the recommended size for the product it really works out perfectly helping keep the pounds off.          Having shopped around, you are saving about ten dollars by ordering from Amazon rather than going into a big box pet store.
