I love steak, although I don't eat it all that often anymore. When I do have a steak, though, I absolutely love the taste of A1, which  ings out the best in any cut of meat. Although I am not too enthusiastic about putting it on seafood (which the label suggests as a good idea), I think it goes well with any kind of beef, and works well on chicken and turkey as well. It is an essential ingredient in many marinades, and is generally one of the most used items for meat preparation in my refrigerator.          What many people don't realize is the long and noble history of A1, which dates to 1824. In 1824, when a king's palate reigned supreme, Henderson William Brand, chef to England's King George IV, created a sauce for King George for use on meats. King George was so impressed with it that he proclaimed it "A1," and that's how the sauce got its name.          Beyond the history lesson, though, I think King George was correct in his gustatory proclamation: this sauce really is "A1"!
