These were amazing candies. I'm very picky about jelly beans and I'm often afraid to invest in experimentation but I love honey so much that I had to try these. The different flavors vary in the prevalence of honey flavor (surprisingly I found that the honey one had a very mild flavor) but they are all delicious. They also had a good texture with a coating that was not too hard or too thick.
