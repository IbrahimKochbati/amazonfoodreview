This is definitely too strong if you make one glass from one K cup. I've experimented. Now I run two K cups through the large cup  ew three times each. I add each cup to a pitcher. Then I add enough water to fill my three quart pitcher. I sweeten it with Stevia, and add juice from one lime. Great iced tea!
