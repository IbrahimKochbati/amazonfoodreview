I used to be a strictly "morning coffee" person. NOT ANYMORE. Coming from TN AL, I only drank tea in good 'ole Southern style: ICED and SWEET. But I jumped off the java wagon to try this as I love mandarin oranges and thought it sounded good. Well it's not good...it's WONDERFUL! Some days, I find myself having 2 or 3 cups; a couple in the morning and one at bedtime. The taste is perfectly blended with all 3 flavors equally represented. A bit sweet so some folks might even be able to enjoy it straight up. All in all, this is the best K cup of ANY kind I've had thus far.
