Beautiful plants, great value, well cared for and packaged perfectly. The only thing I would include in the future is care instructions. I'd like to know how they are cared for by the seller so that I can continue the care at home. Some people mist these plants while others soak them in a bowl of water; which method do these prefer? I will be making this my exclusive go to guy gal for ordering these plants and others in the future. Super impressed! Thank you.
