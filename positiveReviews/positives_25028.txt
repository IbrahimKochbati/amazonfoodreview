My husband and I have enjoyed good coffee for over 25 years.  We're always trying new coffee and our favorite bean has been Sumatra up until now.  We tried Zoka's Colonel Fitzroy a couple month's ago and immediatley decided it was our new favorite.  It's similar to a Sumatra, but has a hint of chocolate unertones.  I love it because I can drink it black.  It has no bitter aftertaste.  Drinking coffee black allows the rich sweetness to resonate and means no calories.  Making it a keeper for sure!
