Our pups go nutty when we  eak out the Greenies.  They can hardly perform their requested tasks for the treats because they're just too excited.  They're a bit expensive for our budget right now, but when we can afford it, we really like to get these for them.  Keeps their  eath very clean smelling and they really just... love love love their Greenies!
