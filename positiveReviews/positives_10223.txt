Because our dog is on 5 pills a day, down from 7, these pill pockets have been a lifesaver for us.  The dog loves them.  I was hesitant to try them given the one review about being distrustful of their composition so  I bought some from vet and used them side by side with ones from Amazon as a test.  I can find no evidence that these aren't genuine.  They are flexible, and the dog makes no distinction between vet's and Amazon's. We use a lot of these given number of daily pills consumed, and every package I've purchased has been fine. We purchase the large capsule size because some of dog's pills are quite large and then just pull off pieces of the pocket for the smaller pills.  I'll continue to buy them on line because of the difference in price with vet and because I can order in the middle of the night if necessary.
