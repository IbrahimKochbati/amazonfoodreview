I just recently got a Keurig machine and I have tried out many different coffees. I have tried different  ands and different flavors, and this one has by far been one of my favorites. I don't always like flavored coffees because I often find them to be overpowering in their smell or taste....but this one is just right. It smells great and the flavor is smooth and tasty. I was expecting not to like it before I tried it because I am not usually a fan of flavored coffees, but I was so pleasantly surprised with this one. I love it! I went through the first box very fast because I couldn't stop drinking it, so I had to buy more. It is one of my new favorite coffees and I am so glad to have found it!
