This is a great coffee  ewer. Makes coffee quick and hot... no more stopping and buying a cup on the way to work and no more 1 2 pots of coffee dumped down the drain because too much was made. I have been using my  ewer daily, before most people ever heard of them... my unit is ~ 6   7 years old and works flawless all the time. Thank you Green Mountain Coffee Roasters who makes these units! Bought one for my sister and her husband... works perfect for them too. Highly recommended!
