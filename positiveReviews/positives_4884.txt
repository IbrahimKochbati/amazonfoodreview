Speaking as another Texan, I think the first rule for these delicious treats is to NOT order them during spring or summer. In fact, your safest bet is to ONLY order them in the dead of winter.  LOL!  As long as you do that, be prepared for a truly amazing treat!  This package comes with 12 bite sized delicacies.  The chocolate is high quality, the nuts are crunchy, and the overall taste couldn't be better.  Definitely worth the price!
