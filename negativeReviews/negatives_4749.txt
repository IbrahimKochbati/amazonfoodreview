I was excited to try this cat litter hoping to eliminate the feces odor other litters have failed to do.  The litter does help with the odor but my gosh, the dust is horrible.  I clean the box twice a day and each time the dust envelopes my head and I start coughing.  I'd rather smell the poopy than  eath whatever is in this product.....bad, bad, bad.  The cat box is covered so the poor cat must also be suffering.  I'm going to try a corn based product next.  I've been told some people use horse bedding or chicken crumbles which make fine cat litter and are very inexpensive.
