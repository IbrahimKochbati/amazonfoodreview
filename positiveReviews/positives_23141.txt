I was recently diagnosed with sensitivity to wheat (the Doc stopped short of a full celiac test and diagnosis). I used to love eating  ead. This product is terrific if you follow the instructions for the machine. The last loaf I made I used olive oil instead of canola. What a difference! The problem now is how to keep a loaf for a week   it gets eaten so quickly! I thoroughly recommend Pamela's Products.
