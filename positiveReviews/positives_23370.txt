I'm a pretty big fan of Think Thin's Chunky Peanut Butter bar and wanted to try some of the  and's other flavors; White Chocolate Chip sounded delicious.  I have to say that this bar has replaced Think Thin's Chunky Peanut Butter as my favorite.          Think Thin's White Chocolate Chip bar has an exterior white coating and a tan center with mini chocolate chips.  The exterior coating is more similar to a vanilla flavor than a white chocolate flavor.  For those that enjoy sweets, this may be your ticket to fulfilling your sugar tooth and obtaining a decent amount of protein.  Note: The exterior coating is sensitive to heat so if you will be in warm temperatures, expect meting to occur.          I found this bar to be moist and flavorful compared to the typical protein bar and even compared to Think Thin's other products. I'm not saying that you cannot taste the protein.  I don't know if that is something you can escape without massive amounts of sweetner.  It is a very edible option.  The ease of consumption is also appreciated. With some protein bars, you have to worry about chipping a tooth but this bar was easy to consume.          These bars can really help you ride out a period of hunger.  I sometimes use them as  eakfast bars and can go three to four hours before I feel like a snack or other  eakfast item is needed.          Think Thin's White Chocolate Chip protein bar has an admirable amount of protein and is sugar free.  Those with sensitivity to sugar alcohols and soy should probably pick another protein bar, however, because the bar contains both.
