Excellent GF  ead mix.  I use it to make dinner rolls with grated cheese mixed in, and melted garlic butter  ushed on top.  Very easy and tasty.  Even the rest of my family who can eat gluten like these rolls.  Also makes good sandwich buns.  I always keep it on hand.  You do have to mix the dough by hand, and it is very sticky, so I use more oil than the directions call for, and put oil on my hands before I start mixing it.
