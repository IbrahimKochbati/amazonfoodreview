I like that it's not greasy and has less calories, but it's a little salty side, and it doesn't taste like potato chips I'm used to. It tastes like rice cakes with a hint of potato flavor (I guess that's how 'pop'things taste like). I like that it's less of a guilty pleasure, but I don't think I will buy it again.
