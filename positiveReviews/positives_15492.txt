I used this squid ink for a recipe out of Ferran Adria's new Family Meal cookbook.  I had to buy on Amazon since apparently no one in Dallas has ever heard of or carried squid ink in their stores.  Thank goodness for online ordering!          I used two of the four packets for the recipe (for 2 servings of squid risotto), and it dissolved into the fish stock pretty easily.  I was expecting any stray droplets to permanently stain my counter, but that didn't happen.  It wipes up easily.  The taste was good...kind of salty and milder than I expected.  I've never had squid ink before, so I can't tell if this product is better or worse than others, but I liked it and the dish turned out well.  I'm just glad that I didn't need much more for the recipe since this product could get a little pricey in larger quantities.
