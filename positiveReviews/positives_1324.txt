I was very pleased with the popchips.  MY first order was before the chips hit the stores.  The taste is delightful.  No greasy taste. In fact the variety in flavors will keep your palate very excited!  Amazing how it is made.  Calorie count is great too! I went further to send the chips to my family they too were very pleased with them.  My third order I placed for a gathering of 12 friends.  They too, could not get over the variety of flavors and how they were made. I feel the product itself won over more prospective customers. Try it yourself, I know you will be very pleased.
