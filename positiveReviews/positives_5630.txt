My morning  eakfast:          A six ounce container of Fage 2% plain Greek Yogurt, mixed with a sliced banana and 3 or 4 sliced strawberries.  Add a teaspoon of Splenda Brown Sugar Blend, and it's nicely sweetened, and a healthy way for me to start my day.  I started this  eakfast routine over a year ago, and haven't grown tired of it.  It was suggested at a Weight Watchers meeting as a very "low points"  eakfast.  It has easily become my "standard" for  eakfast...so much so that I will  ing a bag of Splenda with me on vacations, in case I have trouble finding it at the store.  (I also openly admit that perhaps I'm too hung up on this routine.  But it's so satisfying in the morning that I don't care.)          I haven't personally ever cooked with this  own sugar blend, but as a topping on my yogurt or a baked sweet potato, it's been great!
