See's candy is exceptionally good. It is one of the best candies available. It was given at Christmas to relatives who truely enjoyed it. The shipping cost was criminal! I realize the cost of shipping has gone up in recent months. The See's candy company is charging too much for shipping and handling. I do not plan to buy any additional candy in the future because of this problem.
