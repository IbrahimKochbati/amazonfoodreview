Lipton loose tea is great for  ewing iced tea or hot tea. Mellow yet intensely flavorful, this tea works very well with iced tea makers or coffee  ewers. I wouldn't use a coffee maker that's been used for coffee, though, as the coffee effervescence will overpower the tea's flavor. My only gripe is I would like to see loose tea available in larger packages. Lipton used to sell it in one pound boxes, but now it's only available in 1 2 pound boxes. This six pack helps make up for the problem somewhat. We drink iced tea like some people drink their coffee: all the time! So loose tea works great for us (4 TBSP makes about a gallon) It's much easier than messing with a dozen or more tea bags per gallon. With the free shipping, the price per box is equal to or less than the purchase price in our local grocery stores and Wal*Mart stores, and that's with delivery to my front door!
