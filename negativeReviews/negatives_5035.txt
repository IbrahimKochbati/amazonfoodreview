I gave this to my dogs to see how they'd take to it.  They both seem confused by it.  At first it just sat on the floor, untouched for a couple of days.  I figured I'd try to lure them into playing with it by putting some really really yummy people food in it for them to sniff out. That definitely worked.  But they lose interest in the toy itself once the treats are gone.  Unlike another toy I purchased that they play with whether or not it has treats in it.     You have to show your dog how the treats slide out when you tug on the rope. I don't think my dogs are stupid but they just didn't get it until I went over it a couple of dozen times with them.
