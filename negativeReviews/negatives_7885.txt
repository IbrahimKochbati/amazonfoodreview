bought these for my dog for her teeth and  eath. the first one i gave her she almost choked on and i had to reach down her throat to get it out. i read that many other people have had this problem. once your dog chews on them for more than a few minutes they become soft and mushy but because of the shape and the material they cannot be swallowed so when your dog tries to swallow they end up blocking your dogs airway. i threw them out immediately after and will tell people to never give these to your pet if you love them for fear of causing them to choke to death
