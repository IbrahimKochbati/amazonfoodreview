I've been buying Happy Bellies for the past 6 months (though I didn't use it exclusively... I also tried other  ands). I'd say I've bought probably 5 or 6 cans so far. Unlike most of the reviewers here who opened a seemingly bad can, most of my cans have been grayish greenish color! I thought it was a bit weird that the color consistency smell is different from the other  ands, but since the "quality" I got has been consistent (consistently bad...), I didn't think too much of it. And then one day I finally got one that looks "normal"... I did some search on the internet and realized that I've been giving my baby bad oatmeal!!!! I feel so bad. I hope the company does something about it, and that FDA investigates on this issue. Has anyone reported this yet?
