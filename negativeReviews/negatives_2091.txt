I'm on a low sodium diet and use this product regularly.  Think it is very good.  Try their salsa.  Couple of jars of this & a couple of jars of another pasta suace, spices, seasonings, etc.  However, the $44.00+ shipping cost is a major rip off.  Try one of two or three sites on Google.  You will save $20.00 to $30.00 a case.
