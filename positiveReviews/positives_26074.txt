The food is good, but I buy it because my cat really loves it. I must confess I was trying to switch her to Evo  and food, so I did the usual routine of starting to mix in the new food. We noticed that she was eating very carefully. After a few days we were up to half Natural Balance and half Evo and after she ate...very slowly...I Iooked at the bowl and realized what she was doing  she was tasting each little pellet and only eating the Natural Balance (leaving behind the little triangular Evo bits)!! We gave the rest of the bag of Evo to a friend and ordered more Natural Balance.
