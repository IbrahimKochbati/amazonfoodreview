This is one of my favorite potates dishes but I always have a tough time finding them in my local supermarkets. So, like usually, I go to Amazon and sure enough, they're available at a much lower price in a shipment of 6 boxes. As I know they'll be gone in no time (my family loves them too) I put them on automatic delivery. No more searching the supermarkets, love it!
