This is a difficult review to write.  I have reflux and coffee is a major trigger.  I LOVE good coffee, dark, strong, robust coffee.          I was so happy to find this product and had hoped I could "have my coffee and drink it, too."  It is not to be.  I would rather have nothing than drink this.          Coffee is such a personal thing.  I know most people drink it because they are addicted to caffeine (otherwise there would be NO on buying the majority of the coffee sold in grocery stores).  I drink coffee because I absolutely love the taste (I normally drink decaf everything so caffeine is not a factor for me).          For those who absolutely cannot have coffee and aren't particular about flavor, I think this product will be a godsend.  Just like the gluten free products are godsends for celiacs, but you won't catch me eating them either!
