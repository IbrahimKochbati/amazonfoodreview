I ordered these after I bought the Stonewall Kitchen gluten free chocolate chip cookie mix.  I was so happy to find something like this for my 7 year old!  Unfortunately, the cupcakes were really   icky.  They tasted like corn muffins.  My son is gluten free due to sensitivity, not a disease.  Therefore he does not have to be 100% gluten free.  This makes our choices a bit wider when I am looking at ingredients for him.  The chocolate chip cookies were very good and I'd buy the mix again and make them.  I bought both the chocolate and vanilla cupcake mix.  We found them heavy, and didn't really like the taste.  They were totally disappointing.  I can now go to Hannafords and buy pre made gluten free cupcakes that are actually yummy   they are also a bit heavy.  They don't taste like corn  ead and that is the plus.  My suggestion if you order these is make them mini cupcakes and make or buy your own frosting.  For someone who is gluten free, they do taste better than lots of things you can buy and make.  For kids who aren't   they will notice a big difference and most likely not like or want them.
