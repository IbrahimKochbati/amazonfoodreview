I received this gift basket Monday which was an unseasonably warm late October day here in Colorado.  My family and I tried the chocolate covered peanuts that same evening and though delicious they were melted together in one lump!  Same experience with the chocolate coated pretzels.  The chocolate covered raisins also tasted great and fortunately had stayed intact with no ill effects from being too warm.  There's a variety of truffles, covered marshmallows, graham crackers etc included I have not yet opened or tasted.  All the  treats appear to be of very high quality though the quantities are quite small which may be a good thing for those of us watching our waistlines.  The actual basket the treats come in is a little cheap looking but I did decide to keep it to make up my own gift basket for someone in the future.  At a cost of around $40 I don't consider this item to be an exceptional value.     PS  I took a star off this gift basket since the more I look at it the less impressed I am.  For some strange reasons a rice krispie type bar with a bit of chocolate was placed in a box for flan, some truffles were placed in one of those single serve size cereal boxes for sugar pops and some dark chocolate pieces were in a Royal Jello box.  I don't really think I would want to give as a gift something with this odd packaging.     UPDATE:  ig4U contacted me and sent me another basket to review.  This second basket did NOT contain melted chocolates or strange recycled packages.  Based on the second basket I received this item would make an attractive, respectable gift for a chocolate lover.
