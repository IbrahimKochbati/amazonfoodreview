my two dogs absolutely LOVE zuke's hip action dog treats!  it's so great to finally find a "treat" that's not only beneficial to their health as well as them really liking the way they taste ~ i only have to give them each two a day ~ my dogs have a combined weight of 185 lbs.!  most "treats" recommend feeding a lot more making it kind of expensive ~ the price is right and maya & luna are happy!  i will definitely be ordering on a regular basis!
