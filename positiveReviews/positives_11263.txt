I have been off gluten for three months and although I am getting used to being deprived of my favorite desserts, it does not make it fun.  Pamela's products are by far the best gluten free deserts around and the  ownies are the best!  Unlike other gluten free products that are dense and dry, these  ownies are moist, light, and delicious. Even people who can have gluten will love this product.
