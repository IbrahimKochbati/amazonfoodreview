I love these, but have only been able to find them at one location in our town and have to order them on line.  I was resently diagnosed as pre diabetic and needed to lose weight. I showed these to my nutritionist who was very impressed and planned to recommend them to other patients as a snack. Warm from the microwave, they are so much better than the regular rinds.
