My mom is 82 years old and she has been telling me stories about how her father used to make huckleberry pies and how great they were. I wanted to give her a treat, so I Googled, Huckleberry, and found the company selling on Amazon. I called out to the store itself and spoke with a very friendly young lady named Krista. I wound up ordering their pie filling.     I first surprised my mom with the jam and she loved it!  Then I baked the pie and she said it was like her father's. I think she was being kind because the crust wasnt very good.     I would definitely recommend this product.
