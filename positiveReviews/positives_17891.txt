I don't fix much pork (I don't know why?!), but I picked up some (4) thin cut pork tenderloins to use with this product.  I had plenty of Shake'N Bake crumbs left over to do more chops tenderloins.  I liked how the crumbs gave the pork a light taste and certainly did NOT overpower the meat itself.  I don't like tons of flavorings to overpower what I'm eating, so if that is what you typically want need (like tons of salt, garlic, etc.), I'm not sure if this will do it for you.  You could probably add some garlic or spices to the crumb mix if you needed to.  I'm currently on a low carb diet, so I was not going to put my pork in the mix, but, looking at the label, it really wasn't too bad   so I had some myself!  And, even if you don't want to eat the  eading, but you do want the flavor, it was easy to scrape off of the port after cooking.  I liked it, my kids liked it, I would give it a try again!
