I received this product from the Amazon Vine Program.          I love coffee, but I cannot drink too much and am sensitive to the amount of acid in coffee.  I decided to try Puroast to see what this  and is all about.  I have had low acid coffee in the past but they don't taste good AT ALL!          Here is what I like:          1) Taste? It doesn't suck.  Its not regular coffee, but if I had to drink it because of health reasons... I could.     2) Smell?  Smells just like regular coffee.  And isn't that why we drink coffee too?     3) Price.  About the same as what I already pay, no problem there.  Note: I do drink good, pricy coffee.          If you have health issues and need to drink low acid coffee, this is pretty good. No, its not regular coffee, but if you are looking to buy a low acid coffee, AND you are looking for a coffee with good taste.  This was good.  I liked it.  Its definitely worth your try!!
