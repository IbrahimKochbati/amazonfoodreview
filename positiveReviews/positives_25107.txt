I'm somewhat perplexed as to why reviewers slammed this for not having enough flavor because the name says it all. This is supposed be a light, subtly flavored beverage. I think it's delicious.     I'm also left scratching my head as to assertions that this product contains sugar; it contains CANE JUICE which is not only far more dilute than sugar but is enjoyed on its own as a delicious, healthful beverage and is well worth sampling if you can find it (it's fairly easy to find fresh in NYC's Chinatown). For the record, it's not sickeningly sweet and is claimed to have anti cariogenic properties (I love the stuff). Don't downgrade a product because you don't know how to interpret what's printed on a label (let the negs begin).     O.N.E. Coconut Water with a Splash of Pink Guava is very refreshing when you're in need of an electrolyte boost and I agree with other reviewers that 8.5 ounces is insufficient for a fierce thirst; I hope O.N.E. has this flavor slated for 1 liter packaging. The flavor is exquisite, as is the color. This also makes a great base for a pink guava smoothie  blend with a frozen banana, coconut milk (canned is fine), frozen pink guava pulp, and a sweetener of your choice (coconut sugar would be great). Delicious AND pretty! You could also, if you prefer a different liquid (such as yogurt or fruit juice), freeze it in an ice cube tray and add to the other ingredients to thicken and chill your smoothie  it's the kind of product you can get creative with if you're into playing in the kitchen.     To sum it up, O.N.E. Coconut Water with a Splash of Pink Guava does NOT contain added sugar, doesn't claim to be a juice, and is well worth trying, especially if you can find it on sale. In addition, although I'm a Vine Voice, this product wasn't offered to me for review; I'm of my own initiative evaluating my own purchase. Enjoy!
