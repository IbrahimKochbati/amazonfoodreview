This mayo is made with egg whites and no yolks, hard to find a good tasting mayo without them being front and center.  I tried MANY yolkless mayos before this and had given up hope of ever finding one I could stand.  I am so glad I tried this, it is the best mayo I have ever had out of a jar!  I am so excited to be able to have a seafood salad sandwich again :)          This tastes better than regular Hellmans Best Foods mayo, and it tastes nothing like Miracle Whip (which I hate).  It is smooth and rich and helps combine any salad style mix you have going without adding any off flavors.  I actually never put mayo on sandwiches before, just used it as an ingredient, but I may start since this is so tasty!          The four pack is a great value.
