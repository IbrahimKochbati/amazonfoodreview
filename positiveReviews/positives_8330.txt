Haven't been able to find loose Lipton's tea in grocery stores for years and was delighted to find it here at Amazon. This is absolutely the best buy in tea I have made in my life. Received a very ample supply quickly at minimum cost and Amazon paid the shipping.          The Tea is as good as I remembered it and I am a happy camper again, able to make my own by the pitcher.          Thank you, Amazon.
