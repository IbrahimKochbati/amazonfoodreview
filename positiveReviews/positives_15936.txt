First of all, this is a great price as I have purchased it elsewhere and paid alot more...Secondly, if you are sitting on the fence on whether to try it... JUST DO IT! You will NOT regret it... just need a blender, milk and ice cubes... a fancy glass... and whipped cream to top it off.  It is delicious!  We had this in the dead of winter and couldn't wait for the next one!  Can't wait to try it in the heat of the summer!  ENJOY!
