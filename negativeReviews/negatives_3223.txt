I was sent English Breakfast tea in a Decaf Earl Grey Box.  The incorrect k cups were in the wrong box and strewn haphazardly in the box.  It seemed rather unprofessional, like someone had just thrown what they had in their kitchen in a box and sent to me.  I am not happy to say the least.  Amazon customer service was wonderful and refunded me.
