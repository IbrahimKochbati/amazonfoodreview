I absolutely LOVE Walden Farms' salad dressings.  However, this product was not appetizing to me after the tasting it and it has a very unpleasant, lingering aftertaste.  I tried to doctor it up a bit so that the aftertaste wasn't so undesirable.  Nothing really worked.  Additionally, the smell is unappealing.
