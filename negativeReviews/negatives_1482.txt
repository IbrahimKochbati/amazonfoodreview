Ive noticed that my dog has had more frequent bowel movement than usual. He is on a strict schedule for potty  eak and has been very good on it for the past 4 years until i tried this food. Now he poops in my apt in front of us because he has to go so bad, like the poster above, its one hell of a laxative when my very well trained yorkie cant even hold it in
