Just be forewarned it is a bit "moist."  Have plenty of papertowels napkins around when eating it.          However for vegan jerky, this has by far the best texture. You will be picking it out of your teeth for hours! And for me, that is a good thing!          My fav is the BBQ flavor, however their other flavors are very tasty as well : )
