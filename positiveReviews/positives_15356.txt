By far, the best chocolate in the USA. Better than Godiva, I think, but others may disagree. I LOVE See's Candies, BUT the shipping cost is almost the same as the pound of truffles.  I know shipping chocolate may be difficult during hot or cold times, but geez, something has to be done about this..... Maybe buy multiple See's products for shipping discounts? we don't have See's stores in the East, just little stands in malls during the holiday season with few choices. I WANT MY SEE'S KEY LIME WHITE CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES.  Your best bet is to search amazon's grocery and gourmet food site and find discounts. During the winter holidays, I got terrific truffles at a deep discount, regularly $100 for $20 plus free shipping.
