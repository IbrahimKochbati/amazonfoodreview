Flavor was perfect but absolutely horrible texture!          Mushy to the point that they would fall apart when taking them out if you weren't exceptionally careful.          Just about to finish our first tin, and if the second is the same I won't be ordering again.          If by some chance, the second tin is different I'll update.          Otherwise, no news is bad news.
