They have this coffee at where I work... and before this, they had this horrible folgers coffee which HAD to be diluted with sweetner and creamer... I can actually drink this black because it's actually good! It tastes like a coffee that was  ewed from a cafe, not just your coffee machine at home. Good stuff.
