My cats loved the treats but everytime I try to use the bags zipper to close it up I gotta fiddle with it for a while just to close the bag. Eventually The bag didn't close properly and all the treats dried out causing the cats to lose interest. I plan to buy another but this time I will dump it in my own container.
