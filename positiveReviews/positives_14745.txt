Price   I generally get this at an Asian market store so I have to say if you can't get it locally, then having it delivered seems like a great idea unless Amazon throws out a deal which makes it better.  I jumped on a deal with mixed results.          Taste   this is one of my picks for this type of noodle ( Udon )thicker type.  It is on the spicy side.  Yes, have to agree it is seafood but a blended taste.  The dried seaweed   dried little fish disks ( like those imitation crab legs made of ground fish sticks )gives it more appeal.          Delivery   I write this because you'll get noodle that are crushed on both sides.  I cringe at the thought of the other box I haven't opened yet.  Basically, your product condition is your selling point.  The problem is somehow in delivery or I suspect before boxing, the noodles are crushed so you end up something along the lines of a pill capsule shape.  Every one opened so far and these are along the edge of the box not the center yet.  When the significant other opened one and said said it was crushed, I thought well, time to post this so no one else is surprised.
