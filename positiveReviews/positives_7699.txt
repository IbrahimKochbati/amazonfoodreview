These microwave pork rinds are absolutely the BEST available. Any bag of pork rinds you buy in a store are not as good. The only place I've seen their equal is the ones that are cooked fresh at fall festivals and such places. They are EXCELLENT. Do not overcook them or they will burn and be lousy. If done properly, they are the best.
