My 8 month old lab retriever hound mix had wet stool for a long time. In addition, I thought he didn't have much of a food drive, because I would have to trick him into eating his food. After switching from Wellness puppy food (which had chicken in it) to Natural Balance Venison and Sweet Potato, he's normal, healthy, and eagerly waits for his meals!
