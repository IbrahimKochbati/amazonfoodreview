Strong positives:          Here is my assessment on buying 3 cases of this product as a cook:     1. This is a very strong value on an organic product       Nearly 60% to my local Whole Foods          2. Organic products don't act or cook like the mass produced  and but the difference is in the organic nature of these items.       Our experience cooking for over 50 people and over 12 pies so far is they all tasted fine and didn't see any issues in consistency.          3. Dented cans, 36 cans purchased and no dents.          4. Lastly, beyond the value it was organic with a shelf life on our cans into late 2013.  So while I'm sure the cans we have left will be gone by then the reality was this was a great deal at better than 60% off to my local organic store.          Great product and value, glad it was an offered program wish there were more organic items on amazon.com.
