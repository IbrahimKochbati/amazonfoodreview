For the price, this is:          organic     taste great     pure maple     grade A     competitive price          I wish when reviewers criticize products they would direct us to the better product, but some people seem to only want to be negative really negative.          I like the info, but not the tone as well as no comment that there is (what is it) or is not a better option.
