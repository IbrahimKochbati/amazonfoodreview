On the recommendation of someone else's review which said this coffee was mild, I chose to purchase a box.  It is still stronger than I like.  I have to use much creamer and sugar, plus run more water through a second time.  Not what i hoped for.  Sorry.          Would like a truly mild tasting coffee, there were some in the first sample box I bought, but the next two sample boxes had too many strong coffees and many tea cups.  I already have a good selection of tea, etc and only wanted coffee samples.  Am not sure how to find a coffee to my taste without a lot of waste.
