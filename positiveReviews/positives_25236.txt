This syrup is delicious!  I've never tried the grade B, but I wasn't disappointed.  It has a full, rich, mapley flavor and is wonderful on pancakes, waffles, and as a replacement for sugar in muffins, sweet  eads and cookies. You only need to use a small amount on pancakes and waffles because it is so sweet.  Knowing that it is organic puts my mind at ease because I know there is no formaldehyde in it, as there can be in other maple syrups.
