I've tried almost all the flavors, and my favorites are Teriyaki and Thai Peanut (both are sweet and savory).  For about 100 calories and 10 grams of protein, this makes a great snack.  I hadn't eaten these in a couple of years, but when I got pregnant I started craving the Teriyaki again so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon in bulk.
