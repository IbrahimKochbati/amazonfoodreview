I ran out of mate, and have been drinking mate for a long time. I ended up picking this up at the local Co op. Well I gotta say this tastes horrible. I have been drinking mate for a long time as I lived in Argentina, and this tastes nothing like normal mate. I understand the idea behind this mate, and the better health reasons behind having it unsmoked and organic, which organic and unsmoked sounds like an amazing idea, especially since I prefer organic everything! The problem is that this mate tastes nothing like normal mate, and really doesn't have a good taste. There are a lot of Americans who when they drink mate out of a gourd and bombilla who think that it tastes like dirt. Well this mate is definitely a dirt earthy taste. It tastes nothing like a good crop of mate, this is highly agreed by my Argentinian friend who ended up throwing his purchase in the garbage just after 2 gourds full, and eventually I tried to struggle through this yerba, but in the end it was just too much for me. Waste of money, and the many Argentinians that are friends of the family want to stay away from this mate, when even they would prefer to drink organic as well. Sorry eco teas, but your crafty wording, and healthy image doesn't always mean it is good. I mean just because you have a pretty label, and you take out all the stalk from your teas does not mean they are truly better. The stalk is fundamentally part of yerba mate, as an image and why waste the other part of the plant right? For an alternative to smoked mate and non organic there are better ones out there....
