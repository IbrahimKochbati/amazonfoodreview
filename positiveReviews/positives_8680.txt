While they aren't my favorite fruits, I do enjoy bananas and I keep them on hand because I love to add them to my smoothies (I usually add a heaping teaspoon or two of Matcha to all my smoothies too).          This matcha has a delicious banana y flavor that isn't too sweet.  The sweetness is from the fruit flavor and the Matcha itself, but it doesn't taste candy sweet, at least, not to me ... although it does smell like banana candy when you first open the package and all the while during preparation.  But, I don't get that sort of taste from the Matcha and that's a good thing, at least in my opinion.          The matcha does taste a little different with the banana flavoring.  The normal vegetative tones of the matcha meld with the flavor of the banana ... the fruity notes of the banana ... in such a way that the vegetal notes seem to disappear and become more fruity.  The lovely, creamy, buttery tones are still there, and it still tastes like Matcha... but it's not veggie or grassy tasting like some Matcha can taste.          I like!
