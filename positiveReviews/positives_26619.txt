I like to say my taste buds require a lot of flavoring so it might not be the norm. When I first ordered it I was hoping it would have a nice full taste, and not, for a lack of a better word, diluted flavor.  I was not disappointed. Not to say this tasted burnt like some coffee.  I'm really enjoying it and will order some more when the time comes.
