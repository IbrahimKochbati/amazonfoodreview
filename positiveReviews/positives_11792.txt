I live in a sparsely populated state, and due to the low volume of gluten free products, what is available in our stores costs about double what you pay on Amazon.com.  This Sam Mills Pasta D'Oro is very tasty and I don't think the average person would know it was gluten free if you didn't tell them.  It also holds it shape very well and doesn't fall apart after it is cooked.  Sam Mills pastas will now become a staple in my cupboards.  Thanks, Amazon.com, for making this line of products available to us at a reasonable price.
