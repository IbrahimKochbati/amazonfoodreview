when we were traveling thru montana and had a huckleberry shake it was incredible...full intense flavor.          when home we remissed not buying huckleberry products, and so shopped for the montana huckleberry products. we just tried the jam and found it sorely lacking in that same intense flavor. it was far less enjoyable than trader joe's good blueberry, blackberry etc jams. what we got was meek and mild, and we thought very very sugar laden. even the french  ead overwhelmed the flavor of the jam, which shows how weak the flavor is.          we will soon thry the syrup and the topping and report on them. but i would pass on this. even smuckers jams fare far better in flavor.
