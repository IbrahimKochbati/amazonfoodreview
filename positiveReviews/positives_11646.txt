I mix this with the Royal Canin Intense Hairball 34 as well as a no grain variety   I figure I am covering all the bases this way and not giving the cats more protein than they can handle. They like the Indoor Mature, and the shape is designed to make it easy for an older cat to chew. I wish RC offered this in a larger bag but I'll keep getting the 5.5 lb. size until they do. It's the best formula for older cats that I have found   and best liked by my cats.
