I have tried a few of the different flavors of Switch now and I think this one is my favorite.  It has a nice smooth taste with a nice aftertaste of kiwi and strawberry.  As usual, the dominant first taste is apple and grape but the aftertaste comes on quickly.  It isn't too carbonated but not flat as well.  I think this is a great and refreshing drink.  I think it is so good you will wish the cans were bigger.
