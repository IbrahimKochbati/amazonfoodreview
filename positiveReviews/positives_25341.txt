Our vet suggested these chews to help our dog's teeth and my dog prefers them to any other rawhide chew. OK prefer is not the best word, more like she's addicted and must have one to " ush her teeth" every night. The product is excellent, her teeth look fabulous, and she's happy. I'm happy because the cost through Amazon is nearly half of what I'd pay at the vet's office, even with the cost of shipping thrown in. I most definitely recommend this product.
