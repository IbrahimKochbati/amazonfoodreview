Not the best quality, a few pieces seemed to be slighly out dated. Overall though, it was a good buy. Most of the pieces were fresh and it  ought back some memories and that to me is what really made this a great value. The two ladies that recieved this thought it was great, and told me stories about the fourties that made me laugh, so I would suggest this if you are looking to give it as a gift to someone in say their seventies or eighties like I did.
