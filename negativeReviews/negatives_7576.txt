My cats prefer their wet food to be the kind that is chunks in gravy and not the pate kind. They normally love all of the varieties of Natural Balance's Platefulls, but they DO NOT LIKE the salmon, tuna, chicken, and shrimp flavor. They only lick the gravy off and leave the chunks to dry out. Also, someone seems to get a sick tummy more often since we got this package. So, it's a waste of my money.
