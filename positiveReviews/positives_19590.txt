I have one cat that even though the cat nip may be in a large jar he still tries to get to it, putting the jar about like a golf ball if I forget to put it in the cupboard.     They all love this Cosmic Catnip. I and my daughter have gotten catnip sometimes that just don't seem to have any 'nip' to it.     One can tell a good quality cat nip by the cats nusseling, eating, and rolling, antics. My cats have all the signs.
