.          I have a bit of a sweet tooth, but am limited on the amount of sugar I eat.  So when I choose to  eak my diet, I want it to be with a genuine reward.  I purchased Ghirardelli Squares Milk Chocolate with Caramel Filling because others have recommended them.          These candies are special   genuine chocolate that  slowly melts in my mouth.  Then after savoring the sweet chocolate, the caramel drifts onto my taste buds.  I like the caramel filling.  The candy is smooth and tasty.  I noticed that Ghirardelli has other candies with different fillings.  I may try them all (one small piece at a time).          I recommend these chocolates.     .
