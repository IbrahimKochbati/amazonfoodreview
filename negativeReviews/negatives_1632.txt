The advert for Switch describes it as a "healthy alternative to soda" and "a perfect balance beween juice and carbonation." To get right to it, let us tackle the first claim. The can of Switch I got (Orange Tangerine) was 8.3 fluid ounces. Those 8.3 ounces contain 36g carbs, 34g sugars and 15g sodium and packs 140 calories. To put this in perspective, the 20 fluid ounce bottle of vanilla Coke sitting on my desk right now  contains 28g carbs, 28g sugars and 25mg sodium, and has 100 calories. In other words, a bottle of conventional soda 2.5x as large has less calories, less carbs, and less sugars. Granted, Switch has less sodium, but if we poured equivalent amounts of drink, i.e. 20 oz vs. 20 oz, it would have much more. The drawing power of Switch, then, is that it boasts 100% RDA of Vitamin C and 20% RDA of Vitamin A vs 0% in these categories for Coke, and that it has plenty of carbonation to satisfy the taste of soda lovers. In my mind this doesn't quite balance the scale          As to the second claim: I liked the balance between a fruit juice and a carbonated drink. It reminded me of Orangina in that it is sharp and crisp and has a bite to it, but it might strike some as too sugary sweet. All in all I think this is likely to be one of those drinks that people like very much or no at all, no in betweens. However, it can be considered "healty" only in small doses (one can day, say) and should be avoided by low carb dieters.
