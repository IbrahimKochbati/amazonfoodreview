My shipment arrived with no  oken or leaking containers. The product was well packed as to prevent a lot of movement to could cause damage and it worked out well. the only thing I found wrong was the shipment was seven (7) containers short, should have been 192 received 185, but for the price I paid I still came out far ahead on this sell. No complaints, and I would order from them again if given the chance.
