I have to wonder about the leadership of this company.  There's a review here from 2007 complaining about no safety seal and obviously no one at the company with the power to change that thinks it's a big deal.  I bought this at my local grocery store.  When I got home and opened it without the lid popping, I took it right back to the store and got my money back.  I was going to call the company but there is no phone number on the label.  Get this  it says if you have questions or comments about the product to WRITE to them.  Ok, sure.  Bet they don't get many questions or comments...which apparently is how they like it.
