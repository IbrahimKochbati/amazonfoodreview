I tried this milk chocolate with hazelnuts for the first time recently after reading a review that this  and was the best chocolate in the world. I had to try it and it was worth every penny. I am a dark chocolate fan normally (70% is my favorite) but I have to say I would order this again and give it as a gift. It melted like butter in my mouth and was beyond delightful.
