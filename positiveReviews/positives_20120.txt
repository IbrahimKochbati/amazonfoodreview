I know that title sounds a big negative, but you have to know that I wasn't expecting much. Being only 1 WW Points+ each, I was expecting overly sweet, not very chocolatey and not very tasty. I was wrong, though!          These are a decent size; one mouthful, or 2 smaller bites. Each is individually wrapped, which makes them perfect to stick in a lunch or snack box for work. They certainly stop my chocolate or sweet craving after meals or between 2 4 pm.
