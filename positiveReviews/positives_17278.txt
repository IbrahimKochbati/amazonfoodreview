My dog is learning to like more foods, other than junk food, and  other non food items.     I don't know the number of  ands our family has tried, almost all, failing. A few he would take to after time.     "MOTHER NATURE," on the other hand has been a huge hit.     If they are out, and within reach, he'll attempt to steal them. This is bad, and good.
