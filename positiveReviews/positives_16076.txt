I've very glad that Amazon and other companies are making more English foods available in the U.S. McVities make a high quality product and slightly a bit different than many of the similar products sold here. The years the I spent in England McVities was my favorite  and of biscuits (cookies).     Through some Amazon.com deals you can get a good price, but shop carefully, not all prices on Amazon.com are the best. But if it says McVities, it should be good.  While you're at it get some PG Tips Tea bags, now you've got a great way to relax.
