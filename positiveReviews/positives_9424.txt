Peas came in good condition. Cans were not dented and the peas themselves were not mushy. Great for quick meals and a very reasonable price compared to the cost per can at a regular grocery store. Other pros include: BPA free can,organic, no added salt, limited ingredient list (peas,water,seaweed). Please note that you can't even tell the seaweed is in the can. I flavor mine with a little onion and garlic powder, a pinch of sea salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Add a little liquid smoke for a smokey taste without added fat,sodium,or meat. All in all a good product.
