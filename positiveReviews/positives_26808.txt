First things first...if you are sensitive to spicy foods, go lightly as you adjust your pallet to the heat this salsa provides.  Everyone has their own heat tolerance level and I would say that this salsa does warm up your mouth, could possibly cause your nose to run but has a vinegary jalapeno taste that is unmatched by any other commercial tomatillo hot sauce that can be sourced locally at your neighborhood grocery store and or Wal Mart.  While I try to share my business amongst various grocery stores and markets in the town I live in, I believe my Wal Mart sells this for less than $3 for a 1kg 35oz bottle.  I love to put this on frozen burritos and it is awesome with tortilla chips.  I was actually introduced to this salsa by a Cuban American family that we are friends with and they always have it on standby for the congris (black beans and rice) that the mom of the family makes.  And really, unless you have a garden with tomatillos, jalapenos etc. at your disposal, can you really make it for less than your local store might sell it for? Anyway, I rate it highly even though my gabacho palate is still adjusting to the uncountable number of salsas that are out there.
