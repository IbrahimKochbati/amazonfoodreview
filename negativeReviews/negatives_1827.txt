I don't find the taste of this goat milk very pleasing if mixed to use in liquid form; I've had fresh goat milk and frankly, this does not come anywhere close even with reasonable expectations because of the powered form. It does however have its use in my kitchen in baked goods where the flavor even if slightly sour can be of use. Certain  ead, pancakes and the like do very well if I add this mix instead of other milks or water. Good to have in the pantry for those "just in case" days.
