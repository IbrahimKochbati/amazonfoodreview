I discovered the HappyBellies at Babies R Us and didn't know anything about it. (btw it is more expensive there) We started our baby on it in 4 months. She LOVES it and it is good for her belly. She used to be constipated from time to time even on the  east milk. Now she is much more regular. Once i could not find the HappyBellies rice cereal at the store and got the Earth Best instead. The baby didn't like it and it was hard to feed through the bottle          The only problem i have is what's up with the 3 4 of the container? Why it is not as full as it's used to be? Keeping static price in expense of the quantity i guess? oh well...economy it is
