This chili is great. I've tried a handful of major  and canned chili, you know the ones I mean, and always walked away disappointed. Needing something meaty that could be eaten as a meal, I was determined to find a decent canned chili. Normally I would have passed over this  and because it contains no meat, but I made a mistake and ordered it without realizing this. I'm not a vegetarian and have only found out since ordering it that Worthington is a vegetarian only  and name. Well, it's a mistake I don't regret, because the absence of meat in this chili is not a problem at all. The company replaced the meat in an otherwise excellent chili recipe with what I believe is mashed tofu along with some other natural stuff that congeals and even looks convincingly like meat. Thanks to the natural heavy spicing of chili, the taste of tofu is camouflaged, and only the taste of the delicious beans and spices comes through. The consistency is perfect, being just watery enough to not require added water, but still being solid enough to not be a tasteless soup. Bottom line: I find myself, a perfectly contented meat eater, to be craving this chili at least once a week.
