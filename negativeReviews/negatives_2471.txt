This is my fourth order of these pork rinds and I'm not sure what's up, but something's really amiss.  The bags are leaking some kind of grease and don't fluff up during the microwave process.  I used to love these, so hopefully this is just a bad batch.  If not, then Lowrey's needs to look into this and fix whatever has happened to a once great snack.
