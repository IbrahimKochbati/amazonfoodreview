These chocolate sandwich creme cookies by WhoNu? are every bit as delicious as similar  ands but they are healthier for you. True, they have almost the same sugar, fat and carb amounts of the best known name  and of these cookies; but as others have noted they also give you fiber with noticeably more vitamins and minerals than that other  and. This is a plus!          They're really good as a snack and it's hard to stop at the serving size of just three cookies; but I guess I'm allowed an occasional guilty pleasure! As I write this they are a bit too expensive on this website; try looking for these cookies elsewhere unless you want the convenience of having them shipped to your door.          Overall, these awesome chocolate sandwich creme cookies by WhoNu? are the best! I definitely recommend them as an excellent, healthier alternative to the major name  and of this type of cookie.          I love `em! Enjoy!
