I really love the Strawberry flavor of Extra Dessert Delights and so decided to buy a 10 pack package. The order arrived in a reasonable time, but as I started using the packs, discovered that I could not pull individual sticks from the packs   the sticks were sticking to the bottom of the pack. For each new pack, I have to remove all the sticks, remove the outer 5 stick wrappers, and replace all the sticks back into the pack. Either the packs have a manufacturing defect, or, more likely, the 10 pack package was stored at elevated temperatures before shipping. I have purchased individual packs at local stores for a long time and never had this problem. I will have to try a different vendor on the next order.
