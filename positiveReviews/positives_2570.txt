This is the absolute best hot cocoa for the Keurig Brewers. All of the other Hot Cocoa's that we have tried we had to "doctor" to make them taste good. We had to add more cocoa and more sugar. I was pretty much making my own cocoa, which defeated the purpose of the  ewer. But the Grove Square Hot Cocoa does not need any help. In my opinion, It has just the right amount of flavor!!
