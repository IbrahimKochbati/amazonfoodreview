I had to do quite a bit of research on which popcorn and flavoring to get with my new popcorn maker from Costco. After reading reviews on this I pulled the trigger, and I'm sure glad I did. It tastes almost exactly like the movie theater popcorn. Just add a little Orville popcorn oil on top and viola! BEST POPCORN EVER!
