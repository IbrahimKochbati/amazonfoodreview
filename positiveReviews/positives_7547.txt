I started adding chia seeds to my diet about 18 months ago.  I have tried various  ands and like the Navitas Naturals  and the best of the 4 or 5  ands I have tried.  Not sure if the "organic" promises they provide are absolutely true, but as a consumer of several Navitas Naturals products I certainly hope so.  In any event, it beats buying some of the bulk chia seeds I have found at local stores with little or no explanation of where the seeds really come from.          In all, I find chia seeds rather tasteless.  The joy in eating them, if there is any, is in the texture   crunch they provide.  Some other  ands had what I assume was foreign matter, which made the texture uneven or, worse, hard like having little rocks in the mix.          My motivation for adding them to my diet was to increase my Omega 3 intake from plant sources and add more fiber as well.  I have noticed improvement in my overall health since eating them, but I can't say for sure if chia played any role in that because I changed my diet in many other ways and greatly increased my work out schedule.  Just to be safe, I'm going to continue eating chia every morning and adding it as often as possible for other meals throughout the day.          As a very happy customer, I plan on continuing my subscription to Navitas Naturals Chia Seeds for a long time.
