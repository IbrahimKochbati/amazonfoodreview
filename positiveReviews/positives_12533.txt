I have tried all the k cups that came with my Keurig at Christmas and by far the best of all for me was the  eakfast blend.  Not too strong or weak, JUST RIGHT.  I use the 12oz size for my mug and a little half and half and enjoy!  I was not enjoying the coffees I kept trying so bought some medium roasts at the store but still not satisfied with the taste. By far the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend is it for me.
