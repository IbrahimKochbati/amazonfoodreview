My 14 month old daughter can not tolerate cows milk or soy. While she was an infant, she had to drink Nutramigen formula and would only drink maybe 4 oz at a time. Once she turned a year old, and I began giving her Meyenberg goat's milk, she began to guzzle it! She loves it so much! She now consistently drinks 8 12 ounces at a time!          I mix one can (powdered) at a time, which makes approx. one gallon. We go through about a gallon every 2 days!          This milk is such a blessing! We highly recommend it! Amazon has the best price, too. It's so much more convenient and less expensive to purchase it on here and have it delivered to us rather than make countless (and expensive) trips to the health food store.
