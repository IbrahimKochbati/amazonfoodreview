IT IS HARD FINDING SIMILAR PRODUCTS FOR OUR GLUTEN FREE CHILD, FOR THINGS SHE LOVED BEFORE BEING DIAGNOSED WITH CELIAC DISEASE.  THIS IS A MIX THAT SHE LOVES FOR PANCAKES.  SHE EVEN MADE SWEET POTATO BISCUITS YESTERDAY WITH IT. WE HAVE FOUND IT ON SALE FOR $1.79 PER BOX AT OUR LOCAL GROCERY STORE (LESS THAN AMAZON A FEW TIMES,) SO WE STOCK UP WHEN IT IS ON SALE.  IT WILL BE NICE WHEN GLUTEN FREE FOODS ARE PRICED MORE CLOSELY TO THE WHEAT MIXES.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FOR YOU.  WE WILL TRY MANY MORE RECIPIES USING THIS PRODUCT IN THE FUTURE.   "
