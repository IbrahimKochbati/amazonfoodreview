I found the flavor and consistency of this fudge to just be OK. The consistency was a tad grainy where it should have a smooth texture. I remember when my mom made fudge it would occasionally turn out grainy and she said it was because the humidity caused the sugar in the candy to crystalize. I don't know if that is the case with this fudge or not, but both this and another Gardiners of Scotland fudge I bought have the same graininess. Further the flavors were odd. The Rum and Raisin was ok, but the raisins had no flavor. The apple and cinnamon didn't taste like apple or cinnamon nor did the strawberry and cream taste like strawberries. I think there was one ginger flavored piece in the can and it was flavorless. I won't be buying Gardiners of Scotland fudge again.
