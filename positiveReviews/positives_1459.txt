These are the greatest potato snack products I've found.  Only 2 points for Weight Watchers.  Really crispy and tasty.  All of the flavors are great.  My only complaint......it's difficult to open the little bags.  I need a pair of scissors, but I guess that keeps them fresher for longer so it's a great trade off.  I would recommend these chips to everyone.
