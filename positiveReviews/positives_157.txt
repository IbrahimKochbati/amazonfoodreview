These little guys are tasty and refreshing.          I usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to  eath.  I eat 2 of these after lunch (because they are so small) and I find this sufficiently resolves the problem.          They're sugar free (sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow) which is great and they're tasty enough that I almost think of them as part of my lunch.          This is a good bulk value buy and I'd highly recommend the mints themselves.  Cheers!
