I wasn't sure what to expected with these bars. I am not a huge energy bar fan. I find them too heavy and even after spending eight hours of hiking, I can only eat half of an energy bar. I admit, that I was expected the same thing with these. Instead, I got a light and almost cookie like bar that was delicious. I would have never guessed that they were gluten free because I've tried gluten free food and this was nothing like that. This bar was a perfect afternoon snack that was chewy and light. I really enjoyed the nice sweet flavor that wasn't overpowering. I had eaten the entire bar before I knew it and found it kept me going all afternoon too. I think I might have found a new hiking snack! Yay!
