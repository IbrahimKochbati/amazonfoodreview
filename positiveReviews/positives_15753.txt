This is quite a unique  and of cat food. Their tagline is "People food for cats" and they are quite right. They smell and look delicious.          There are basically two types of canned cat food in my experience, the first kind is the solid kind where you tip the can into the plate and the food retains the shape of the can. The second type is the  more liquidy type that you can spoon, almost pour into the cats plate. For me this second type is preferable because it has a higher content of liquid which I consider to be healthier for the cats urinary system. This cat food is of this second type.          My cat is a very finicky eater and he takes time to adjust to new foods.     This package contains two flavors; the first is chicken pot pie which looks just like real chicken pot pie, right down to the light gravy, there are cubes of real chicken  east and it really looks like pot pie. My cat laps up all the sauce then moves on to the chunks of chicken.          Second flavor is sesame chicken: This smells really good and the chicken is not chunked but in thin strips. My cat loves the sauce and will drain it all dry but is not too fond of the chicken. He will probably adjust to it over time. This is why only four stars.
