Not a good flavor overall. I have only tried the TERIYAKI flavored strips, and hate them. The texture and the sweetness is just gross together. I'm going to try a different flavor before writing this off, but yuck. I'm a vegan by the way, and I've had some amazingly delicious fake feet products: this is not one of them.
