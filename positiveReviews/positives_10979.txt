I was a little hesitant to try these because I tried another glutino product & hated it. I bought one box of these in one of the local stores to try it & they were great. In fact the last two days I've had little cracker sandwiches for lunch. They're not as good as saltines or ritz but honestly when you pile all the goodies on them you can't really tell. I also tried the suggestion on the box of putting a slice of banana, honey & cinnamon on the cracker & omg! heaven!
