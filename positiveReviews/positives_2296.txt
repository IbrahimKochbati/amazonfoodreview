I ordered these fortune cookies as rewards for my students each time they passed a multiplication test (to go along with the theme "Fortunately we know our math facts").  The majority of the cookies arrived still in tact.  I understand that with shipping there are bound to be a few  oken cookies.  I am very please with the product and the customer service.  I will definitely be ordering again in the future and will make sure I refer my family and friends to this business.
