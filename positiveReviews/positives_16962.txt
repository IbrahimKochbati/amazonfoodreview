We give this toy with a cup of food in it for our five month old dobie.  It took him a very short time to figure it out, but now knows if he turns it upside down the food comes out.  Now our dinner times are enjoyable for everyone!  He does use it as a chew toy also, but a word of warning:  As I was inspecting the bottle the other day, I noticed that the screw off bottom was cracked on the side (it has spent ALOT of time being used as a molar teething toy).  We will definitely be getting another one!
