These seeds turn puffy and expand when they soak in water. Then, they can be added to drinks for texture. They have a very slight licorice flavor. The notable experience using these seeds is that they add texture to drinks. Some traditional Indian drinks use them. I have, however, used them in cold teas, juices, and other mixtures. It is said that they can cool the core temperature of the body. I have not experienced this.
