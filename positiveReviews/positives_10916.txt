These must be yummy because my beagle loves them.  She really looks forward to her "treat".  They are crunchy and I like that they are healthier than most of the dog treats on the market.  Only downside is that I like to give very small treats and they are hard to  eak apart.  Of course my Zoey doesn't mind.  I will be looking for these in our local stores.
