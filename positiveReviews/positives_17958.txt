I've loved this product for a long time. The chicken variety too. It's a great, crispy alternate to frying. You can use egg to coat, or my suggestion is water milk  same effect. This can be a tad expensive to buy in stores, depending how often you use it, and there are genererics like "Oven Fry." This can also be used in meatloaf, or a substitution for  eadcrumbs in any recipe. The product is good and tasty on it's own, but for chicken I suggest mixing with garlic powder or other seasoning. For the pork, I suggest seasoning salt or other seasoning for taste. Alone, the meat with Shake N Bake coating is a bit bland.
