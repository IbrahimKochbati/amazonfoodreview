This coffee has an average taste with no major undertones. It has a lighter taste than what I am accustomed to (Starbucks) so I had to use more to acheive the same flavor density. I couldn't tell any flavor difference between the decaf and non decaf versions, and since I'm cutting back on caffeine, this has become a welcome staple in my home. It made a nice iced coffee as well.
