I love macadamia nuts and usually buy the Mauna Loa  and @ Costco.  I decided to take a chance on this  and and I am very impressed.  The nuts are huge, crunchy and very fresh.  I know other reviewers have complained about receiving rancid nuts.  I guess I got lucky.  I highly recommend them.  You'll be glad you bought them.
