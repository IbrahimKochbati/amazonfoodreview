The bottles are about 4 inches tall. Since I've never had white truffles before, I don't have much to compare them to, LOL.  But I wanted to try some white truffle oil, and this was affordable.  I'm planning to try some baked potato slices, and drizzle a bit on those (saw on TV cooking show). I tried it with some steamed clams, and it was ok.  If I find a use I really like for white truffle oil, I'll order again.  Prefer the black truffle salt I got at the same time.
