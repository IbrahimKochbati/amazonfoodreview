I use a double batch to emulate the Toll House cookies and they turn out quite well.  A lot of chocolate chunks in them.  My sister bought some other  and (forget the name) and the cookies were anemic looking with just 1 chunk per cookie.  They were also much drier.  When I do use a single batch for cookies I take them out just before they look like they are done and continue baking on the cookie sheet.  Nice and moist!
