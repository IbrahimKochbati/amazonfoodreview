Been curious about Stonewall since reading all the Amazon reviews but not sure about spending $$$ for a pancake mix.  The other day, found a big can at Sur La Tab store in San Francisco for only $10.95, so I thought, why not, this is my chance to try.  I was so looking fwd to Saturday morning and made it first thing today....all I can say is, underwhelming, nothing special.  I tried it following the instructions but using low fat milk and "healthier" butter, it was alright, but not great esp. considering the price.  Then I doctored it up a bit, added madagascar vanilla, flaxseed and psyllium which I usually do with my pancakes, tasted a bit better. Overall rating, 3 stars, just ok, stuck with the can so we'll eat it, but will not purchase again.  I will probably try it next time with full fat milk and butter as it recommended to see if that makes a difference, it probably does. I highly recommend Garvey's Organic Pancake Mix, also here in Amazon, tastes so much better and fluffier.  If you like 100% whole grain pancakes, we also love Kodiak Buttermilk mix, also here on Amazon...healthy, hearty and so good, even my kids love it...and best of all it's just add water, makes it portable, we even took it with us on vacay to Hawaii.
