I received the packets of Frozen Hot Chocolate for Christmas and just tonight whipped up my first batch. Very quick and easy to do, just need a blender, ice and milk. It is amazing! A rich wonderful chocolate flavor! I told my husband I am going to need a constant supply of this stuff, I am addicted already! Definately a treat worth buying!
