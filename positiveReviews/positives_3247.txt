I really love this product, I think it is a great overall flour replacement in your kitchen but I just felt the size was a bit small. I would have really loved to see the box be larger, I think there are three cups total in the box. Overall the product is amazing though. Everything I've made with it has come out wonderfully and all of the recipes online via Bisquick's website are easy to follow and come out very good. I'd highly recommend this product to anyone. My favorite things to make are the biscuits, I add a little cheddar to them to make them oh so good and the apple "pie" which is more like a coffee cake but good either way! Give it a shot if you are GF!
