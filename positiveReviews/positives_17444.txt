The short ead arrived well packaged and intact, no  oken cookies in the three boxes I have opened so far. I later realised that the price was not that great (at 24 per 6 packs, it came to about  dollars a box)   there was a 2 for 5 dollars deal at my local Sprouts around Christmas. However, since I don't buy these often and the ordering is more convenient than shopping around, I did not feel bad about paying a bit more.
