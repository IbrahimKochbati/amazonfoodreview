I almost can't put into words how much I love this product   the packaging, the flavor, the health benefits, the price (especially with the subscription discount)   fabulous!  The vinaigrette recipe on the can is phenomenal   I mix up a couple of cups of it and keep it in a squeeze bottle in the fridge, use it on greens, antipasto, and grilled chicken.  I use the oil straight for the finishing touch on a lot of items.  Recently I found myself with a last minute invitation to dinner and not a lot of ingredients in the house to throw together a contribution   settled on a white bean  uscetta with a drizzle of this oil, and people swooned.  It elevates everything it touches.
