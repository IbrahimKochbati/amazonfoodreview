I learned to drink coffee black and cheap and have never varied much from that.  Strong is fine so long as it isn't bitter.  Complexity is okay if you can find it cheap or if someone else is paying for the cup, but there's no need to get carried away.  It's just coffee.          This Melitta  and (Cafe Collection Classique Supreme) is quite smooth and tasty.  If the cost was comparable to the big cans of Chock Full o'Nuts at BJ's I'd happily buy it.  But it just doesn't taste enough better for it to cost much more.
