I tried this product about 2 years ago and it was just like movie theatre popcorn at that time but since that time, they must have changed the product and now tastes more like a microwave popcorn that lacks flavor.  The packaging has changed to include a separate salt butter flavor compartment and the oil is now a liquid instead of a solid. Very disappointed in this product and sadly I now have 23 packets remaining.
