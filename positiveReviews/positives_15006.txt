Expensive little buggers   sixty cents for a piece of candy is pretty steep.  But they're almost worth it.  These yummy little pillows of chocolate with espresso syrup centers are downright addictive, and really do make an almost acceptable substitute for a cup of coffee those times you're unable to manage a cup of hot liquid.          You could order a smaller package to make sure you like them, but if you like coffee and chocolate (and what's not to like?) you'll like these.
