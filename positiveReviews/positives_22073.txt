Wasabi peas are one of my favorite snacks, and finding these on Amazon has allowed me to indulge often while getting a great deal. They are crunchy and flavorful, and with a good dose of protein and fiber, these make a great healthy snack that is satisfying too. Also good if you have a cold or allergies. These wasabi peas are really good, but they aren't the best I have ever had. I really like the ones that have a lot of wasabi coating on them, even so the whole pea is covered, and I find that with this  and, there tend to be many peas with minimal coating on them. I like to feel a split second of intense regret after putting a wasabi pea in my mouth and feeling my sinuses about to implode before the spice dissipates, and these will do that if you put a solid handful in your mouth all at the same time. Maybe I have been eating too many wasabi peas and have built up some tolerance. Nonetheless, they still pack a good spicy kick overall, and are really crunchy without being too hard. The price of these is fantastic and as far as I know, you can't find a better deal out there for this level of quality, which is good because once you start they are hard to put down. I get the big bag and store them in empty pasta sauce jars or plastic food storage containers, and I like to split some up into single serving bags to take on the go. Maybe I am a little spoiled by Amazon, but shipping on these was slower than what I was expecting, as it has taken over a week both times I have ordered   but that certainly doesn't mean I won't order again! If you are a wasabi pea lover like me, give these a shot! You will be in snacking happyland for as long you can make these last.
