My monster lab is very very picky about his "treats."  There are few that he will eat.  In spite of many failed attempts at finding a treat he will eat, I still try just about every new product I can find in hopes of finding "the one."  These are THE ONES!  I love the quality healthy ingredients and he loves to eat them!  He begs for them, which is a first.  He seems to like how crunchy they are as well..really savors them instead of swallowing them whole like he does most small food sources!
