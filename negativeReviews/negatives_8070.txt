We bought this coffee as a replacement for Lavazza Supercrema while my wife cannot drink caffeine, and found it of uneven quality. We use it for making espresso in a Saeco Odea Giro, which  ews consistently high quality espresso from the Supercrema beans. However, some of the espressos from this decaf were excellent while other  ews had a bit of a weird taste. Whether it's due to the visible inhomogeneity of the beans, I cannot tell. Or maybe this coffee is for what it says: drip coffee. Either way, we'll keep looking for better espresso beans. : )
