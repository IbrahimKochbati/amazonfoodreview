If you want a mild cup of tea that still has a decent aroma and flavor, this will do the trick. Wonderful for drinking with "biscuits" and other mild cookies or cake. Wonderful when you just want something that feels like you are pampering yourself. Good for a steambath facial, too. I steeped one bag five minutes by accident, but it still was delicate.
