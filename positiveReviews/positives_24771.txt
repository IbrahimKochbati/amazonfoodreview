This is a better than average gourmet popcorn.  It is the same variety as that sold as Fireworks  and Orchard Harvest, but seems to be a bit crisper after popping and the taste is better.  It is nearly hulless, smallish kernels, good flavor.  If you prefer "Orville Redenbacher" type flavor, this may not be the popcorn for you. Pops beautifully in a hot air popper.  We'll buy this again.
