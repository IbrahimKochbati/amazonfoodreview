After enjoying my first four Fresh Mixer varieties I had high hopes for this one as well.  Unfortunately, this one fell flat.  The sauce lacks flavor and the dish was somewhat sickening.  Having ordered a box of six, I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the others.  This one would be better off as dog food.  I do recommend the Zesty Marinara Penne, Rotini Meat Sauce and Southwestern Chicken though.
