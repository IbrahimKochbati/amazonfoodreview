I have used this product for the last 55 plus years, it has been used by my family     for generations. I have recently tried other products that have taken this out of their     product and the taste is not the same. I will not give up the satisfaction of enjoying     the best flavor for some health nut's opinion that it isn't good for you. Also , the     reason I buy this online, when I came from the east coast I found that I couldn't get     this product in the stores here on the west coast.  It was really a blessing to realize     that I didn't have to give it up or have family send it to me.
