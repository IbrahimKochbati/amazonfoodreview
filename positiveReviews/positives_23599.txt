This "peanut butta" is amazing.  Hands down my favorite candy bar dessert.  I eat it regardless of weather or not I'm exercising just because its so good.  Not too sweet, and the size is good for quick snack, plus it's filling.  What more could you ask for?          So why 4 stars and not 5?  because it's pricey.  Can't help it, but at $1.5 a pop they really add up quick.
