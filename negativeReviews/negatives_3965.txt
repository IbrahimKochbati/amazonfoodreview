I liked this flavor a lot when I had it with the pods that came with my machine...alas, the thrill is gone.  I am most definitely a dark roast fan, but this actually comes closer to bitter.  It can be diluted with some milk, but it's definitely one of those tastes that sticks with you until you  ush your teeth.
