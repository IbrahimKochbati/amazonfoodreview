This is the dried sap from coconut blossoms.  Looks and tastes like really good home made  own sugar, but with a lower glycemic index than sugar...favorable with often more expensive blue agave nectar.  This has replaced all sugar in our house and can be used 1:1 like white sugar.  Aside from the low glycemic index, it has some nice minerals and amino acids.          This pack of six is often sold at a very good price, competing with supermarket  own sugar which is just white sugar that has had a little molasses added back in.          Whether its healthier or better is somewhat irrelevant.  It tastes good, should be better for me, and it doesnt cost an arm and a leg.
