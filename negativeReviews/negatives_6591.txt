Looked forward to trying this popcorn. NOT IMPRESSED. I guess everyone has a different idea about what great popcorn is. And it's expensive, 5 packs for $10. We don't have one of those Whirly Pop pans like they always advertise. Used a large pot instead. Had to add more salt and oil. It was ok    just not great. I will stick to making great popcorn right on my stove and much cheaper. I just use a heavy 3qt saucepan, add popcorn, salt, oil and butter all right in the pan. Much better than any of these store bought kits.
