We have a gluten free household of 5.  No one in our family likes these.  My children (9, 7, &5) are begging me to throw the box away   I think they are afraid I'll sneak one in their lunchbox.  The cookie crumbles leaving a dry mess of rice flour and hardish chewy fruity bits in your mouth.  Have a glass of water nearby if you try these.  I hate to leave a bad review, but there are way better gluten free options out there.          (I won't throw the box away.  I'll pass it on to another gluten free family I know and let them form their own opinion.)
