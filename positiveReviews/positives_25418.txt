I buy these for my 100 pound Rhodesian Lab mix who is a diabetic as well as my 60 pound pitt bull mix. They each get one every evening after my diabetic dog has had his shot as an alternative to the expensive teeth cleaning my vet recommended. By the way, my vet also recommended these chews. They are much cheaper on Amazon.com than at the vet's by far. The dogs really enjoy them and look forward to them every evening. I have noticed less tartar on their teeth as well as fresher  eath.  Because I have large dogs, I buy the x large size; however, the strips do not all come x large. I get an assortment of small, medium, and large. The dogs do fine with the larger ones, but I find I have to watch the Rhodesian Lab closely as he will tend to get choked on the smaller ones. This is also a disappointment to the dogs when one evening they get a chew that may last up to thirty minutes, and the next evening they get one that lasts five or ten minutes.
