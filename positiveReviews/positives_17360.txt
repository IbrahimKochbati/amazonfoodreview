I have limited experience with sencha but I know what I like, and that is a fresh and somewhat flowery smooth taste.  I ordered this on a chance it would be good and am not disappointed. I followed the directions for water temperature and timing and I think that is important. I was then surprised at some immediate side benefits to drinking a few cups of this each day for the first two weeks I received it.  Without having changed anything else about my diet or health supplements, I noticed a minor skin rash that has plagued e for months began to diminish drastically.  It is not totally gone but is no longer noticeable to the casual observer and it has retreated significantly.  It is worth it for just this benefit alone.  I will reorder it but want to find larger quantities i the hope of getting a better price per ounce.
