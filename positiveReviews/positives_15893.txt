Be careful when using this sauces. I almost die from the pain, honestly, and I love hot sauces. Read the instructions for each of them before. I could finally ease the pain in my tongue with yogurt after trying mayonnaise, milk, and sugar. But finally a real hot sauce in the US. Just remember to be cautious and try little by little because it starts to burn your mouth after some seconds not immediately.
