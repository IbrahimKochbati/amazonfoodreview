fun to try.  really, they're just an amazing way to eat lemons.  you can basically squeese lemons in water and it tastes delicious.          I can't tell the difference between  ands.  seem pretty much the same to me...          they make a fun gift.  don't buy them for a mind bending experience, they're not drugs; they're a sort of food sweetener.
