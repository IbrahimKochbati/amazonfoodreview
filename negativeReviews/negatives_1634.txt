This product is tasty    it's carbonated juice (a blend of several juices, mostly apple, grape, tangerine). But the 8.3 ounces costs $1 and contains 140 calories. This is a little rich for me, both economically and calorically. I would recommend this for someone who doesn't mind spending their money and calories on juice.
