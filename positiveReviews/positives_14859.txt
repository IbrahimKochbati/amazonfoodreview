Everyone who knows me knows that my favorite tea is Earl Grey. I've never had Rishi's Earl Grey, and now I'm asking where has it been all my life? This is one of the very best Earl Grey teas I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. It comes in a lovely container, and upon opening it, there is a wonderful fragrance of tea and orange bergamont. The quality of this tea is outstanding, and it makes a very invigorating cup of tea. I used one tablespoon and steeped it in boiling hot water for five minutes. I like my Earl Grey with a little milk and organic stevia (a natural sweetener), and honestly, I was in heaven sipping this. There are a lot of mediocre Earl Grey teas out there, but this one is truly top shelf. Don't hesitate to purchase this if you're a fan of this intoxicating tea!
