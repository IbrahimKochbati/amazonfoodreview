My Mommy let me write my own review about Zuke's Natural Purrz. It's absolutely purr fect! Mommy found Natural Purrz at her local co op. When I smelled the bag, I got excited! When she popped one into my mouth, I wuz in love!          At the moment, the co op is out of stock, which is why Mommy checked to see if Amazon had them. She says it's available thru a reseller but the shipping costs are a lot. But she's going to have to do SOMETHING because I miss my Purrz. No cat should be without them!
