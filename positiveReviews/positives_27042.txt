So many ranch dressings that are low fat or lower calorie taste terrible.  Not so with Heinz Ranch dressing.  It is so easy to keep two or three packets in my purse so that I always have them with me when eating out.  No now worry about spoiling a salad with the dressing offered by the resturant!  Thanks for a great product; I will order again.
