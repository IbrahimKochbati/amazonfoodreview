We were very disappointed in this product. I had read the reviews and was expecting a delicious, theater quality popcorn. I popped it according to directions in our stove top Whirley Pop. The popcorn was not tender at all, tasted old and chewy, with a lot of the hard hull remaining on the popped product.  The popcorn also had a very strange heavy after taste and an odd smell. Another reviewer mentioned a slight coconut oil after taste, this was not slight but very pronounced. Our kids, who can each eat a bag of popped corn a piece during a movie  even if it's scorched, didn't like it at all. We each took a couple of bites and threw the entire bowl out. It was awful! If I can, I will return it and ask for a refund....if I can't, I will toss it out. I won't even donate it to the food bank...it was that bad.
