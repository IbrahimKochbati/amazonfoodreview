My dog won't chew rawhides or any bone really, I've tried them all. After spending $350 to get his teeth cleaned, and getting 15 teeth pulled due to decay, I was on a mission to find something he'd chew on to help clean his teeth. He LOVES these!He's around 12 lbs.  I think the bones are a little on the small side, so next time I'll go up a size, so it'll last longer.
