Some have already speculated on flavor, so I won't go into that. But some have said how it tastes like an energy drink that has gone flat. Two words: club soda. I've used old water bottles and filled them with club soda, squirting Mio Green thunder energy until it becomes a 'mountain dew ish' color (about two squirts) and it's like a whole new drink. It's like a generic  and of an energy drink or soda, but without the damaging sugar that dentists cringe at.
