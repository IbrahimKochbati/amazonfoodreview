My dogs love these... either straight up, or crumbled on food they would otherwise not eat.  They don't get sick of them and almost never ever reject them.  They do quite often reject other treats, and certainly after a while of the same other treats.  But then tend to always enjoy these. In fact, I have to be careful not to over feed them these because I don't know if they are healthy to eat in quantity.  Certainly not for my wallet.  They do last a LONG time though, especially compare to their weight.  However, dogs wolf them down quite quickly.  I highly recommend you reward you doggies with some!
