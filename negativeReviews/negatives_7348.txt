There have been ongoing problems with dented and leaking cans with this product.  But my dogs HAVE to have it for their digestion, so I ordered a case somewhat reluctantly.          In the first shipment I received, the cans were so badly dented that they looked like they had either been dropped from a considerable height or beaten with machetes.  One was actually leaking.  What's worse, the cans around the outside were apparently undamaged and had the damage turned to the INSIDE   and every badly damaged can was on the interior of the package.  That would seem to indicate that they were repacked to hide the damage    otherwise the worst damage would be on the OUTSIDE.          Good news:  Amazon cheerfully and without complaint replaced the bad cans, and while the replacement cans had a few dents they were not severe and nothing was leaking.          That said, the pumpkin itself is not as good as Libby's solid pack.  It's very watery, and there are black flecks throughout.  I wouldn't use it for pies, but the dogs don't seem to care and it does them no harm.
