While it may be good for sea sickness, motion sickness, and morning sickness, I have not used it for those.  (I sure would have tried it in my navy years, but that was long before I discovered them).          But I find it very good for sore throats and congestion.  Almost as good as ginger tea.  Not bad tasting either.
