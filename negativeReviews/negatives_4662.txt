My cat George never quite finishes a 6 ounce can of cat food, so I thought I would try these 3 ounce servings. However, George is not terribly fond of people food, and he has only finished one of the cans that I have given him so far   the Sesame Chicken, as it turns out. He clearly likes the  oth in the Chicken Pot Pie, but he doesn't finish his vegetables, or even all of the chunks of chicken.          Of course, we can hardly blame him for abandoning one can to attempt to get into the turkey liver I was cutting up. Some people food is too good for cats to pass up!
