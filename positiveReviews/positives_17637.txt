I did not expect such a bold taste from this coffee, also I made it in a 10 cup pot and it is really suited to a 12 cup pot unless you like your coffee pretty strong.     For a low acid coffee, it does not taste any different and is notable for the strikingly bold taste.          If anything it is a little too bold however, very, still very drinkable and supposedly good for acid reflux sufferers like me.          I am contemplating buying a supply of this coffee but really would like something a little less bold!          A good coffee which will be popular with a lot of people~
