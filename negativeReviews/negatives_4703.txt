UPDATE to the review below: First I'd like to downgrade this to a two star, but the system won't let me...well, would a 1 & 1 2 actually, but it really won't let me do that.          NEITHER cat ever became fond of this, and we stopped using it completely when I found two 1" bones and several smaller bone chunks in one of the cans of the "Snapper" flavour.          ORIGINAL REVIEW: We have two cats: Bruegel, a 16 year old female who is very petite and very picky, and Banjo, a 7 year old male who is very large and quite indiscriminate in his choice of what to eat. Bruegie mostly only likes wet food especially tuna (Sheba Tuna entr&eacute;e is her favorite)...oh, and cheese; we call her the cheese monger. Banjo mostly likes dry food; he has become carbo kittie...he begs for  ead and crackers.          Now that the intended consumers have been introduced, here's their review: Eh, I'm bored.          When I looked at the can, I was overjoyed. No wheat gluten and all natural ingredients plus a few vitamins. When I opened the first can, I was even happier; Bruegie likes the foods with more liquid in them and these are fish chunks and lots of liquid. However, when I set the plates down, they were ignored. When it was time for clean up, most of the food was still there. We have now gone through every flavour in the box...with the same result.          The first time we set down a can of Sheba (which wasn't too long ago) Bruegie was all over it and Banjo tried to muscle in. When we are feeding her something she can tell is her favorite (from the smell when we open the can, I suppose,) Bruegie will beg...none of that.          All that said, as any cat owner will tell you, EVERY cat is different... and next week, we might be looking at clean plates, but for now the Capehart Stephenson Kitties are having none of this. The three stars are for the ingredients, hopefully your cats will like it more than ours.
