I was drinking lots of tea from the local Jewel, Tetley's British blend. So when I saw this I thought it was an opportunity to try something better. Indeed its a lot better tea, does get strong nicely and I use skim milk. It tastes much better obviously than the Tetley in a box, its full bodied, but it did not have a refreshing taste.     The reason I say that is I was drinking some other Assam team from a store in Cleveland(Teavana) and that was very refreshing, full bodied. Likely it wasn't organic. Obviously the price at Teavana for a few oz. was a lot more per oz. than the Banaspaty tea, so it has that going for it.     The Twinings are pretty good, likely they have their own tea estate, but my guess is the tea estates vary in flavor.     But, hey, remember where I came from, Tetley's bags to Assam Banaspaty. Big leap for me.
