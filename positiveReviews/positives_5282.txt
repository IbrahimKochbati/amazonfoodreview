All of the Switch drink flavors taste good and go down refreshing, but this was the one that made me skeptical until I opened the can. It does taste like fresh tangerines, and the flavor is  ight and not weak or watery. There's just enough fizz to add some interest, but none of the bad stuff people like to avoid in a soda: you know, artificial flavors and colors, preservatives and all that. It's just juice with fizz. In fact, it's good juice with fizz!
