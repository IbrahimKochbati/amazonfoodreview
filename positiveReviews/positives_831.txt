Due to my husband's and son's inability to eat gluten, cornstarch is used very frequently in many gluten free recipes.  I am very concerned with the prolific use of GMOs in corn especially and my family's increased consumption of it.  I wanted to find an affordable GMO free cornstarch product to use in all my baking.  Rumford Natural Cornstarch is the one!  I've been using it for months now with great success & satisfaction.
