I've tried many different  ands of rose jams and was alway disappointed because they were too sweet with very little flower flavoring. I'm so glad I found the Kafka  and of Rose Preserves because this tastes exactly as it should with subtle aroma of rose (you know you're getting the real thing in the Kafkas  and because you can see some bits of the petals in the jam!). This is great alone on toast, or paired with cream cheese or goat cheese. Even scoop some on a good  and of vanilla ice cream. Be creative! This is delicious!
