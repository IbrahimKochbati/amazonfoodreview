These are great!  If you've ever tried to hold a cat and stuff a pill (that they most have) down their throat...you might get away with it the first or second time, but they don't tolerate it for very long...they see you coming!  With pet pockets they practically knock you down to get the "treat".  I highly recommend this product...my cat loves the chicken.
