I bought this product to make frozen lattes and it has worked great for that purpose.  I add the mix to milk, espresso, and ice and throw it in a blender.  This holds the drink together so the parts don't separate.  It has recipes on the back of the package if you need help creating drinks and getting proportions correct.
