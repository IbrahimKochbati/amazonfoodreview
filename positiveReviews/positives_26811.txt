La Sa ozita Homestyle Tomatillo Salsa is simply delicious. I prefer green to red sauce and I've found one I really like. I've used it on tacos, burritos, and enchiladas, I've even mixed it with sour cream and used it for a dip. I can't understand why I can't get it here. I just hope Amazon continues to carry it.
