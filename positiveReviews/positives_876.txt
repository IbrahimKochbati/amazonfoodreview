My cats (7 of them) love this food so I was glad to see Amazon is carrying it again. The local stores do not carry a 15 lb bag, only the 3.5lbs and 12 lbs. This food is sealed very well, and is fresh. I have tried expensive  ands and really cheapo  ands of cat food, and so far 9 lives agrees very well with my cats. This food does not "rifle" through them or cause overly offensive litter pan odors (like cheapo cat food) and their digestive and urinary tracts are all healthy. My cats ages range from 3 years to 18 years old, and believe me, this 9 Lives  and and flavor are something they all like. The price is a really good deal especially for prime as the shipping is free.          I also buy the Iams in the orange bag for my cats for a variety and putting some of that in a bowl dry as well as wetted down with water in another bowl is something they really love. Again, no intestinal issues or litter pan issues as they have been eating this combination for several years now.          If you do try this, or switch your cat(s) over, be patient as it may take a week or so for your cats digestive system to adjust. In the end, I think you will be very pleased with the quality and price.          Also, we used to take in foster cats, and fed them this 9 Lives  and, and they all did very well.
