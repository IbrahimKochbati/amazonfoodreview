I have told any number of people when I can't find something I immediately go to Amazon and voila there it is and most times at the best price also!  With this particular item had it in California where it was readily available here on East coast not at all.  Found it once and never again and since it was super market item asked for it to be ordered only to be told if it's not in the wharehouse we don't open 'new' orders.     Just on a lark checked here and here it is.  Ordered a case.     Love it best canned soup I ever tasted why because it parallels the taste of the homemade cream of turkey soup my mom used to make.  What a find!
