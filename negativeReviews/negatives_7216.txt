I wantd to make the Barefoot Contessa's recipe for strawberry scones, which calls for dried strawberries.  Expecting to get something akin to dried cranberries or raisins, I was disappointed, these should be called candied strawberries since they hardly resembled fruit and were coated in sugar.  They were OK in the recipe, but I can't feel good about feeding these to my family.  Save your money (they are pricey!)and use craisins instead   or just go for chocolate.
