I have a 3 month old puppy that is teething right now, so I thought these would be good for him. I thought that, this treats being hard that he would gnaw on them for a while to keep him busy. Nope, he either had no interest in it, or lost interest in it fast. And now, I have these square treats lying around my house.          These don't really look like treats, and my puppy really doesn't know what to do with it. He might be too young for these? But, I didn't see an age requirement on the bag. I don't know, these treats remind me of something you would give a hamster, rabbit or gerbil to chew on.          I read a lot of review on here saying their dogs just love this and wanted more. My dog acts like I am giving him a rock. He did play with the treat a bit and carried it around the house. But, I don't think he has finished one completely.
