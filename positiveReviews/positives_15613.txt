yes, that's right, our family has 10 cats (all rescues), so you can imagine I was pretty stoked when this product came up for review.          Now, since I have so many cats, my cats normally only get can food as a treat, maybe once a month. About a third LOVE can food, a third can take it or leave it, and the last third do not like can food at all. When I tried this product on my cats, over two thirds gobbled it up, only one or two showed no interest, and one (who has a sensitive stomach anyway) got sick within five minutes of consumption.          The product has a lot of "juice", which I find my cats tend to enjoy. The smell wasn't overpowering like many cat foods.     In conclusion, I'd buy Petite Cuisine for my cats but only as a treat.     3.5 stars.
