This product is BEYOND AMAZING! I have been cooking pancakes in assorted ways for four decades. And, for home use, no other product comes close to this Bisquick Gluten Free Mix. It is superior not only to every gluten free product on the matter; it is ALSO superior to every other mix (gluten free or not) on the market. Friends and family are constantly amazed and surprised when I serve them  eakfast. So, to everyone and anyone, don't make the mistake of associating this Bisquick product w  other gluten free products that result in food that tastes like cardboard.     Last thought: Thanks to Amazon for making it available as a subscription purchase, since I can no longer find it in any South Florida supermarkets.
