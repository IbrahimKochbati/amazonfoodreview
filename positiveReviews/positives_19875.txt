First became acquainted with these in Italy. They sold them at the "Auto Grills" at rest stops along the "Autostrada" (their version of the turnpikes here in the States). When we got back, found out that I could order them through Amazon. I like to order them by the case as they are only available during the Fall and Winter months.          Love the unique blend of expresso coffee and dark chocolate. The chocolate surounds a liquid center of expresso, which when you bite into it blends with the chocolate to make a wonderful mocha taste. Have found nothing here in the states which comes even close to this. would give it 10 stars if I could. A great product, and a great value in this packaging. (If you want to give these as gifts, the case containing the "5 piece" packages is a great alternative. We did that for the holidays last year.)
