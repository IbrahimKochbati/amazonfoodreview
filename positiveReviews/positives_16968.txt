This toy keeps our Boston Terrier entertained for a long time.  We don't give it to her all the time to keep it new and interesting.  It is not easy to get the food out of the toy, which really frustrates her.  She'll start barking at it and going at it harder.  Other reviewers said their dogs got the hang of it quickly and were able to "beat" the system, but I don't see that happening with our dog.  It is still a bit of randomness with how the food comes out, so what worked for the dog one time, might not the next.  You can make it harder or easier depending on the size and shape of food you use.
