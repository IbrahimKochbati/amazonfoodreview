I've read the reviews from people who have had problems   and Amazon currently shows this note:     "Item Under Review     While this item is available from other marketplace sellers on this page, it is not currently offered by Amazon.com because customers have told us there may be something wrong with our inventory of the item, the way we are shipping it, or the way it's described here. (Thanks for the tip!)     We're working to fix the problem as quickly as possible."          I bought one box (24 ct.) in July and didn't have any problems.  Then I bought 3 boxes on 8 1   I haven't had any problems with them yet, either.          That's good, because this is by far my favorite decaf.  I hope they get the problems fixed quickly   I'd hate to have to settle for something else.          This blend is made by Green Mountain   I think they usually make a quality product.
