I love this  and of chips. By far, I like the cheddar potato the best. Second in line is the sour cream, and third is the BBQ. I recently bought 12 bags of Cheddar on Amazon!     These are much better than those baked chips out on the market (in my opinion). Oh, and an FYI, these are way better than rice cakes people keep comparing the two and I totally disagree).     The 0.8 oz bag is perfect single size (pretty generous actually).     Yummy!
