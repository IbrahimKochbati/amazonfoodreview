I bought these jimmies because I couldn't find the needed orange color in any of my local stores.  A pound of jimmies is a lot, but I went through more than I expected, probably half the bag to thoroughly coat a recipe of chocolate truffles.  The taste is, well, jimmy taste.  My only disappointment surprise was how short these jimmies are    about two thirds of the length of Wilton and CakeMate  ands I have in the cupboard.          If you need a special color that only CK makes, don't hesitate to get them.             Debbie Lee  Wesselmann
