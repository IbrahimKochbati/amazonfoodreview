These are wonderful treats for cleaning your dog's teeth.  I occasionally  ush my dog's teeth, but I wasn't making any headway on some plaque buildup I had noticed.  I gave him 1 of these each day, for a few days and the plaque deposits had started to  eak up.  It's now a routine for him to get 1 of these each day.  I like them better than greenies.
