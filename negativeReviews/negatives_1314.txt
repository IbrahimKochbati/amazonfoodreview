Hi, i ordered this product from another website but i wanted to post a review on here since it has the same product.     Okay first of all the packaging looks nice and neat not messy like others, just pure and simple...maybe too simple?.     they dont give the ingredients info which is an automatic fail, on the back it says "allergy warning CONTAINS: SOY"  another fail     they dont tell us what the gum does, does it whiten teeth? fight bad  eath? or what!? you know...          it has the word "Vitality, which means active" but thats all they say nothing more?....          the taste is like any other gum
