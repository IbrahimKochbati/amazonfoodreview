This Hickory Smoked flavor is my favorite of the Primal Strips lot. The strips are moist, tender, unusually flavorful, and just the right size. Even my carnivorous relatives in Wisconsin took to these Strips. My only outstanding concern is that Primal Strips are manufactured in Taiwan, which  means their production is outside the domain of US food safety and inspection. However, having consumed over two dozen of these strips in the past month, I remain happy and healthy.
