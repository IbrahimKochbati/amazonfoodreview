I purchased this item as an alternative to traditional K cups in an attempt to save money; however, this product did not work well in my machine. I followed the directions and read reviews to see what works best, but was not able to use the K cups effectively. The cup itself is too weak and warps in my machine. I compared the shape before and after and there is a big difference; this K cup seems to expand horizontally and vertically because the plastic is not strong enough. Also, the K cup is shaped differently from the traditional K cup. This is neccessary because it does not use foil as a topper, but does not seem to work. In the end, I had to clean up several coffee explosions in my kitchen to figure out how it works, but still could not use it effectively. Maybe I am not doing something correctly, but I'm sure there is also an issue with the product itself. While I do like the idea, I would not suggest purchasing this product until the bugs are worked out.
