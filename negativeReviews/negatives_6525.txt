Received the wrong item and called to complain.  The person who answered the phone was completely unprofessional and sounded incoherent.  At first he told me he could help me then told me to call back when a SUPERVISOR was available. Next call, my credit card company.  I almost neglected to mention that the incorrect order I received contained a packing slip with someone else's address and credit card info.  Scary stuff here.
