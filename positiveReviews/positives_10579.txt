I love Pork Rinds and these are great! I've never tried or even seen rinds that need to be cooked before eating and in my search for another  and I have ordered from the East Coast, I came across these. They puff up into delicious warm flavorful snacks. Low carb munchies! Try a little parmesan cheese or garlic to mix it up a bit.
