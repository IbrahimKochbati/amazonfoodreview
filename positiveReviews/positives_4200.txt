I have been very pleased with this variety pack of baby food. The pack contains three each of pears, peaches oatmeal banana, apples and apricots, and peaches bananas and raspberries. My 6 1 2 month old daughter loves all of them, especially the peaches bananas and raspberries! I have been very satisfied with Earth's best with one exception. The metal lids have a lining that contains BPA (as do ALL lids on glass babyfood jars), so if you're set on staying away from BPA, you'll want to get your baby food from companies that make pouches, like HappyBaby and Plum Organics. I make a lot of my own babyfood, so I feel that feeding her SOME food from glass jars is acceptable, especially for varieties that I can't make. I do also buy a lot of HappyBaby, and I'm very satisfied with the quality there also. All in all though, a very nice variety of good tasting fruits!
