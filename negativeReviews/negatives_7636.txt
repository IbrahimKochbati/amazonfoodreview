For an oatmeal cookie I was very surprised at how dry these were; usually oatmeal cookies, and particularly commercially produced ones, are super soft.  Definitely needed a glass of milk to get it down.  On the positive side, there were quite a bit of almonds    larger bits at that    which are often promised but not delivered.  The chocolate chunks were not plentiful but I didn't mind that as much as I don't like big hunks of chocolate in my cookies; chocolate lovers might be a bit disappointed.  Due to the dryness of this cookie I wouldn't be likely to purchase these in the store as I really prefer a much moister cookie.
