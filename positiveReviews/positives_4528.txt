Flavor 5 STARS:  First time I used the oil I poured some in a saute pan to scramble some eggs. It ended up being an earthy mushroom like flavor. I loved it.  I pour it on my dogs food occasionally and they love it.  I wanted to buy this originally because I watched the Dr. OZ tv show and he recommended ingesting a little every day for its anti inflammatory properties.  I gave some oil to my Aunt who has an auto immune disease and she likes the oil as well. I would definitely buy this product again.          Ding for metal alloy container: It is cheap metal and though it was packaged well by Amazon.com the containers probably got dented in Amazon's warehouse because it didn't seem like the packaging should have caused the dents.  The way it was packaged if there was any damage it would probably only be dents to the containers so I would say "expect" dents with any shipment of oils if this company uses the same cheaper kind of metal alloy for their containers.  Dents do not make the product taste worse so I do not worry about the taste.  I will return it if the containers leak but that would not stop me from ordering again.  However, the odds of leaking happening probably statistically is not "often" if you receive shipments regularly.
