This is the best maple syrup I have tasted. It has the perfect balance of sweetness and maple flavor. My kids normally will not use maple syrup because of the strong taste ( I have tried several) but they love this one. A great mild maple flavor with just the right amount of sweetness. I am glad I tried it!
