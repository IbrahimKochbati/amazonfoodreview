I'd give this 5 stars if they'd leave the seasoning out of the can   I'm not going to eat 4 tablespoons of seasoning! So I don't want to pay for it (you're paying by the ounce) and I certainly don't want to sift through the seasoning to get all the little pieces out of it at the end. Overall   they taste excellent, they are very light & crunch & the seasoning does taste good, if only there wasn't so much of it.
