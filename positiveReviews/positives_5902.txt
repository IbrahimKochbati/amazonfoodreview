We wanted to use milk that was lactose free and close to  east milk.  We began using this milk to supplement my  east milk and we now use it full time.  My baby has never had an allergic reaction to it and he doesn't spit up.  It's gentle on his stomach and Amazon has it at an inexpensive price.  I would suggest this milk to any parent that prefers something different than cow's milk.
