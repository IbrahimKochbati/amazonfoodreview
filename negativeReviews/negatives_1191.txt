I've been feeding Wellness grain free for a while now and all three of them love it. I ordered the Felidae last time because the Wellness was no longer eligible for free shipping and the Felidae was   which makes the difference between whether it is a better deal to order it or buy it at Petco  ick and mortar....None of my cats will eat it. They actually at NOTHING for the past 2 days since the only thing offered them was the Felidae. I  oke down today and gave them a back up can of 9 Lives grain free and they are happily curled up and purring now. I think Felidae is a high quality food and I only feed the lower quality grain free food on rare occasion, but the rest of this case will be donated to my local shelter. Hopefully, something there will like it. I'm off for the trip to Petco for the Wellness.
