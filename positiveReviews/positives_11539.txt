This is the second 6 pack I am having. I am used to having my tea with milk since childhood but wanted to turn vegan. If I follow the same process to make tea with same ingredients and leave out milk, it will be too bitter. I went all over the place and tried a zillion different kinds of tea and this one is the best. I am a 100% vegan now.          I travel a lot. The coffee at gas stations and hotels is usually cheap and I hate it. I carry a handful of these and use it in hot water at gas stations or coffee maker in hotels.          At home   I drink a LOT of tea. Lot of the spices listed on the packet are readily available at affordable prices at Indian grocery stores but they will be non organic. I have experimented with boiling those with fresh ginger root and long leaf black tea leaves. The output I get is different from Good Earth but inspired by them and equally flavorful. Over few attempts, I learned the proportions and boiling time to perfection. You got to be tea lover to do so much.
