*****     St. Dalfour's Organic Strawberry Tea is a black tea with some very slight strawberry overtones   not enough to make it berry like, but enough to make it different. I enjoyed it very much. I left the tea bag in as I drank the tea (the whole time, much longer than recommended), which turns most teas bitter, but not this one. So far, this has been my experience with all of the St. Dalfour's teas that I have tried, a big selling point for me since I enjoy my teas very strongly  ewed.          St. Dalfour is a French firm that makes natural teas, including this organic tea. There is not a lot of information about them on their web site beyond the basics, but what is there looks good.          St. Dalfour's Organic Strawberry Tea is a nice variation on plain black tea. Note that black tea does contain caffeine.          Definitely recommended.     *****
