At a time of a "pumpkin drought" in the commercial market, when I couldn't find a single can of pure pumpkin in any supermarket, finding this product was a miracle!  We use pumpkin daily, as an addition to our dogs' diets, in order to keep their digestive systems in peak condition.  And Farmer's Market Organic Pumpkin is exceptional. It is slightly thinner in consistency than the store  ands we've previously purchased which makes it excellent for its intended purpose. That it is organic is an added plus.
