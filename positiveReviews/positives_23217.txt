This is the best wheat free  ead mix I've used. The  ead comes out great and can be used for toast and sandwiches. I make it in my  ead machine on the wheat  ead setting and it comes out perfect. I use egg whites instead of whole eggs and soy milk for most of the water and it is soft and rich tasting!
