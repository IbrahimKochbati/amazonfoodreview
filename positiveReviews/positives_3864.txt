As an avid rice cracker fan, I've tried a lot of different varieties, and this is the best as far as taste and availability goes. Obviously some of the best are in the Japanese grocery stores, but at least in my case, they're out of the way most of the time.          The crackers themselves are savory and crunchy  exactly what I look for in this snack (and this particular mix is nothing but crackers!).     Thanks to these, I've stopped trying out the regular grocery store imitations.
