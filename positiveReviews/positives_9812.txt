I was a bit skeptical about these peanuts due to the price premium attached to them, but after I bit into the first one I became a believer.  Each one gives off a satisfying crunch, followed by a much more subtle peanut flavor compared to Planter's.  The use of peanut oil in lieu of the cottonseed oil used in cheaper  ands was also noticeable.
