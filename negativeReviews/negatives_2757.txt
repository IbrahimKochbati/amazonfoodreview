Unfortunately my dear sweet cat did not think this food was so dear or sweet. She only ate it when she knew there would be nothing else and she NEVER finished what I gave her. She normally eats EVERY SINGLE BITE of her food but constantly turned her nose up at this. She really enjoys Bench & Field's Holistic Natural Feline Formula (from Trader Joe's) and also Purina's Naturals Cat Chow. Sorry, Halo, I REALLY wanted her to like this!
