I ordered this pasta because I thought my children would love the animal shapes. Since I am the only GlutenFree in our home, I try to find FUN things for the entire family instead of making 2 separate meals. When I served this at dinner the other night, my husband's expression said it all! He followed his surprised look with "Now This is Pasta!" We could not believe how good this pasta was. We are now hooked! I can not wait to try some more of the OrgraN products.
