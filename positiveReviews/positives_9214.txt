This is a good high fiber  eakfast cereal with a high protein content.  It does contain some sodium, but has a good potassium sodium ratio.  It has some sugar content (evaporated cane juice) and a good flavor.  It generally is found in health food sections of larger supermarkets or in health food stores, and is now available on the Internet.  My main complaint is that retailers do not generally carry the hot cereal equivalent (which I managed to get my friend Lisa to carry in her health food store).
