I had just finished a Theater room in my house and decided the only thing missing was the popcorn! I searched and bought what I thought was the perfect machine and added the gourmet oil and popcorn, turned on the movie and sat back for the movie.  To my surprise, it just wasn't the same, no flavor, not even the smell was the same.  So I searched the web and discovered Great Northern Popcorn in pre measured portion packs.  It was easy, and the result was just like I had dreamed, fresh great tasting popcorn, with the smell of a movie theater.  I highly recommend Great northern Popcorn for any event and any machine, you won't be disappointed.
