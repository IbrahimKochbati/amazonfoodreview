This tea is strong and has a smoky flavor   you can feel the leafy greenness though. It's not very bitter. I think it's a bit expensive for it is   but I haven't found a replacement. I guess we're paying for the fancy packaging, which in my opinion is a real waste, especially when you go through 3 4 cups a day like I do. Ahmed's Gunpowder green tea is stronger and is pretty good, but is available for cheaper than Dilmah's in the local Indian stores.
