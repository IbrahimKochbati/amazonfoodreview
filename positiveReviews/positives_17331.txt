I bought this while I was in the US visiting my parents.  Thai Sweet Chili in general is my favourite type of dipping sauce.  And when I saw this on amazon, with garlic in it (my favourite cooking ingredient), I thought I'd give it a try.  What a lucky find!  This is amazing!  I use it on everything from egg rolls to prawns to chips.  And despite the fact that garlic is my favourite cooking ingredient, I've often come across dishes or condiments where the taste of garlic is too over powering (you can have to much of a good thing).  But they've gotten the balance just right here.  I'll be ordering up several more for family and friends when I'm next in the US!
