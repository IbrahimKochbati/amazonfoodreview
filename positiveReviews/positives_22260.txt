I bought this for my husband who is into trying out hot sauces. Is latest interest is the ghost chili pepper which he tried at this burger place in San Antonio. When I saw this had ghost chili peppers in it, I was sold! I knew he'd love it. He dabbed maybe one drop of the hot sauce on a chip and he said it was HOT!  He loved it. I like how it comes in a wood crate too. Great gift for hot sauce lovers.
