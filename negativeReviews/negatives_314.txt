Are you familiar with the Hormel Compleats line?  If so, put this one in the middle of the pack.  It's not as good as the meatloaf or the meatballs noodles in cream sauce.  It's better than the horribly taste free chicken dressing.  About even with the turkey.  Is that all I've tried?  I forget; but you get the point.  It's medium Compleat.          Are you just thinking about trying a Hormel Compleat for the first time?  OK, then just remember these reviews on Amazon    particularly food reviews    are all simply opinions of customers, no scientific analysis intended (I hope).          Compleats are quick, easy (except for pulling the plastic off the top) and generally edible.  There's not a whole lot more to say about them.  I eat them because I'm an old guy living alone and too often I'm just lazy.  These do come in handy for a quick light meal.  "Light" depending on your appetite and the size of your tummy.          This is a good one to lead off with if you're just now getting into Compleats.  Just note that, in my opinion, it's middle of the road for the line.  Not a lot of flavor; but goes down OK.
