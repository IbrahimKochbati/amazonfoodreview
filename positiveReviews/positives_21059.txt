I first ordered this to try out after purchasing The Vegenomicon, which had recipes using it.  It sounded intriguing, something different, so I ordered from Amazon, I can't find it in my area.  It's a sweet rice cooking wine and there's a lot you can do with it, I don't limit myself to cookbooks.  I've been ordering it from Amazon ever since.  Those who love to cook will love this product.
