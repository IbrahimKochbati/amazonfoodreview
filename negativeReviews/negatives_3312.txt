What is "four ears up"?  Read on, I'll explain later.          The first thing I did when I received the Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley Treats was to read the lable.  Darn near everything is listed as organic.  Whether that is good or bad is a matter of personal opinion and personally, I don't even look for organic food for myself.  Is organic food actually healthier?  I don't know, but for the purposes of this review, that's neither here nor there.  The treats themselves are hard and crunchy and about 1" x 2" in size.  Each is scored so they can be  oken in half.  I preferred to  eak them in half for all my dogs even though none would have had issues with the size.          My house seems to revolve around my 4 rescued dogs, 2 Australian Kelpie mixes, a Yellow Lab mix, and a beautiful Heinz 57, maybe a doberman border collie mix.  Weights run from 30 lbs to 85 lbs.  At one point in their lives, all of them had been abused and I do know for a fact that 2 had been starved.  As a result none are too picky about dog food or treats.  When presented with the Newman's treats for the first time 3 dogs took them quickly, but not as quickly as usual.  One dropped the treat and sniffed it before eating it.  My lab spent about 15 seconds sniffing before she would take it.  When given their regular  and of treats, the lab usually sniffs for just a second before taking it and the others just grab and inhale them.  At another treat time each dog was presented with 2 treats side by side on the floor, one of the Newman's and one of their regular  and.  Two dogs, including the hesitant Lab, chose their regular  and first before eating the Newman's.  The 2nd time I tried that, 3 out of four at their regular  and first.  That pretty much ended the experimentation and I just gave the Newman's treats until they were gone. One of the Kelpies actually refused the Newman's a couple of times which for him was highly unusual since he's usually the first in line at treat time. The others never did seem overly excited about eating organic but did eat them.  When we changed back to the usual  and they scarfed them down as usual.          Now we get to the "four ears up".  When my four are really excited about something they will sit at full attention with their ears completely perked up.  At the treat times when they were being fed the Newman's, they initially started out with perked ears then once they found out what they were getting, their excitement faltered and they seemed somewhat indifferent.  Since there are four dogs with 2 ears each, an "8 ears up" would be a perfect rating where they were excited about eating or doing something.  Since, with the 2 exceptions, they never did refuse the Newman's but ate them without much excitement, these treats get a "four ears up" rating, pretty much middle of the road.          If feeding your dogs organic treats is important to you, definately give thee a try.  Just be forewarned that they may be a bit on the large side for small dogs and they do seem harder and crunchier than some other  ands.  Given the cost and the lackluster response from my dogs, it's highly unlikely that I'll be giving them the Newman's in the future.
