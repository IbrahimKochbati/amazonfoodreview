I have a box of this popcorn and a box of Pop Weaver popcorn. No offense to Pop Weaver popcorn because I think it also tastes great. But I like the flavor of the Great American popcorn better. As for unpopped kernels, yes there are unpopped kernels. I think there will always be unpopped kernels. The trick to good popcorn is to turn the heat off when the popping slows. That's where the unpopped kernels come from. I suspect you could get less unpopped kernels if you like burnt popcorn. As for the taste, I think the taste is pretty close to the theater popcorn. The only difference to me is no hot butter. If you want to go EXACTLY like a theater, buy one of those hot butter melters like the theater has. Otherwise it is a great tasting popcorn. The 8 ounce packets give you a lot of popcorn. I believe I remember the packets for the 8 ounce machine saying it has 10 ounces of popcorn in each bag. Great American popcorn from this store seemed to have the best price I could fine and (in my opinion) is definately better tasting than other types of popcorn.
