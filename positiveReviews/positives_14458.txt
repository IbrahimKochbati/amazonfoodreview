This cereal has great texture (not over processed) and the portion size is generous.  It also is not overly sweetened and has great flavor from the fruit.I became aware of this product through my workplace cafeteria. Unfortunately, when I ordered the peach raspberry oatmeal online, I was sent onion soup instead.  Food items are not returnable, so I am stuck with something that I did not order.
