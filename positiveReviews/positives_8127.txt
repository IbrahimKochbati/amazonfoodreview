I recently bought a Keurig coffee maker and was looking for k cups when I discovered this.  My daughter is a hot chocolate lover and so I decided to give this a try.  If your coffee machine has different size drink settings use smallest size setting otherwise it is too watery but when done on the lowest size setting it makes a very good cup of hot cocoa.  My daughter loves it and has it nearly every morning.  It is very convenient and if you have a Keurig coffee maker and are looking for drink alternatives to coffee this is a good choice.
