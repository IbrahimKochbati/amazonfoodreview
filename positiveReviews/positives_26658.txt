I love eating spicy foods and so I was looking for chips that were really spicy because you can't find it anywhere besides dipping chips in salsa. I have tried all kinds of spicy chips, but this tops it by far. Usually it takes a while of eating the chips to feel that burn on your tongue, but after eating one chip of the Blair's habanero, you instantly get that kick of hotness on your tongue. The chips are nice and crunchy like the kettle cooked chips. I recommend this to any lover of spicy foods. I have already bought this twice on amazon and I will soon have to buy another box because it's just that good.
