The popcorn is very good.  Very fresh. More salt than I like, but able to separate it fairly easy. This was a good value for the money.  I am able to add my own popcorn to the mix to make more.  Next time it is on sale I'll buy some more, glad that I bought two case when I had the chance.  Also it was ship and receive very fast.
