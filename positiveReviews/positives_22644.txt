I have been searching to find that perfect movie theater popcorn that I can make at home; well, I found it! I recently purchased a Stir Crazy popper and this popcorn works great with it. The seasoning and oil combines to make a perfect and delicious batch every time. At first I was concerned about buying such a large quantity of popcorn without knowing how it would taste, but I can already tell that I'll be going through this box fast. A+ recommended!
