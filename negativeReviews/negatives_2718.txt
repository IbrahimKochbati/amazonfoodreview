I'm actually eating candy coated sawdust.          I know that chicory root is a tree... that I'm eating sawdust... but there's so much sugar I can't stop.  It doesn't really taste like caramel to me.  It felt more like drinking maple syrup out of the bottle.  If you've tried it, you'll probably agree.  It's like eating maple syrup.          I'm going to do some research now because I'm having trouble thinking or  eathing.  The beeping from my insulin pump isn't helping.
