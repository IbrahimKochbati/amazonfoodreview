I have enjoyed this tea for the past few months. Having a cup in the morning with a little milk and sugar (or honey). But recently it seems to have vanished from store shelves. I can't find it anywhere except online (thanks Amazon!).          I am looking for a replacement, trying Celestial's Chai and Good Earth Chai. Tazo is too strong. Hopefully I can find one that comes close, looks like the Lipton Spiced Chai will soon be a discontinued item (the lipton web site no longer lists it as a product). Sad.
