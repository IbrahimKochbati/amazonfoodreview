I would have liked to give these 2 and a half stars, because they're basically middle of the road. They taste more or less like a Fig Newton, and you won't miss the fat at all. They are not as soft as Fig Newtons.          These cookies are great if you're on a diet because two of them are only 100 calories, however they are on the small side so you may end up eating more.          I would say that overall, the taste is comparable to a Fig Newton, but slightly more firm in texture and a smaller size. With all things considered, if a box of Fig Newtons and Fig Newmans were sitting on the shelf together, I would probably just go by price and get the cheaper item and not think about the  and.
