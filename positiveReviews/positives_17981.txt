I bought a box of Oregan Chai not expected big things from it as I haven't been happy with these types of packaged drinks before. Anyway, the first time I tried it I used only half of the package as I do not like things too sweet and added some milk to it. Let me tell you, it was awesome. It's creamy and comforting and tastes like real chai, not Starbucks chai.  I have also mixed it with the Starbucks Via coffee, again using only half the package, and it also tasted great. I will totally buy this product again.
