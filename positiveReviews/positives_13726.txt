Simply put...people love it or hate it. I loveeee Nutella! I put it on  ead, Ritz Crackers, Animal Crackers, Rice Cakes and just eat it straight from a spoon on its own! It can be taken anywhere and doesn't require refrigeration. I suggest "icing" yellow cupcakes with it! Delish treat! I think everyone should try Nutella once in their life. Its amazing amazing AMAZING!!!!!!
