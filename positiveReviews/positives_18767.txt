The only thing that I would change about this drink is that I wish it had caffeine in it.          However, even though it's caffeine free, it's one of the best grape sodas that I've ever tasted.  (I'm also very picky.)          It's crisp, has great grape flaver, has the right amount of fizz.....it really is awesome!  It's also clear (not purple colored).
