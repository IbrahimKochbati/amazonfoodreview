These things taste so bad, I could not find anyone in my office who would finish one ON A BET!  They are absolutely foul.  I can't for the life of me figure out how any company would have put these on the market.  when you open them, they smell like pudding, which is a good thing except for when you actually taste them and then you feel like you've been tricked.  They have almost no taste, and the texture of melted plastic.  Another way to describe them is that it is like easting grease, except I think eating grease might be better.  And don't think the chocolate ones will be marginally better.  Snack Pack, shame on you.
