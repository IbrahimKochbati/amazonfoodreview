I was introduced to this in the early 90s and never looked back. It's magic, plain and simple. You really can eat it out of the can... it's that good. Whenever we travel to the east coast, we stuff our suitcases full of these cans and  ing them home for homemade pizza. Nothing comes close. I don't know what the heck they do to make this, but it's unlike any other pizza sauce you'll find.
