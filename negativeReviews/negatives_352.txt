I had high hopes when I ordered this tea, as years ago in San Francisco I used to buy a lovely rose black in Chinatown which was my favorite tea ever. Unfortunately, this blend lacks body and is very high in caffeine. I prefer the opposite, a full bodied tea I can  ew strong without sending my blood pressure through the roof.  But for someone who wants a light tasting tea with a powerful caffeine punch, this might be a good choice.
