I enjoy my Kavli Crispy Thins so much and so often that I now order by the case. Besides being naturally low fat and naturally nutritious, Kavli Crisp Thins are a great replacement for salty, fattening nachoes, and  or pizza. With Crispy Thins, you can make your own nachos by layering the Crisps w  chopped tomatoes, cheese, even ground meat ... pop 2 Crisp Thins w  toppings in microwave, and  you've got your delicious nachos, (or pizza). I have Crispy Thins w  melted cheese every morning ... great way to start the day. No, I don't work for Kavli ! This is not an ad, but a truthful review. Also so nice and easy to be able to order Kavli ( and just about everything) via Amazon.
