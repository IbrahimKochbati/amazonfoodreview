I have to say I am a fan of the Kong  and. So far, they're one of the few things I've bought for my Lab puppy that he hasn't managed to destroy. I use the paste inside his Kongs to keep him busy. Whenever he sees the can and start putting some out, the smell gets him all excited. I've tried peanut butter once but it made my pup super hyper (never doing that again). I find this a better alternative.
