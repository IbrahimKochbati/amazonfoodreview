I have been using International Delight French Vanilla for years and I've been ordering it through Amazon for the last two years.  It is the perfect addition to every cup of coffee.  Ordering online is just convenient.  For the most part it is very good quality.  However, occasionaly there is a handful of defective creamers that are either empty or impossible to open.  There is always one in every box that leaks.
