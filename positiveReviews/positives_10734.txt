I have two puppy min pin rat terrier mixes from the shelter and another older shelter treasure, also a terrier mix.  All three love these treats. I use them to get the puppies to come in from the backyard races they get too involved in to listen to me.  And they work! (I have to make sure I don't run out of these   ever.)          They seem very hard, but no more than regular Milkbones, and this is probably a good thing in regard to teeth cleaning.  The treats need to be  oken in half, but are scored to make it easy.  They are also somewhat large (approximately 1.5 inch square) for the puppies but I don't mind that so much since the treats are organic and apparently much more appealing than regular dog food.          I will continue to buy these on Amazon.  Our local Wal Mart does not carry them and our pet store is asking $2 more per bag than Amazon.
