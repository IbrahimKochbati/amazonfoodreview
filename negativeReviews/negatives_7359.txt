I ordered the case of twelve.  Every single can is dented...badly dented.  Were these rejects from a grocery store?  I do not buy dented cans in the grocery store, and I was not at all happy to receive an entire case of dented cans.  The packaging was fine, so the cans had to be dented before they were packed.  I am rethinking Amazon's subscription service for food items.  There is no savings if the product is virtually unusable.  Unfortunately, I cannot comment on the actual product because of the condition the cans arrived in.
