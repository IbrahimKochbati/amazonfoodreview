Sarsaparilla, cinnamon, ginger, licorice, burdock, dandelion, cardamom, cloves and that's just half the list. I just recently got in touch with preventative herbal ideology and decided to get cloves, dandelion and ginger. Then I found this tea, and knew I had to order it. I'm not a picky eater, so I'm not the best person to ask about the taste, I say most things taste good. But I can testify to the efficacy of many of the ingredients listed here. If you like some of the other Yogi teas, you'll probably like this one to. It does have a kick to it (have you ever had fresh ginger?), but I like it, and I will continue to order it because it helps me relax and feel good.
