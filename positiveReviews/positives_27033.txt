As our teenage son couldn't afford his Starbuckery, he wanted his old standby back, Nescafe Butterfinger Frothy. Making this at home with 2 TBLSP to 10 oz of hot water with an occasional dollop of whipped cream or cool whip make his day and keep more money in his pocket... his "treat on the cheap". Getting this for less than 10.00 per bag is a deal BUT getting it at about 7.00 is a great bargain.
