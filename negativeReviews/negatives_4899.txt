My medium sized dog will not chew rubber bones.  So I bought greenies hoping the chewing would help keep her teeth clean.     she is overweight so I don't give her extra treats during the day.  Unfortunately the Greenies are not as hard as I thought, she is able to bite off and swallow the pieces within a minute or two.
