These cookies are much healthier than other large, soft, packaged cookies. Unfortunately, they taste like it. They are relatively low in sugar and fat, which is good, and they actually have a very nice flavor. The only problem is that they are dry and "airy" and fall apart. I thought about dipping them in milk, but with the texture, they'd fall apart into nothing. I've been looking for a good  eakfast cookie that is healthy and my kids will eat. This is not it.
