This is a tough product for me to review because at first taste I thought, "hey these aren't too bad," but the second time around I thought, "these are not good!" and then the third time I thought, "there're not as bad as I thought they were last time."  Hmmm.  So my conclusion is they're not too bad, but not that good either.  Each bar comes in an individual package and tastes pretty fresh.  The bars are kind of mushy, with a non descript  ownish color and soft rectangular shape.  I don't know that I really tasted much coconut flavor, and the chocolate chips certainly gave it a boost in taste.  I would not buy these or eat them as snacks, but I do not typically buy snack bars or power bars because on the whole I don't find them all that appealing.  I am always willing to give these types of bars a chance and would LOVE to be won over, but unfortunately these ones didn't do it for me.
