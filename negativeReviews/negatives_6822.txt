I bought a case of 8 ounce packs of Great Northern Popcorn. The popcorn is great and the convenience of having pre measured packs is very handy, it lowers the risks of contaminated product and guarantees freshness. However, something is wrong with the case I received. I just went through my remaining stock and threw away another 5 packs that were leaking oil. I then washed the oil mess off of what was left and tossed one more that wasn't sealed on the popcorn. This is after I tossed 7 away a month after buying the case. I had started organizing my pantry and noticed oil everywhere, the source being the corner of box of popcorn. Not a fun clean up job. I had forgotten about it until today, when I had noticed oil all over again.          The bottom edge of the packaging seems to weaken and develop points that "crack" open.          So out of my case of 24, I've thrown away 12 and used 3, that's ridiculous in my opinion. It just might be cheaper to buy it elsewhere and avoid the waste.
