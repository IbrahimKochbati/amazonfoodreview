This recipe is my favorite. I bought 5 boxes of this flavor during last years deer hunting season. Everyone who tried this was impressed with the flavor. I did add some liquid smoke, some salt, and additional cayenne pepper to some of my batches.  I make enough deer jerky to fill up (8) 1 gallon bags every season and this is by far the best I have tried to date
