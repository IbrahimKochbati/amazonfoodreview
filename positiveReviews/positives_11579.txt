This maple syrup is absolutely delicious. I must admit that when I first purchased it, I had no idea about the different grades of syrup and the nutritional content of each. I was just looking for a good pancake syrup that was actually natural and not HFCS (which tends to make my kids wild.)  We buy organic when we can, too.  The "real" maple syrup at our local grocery store was almost $7 for a small glass bottle.  This Amazon deal just made more sense.  I have been buying it for over a year now and my kids love it.  The flavor is great and a little goes a long way, so I find that we actually use less than we used to.  The syrup is a little thinner than I expected (probably because I'm used to the thickness of corn syrup.)  Try it and see what you think!
