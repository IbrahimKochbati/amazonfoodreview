My son started eating this when he was around 8 months old; he's now 14 months old and it's one of his favorites. Unfortunately, they don't carry it at the local grocery store (they carry other varieties of Earth's Best; just not this one or his other favorites, Spinach Potatoes and Spaghetti with Cheese); they do carry it at some of the Whole Foods so I buy them there. I'm so glad to find them on Amazon! I get TIRED of ringing up a gazillion little jars at the store.          We use this as a base and mix in other things   bits of cooked  occoli, small pieces of meat. I've also started adding spices to introduce him to new flavors.
