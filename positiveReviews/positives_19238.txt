As some other reviewers have mentioned this toy was not much of a challenge for my food motivated Golden Retriever.  It took him less then 3 minutes to pick up each of the little yellow cup covers and eat his treat.  I will continue to use this toy, as I already own it.  I might even ue it sometimes just to put his dinner in so it will take him a little longer to go from well to well instead of gobbling down his bowl of food.  I do like the fact that the toy is all plastic so it can easily be washed.
