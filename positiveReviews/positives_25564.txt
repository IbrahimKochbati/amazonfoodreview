My boyfriend and I disagree about this hibiscus. Not the quality, that seems to be just fine, and it's nice to have a pound of organic hibiscus delivered right to your door. The disagreement is about whether it's better to buy a pound of organic hibiscus from amazon (his preference) or whether it's better to pay 60% less per pound by buying hibiscus (jamaica) at the local hispaic centric market, where it comes in bulk bins and you can even buy just a single scoop of it for a dollar if you're short on cash (my preference.)          In theory, I agree that organic is better, but the price difference is quite a lot and I have searched online and haven't found anything (yet) that tells me non organic hibiscus is saturated with pesticides and will kill me. For all I know, maybe it's more like the coffee beans we buy that don't have an organic certification but they are purchased from small farmers in third world countries that couldn't afford pesticides if they wanted to. I just don't know.          Either way, hibiscus is delicious. And this particular hibiscus was very satisfactory when we used it. This is the recipe my boyfriend has devised for making a wonderful iced tea with it:          Hibiscus Tea with Cinnamon          1 cup dried hibiscus     3 sticks of cinnamon (also available by the pound on amazon, and in this case I'd have to say the amazon cinnamon is definitely superior to the hi ic market cinnamon)     3 T of raw honey or to taste     48 ounces water (six cups)          Bring water to a boil in a saucepan on the stove. Add hibiscus and cinnamon and simmer 25 minutes (I've forgotten about it until it was more like 50 minutes and it was still good, but too long can make it bitter.)     Remove from heat and strain out the hibiscus and cinnamon. Allow to cool to lukewarm, then add honey. (We use raw honey from the local farmer's market. If your honey is probably not raw, it doesn't make any difference whether you wait to add it or not.)     Refrigerate and serve chilled over ice.          Hibiscus: is high in vitamin c, is said to be good for improving acne, reduces cholesterol, lowers blood pressure and just like other plants is full of anti oxidants.     Cinnamon: can lower blood pressure, regulate blood sugar, and has even been reported to relieve arthritis.     Honey: is delicious. :) And if you buy local honey from your local farmer's market, it may even help you with hayfever type allergies. Hey, it's worth a try!
