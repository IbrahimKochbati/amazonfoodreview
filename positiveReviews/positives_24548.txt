This is my second order and the cans arrived perfectly packed with no dents on any cans.  I am giving this to my basset hounds in hope of helping them with their anal glands issue.  But I may use some to make pumpkin muffins. My dogs love the puree in their food and I am glad to give them organic.  Although I don't think pumpkins are susceptible to pesticide spray since you dont eat the hard skin and the pesticide probably cannot penetrate the thick skin.
