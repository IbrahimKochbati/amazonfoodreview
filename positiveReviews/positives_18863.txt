We have a 13 month old, 100+ pound Rottweiler who loves his Ziwipeak.  We started him on the raw diet a few months ago, and use ZiwiPeak for training treats and for regular meals.  It combines the benefits of a raw diet with the convenience of kibble.  Notable good points: great 'output' for a dog with a sensitive stomach, gleaming coat with significantly less dander, fresh  eath, easy to feed, and good for times when feeding frozen raw is difficult (traveling, boarding, you've forgotten to defrost the raw...).          I took away one star for the high cost.  HOWEVER, a portion of Ziwipeak goes a longer way than the same amount of kibble, and the cost is on par   or slightly less if you look around   than most frozen raw foods.
