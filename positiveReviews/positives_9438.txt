These are the best tasting peanuts I've so far had in my life.  They possibly could the best peanuts ever but I haven't tried all of them yet so I'll hedge my review there.  The peanuts are crunchy and fresh and just right salty.  So much better than anything I can buy in my local supermarket, which stocks only large  ands like Planters.  There is a reason these are more expensive   the taste is superior, it's just on a different level.  Try these, I bet you won't be able to eat another supermarket peanut again.
