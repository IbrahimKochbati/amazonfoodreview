I am a very picky coffee drinker.  I don't know or follow what critics may view as the best coffee, only my own taste buds.  There is just something great about the aroma and taste of this Italian Roast. As mush as I didn't want to give any of mine away, I wanted others to try it and hear if they agree and THEY DID. I had everyone asking where I bought it so they could get their own.  Now I am out and need to buy more.  I thought it would be no big deal b c I have more of another  and to drink, but it's just not the same, coffee in the morning can make your day and if it's not the right one....well, you know. I will continue to buy Tully's Italian Roast and so will my friends and family whom have tried it.
