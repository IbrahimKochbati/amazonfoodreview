This drawer is fabulous and holds a TON of kcups. It does make the machine too tall for low hanging cabinets. However, it saves on total counter space needed (versus a carousel) and looks great. It is very sturdy and should last for a long time. I have the Keurig Platinum and have plenty of room to put sugar Splenda packets or mugs. Love it!
