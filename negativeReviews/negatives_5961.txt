I recall using this product in 1956, and I liked it very much then.  Over the decades I had not used it, until I recently bought several boxes on Amazon.com.          The cocoa powder is excellent and makes a delicious and easy to make hot chocolate drink.  But I was very disappointed with the packaging.  The powder was in a box without a bag or a sealed lid.  Consequently it leaked and it was a mess.  I gave one box as a gift and had to seal it in a sealed small freezer bag before gift wrapping it.          Droste could do better on the packaging.  Hershey does.          I rate the cocoa powder 5 stars and I rate the packaging 1 star.  Therefore and overall, I rate Droste's Dutch Processed Cocoa 3 stars.          Steve Riehle
