Excellent quality, quick service.  I'm a very happy customer.  Everybody who has tried the hibiscus tea has been delighted.  A friend's 3 year old daughter calls it "flower juice" and likes it better than most fruit juices.          My recipe: 2 oz of flowers, 3 4 c. sugar, 2 qts of water.  Simmer 30 minutes, strain, chill.  Serve over ice.  Delicious!
