So not worth the price. The people who run this company must have spent too much time working the fields in the hot sun and lost their minds. The popcorn I received was stale and tough. There are no freshness dates anywhere on the bag and it's not even sealed. It comes in a plastic bag with a wire tie, like a loaf of  ead. Obviously it's been on the shelf too long and dried out. Very disappointing when you pay top price. I sent the company an email and they don't even answer.
