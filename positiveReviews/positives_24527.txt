I had been hunting for canned pumpkin for several weeks (with no luck in my local grocery stores) before remembering last year's pumpkin crop disaster, so out of desperation, I turned to the 'Net and ordered a case of the Farmer's Market product.          I'm glad I did  this stuff is great! I originally wanted it for holiday pies, but have already used it for pumpkin pancakes and waffles with superb results, and have lots of other recipes still to try (but expect to have equally good results).          It's not been watery in the can, and not a single can arrived with a dent, so I think this was an excellent purchase!  If I run out, I plan to purchase this product again.
