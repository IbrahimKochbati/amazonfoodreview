DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT OR ANY CHICKEN JERKY TREAT PRODUCT FROM CANYON CREEK RANCH OR ANY OTHER DISTRIBUTOR OF PRODUCTS FROM CHINA UNTIL THE FDA ADVISES THE PRODUCTS ARE SAFE AGAIN. Last month the FDA issued a warning advising people not to buy chicken jerky treats made in China [...]. Unfortunately I didn't hear of the warning until it was too late. I gave both my dogs one Yam Good each for about a month and the result was they almost died from vomiting and bloody stool. Despite their American sounding name, Canyon Creek Ranch IS MADE IN CHINA AND SAYS SO ON THE PACKAGE. Even worse, no where on their website or on Amazon does it mention the FDA warning or that the product is toxic. These lovely little treats nearly cost me the lives of both my dogs, as well as over $500 in vet bills and time off of work.
