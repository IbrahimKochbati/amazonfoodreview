Sorry, but I just don't "get it".  You pay almost a buck for 8.3oz (just over a cup) of carbonated water and fruit juice concentrate.  FYI, the first one listed on the can is Apple. . . then Grape. . . then Tangerine. . . then Orange.  The taste is fine, but personally, I would much rather have a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. .  .for a lot less $$. The can is small and cylindrical, like an energy drink, but there's nothing in this to give you a "boost".  FYI, there are 140 calories in one can.  If you have the $$ to spend, then yes, it's a tasty beverage.  But it's simply not a good value in my book.
