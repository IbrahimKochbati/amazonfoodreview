This product is absolutely not to my taste.  It is advertised as a carbonated juice drink, so I kinda expected something along the lines of Welch's Sparkling Grape Juice; I was wrong. The first thing I noticed after opening the can was the aroma; it was unpleasant.  The drink is not very strongly carbonated and there isn't much bite to it.  The strawberry kiwi flavor is very muted and is masked by something terrible.  The taste was bad going down but worse after a minute or so, as the aftertaste is strong and unpleasant.          On top of the bad taste and unpleasant aroma, the drink has a considerable amount of calories for a small can at 135 calories per 8.3 ounces.  Perhaps there are vitamins and things in the drink that make it worthwhile for people who... well, I am not sure who might like this stuff.          1 5   not recommended          Your mileage may vary, but I just don't like it.
