My boyfriend and I started buying these at the local grocery store, and finally realized that it's way cheaper to buy them here on Amazon with the Subscribe & Save program after buying numerous boxes on every grocery trip! A shipment of 10 boxes typically lasts a month between the two of us. While 10 boxes seems like a lot, each box has 10 packets, and each packet has maybe 8 gummy snacks in it, so it really isn't an overwhelming amount. These make for a quick snack when you're craving something sweet and fruity, but don't have time to deal with a real piece of fruit. I actually saw these at the local Dollar Store and they were more expensive than Amazon's price per bag! If you already enjoy these Scooby snacks, I encourage you to give the subscription thing a try   combine the convenience of having them shipped to your doorstep with the most inexpensive price around, and you're getting a real deal!
