I have a fourteen year old chihuahua who is missing half his teeth. He has always been a dry dog food grazer who enjoyed picking out a piece or two of kibble and taking his time playing with it a while before he ate it. But he got where he couldn't chew the dry kibble, and for many reasons the canned wet dog food was not working out. This Bil Jac Senior proved to be the answer. He is able to have the comfort of food in his bowl all day like he's used to, and he can actually eat it when he's hungry. I am grateful for this product because we are both old dogs who are pretty set in our ways.
