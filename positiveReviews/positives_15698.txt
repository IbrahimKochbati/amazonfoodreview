Our cats love soft cat food, so I was not surprised when they quickly devoured Petite Cuisine.          One of our cats is allergic to corn products, so I was pleased to discover that Petite Cuisine doesn't contain corn or corn products.  It's also free of wheat gluten.  Vitamin supplements are added into the food   Vitamins E, A, and D3.  Our cats have digested it without any noticeable problems.          The 24 can pack contains six cans each of "Red Snapper Entree," "Steamed Tuna & Sole Entree," "Steamed Tuna and Shrimp Entree," and "Yellow Fin Tuna Entree."  Our cats especially love the Yellow Fin Tuna, and they eat every last morsel.  Some pieces get left behind with the Red Snapper and the Tuna and Shrimp flavors, however, maybe because the fish pieces are larger (I suppose I could mash it up for them, though.)  The product's packaging promises "no bad odors," and they're really not that bad    unless you can't stand the smell of fish.          Petite Cuisine seems to be kind of spendy; it costs about twice what you'd pay for a can of Friskies, and the cans of Petite Cuisine are smaller.  After giving my cats Petite Cuisine, I went to the grocery store to look at similar cat food products, and discovered there are several very similar items (to P.C.) on the market, and for a lot cheaper.          So yes, there are cheaper options.  But in terms of taste and kitty appreciation, this was a hit.
