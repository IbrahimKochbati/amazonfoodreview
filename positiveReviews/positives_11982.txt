My dog is a rescued stray.  You'd think she'd be happy to eat any treat offered to her.  Not so.  She's pickier than any dog I have ever seen or heard of.  I have thrown away many bags of treats and dog cookies.  But these things, she adored.  And since they are real liver, they aren't just processed grains flavored to taste like meat.  I recommend them to any dog owner.
