so happy we found this online for a reasonable price.  my two dogs love this stuff and it doesn't upset their stomachs.  Plus I love that it's not made in china or something.  when you look at the food, it looks pretty close to people food. You can see real chunks of chicken and veggies.  I don't want to give my dogs any manufactured stuff but also don't have the time to make our own dog food.
