I bought this through Amazon because most items i have purchased through them have been great.  THIS PRODUCT IS THE EXCEPTION.  They are very difficult to seal or close once filled, and they make one huge mess of your machine.  This product is just not ready for prime time. Also,  it isn't a cheap product.  The filters leak out of the sides which i don't understand as it can't be  sealed any better than i have been doing.  Most important, and this IS IMPORTANT, IT IS MADE IN CHINA, so you just can't be sure that it is free of chemicals that are released during the  ewing process.  Other products clearly state that they are Chemical free.  I can't remember if it BTh or BHT, but take that into consideration.  BUY SOMETHING ELSE.  PLEASE.
