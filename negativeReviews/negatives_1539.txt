I've become a fan of The Switch sodas. The black cherry flavor has a great balance of flavoring and carbonation that had me ready to give up traditional sodas. The Orange flavor; however, leaves a lot to be desired. It has a really strong after taste and despite being "100% juice" it tastes like bad artificial Orange flavoring.          I'd opt for the grape or the black cherry for sure.    "
