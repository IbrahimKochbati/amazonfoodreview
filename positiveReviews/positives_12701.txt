This was the first revolution tea flavor I ever tried, and it made me fall in love with the  and.  Having tried about half of revolution tea's line, I'd rate my favorites in order   Acai Green   Tropical green   Chocolate Orange Green   White Pear   Sweet Ginger Peach.  I'm more of a green and white tea fan, though, so your experience may differ.
