That says it all. This is the most wonderful way to get fiber. I use it as a snack as opposed to cookies or chips. I nver use milk just 1 cup in a bowl and a slowly munch one square at a time. It works for my weight watchers plan. A great way to get fiber and soothe the cookie monseter in a healthy fashion.
