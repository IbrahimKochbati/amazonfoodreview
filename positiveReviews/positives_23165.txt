Pamela's Wheat Free Amazing Bread Mix is perhaps the best mix currently available for people that can not tolerate Gluten.  The texture and taste is the closest I've found to a dense wheat  ead.  I frequently add nuts and seeds, or cinnamon to alter the tastes and characteristics.  The product also can be used to make a very good pizza crust.  If you still want  ead, but can't handle Gluten...this product is for you.
