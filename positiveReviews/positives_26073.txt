I first switched to this food for my senior cats who both had cancer (most likely from my feeding them cheap food all their lives   never again). Within days of starting my cancer cats on this food they both perked up, gained weight, and actually maintained the last few months of their lives in an active and normal manner. Both of course finally succumbed to cancer, but even the vet was surprised at how long they lived after diagnosis, and how  ief the period of their final decline was (they both sort of bottomed out within a two day period at the end).          Now, the other piece: I had purchased another Siamese upon learning of my other cats' illness, and he not only loved them, he also loved the Natural Balance food, which was all he got. I noticed that as he grew he was not anemic looking as most siamese are, but actually had good muscle tone. When I  ought him for his first vet checkup the vet said, and I quote "In 20 years, this is the healthiest looking Siamese cat I have ever seen." She commented on his physique, muscle tone, activity level, coat, etc. I later adopted a Tabby the same age as the Siamese, and got the same response. Both cats just have sleek, beautiful coats, are very athletic and energetic, and love the Natural Balance food.          I firmly believe that this food (and I now also use Blue Buffalo Wilderness for some variety) has made a real and noticeable differnce in the health and quality of life of my cats, and I highly recommend it to anyone. I will say my cats don't care for the wet Natural Balance foods, so I supplement their diet with an occasional Fancy Feast flavor that is free of glutens and fillers (you can Google for the list. Highly recommended.          Addendum 4 12 10: My cats have changed their minds about the NB wet food and really enjoy it now. The key is to switch around the flavors.          Addendum 4 22 11: have since adopted two more shelter cats, one a snowshoe siamese, the other a sable burmese. After each being on Natural Balance for about five months, the Snowshoe has a fur coat that is silky and beautiful; the little Burmese has a sleek shiny coat. Both have loads of energy. Again the vet was amazed at their coats and muscle tone, as was the vet tech.
