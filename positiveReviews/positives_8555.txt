As someone who has been at this for a very long time...wheat free that is... I have tried dozens and dozens of gluten free cookies.     A cookie a holic I have to have my morning coffee with a cookie.     Up until this point most of the gluten free cookies have been huge disappointments..     I have thrown more practically full boxes of cookies in the trash than I care to remember...they were just not worth the calories, they were that bad.     I do like Pamela's  and Biscotti cookies...but they are the only other cookie I've found good enough to spend the money on.     And lets face it prejudice abounds in the gluten free aisle...everything is outrageously expensive.     But these..they are lovely, crunchy, no grainy texture, no strange after taste, vegan, low calorie and low fat...actually a miracle of a cookie.     Most gluten free cookies are loaded with fat...and as I limit fat content that was another big draw back.     No problem here though, only 1.5 2 grams of fat per 4 cookie serving.     I have tried all 4 flavors and each is excellent, I don't think any would disappoint.
