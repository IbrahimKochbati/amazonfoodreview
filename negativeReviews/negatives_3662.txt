I was looking for gluten free pastas because I am trying to eat gluten free. However, on this pasta, even though it says 'gluten free', says it contains 'semolina'. What is semolina? Quite frankly, it is wheat, and it is known to have high quantities of gluten.          I have never tried this pasta, so I don't know how good it is, but there is one thing I know  that will never change as long as DeBoles uses semolina in their products (and still dares to call the product 'gluten free'. I can smell a lawsuit from here when someone severely intolerant thinks it's alright to eat this product.
