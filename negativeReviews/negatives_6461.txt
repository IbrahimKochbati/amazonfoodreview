Broadway Strawberry Rolls when I was a kid and later, the Ruehllers from Denmark as well, were my Favorite candy ever!!! They were sold in Solvang, Ca for a few years!     Recently, someone bought the Broadway name and are making these rolls again! I am an expert been eating these since I was 5!!!     This new batch is an utter ABOMINATION!!! These are WRETCHEDLY AWFUL!!!! Change the name to OFF Broadway Rolls! These are REALLY off!!!     This is as if Yoko Ono toured as The BeaTles!!! Like comparing a Big Mac to the best Fillet Mignon! Like comparing Katy Perry to Joni Mitchell!!!     Like comparing The Flaming Lips to Pink Floyd....     Like comparing Sarah Bernhardt to Natalie Wood...     Anyway, they went from the BEST candy to a contender for Worst!!! Don't be fooled!!! This has No taste! Oh! Actually...it Does!!! It's AWFUL...!!! Yech!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     Want great licorice???? Get the Australian kind! at World Market or any fine candy store!!!  Realllly good! or Lindt Intense Orange! Yummmy dark chocolate!          I WOULD rate this  5 stars!!!!!!!!
