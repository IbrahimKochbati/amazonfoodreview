Greenies are wonderful, my dog loves them and chews them up! I don't notice much as far as better  eath, but I already  ush his teeth and scale them. He gets 1 greenie each night for a snack :)          (To the bad reviews comments...if your dog is one to scarf treats and does not chew things up before swallowing, these are not a good idea! If your dog enjoys the chewing and gnawing, make sure you get the proper size for your dog so they do not choke. Also giving these to puppies can upset their stomache, hints the diarhhea comment previously)
