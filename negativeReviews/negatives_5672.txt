To quote another reviewer, I can't understand the high praises these chips have been receiving.          Based on their popularity and high review score I ordered the 6 flavor variety pack off of Amazon. With some excitement I tore open the packaging and tried the various flavors. I was met with disappointment. Texture wise, these chips are not crunchy at all and are unsatisfying. The flavors vary from terrible to passable. I couldn't finish the pack of what they call "salt and vinegar" chips.          I suppose these chips might be popular with people who are trying to watch their weight.          An anecdote: the day after I received these I gave the rest away to the other people in my dorm (who proceeded to affirm my suspicions that these chips were subpar). I then went to the corner shop across the street and bought some salt & vinegar Kettle chips.
