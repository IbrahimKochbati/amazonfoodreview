I ordered this as the price was certainly right (6 1lb cans for less than $30) and the reviews were good.          This is certainly a step up in the hot cocoa market. Better than just about anything you can find in the supermarket. I certainly prefer hot chocolate   but it can be time consuming to make and it's tough to heat milk and melt chocolate at work or in class.          This is the perfect compromise for when you want that chocolate drink and aren't in a position to 'do it right'.          Very good taste and dissolves well. I always use a little more than it says on the can   with some cocoa that means it won't all dissolve   this is not a problem here.          Certainly recommended.
