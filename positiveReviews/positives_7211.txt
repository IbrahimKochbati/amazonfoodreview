Senseo is my favorite coffee maker.  Of all the coffee pods I've tried from Senseo and other  ands, I keep coming back to Paris.  It is consistently a delight.  I've had trouble finding it in the market because of popularity and now, flavored pods are becoming scarce.  No problem.  I have my subscription to back me up and make it easy.          I love coffee, and I do not drink a lot of it.  So I want something that is a delight, and I want to be able to have a supply available so when I run out, I don't have to go on a hunting expedition to get it.  This plan is perfect for that need.  You can skip a shipment if need be, or increase your order.  It is flexible, more cost effect than the stores, and reliable in availability.          What more could you want?
