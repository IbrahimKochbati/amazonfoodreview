I must say that my dog and all at the dog park LOVE these treats. Even the very fussy boxer sniffs at my pocket waiting for them. The sizes are quite variable which is ok.          The product arrived with no protective covering on either the outside of the tub or under the lid which bothered me a bit (not sure if they had been open, returned by someone, then sent to us) so that is why I rated 3 stars.          The amount of product for the price is great!     I would most likely purchase again.
