Divide 9.99   4 and you can get each 60 piece container for $2.50. Even if Amazon charges you sales tax for your state, you still end up saving $1 per container.          So go ahead and buy this 4 pack of Eclipse gum with 240 pieces of delicious gum. By buying it now, you have $4 to save on other things, like a quick lunch at your local fast food place.
