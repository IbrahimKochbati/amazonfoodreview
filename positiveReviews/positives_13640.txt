This is expensive in the stores, paid $10.00 for 35 packets and usually needed at least 2 packets.     Buying it this way is much cheaper.     It tastes just like sugar with no aftertaste. As far as I know it is safe and has none of the controversial issues surrounding stuff like sucralose and saccharin.  It is not as sweet as sugar so you may need to use a little more.     How cool, no calories, tooth decay or elevated blood sugar levels, just sweetness.
