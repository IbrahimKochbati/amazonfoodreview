I was so shocked to find out that almost all gums have BHT.  I went to the health food store and got gum with Xylitol but I didn't like the taste.  B Fresh was the only one with Xylitol that didn't taste like aspartame.  I saw Newmans Own Organic Mints and was happy to see no aspartame or BHT and they are really good.  I hope the company starts making gum.  The only problem is the mints are made in Mexico.  What is the matter Americans can't make mints?
