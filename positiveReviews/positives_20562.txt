Like peppermint?  Like tea?  Look no more, Celestial Seasonings is here!          This tea is super potent and intense, delivering a powerful mintiness that isn't sweet, and slightly bitter.          I use this tea to help settle an upset tummy, which it does do.  It soothes it and can help control mild nausea.          This is a tea you sip slowly, because it is just too intense to drink fast.  Though it is hot, it tends to create a cooling sensation from the mint as it slides down my throat, which is nice.  It can help clear sinuses, too!          This tea does not taste like a sweet candy cane, unless you load it up with sweeteners.  On its own, which is how I drink it, it is just minty.          I like that the only ingredient is peppermint.  Nothing else which is fabulous!          Highly recommended.
