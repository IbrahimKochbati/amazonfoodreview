I usually don't like  ownie mixes at all and won't buy them.  We bought this product to take to a picnic since we were certain there would be no gluten free desserts there for my kids.  I was surprised at how good these  ownies tasted!  These were the best  ownies I've ever had (other than homemade  ownies that have gluten in them).
