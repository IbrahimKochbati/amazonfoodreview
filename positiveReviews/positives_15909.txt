I actually ordered this to act as an Easter basket for my college student. It was delivered right on time and she loved it!  The candy was packaged and decorated just like the photo, very colorful. (Popcorn is microwave and not already popped but that was actually better for us!)  I didn't order gift wrap but I did mark it as a gift and the vendor put the marked box they usually use inside a plain box so that it was a surprise.  Our order even included buttered popcorn Jelly Bellys, a favorite flavor!  I am always looking for $ 25.00 30.00 items to use as care packages. I suppose that if you added up all the great food it would be a little less than the price but the packaging is really fun and my daughter and I definitely feel that we got our money's worth.  I would be happy to order from this shop again.
