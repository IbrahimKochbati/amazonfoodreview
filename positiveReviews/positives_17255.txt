I only bought a dram of the Champagne flavored oil to try it. I used the dram of flavoring in my nieces wedding cake and everybody raved about it.  A couple of people really tried to guess what the flavor was, but they couldn't quite put their finger on it.  My sister and nephew both said it tasted like banana and that it was great.  But I tell you, it did not taste like banana.  It was awesome.  I can't wait to use it again.   "
