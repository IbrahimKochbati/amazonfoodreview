My dog sometimes gets an upset stomach. The vet recommended that I feed Buddy rice and pumpkin to get him regulated again. Buddy is a large 100+ Golden Retriever. I didn't want to give him just any kind of pumpkin so looked for an organic one. He loves it   and it makes me feel good about giving it to him.
