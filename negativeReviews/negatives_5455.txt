In order to taste test this coffee, I used the sample to make a pot.  I used freshly filtered water and a Melitta drip cone with a Melitta filter.  I invited two other coffee lovers to join me in trying the  ewed coffee.  Each of us agreed that this dark roast coffee was mild, did have the "bitter" taste that one associates with dark roast coffee, but was weak in flavor.  Whether or not that is a result of removing the acid, I can only leave to the chemists to decide.  For one who needs to avoid acid, I believe this is a good choice.  But, if you really love the flavor of good coffee, then you may want to consider other options.
