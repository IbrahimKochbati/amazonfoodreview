I'm a big fan of most nuts and especially peanuts, but these are the crunchiest, most flavorful peanuts that I've ever had, and just lightly salted, very light, only a little bit of oil. They're "dangerously delicious", like it's hard to stop eating them. You'd better buy the 3 or 4 can pack because the fisrt can will be gone in a few minutes.
