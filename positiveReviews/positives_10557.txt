1) Does not have that harsh tic tac minty sensation that numbs your mouth.     2) The red ones taste like cherries.     3) The yellow ones taste like passion fruit.          This product freshens a person's  eath and is very pleasant to suck on. And they taste so good it is easy to finish a pack of them without realizing it. So it makes sense to buy a box of 12. This lasts me about 1 2 months. Your mileage may vary!
