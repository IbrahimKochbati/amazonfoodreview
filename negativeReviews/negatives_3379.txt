These are the best glutin free ritz like crackers...but that's not exactly a praise.  The cheese are not not bad, but the plain ones taste like egg.  A lot of gluten free  eads and crackers use egg as the lacking "glue"...and you can always taste it.  Yuck! All of that being said, the plain ones are ok when made into peanut butter sandwiches and all of the crackers are pretty good with a dip or chicken tuna salad...sigh.
