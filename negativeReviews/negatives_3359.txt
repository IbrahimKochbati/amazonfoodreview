Please investigate the ingredient list of the so called "healthy" alternatives.  Especially if your body is already sensitive to gluten, MSG, wheat, or other things.  Here is only one review of one of the ingredients in these crackers....                                                                AMMONIUM BICARBONATE     Ammonia powder is ammonium bicarbonate, a leavening agent that is a precursor of today's baking powder and baking soda; it must be ground to a powder before using. It is also known as hartshorn, carbonate of ammonia or powdered baking ammonia. It is still called for in some recipes especially for cookies.          It is suggested substituting an equal amount of double acting baking powder for the powdered ammonia (hartshorn) in a recipe.  (Your kitchen would stink of ammonia while the cookies baked, but the cookies would not taste or smell of ammonia                                                                   Now doesn't that just make you want to gobble up these crackers,..NOT.  Most of the product comes from China....another caution.  It is preferred by some food processors because it is CHEAP....so how expensive is common baking soda &bakin g powder?
