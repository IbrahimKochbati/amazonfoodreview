I bought this because I am vegan and not because the product is gluten free. The only other vegan Mac n' cheese substitute I have found  tried are the Roads End products. My husband is hard to please when it comes to vegan cheese, and he hated the Roads End stuff but loved this. I do too  it's way better than Roads End stuff. It has a delicious flavor that is not at all spicy. Also much easier to mix up than the Roads End.          Not that expensive at all. I'll definitely be buying more. Love it!          Btw the people adding tuna and chicken are missing the point of eating a vegan meal!
