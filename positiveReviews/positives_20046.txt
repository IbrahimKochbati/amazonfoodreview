Kettle Foods, Inc. makes the best tasting potato chips I've ever eaten.  With a variety of flavors, from classic Barbeque to their unique Spicy Thai you'll find the right flavor for your mouth. And not only do they taste wonderful, but these all natural chips are cooked in safflower or sunflower oil for zero cholesterol.          But why is it a GoGreenMart&More product of the week? Kettle Foods, Inc. is a "Green Giant", a company highlighted for their environmental practices.  They convert waste oils to biodiesel to power some of their company cars. A roof top solar panel system creates 120,000kWh annually for production and they offset 100% of their additional U.S. energy usage by buying renewable energy credits. Not only are their efforts for the future but they care for the present by rejuvenate a neighboring 2 acre wetland eco system. And during recent building construction, they earned a Gold rating from Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED).          Now your mouth will thank you and so will the environment.
