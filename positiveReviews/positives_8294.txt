I really love my Keurig  ewer but after my third purchase of highly priced tea and coffee K cups I knew I needed a more cost efficient solution. I purchased a My K cup for the unit which allowed me to use regular canned coffee but what was I going to do about the tea? I tried opening tea bags and using that tea but it was weak and flat. Next I tried using this tea and it worked perfect (but a word of caution...remove the tea leaves from the filter while moist to make removal easier). No more  ewing an entire teapot for just a quick morning cup and no waiting for tea bags to  ew and it tastes great!!! Not weak and off taste but perfect. My tea consumption has increased to the point that I now use the Amazon auto ship to receive 6 boxes at a time so that I never run out. If you have a Keurig and love tea this product is the perfect solution...you won't be disappointed.
