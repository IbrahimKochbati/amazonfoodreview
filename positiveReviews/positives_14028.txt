I have been on Weight Watchers since June 24th of this year and have successfully lost 35 lbs. The one thing I missed was peanut butter!! It is very costly on the weight loss system that Weight Watchers established, Points Plus. When I saw it on Dr Phil's show, I was curious, ordered it and was I HAPPY. Mixing it with water, the recommended serving is 1 point, regular peanut butter can be as much as 5 points. When using sugar free jam or syrup to mix the powder in, the taste is wonderful and has the consistency of peanut butter, thanks to whom ever developed this product,for someone like myself, trying to get healthier,well this is just a blessing. I encourage anyone who is a peanut butter lover like me, and would like to have the taste without all of the fat and calories, GO FOR IT.
