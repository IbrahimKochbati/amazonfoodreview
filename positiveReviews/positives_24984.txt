My little Shih Tzu, Honey, can hardly wait to get up each day! Her first order of business is to sit for her Happy Hips chicken  east strips. She gets two every morning and this starts a happy day for her. Buying it direct from Amazon is about 1 3 of what local vendors charge! Wonderful, pure treat!     CCW
