This blend of rice, wheat berries, and rye berries is delicious.  I'm using it in soups, cassaroles, and by itself as a side dish. Usually, I put it in my rice cooker and in about 45 minutes it is ready to be eaten.  I plan to purchase more of this product.  I haven't found it in my local grocery stores, so it is wonderful to be able to order it, and have it arrive in just a few days in excellent condition.
