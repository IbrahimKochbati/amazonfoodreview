Just got a cat about a month ago, and this is the first product I ever bought, by walking into a pet store. I ended up with so much dust in my house, and a nasty chemical smell.          Then, went online to search for a new product, and I got what I was looking for. No smell, no chemicals, no dust.          Comparing this product with the other product, this product should get only one star.
