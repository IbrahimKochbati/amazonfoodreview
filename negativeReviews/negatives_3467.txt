Actually, I love Nonni's chocolate biscotti and would buy them at my local grocer if they had them.  I found these listed at Amazon and ordered two containers.  When they arrived which was during the warmest part of the summer, most of the chocolate frosting had melted and flowed onto the plastic packaging which made eating them very messy.  The worst part which didn't seem to be caused by the heat was that virtually every one of the biscotti's were  oken into multiple parts which I attribute to rough handling. I don't know whether this rough handling occurred at Amazon or by the shipper.  I have always liked to buy from Amazon but won't buy any more biscotti.
