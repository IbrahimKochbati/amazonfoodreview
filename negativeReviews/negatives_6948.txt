I suppose if you have been gluten free for a long time this  ead is great, but it has a slightly sweet taste (some may like that) and its much like other gluten free  eads, its very dense. It is better than most I've had though and the price is right.. I use it for  ead crumbs to make meatballs.. something I haven't been able to do until recently.          Its a good product for the money, considering how much a gluten free diet costs   I just couldn't use it for  ead.. it does however make a decent pizza crust.. haven't tried it for much else.
