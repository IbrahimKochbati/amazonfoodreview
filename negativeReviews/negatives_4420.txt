I have bought several Revolution flavored teas.. white pomegranate and sweet ginger peach (not sweet but nice peachy ginger taste) and I loved them. However, this tea is not too good.. there is no pear flavor! not even a subtle one.. it is a bit bitter and really just like a plain white tea. If you like that, fine, but don't expect a pear taste!
