This was a nice cookie. The cookies are individually packaged so that you can easily tuck them into a lunchbag or a purse, and the packaging really does hold up well. The cookie itself is slightly on the dry side, but good. For someone looking for a sneaky way to get some extra fiber into my diet and my husband's, this worked really well!
