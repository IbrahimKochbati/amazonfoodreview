I've recently started eating more healthy by slightly cutting down on sugar. This cereal is great not only because it taste good but because it has more natural sugar than most cereals. The raisins substitutes for the sugar which is good because raisins are dried grapes. raisins combined with my b12 pills give me a boost of energy in the morning. This cereal is also pack with a lot of fiber which helps boost your metabolism thus giving me even more energy.
