It's pretty remarkable that I'm writing a review for rooibos, because it's not a product that I go out of my way to buy or to drink.  But I received a sample of this in one of my Adagio orders, and I liked it.  I liked it enough to buy it.  This rooibos has a strong, true caramel flavor, which I loved.  This is the product that showed me I liked Caramel flavored teas.  Overall, this is a good beverage for the evenings, as it is caffeine free, and those who are fond of rooibos shous definitely give it a try.
