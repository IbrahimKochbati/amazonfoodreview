For years I have used Knorr Bernaise sauce packets with steaks that I found at the grocery store.  I found it to be quite expensive (about $5.00 a packet plus milk and butter).  Upon researching some other food products, I found it on your site.  It was about 1 3 the price of the in store packets. Over time we have also started using it with chicken, even on baked potatoes, and it is delicious and makes anything you use with it taste more "special".  I will buy again and again!  Thanks Amazon!!!!!
