I actually came to this coffee because Amazon took all my coffees off Subscribe and Save.  I actually like this coffee.  It's a good coffee for morning time.  I find the Breakfast blends to light for me and this one is a bit stronger.  Not a favorite of mine but is good enough to keep since it's still on Subscribe.
