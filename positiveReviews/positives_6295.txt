My cat is very picky and this is the only hairball remedy that I can give him that he eats and it works!  I don't have a problem with him vomiting at all.  I give him about 8 10 treats per day (and you have to make sure that you are giving them on an empty stomach), and the hairballs pass through his system   he never spits them up.  I used to purchase them at the store, but they stopped carrying this specific type and only sell the hairball tartar control combo ones now   my cat hates them.  So happy to find these online!
