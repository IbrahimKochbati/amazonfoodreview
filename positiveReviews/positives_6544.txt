We have a Keurig coffee maker. One of the side benefits is the opportunity to experiment with different K cups. I have already tried half a score. Some seem pretty tasty at first  until one taste something that is even better. Some early K cups that I graded highly don't compare too well with later  ands that I have tried.          Wolfgang Puck's Columbian Dark Roast Noir is one of the better products that I have tried. It has a bold taste, although not strongly so. It is also smooth tasting.          It is now on my short list of possibilities for my first morning cup of coffee. So, I am pretty happy with Wolfgang Puck's product here.
