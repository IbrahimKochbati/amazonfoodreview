I ordered the French Vanilla, the only creamer I ever like. Unfortunately, before my item was shipped, Amazon put the item under review and sent me Hazelnut. YUCK!  I was refunded the money, thankfully, but was told that I could reorder after the item was no longer being reviewed. As I spoke to the Amazon representative, I checked the item and saw that the price had increased. Amazon customer service took care of me and I was completely satisfied by the time I got off the phone. I got a refund for the item AND I'll be getting a replacement item once it becomes available.  THANK YOU AMAZON. Although this means I'll be stuck w  more powered creamer or Starbucks until my creamer comes in.
