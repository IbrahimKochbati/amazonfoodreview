I have been trying the sample sizes of a bunch of different protein shake mixes. I am glad I got the sample size of this one as it is the worst of the lot so far. It tastes super bitter, although, I did not mix fruit with it like the directions say, so perhaps it would be better with fruit. It also irritates my throat for some reason, in fact at first I thought I was having some kind of reaction, but it has subsided since I've started writing this review.          Like everyone else is saying, this 'protein' shake doesn't have much protein. Compared to the other shakes I've been trying, it has the least amount by % weight.          I think that it's unfair for the marketers to put delicious in the label as it is far from delicious.
