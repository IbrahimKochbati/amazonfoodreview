Bear Creek "Darn Good" Chili is some of the best chili I've ever had. It is quick and easy by just following the instructions on the back of the packet. My family enjoys chili just a little spicier and a little meatier so I've added a few items to kick the chili up another notch. So here it is....          (2) packs of Bear Creek "Darn Good" Chili Mix     (2) cans of Tomato Paste     (2) cans of Rotel Tomatoes     (2) Small Onions (Chopped)     (1) Bellpepper (Chopped)     (4) cloves of Garlic (Chopped)     (1.5) lbs. of Ground Beef or Ground Chuck     (2) lbs. of Smoked Sausage (Finely Chopped)     Hint of Cayenne Pepper (To your taste)     Hint of liquid smoke          In a large pot, add both chili mixes to boiling water (As directed), then add the tomato paste. Stir well and turn fire down to a medium heat. In a large sauce pan,  own your ground beef and chopped sausage, then add to your pot. In the same large sauce pan, saute chopped onion, bellpeppers, and garlic (10 15 min) and then add to your pot. Add the Rotel Tomatoes, turn heat down to a simmer and let cook about 30 minutes (Stirring occasionally). Add cayenne pepper to taste and a hint of Liquid Smoke and let simmer for about 30 more minutes (Still stirring). In this last few minutes while the chili is cooking,  bake up your favorite corn ead (I like "Jiffy"). Gather your family and friends for a "Darn Good" Chili time.          Recipe is even better in a CrockPot.....And I don't know why I added the Liquid Smoke (But it worked)          Hope ya like it!!!
