Granted I didn't take into account that my dog would chew through the rope, but my Pit had this destroyed in less than 10 mins.  The sides of the bottle are too deep to really dispense without having to tip the bottle, so she got a little frustrated trying to get the treats out.  She ended up  inging the toy to people to get the treat out for her.  Well, she got tired of that and just decided to eat the rope off.  I was really excited to get this toy too, she needs mind games to keep her busy.  This one just doesn't hold up.  Totally not worth the $20 I wasted.  I'm sticking to Kong and West Paw toys from now on.  They are the ONLY  ands I have found to hold up and cost less than the new poser  ands coming out.
