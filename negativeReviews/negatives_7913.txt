We have been buying Caribou Blend K cups for a couple of years. It is a fine medium blend that we, and everyone that we have served it to, loves. We usually order it in larger quantities to try and save some money since we go through it fairly quickly. The last order we placed for 2 x 80 boxes was fulfilled with the K cups with green color labels (the older labels were orange around the edges). The taste of this new k cup can only be described as vile and has nothing to do with the former product. It is not drinkable. We have written to Caribou and have been waiting for a response, but nothing yet (I will update if I hear anything). DO NOT BUY this product if you have used the older product with he orange color on the label and liked it. You will not get the same thing and this coffee is truly terrible!          Deserves 0 Stars...          Update   a note from Caribou Corporate:          Thank you for taking the time to contact us.          We certainly apologize for any confusion. Recently the packaging for Caribou Blend K Cups did change. Previously the regular blend had an orange band and the decaf had a green band. The new labels the regular is a green band and the decaf is an orange band.          The coffee itself has not changed, simply the label. There are two factors that might be involved in the change you taste. The change in taste is affected by the time that has lapsed between roasting the coffee beans and  ewing them...freshness. Also, coffee is an agricultural crop that varies with weather and other environmental factors. Our Roastmasters put in a lot of time and attention to provide a consistency when roasting the coffee beans.          We do apologize for any confusion and please let us know if there is anything else we can do for you.          Sincerely,          Linda          Caribou Coffee Customer Relations          The coffee is Dramatically different, but they will not admit to the change. Oh, well. Goodbye Caribou Coffee.
