My little one loves froose! It's expensive at our grocery store, $4 for a 4 pack. We use it sparingly. If our little one wakes up too early and has already nursed, he'll have a froose and go back to sleep. When he was sick, it was the only liquid other than nursing that I could get in him. I buy the pear flavor because it has less sugar than the others by froose. I like that it is more nourishing and substantial than other juices. It is thicker and "syrupy", but that's not a problem unless you have a box squeezer. That could be solved by placing the juice box in a small cup. Someone taught me this trick. :)     Love pear froose!
