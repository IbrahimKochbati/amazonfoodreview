Looks like and tastes like chocolate colored water. No chocolate flavor whatsoever, this was a complete disappointment.  I got the hot chocolate k cups from swiss miss instead.  How people can be giving this product four and five stars is astounding to me, is the Amazon ratings system being gamed for this product?
