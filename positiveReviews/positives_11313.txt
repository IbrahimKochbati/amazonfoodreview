This is the best ground coffee I've ever tasted from a major coffee  and. It has a bold sharpness to it, that great caffeine "bite". Those of you that appreciate good coffee you know what I mean. It is bold, but low on acid, and it couldn't have been more rightly named goes down like silk. My new favorite, better stock up before it gets discontinued.(perish the thought!)
