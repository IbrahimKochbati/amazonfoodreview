We have a 4 oz stand up electric popcorn popper and find 4 oz bags a little hard to come by. This popcorn, salt and oil is 6 ozs and work perfectly in out 4 oz popper. About 80 to 90% of the grains pop and that is our only complaint. We have tested the kettle at very hot and at start up tempatures and there is still at least 10% of the grains unpopped. What are we doing wrong?
