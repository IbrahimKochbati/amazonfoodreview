I'm not sure why no one seems to like these very much!  They are pretty good to us.  I haven't had a problem with them falling apart and they're easy to slice for toasting.  My son,(who is the one on the GFCF diet), is extremely picky and suspicious of anything new, ate these muffins without hesitating. I sometimes poke a hole in the middle and serve as a 'bagel'.  These are a regular staple in our house.
