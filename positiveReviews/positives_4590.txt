My daughter and I eat low carb. Which oatmeal is not really, by the way. But I was looking for something that we could eat in the morning that was not meat dairy egg, and was gluten free, and filling, without being pure sugar like most  eakfast foods and especially grains. I decided to try these long cooking irish oats. We use 2 cups water and 1 2 cup dry oats, for 1 4cup dry each. It takes this stuff 30 minutes+ to cook so it is not fast food, for sure. But strangely enough, it's filling. Adding fats (couple tablespoons of cream) to the serving helps that of course. In any case, it is much tastier, and much more long lasting for keeping us satisfied, than I expected, and surprisingly stable on blood sugar. Nor has it set off cravings like most grains, fruits, etc. do if we eat those; the sugars digest so slowly in this apparently. It is more solid and nutty than the flakey quick oats I grew up with, which I now consider a gummy gluey sugarbomb insult to true oats. These are harder to find and cost more but they're worth it.
