I really enjoy sweet potato chips, sweet potato fries, baked sweet potatoes, etc., so I was eager to try these Popchips.  They did not disappoint!  The flavor of the sweet potato is just right, mixed with a bit of saltiness   very tasty!  Just the right amount of light crunch, more like popcorn.          At 100 calories per bag, these fit right into my eating plan that allows two 100 150 calorie snacks per day.  That made me extra happy!  There are plenty in the bag, too, unlike the small servings usually found in low calorie snack packs.          I shared these with a friend who came over one afternoon, since she also professed a love of sweet potatoes.  She asked for some extra to take home, she really enjoyed them.          All the good Vitamin A content that you would normally find in a sweet potato has completely vanished in the processing of these, however.  I don't expect much from chips, I guess, still a bit disappointing.          The bags are very thick, for a chip bag.  My 9 & 12 yr. old kids had trouble opening these, and resorted to scissors.  I should also mention that they are not fans of sweet potatoes, and did not care for these either.  That's ok   more for me!
