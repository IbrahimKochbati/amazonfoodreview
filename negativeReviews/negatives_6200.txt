I buy a lot of canned salmon, smoked and not. This time, I wanted a wild caught version to avoid carcinogenic chemicals.  As soon as I opened the can, a powerful fishy smell took over the kitchen, more powerful than sardines.  The taste is overly fishy also.  Maybe it was a bad can.  If the rest are better, I'll write another review.
