Cosmic makes the standard by which all catnip must be measured now, its that good. However I found it does need to be crushed to release the catnip scent oils to really get the cats aroused. Otherwise my roly poly is happy to just lap it up when the intention is to get him excited to play with the 10,000 toys all around that he and housemate wait for me to entertain them with.
