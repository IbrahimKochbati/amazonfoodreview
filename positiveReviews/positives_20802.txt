Just one chocolate orange lasts for a very long time :) You'll be savoring each slice, so it lasts. Each slice is detailed to look like a real orange slice. The chocolate is so creamy and melts instantly when it hits your tongue! The chocolate is not as sweet as other chocolates, and the orange flavor does not over power the chocolate flavor either. Each compliment eachother perfectly! The chocolate orange is also the size of a real navel orange!          And the throwing? Get ready to bash the heck out of this thing! The slices don't come apart unless you bash the bottom on a table or other hard surface. You can get your rage out! Or, you can get one for each family member at Christmas and see who can get all of their slices to come apart at once! It can become a very fun Christmas tradition!!
