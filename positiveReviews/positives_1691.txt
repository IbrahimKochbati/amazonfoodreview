I found this exact same stuff at the dollar store.  It is pretty good.  Not as good or as strong as my loose whole leaf tea, but for the price it can't be beat. Bags are never as good as loose leaf.  I use it if I want one quick cup.  I steep my loose leaf tea 2 3 times, so I have to have time to drink 2 3 cups.  I gave this 4 stars because it is a good deal for the money purchased from the dollar store. If I make myself a mug, and because it is cheap, I use 2 bags.  I would have been disappointed if I had paid the original price on here for it though.
