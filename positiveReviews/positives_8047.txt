So I bought this after watching an Alton Brown episode where he talks about Ghee being clarified butter, the best you can get, and really deals with high heat. I put it in fridge, and I scooped out what I thought was about 1 4 cup spoonful for my cooking last night. Wow! Cooks well; no more smoke than cooking on any high heat setting, and I had some left over. I think maybe you should use less than you originally use of other oils as this does not evaporate the same. Really cool stuff, and no additional taste of french fries, or other stir fried items. Coolness!!
