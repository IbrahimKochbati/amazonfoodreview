Initially, the flavor is fairly accurate, however weak  from there, the flavor diminishes rapidly. I just timed it, and this gum goes flat within 5 minutes.     In light of my experience, I find these rave reviews somewhat... amusing; one reviewer even went as far as to describe it as "incredibly tart". Meh.     Like many new products in the realm of gum, pop, energy drinks, and fast food, they only need you to buy one. If everyone does that, they'll be sitting pretty.     Based on this experience, I have no desire to try the other flavors of Extra Dessert Delights.     Three stars   It's OK, but doesn't live up to the hype.
