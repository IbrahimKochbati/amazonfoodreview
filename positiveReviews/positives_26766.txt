I got this for my wife who is a choc a holic, when I told her all she said was "chocolate and waffles.... together, when's it coming!". Needless to say this mix has been a big hit with her and me. They cook up nice and quick in our waffle iron actually cooking a little faster than the straight vanilla flavor mixes, so keep an eye on them.          The waffles themselves turn out with a nice crispy exterior with a dense soft middle. We have found these make awesome dessert waffles, simply add a little sweetened whipped cream and enjoy! The chocolate flavor is also a true malted flavor, I would almost compare it to the chocolate flavor of Ovaltine.
