All of Tinkyada's pasta is pretty wonderful.  I can't tell you how many Gluten free pasta  ands I have tried and at best they have been gross!  Finally, I found Tinkyada and I have never been disappointed.  I think this is my absolute favorite Tinkyada type (the Fusilli), but I also love the fettucini, the lasagna noodles, the elbows and shells.
