I had some quinoa pasta at a relative's house and loved it. I eat kamut spelt  ead because of allergies. So I thought this combo for pasta would be good, especially since most quinoa seems to come with corn. The pasta is twisted very tight, making it thick, so it takes much longer to boil. I tried it in an alfreda sauce dish and didn't like it. :^( I much prefer spelt noodles or even rice, which are lighter weight. These things are heavy. Maybe if they are used differently? I don't know what to do with them, since Amazon sells them in bulk.
