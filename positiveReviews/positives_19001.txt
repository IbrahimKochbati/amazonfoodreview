I'm very picky about my chocolate milk flavor   I've tried some that didn't taste like chocolate milk; others had a coffee taste to it which I didn't like at all.  But I really enjoyed the flavor of the Cocoquik.  This one tasted like the real deal.  Despite its excellent taste, I wouldn't have tried it if it was high in calories, but it's only 6 calories per serving, which is a winner in my book.  My only complaint is that I wish it came in little individual serving packets.  It would be easier more convenient to use it that way.
