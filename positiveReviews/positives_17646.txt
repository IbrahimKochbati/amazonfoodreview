Smooth acid free coffee with a nice hearty taste.  Very easy on the stomach compared to regular coffee yet still adds a nice caffeine kick.  May not seem hearty enough to some who only enjoy high test regular but a nice alternative for those who love coffee but can't handle the after effects.  And definitely an alternative to those of us who have tried decafe to ease the impact on the digestive system.  Great black!
