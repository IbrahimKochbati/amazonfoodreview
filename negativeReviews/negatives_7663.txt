I'm usually a pretty big fan of Quaker products and I was certainly tempted by the picture on the box.  It's great that whole grain oat flour is used to make these cookies, and it's also great that each cookie comes with 4 grams of dietary fiber which is about 16% of what we each need in an ideal day.  The taste however, is merely OK and that's putting a good spin on it.  I was glad to see that each cookie is individually wrapped and when I unwrapped my first cookie, it certainly seemed moist and inviting.  But when I bit into it, my anticipation turned to disapointment. The fiber must come from sawdust because that was my first thought.  The flavor was mediocre at best, not very strong and not, unfortunately, enough to overcome the fi ous texture.  I wish I could taste some of the almond flavor and a bit more chocolaty goodness instead of the bland nature of the oat flour.          So if you're looking for healthy snacks, there are better alternatives out there that offer all of the fiber, etc. but without the 180 calories per cookie.  And if you're looking for a good tasting cookie, well, then I'd avoid this product all together.
