I bought the Beaba freezer trays along with the Beaba Babycook. Initially I thought why on earth did I spent that money?? However, after making baby food for three months, I can say it was totally worth it.     The trays are indeed expensive, but they are far superior to your average ice cube tray. If you do not overfill it, the frozen food does pop out super easy. It is BPA free, so safe for baby. And it lasts a lot longer than a normal ice tray, which I also use to freeze my baby food if I run out of the beaba ones (I freeze in batches).     Just a great product, and it has helped making my daughter's food a lot of fun and super simple.
