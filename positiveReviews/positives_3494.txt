This is an excellent coffee, rich and full of flavor (not watery).  Many decaf's are obviously decaf.  This one tastes great, with a medium body.  The grind is fine, which works great in our drip coffee maker.  It also has a nice aroma and no bitter aftertaste.  It doesn't have the "burnt" flavor that a certain large coffeehouse chain has, which personally I don't care for.  I found it closer to Einsteins house blend, but much better.          This is a great quality coffee, highly recommended.  I will be buying more.
