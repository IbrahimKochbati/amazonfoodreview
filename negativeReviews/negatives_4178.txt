This is a good tea, for an incredible price.  However, unless you drink tea on a daily basis, it is probably not what you're looking for.  It comes in a very large quantity that will not stay fresh forever.          That said, I  ew kombucha in five gallon batches.  This tea makes an excellent kombucha, and I use it quickly enough to justify the quantity.
