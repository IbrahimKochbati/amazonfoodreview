These are apparently very tasty cookies. I have a Jack Russell mix and a Shih Tzu, and they appear to like the cookies very much.          However, the cookies are like rocks. I have a difficult time  eaking them apart even when they are meant to be  oken apart. Each cookie is a sectioned two piece. It's impossible to  eak them apart further by hand.          The JR mix finally succeeded in  eaking down the cookie with his teeth. The Shih Tzu couldn't do it, no matter how hard he tried. Frankly, I worry he could  eak a tooth on these things.          The ingredients look good (and they smell good), though I'm a little concerned about the palm oil  is it as bad for dogs as it is for humans?          Even though the dogs seem to like them (I used a mallet to give small pieces to the Shih Tzu), I can't see buying them again. They're too much trouble.
