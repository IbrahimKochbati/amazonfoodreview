You cannot argue with the Starbucks success story and Pike Place follows that tradition. We  ew about 24 cups per day for household use and found this roast competitive with other high end offerings..smooth and somewhat bold.          In the premium bean category, individual tastes seem to rule. At this price level, there are several other niche roasters offering 'as good or better' blends. It is difficult, given the somewhat artifical rise in bean prices, to clearly assess the quality price point but all things considered, it might be slightly ($1) overpriced. But, if Pike's is your favorite, money isn't that important.  It certainly is worth a try.
