This Yogi tea flavor doesn't really have the strong flavor like Peach Detox or Women's Energy just to name a few. This tea has the Lavender smell. OMG! The fragrance can linger for a long time in my mouth and throat after drinking this tea. Just make me feel so good and calm. YES! Just soothing and relaxing. My 70 year old mother who is usually picky on her tea choices, I let her try this tea when she visits. After a cup, she told me   hum.. Get me more, this is good and I want to share with my circle of friends. This tea is "Mother proves"!
