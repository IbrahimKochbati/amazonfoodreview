I was so excited to find a gluten free angel hair that I immediately put in a bulk order. This allowed me to give this product about ten chances with different cooking and rinsing techniques,  various sauces and attempts at patience. It's awful. The rest of the boxes will go to the food bank because obviously some consumers like it. I will stick with Schar and a few other faves that get the consistency and flavor right... and just forego the angel hair.
