Pork chops can be intimidating. Your classic chop is a very lean piece of meat that can dry out very quickly, especially if you're concerned about ensuring that the meat is well done because, after all, it's pork.          There are a couple ways around this problem. One is to substitute a less lean cut of pork. The less lean pork is far less expensive, and has more flavor on it's own, but it's also fairly fatty. Another way is to plan ahead and soak your chops in a seasoned  ine over night. A third way is to  ead your chops    and that's where Shake 'n Bake comes in.          Now, first off, I advise strongly not to use this product with shoulder steaks or blade steaks. Use rib chops. The Shake 'N Bake mix includes fat (to keep the  eading from sticking to the pan), so it works best with very lean pork. Second, do not oil or grease your pan.          Do you need to shake in a bag? Well, you could just dredge, but when you shake in a bag, you get all the sides coated, not just the big sides.          I was able to coat four rib chops, and had some coating left. Resist the urge to sprinkle it on the already  eaded chops. It won't bake properly if you do that. If you disregarded my advice and bought pork blade steaks instead of chops, you're probably not going to have enough  eading for more than three, as the blade steaks generally have more surface area than a rib chop does.          As for flavor, this is a very traditional flavor, much as I remembered from my youth. It's quite obvious that we're talking about a cornmeal based  eading, with mild flavors such as onion and celery powder, and only a hint of pepper. If you like a little more bite, you can add a couple extra shakes of black pepper to the mix.          If you want to make  eaded pork chops from scratch, you certainly can. Get some cornmeal, and some seasonings. Don't forget to grease your pan if you do it yourself. But you know what? Buying cornmeal and spices in bulk isn't less expensive if you're not going to use them up before they loose their freshness. Shake 'N Bake comes sealed in one meal sized packages, and even if you want to adjust the seasoning, it starts out from a nice baseline.          Personally, I like my pork chops grilled. Broiled is another good way. But like I said earlier, pork is very lean, and it's easy to ruin it. So if you're looking to get more lean pork into your diet, the easy way is to go with  eaded pork chops, and Shake 'N Bake is the easiest way to do that.          But remember: Get rib chops. Do NOT substitute pork blade steaks for  eaded pork chops. That's the fast track to a meal that only gets 1 or 2 stars.
