I was soooo disappointed by this product. They would not take! I guess I should have suspected from the low price. I had gotten fresh pablanos shortly before and they were WONDERFUL, but these are not. I know these are terribly hard to find ,thats why I took a chance, but do not waste your time on this product. (scoring & soaking will not help)
