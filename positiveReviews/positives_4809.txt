This is a nice "middle." It's a good tasting roast coffee, with some hazelnut flavor. I'd say it is as good or better than the Wal Mart Millstone hazelnut coffee. More of the hazelnut flavor is often too much for moi.          It's not the best coffee I ever had, but it's just fine considering that it only costs about $6.25   lb in the current market (Millstone is about $9).          My only problem is what the product is    5 lbs. It's hard to keep that amount fresh, unless you are a restaurant. When a package is opened, I package the full 5 lbs in Wal Mart (...) coffee bags, 1 2 lb per bag, then double bag it into freezer bags, and pop that into the freezer. That way it stays fairly fresh, as defined by the aroma    which is really nice when fresh, and less so when not
