Much of the junk sold as dog food is made of filler and animal by products and mysterious stuff with long scientific names.  How refreshing to have a simple organic dog biscuit made from good organic stuff that you can actually pronounce.  My dogs love these biscuits and eagerly offered a "sit" before I had a chance to fully open the package.  Lamb and rice, yum!          My wife was curious and tasted a bit.  She said it tasted good like Zwieback crackers. (I took her word for it but didn't try it myself).  My two dogs eagerly chomped them up.  The only negative to these tasty treats in my opinion is their size.  I'd prefer a treat about the size of a pencil eraserhead for my small dogs as I like to give treats frequently for training.  The large size are a mega size treat.  I won't give them anything less than five stars. These biscuits are yummy!
