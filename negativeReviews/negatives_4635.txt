This is my first Bonsai tree. It is obvious it is at least 1 yr old or less and it is a baby bonsai. The seller kind of tricks you with their profile picture. You DON'T GET A TREE LIKE THE ONE IN THE PICTURE. What you get is a small bonsai tree with one main  anch and maybe 7 inches in lenght. My tree goes up about 1 and 1 2 inch out the ground then curves at a right angle. I am disappointing but using some wire I should be able to make it look unique I hope.          When I arrived home to get the package, it looked like UPS played kickball with the package. There was a big dent in the box like someone stomped on it. Luckily, the tree survived. Since, I have been taking extreme care of it. I water it every Sunday. I give it indirect sunlight and sometimes take it outside on the porch for fresh air. I use a spray mist bottle and mist it once in a while to make sure to clean off dust, bugs and other things.          Other than my disappointment in what I got, I am happy to finally have a tree that I can take care of and watch grow.
