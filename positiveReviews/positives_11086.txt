We are big fans of what we call Tummy Tea.  It helps ease our daughter's discomfort and relaxes her, so she can go to sleep at night, on days when she suffers from stomach aches whose cause the doctor can't seem to pinpoint.  This was a quick, easy transaction, and we bought (4) 6 box packages.  We use this on an almost daily basis sometimes and this amazon price can't be beat, though not by much, it can't be beat even with sale prices that we've found.  So, if you buy more than $25 worth you get free shipping :)  This tea tastes great too!
