A 25% price increase since the end of November, from $37.28 to $46.65. Is it still a bargain?          Now we've passed the $50 mark, which comes out to $5.57 per pound. I pay $5 6 per pound for fresh roasted beans in five pound lots.          If the rating were just for the price, I would make it three stars.
