This product was way to easy for our 4 month old pup Raisin. The compartments opened up very easily with each nudge. It does serve well as a puppy food snack bowl if your pup eats too fast   making him move from compartment to compartment to eat will slow him down. Not great for trying to improve or test your puppy's IQ, but a fun way to feed him.
