When I eat these along with a meal, as opposed to a between meal snack, a 3 ounce bag contains more like 5 or 6 servings, not two.          The package is resealable. It says to refrigerate after opening for best results. Not only does that prolong storage life, I like the taste and texture better when chilled.          When dry, I find them pleasantly crunchy and chewy  not tough leathery fi ous. But a few times, I added some to a pot of simmering oatmeal, figuring they'd soften when reconstituted. Instead, they deteriorated in taste and texture. About 1 3 of the pieces became leathery and not chewable.          Bottom line: Eat them dry and preferably chilled.
