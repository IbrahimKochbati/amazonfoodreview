These treats were a big hit.  The dog loves these treats. They are rectangular but are scored so that you can  eak each treat into two squares if you prefer smaller treats.  These do not have the typical unappealing smell of most dog treats; they almost smell like a treat suitable for humans.  I like that they are not full of preservatives.     I have made my own dog treats in the past in order to avoid the preservatives and additives but they are a lot of trouble to make.  This product is a good alternative to making my own.
