The description of this product says you can fill it with meats and veggies and the ingredients do not list sugar. I have a hard time believing there is no sugar. This tasted like sugar cookies! My kids' favorite meal is chicken pot pie. They could not eat it because it tasted too weird to have a sugar cookie crust. With that being said, the taste and texture of the crust was great for a dessert pie. Unfortunately, I spent $35 on pie crusts for chicken pot pie that tasted bad.
