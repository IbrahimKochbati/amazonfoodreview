I'm an avowed omnivore.  I love me some jerky, too.  Meat in all forms, really.  An exchange with an old girlfriend summed it up quite well... "You know, you don't have to eat meat every day," she said. My response was stunned silence.  The point?  These are darned tasty to a meat lover like myself.  Not just these, but the entire line (that I've tried so far).          No, you're not likely to be fooled into thinking it once had parents.  The texture of seitan is not all that meat like, despite what the vegans say (what do THEY know about it, anyway?!).  However, it does have a satisfying chew, and unlike real jerky, you could actually eat a couple Primal Strips products and still have some jaw muscle left.  Also unlike real jerky, these are moist.  Because it's not dehydrated flesh, they're able to have moisture in the flavoring.  And they do a pretty good job on the flavoring, too!          Bottom line: it ain't meat, but it's amazing for a plant!
