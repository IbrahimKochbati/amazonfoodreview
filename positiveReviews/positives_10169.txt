Getting pills down a labador is not always easy and it is amazing how they can actually eat an entire piece of cheese and still spit out a teeny tiny little pill!  The Schipperke is even smarter ...  With Pill Pockets we can actually say "time for your medicine" and they come running.  Buying these off the shelf (when you can find them) is far more expensive than amazon.com    we buy in bulk and save a ton.  Not just on the Pill Pockets ... but on the cheese, peanut putter, hot dogs and whole chickes we use to have to buy to hide that teeny tiny little pill!
