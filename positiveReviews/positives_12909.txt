This is an Amazon Vines review of Switch Carbonated Juice Drink.  The flavor I received was Kiwi Berry and the can is 8.3 fluid ounces.          I seldom drink sodas, not really caring for sugary drinks.  So when I saw the Switch 100% Carbonated Juice offered I wanted to try it.  The flavor I tried had a good tasting Kiwi flavor, was not sugary, and had a nice carbonation to it that I really enjoyed.  The refreshing drink has just 135 calories and only 15 mgs of salt, so as I drank it, I did not feel like I was drinking an unhealthy sugary beverage.          I think this product is a great substitute for soda, provides a nice "pick me up," and is a much healthier product for one to drink than many sodas or other types of drinks that have added sugar, corn syrup, or some type of preservative.          I enjoyed this drink and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a healthy and refreshing 100% juice drink.
