Grade B is definitely the way to go when choosing Maple Syrup. It is the tastiest and great for everything from pancakes, porridges cereals, and baking. I've tried other  ands, but this one (Coombs Family Farms) is the best. And the price is great!          I always recommend buying organic maple syrup only, to be certain you are getting absolute pure maple syrup. (Nothing extra, like formaldehyde.)
