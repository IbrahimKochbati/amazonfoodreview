My best friend in high school (1980s) and I once ate a whole bag of these after a particularly strenuous workout at the gym. They're addictive and go down sooo easy. I just wish we had a gallon of milk to go along with them.          While to my more adult taste buds these are a bit sweet and have a hint of mass produced taste to them, they are still great cookies. Especially when heated up until the chocolate chips are just starting to melt. Serve with a cold dairy beverage and you have yourself some baked nirvana.          I prefer homemade cookies now to the Keebler variety, but if you need a quick fix and don't mind the sugar and calories, then you could do a lot worse than these elven concoctions. They get 2 thumbs up from my kids as well!          ~ Kort
