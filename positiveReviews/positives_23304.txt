This is the best we have found! My 5 yr old loves this  ead! We add just a little cinnamon and sugar to it and she eats this sometimes as a meal! Its hard enough to feed a 5 year old, but one with dietary restrictions is even harder. I have tried this too and it is by far the best we have found! I use my dedicated  ead maker. Very simple! Only need to add egg oil and a little water. There is several recipes on the package!
