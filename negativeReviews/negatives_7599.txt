How did peanut shells get into the mix? Thank goodness I don't have an allergy, esp. since they looked like the ovaries of the flower at first. Some of them were even stained red so they looked like petals. There should at least be a warning that there could be peanut and other allergens in the product. This is just a class action waiting to happen.
