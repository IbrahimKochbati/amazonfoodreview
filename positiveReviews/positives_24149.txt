I am not now nor have I ever been a gourmet. Which probably explains why I like most of the items I've tried in the Hormel Compleats line, including this Beef Steak & Peppers with Savory Sauce and Noodles.           I work at home and don't really want to spend a lot of time on food preparation. Not every meal has to be a grand feast for me.          In short, I guess I have a high tolerance for mediocre food.          There's no question that Hormel Compleats are processed food. They have to be compared with other comparable quick meals, frozen or canned. In terms of convenience, the Compleats score high in some regards and very poorly on others. Preparation is 90 seconds in the microwave. That's it. Then the hard part   getting the thing opened. I've finally just stopped trying to peel back the plastic like cover and instead just cut around it.          The Beef Steak & Peppers is free of any chemical smell and taste. The beef Is cut and probably pressed into uniform strips. The gravy is almost gelatin like in term of density. The noodles are tender. But aesthetically, much is left to be desired.          In all, while far from the equivalent of a five star meal, the Compleats Beef & Peppers is reasonably tasty and, as a quick lunch, filling. I very much doubt a fancier of fine food would eat a Compleats even if their survival were at stake. But for a convenient lunch at home, they fill the bill quite nicely.          Jerry
