I enjoy this tea daily with lemon. I had been drinking the stash green tea that isn't organic. I may like the non organic a bit better but it always depends on the batch. I doubt this compares to fine, whole leaf, carefully  ewed tea but I'm no connoisseur.     I put a bag in a travel mug, pour in the hot water, add some reconstituted lemon juice, and I'm happy. If the tea, or any beverage for that matter, were too good, it would distract me from my work, which I would rather not be doing, but I have to eat and pay the bills.
