I drink this coffee all the time, its one of the best Dolce Gusto's basics, not to strong, not to light in taste.. Just like all the other coffees by Nescafe you have to add cream and sugar to make the coffee just right.     I would have to agree with everyone else that the price for all the Dolce Gusto's coffee is high. My husband and I drink one cup of coffee per day, and before you know it the coffee is gone...
