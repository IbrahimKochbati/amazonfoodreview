..how happy the ingredients list + nutrition facts make me! These have more of a cake y texture than I expected, but are uber delicious.          Following the directions on the box resulted in pancakes that were raw in the middle, so switched to using less water and they cooked up perfectly.          Really appreciative of the thought Kodiak seems to have put into this product. &lt;3
