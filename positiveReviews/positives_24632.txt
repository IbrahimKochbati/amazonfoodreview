I use this to make "pumpkin pie like" side dishes. If you just put about 25% of the sugar usually in a pumpkin pie and a graham cracker crust you have an extremely healthy and tasty dinner dish.          Can't say much other than it is what I expected. I love pumpkin.          As far as the reviews complaining about dented cans go... none of mine were dented, but who really cares anyway? As long as an opener will still open it, it really makes no difference.
