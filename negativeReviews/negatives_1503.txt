Although some may like this drink, it will not be a repeat buy for me.  140 calories for an 8+ oz serving is too much when that amount of orange juice is 115.  Actually this drink isn't 100% orange tangerine juice, but a mix of juices.  Secondly, if this were unaltered juice, seems you wouldn't have to add ascorbic acid to get 100% of your daily Vitamin C since that amount of orange juice naturally provides over 150%. Perhaps the processing requires it. But, alas, the biggest issue for me was taste.  It tasted to me like dishwashing liquid smells.          On the good side, the carbonization is just right and the flavor is bold for those who seek that.  There is no sugar added and the non traditional taste is not overly sweet.  The taste may appeal to some, but I'm not a fan.
