I really like this coffee substitute's flavor, but I could do without the hint of red chilies. This blend has a lot going for it, though. It  ews really strong! So you don't need to use a lot. I use one tablespoon to a 15 oz mug! This is definitely a mocha, so coffee purists may not like it much. It has no aftertaste. Very smooth and rich flavor. After you kick your caffeine monkey, you will not miss coffee much with this alternative. So, it tastes great, rich, smooth, with no aftertaste, and it's economical. I'm going to try their mocha, which has no chilies in it. That should be just perfect. I have not tried some of the others as yet, so maybe I'll like one of them better, but I have a feeling that this will stay my favorite, since I like flavored coffees better than straight, unless its Guatemalan, which I love but can't drink anymore!
