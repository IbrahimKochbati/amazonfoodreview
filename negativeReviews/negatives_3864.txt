This product is labeled "100% of what you want". But one look at the nutrition facts and you may not agree. While it contains 100% juice and vitamin C, no preservatives or sugar, it contains 135 calories, 15 mg of sodium, and a whopping 34 grams of carbohydrates. All this in a tiny 8.3 oz can! I also thought it was too sweet for my tastes, but I normally drink a diet carbonated beverage, so the sweetness did jump out at me. Just okay. I won't add this to my shopping list.
