I like that this is a reasonably priced organic dog food that is readily available. I switched to this when the  and I had been feeding my dogs for years began to upset the tummy of my senior. However, neither of my dogs (even my "chowhound") is crazy about it. They eventually did eat it, but it took a lot of coaxing. But the tummy problems did clear up.
