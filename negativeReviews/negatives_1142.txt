I guess it does the job okay.  And it's much cheaper than 5 Hour  and.  But the packaging it arrived in was in Spanish.  Since I don't speak or read Spanish I was a little leery of this item since it was impossible for me to read ingredients and nutritional information panel.     The item is labelled as being made in the USA but the website on the label has a .mx extension for being a Mexican company.     I don't have anything against our neighbors to the south.  I just expect that when I buy something on Amazon that the labeling will be in English unless otherwise stated.
