This review is for their dark chocolate. Most who like dark chocolate are into the pure chocolate taste and its health effects...not the sweetness! Just as with good coffee, its not necessary to make it overly sweet or flavored since there aren't that many sweet freak fatties drinking it. The ancient Incas didn't use any sugar at all with their chocolate!          I did give it an extra star just for having a dark chocolate drink product since their aren't many companies that even make one, so kudos to them for that.
