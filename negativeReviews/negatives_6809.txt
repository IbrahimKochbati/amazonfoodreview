I've been buying this popcorn on the subscription program for the last 1.5 years. Overall, the kids absolutely love the popcorn   it tastes even better than the movies and for under $1.00 per bag, I figure I'm getting a good deal. However, one issue I have is the large number of "Old Maid" unpopped kernels. I haven't used other  ands, so I'm not sure what is normal, but it seems that about 20% of the kernels do not pop. This is an average over 1.5 years of using the Great Northern  and in a Great Northern popcorn machine.          If you have found a popcorn that makes a higher % of the kernels, you may want to avoid this  and, unless of course, it costs 25% more $.
