I grew up at a time when we had the paper canister of Quaker Oatmeal that could should have been stuck away for desperation use, such as in a bomb shelter. Although some oatmeal would hit the spot sometimes(especially at summer camp, with some butter,  own sugar, and raisins), I came to loath oatmeal so much that I don't even like oatmeal cookies.     Imagine my surprise when on a road trip in Idaho and Montana, my best friend pulled a Tupperware container stuffed with various flavors of Quaker Instant Oatmeal out of her camping box, and when I groaned, she said "Never leave home without it". We pumped up some water, heated it on the Coleman, and voila! Had no milk, sigar, or anything, and it hit the spot, and for a quick and filling snack, it still does. Love the Brown Sugar, and most of the other varieties are good, too. I recently found a Cinnamon Roll flavor at Grocery Outlet that was killer.     So, bottom line, like my friend, I'm now in "don't leave home without it" mode, and carry a quart Zip loc of Quaker Instant Oatmeal in my glove box. You never know when you'll need it.
