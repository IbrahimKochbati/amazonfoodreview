The lids keep popping off when the cup fills up with water, the only I have not tried is putting 2 holes in bottom of the cup so that the water might flow out faster. It's a damn mess getting coffee grounds in your cup! I would not buy anymore of them, unless I can fix the problem!!!!!No more disposebale K cups for me!
