This has recently become my staple  eakfast cereal. After trying many high on taste low on nutrition cereals, I decided to find one that fits my needs. I am a regular at the gym so I have to watch what I eat. This one is not only high in protein and fiber, but also tastes much better that the other similar cereals with high fiber.     It can easily become addictive as it has the right balance between taste and nutrition.     The price is affordable too and the product can be easily found in grocery stores.
