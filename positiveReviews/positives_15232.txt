This stuff is so good I seriously almost ate it myself.  I don't know why people are saying that it is gross or bitter.  It tastes like ministrone (an italian tomato based soup with pasta and veggies).  My 7 1 2 month old loves it.  He is a really good eater in general but actually makes little "mmms" when he eats this meal.  Definitely warm it up.  It is really yummy!  I like the suggestion to serve with Avacado.  We give him avacado almost every day and the creamy texture is a wonderful compliment to the tomato acidic flavor of this meal.
