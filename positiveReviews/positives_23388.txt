We've tried many different thinkThin bars and the white chocolate chip bars are the best!  They can be a bit rich, but I really like the taste and texture.  The best part is that they don't make my blood sugar spike and then drop, so these make a great snack and excellent lunch on days that I don't have time to stop and eat.
