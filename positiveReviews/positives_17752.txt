I was unfamiliar on how much peppercorns I would get with a 1lbs bag. Holy cow, I have enough to last the rest of my life.          The white peppercorns I got were exactly what I was expecting. I bought a white salt grinder for the white peppercorns. Now I have three grinders, salt, black, and white peppercorns.          White pepper isn't as spicy as black pepper. Also if you bite into a white pepper crackle it wont burn like black pepper does.          I love it on eggs. Also white peppered shrimp is amazing.
