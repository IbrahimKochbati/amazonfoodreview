This one is a great basic food. Whatever is in it, cats really go for and mine is no exception.  My current cat really doesn't like the ground variety which is what this is.  He will eat it occasionally, so I only buy it about twice a year.  My previous cat had to have it more often and really enjoyed it.  It's hard to judge what a cat will eat so if your cat likes ground, give this one a go because it really seems to be a big favorite.
