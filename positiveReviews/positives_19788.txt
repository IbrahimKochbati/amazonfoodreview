I have to cut way down on my salt intake and I have tried so many salt substitutes I've lost count. Some were terrible, some just ok. Then I read great reviews on this Benson's Table Tasty.  It is fabulous and does not contain potassium chloride (which I can't use due to some medication I'm currently taking).  Table Tasty is very flavorful. One could swear there is salt in it but, NO, NO, NO!  It is COMPLETELY SALT FREE and also potassium chloride free (potassium chloride has an odd after taste and does not give you that zing you get from salt, so you wined up using a lot more). I've tried this on eggs, popcorn, cooked hamburger, chicken so far and I love it.  I would recommend this to anyone who is on a low sodium or sodium free diet.
