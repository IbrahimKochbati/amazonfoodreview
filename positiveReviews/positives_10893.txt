I will keep this short and sweet.  I have 2 dogs.  One (a fox terrier) can eat anything and suffer no ill effects, at least none I have noticed.  The other (a greyhound) will do poorly if given crap treats like Pupperoni or Beggin' Strips.  This Newman's Lamb and Barley treats was very welcome in my house.  The ingredients are organic, and Barley is one of the easiest to digest grains for dogs. So much better than corn fillers and chemicals they add to food.  When you feed your dog food that is colored yellow, red, or green, you are feeding them useless and unhealthy junk.  That doesn't happen with these treats.          The biscuits were about the size of a domino, but thicker. Yep, they were a bit hard to  eak in half, but when my dogs can crush tennis balls in their mouths, these treats are nothing for them to chew and enjoy.          Bottom line was that it did not give my greyhound diarrhea or gas, so that is a big 5 star in my book.  Plus, I like the fact that it isn't junk goodies, but has quality ingredients.  Thanks Newman!
