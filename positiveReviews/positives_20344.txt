I first looked into getting this cereal because it offers DHA and is organic which no other cereal does yet.  The probiotics may also help with my son's eczema.  (There are conflicting studies on this, but I figured it can't hurt.)  There is some controversy about Martek's DHA in organic products.  But overall it's a great cereal.  My son does well with it.  I only gave 4 stars because it's not the greatest value out there.
