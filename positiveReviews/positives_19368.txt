I bought this tuna when it was on sale to try on a salad. I was hoping to jazz it up a bit from regular tuna. This is really, really GOOD stuff. You can peel the can open easily, so it's great to take to work or in the car for a snack when traveling. My husband loves them too  we make sandwiches and  uschetta all the time. Great for Panini. Handy and yummy, and worth the price.
