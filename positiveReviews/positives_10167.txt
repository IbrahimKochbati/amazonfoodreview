We've been using Greenies Pill Pockets for a couple of years with all our pets (dogs and cats). They are great! They are often much larger than the tabs and capsules, so we frequently only use 1 3 or 1 2 of each pill pocket per dose. That works out even better because we get more pill pockets for our money!  I have even put more than one pill in the pocket, with no issues from the pets.
