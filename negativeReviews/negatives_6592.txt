I recently tried the five pack Wabash "Real theater popcorn."  When cooking, there is a very off smelling aroma emanating from my popper.     So?  I tried Paragon popcorn oil in place of the Wabash product and had no more "smelly" issues.  Neither product offers much in the way of actual product content.  Hydrogenated or non hydrogenated coco oil?  The latter better than the former....both not so good, anyway.     If you pop corn once in a while with Paragon + flavacol, you will not go wrong.  I wouldn't consume this combo very often, like maybe once or twice a month?.......by the same token, just like eating fat laden prime rib, potato chips, hotdogs, all the good stuff, is bad for your cholesterol lol.     Sadly all the snacks and fast foods we enjoy.....sucks.     C'est la vie.
