I just received a box of 50 of the Deidrich french Roast. Upon opening the box I saw coffee grinds meaning some kcups  oke open.          I made a quick call to amzn. Not so upset at losing a few kcups...stuff happens. More upset at the time it would require to wipe the grinds off of each kcup and then find and throw away the damaged ones.          AMZN very promptly gave me a full refund and since it was a 'Grocery Item', they said to keep it or throw it away, but they couldnt take it back.          Obviously I took the time to clean everything and kept the undamaged kcups.          I recently tried EMERILS BIG EASY BOLD and like it very much. Tried around 8 cups to ensure the last was as good as the first.          I wont put it at the top of my 'favorite kcups' list, but will say it was very tasty and worth ordering.          Nice 'Parisian' taste. Decent kick.          4 star coffee + 5 star AMZN CS   BUY IT. You and your guests should like it and AMZN CS ensures if there is an issue, they will make it right.
