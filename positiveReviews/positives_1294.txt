To those of you, and there's a lot of us, who are constantly watching our weight and calorie intake,these chips are A 1 in my book.          First of all, the flavors are incredible, very tastey and enjoyable.  The single serve bags are just the right amount, and a very nice portion might I add, and the calorie intake is only 100 calories for the entire single serve bag.          I'm so happy I tried them, I bought the variety pack of single serves and I can't say enough good things about them.          They're crispy and crunchy and the flavors aren't to salty, just right.          So to those of you who enjoy a nice crunchy savory snack, you can't go wrong with POPCHIPS!!!  I'm hooked, now I just have to make sure I limit myself to only 1   2 bags a day!!!          They really are good and the nutritional information isn't bad at all.          So WOO HOO for those of us who can't sit down with a big old bag of Herrs or Utz and just can't seem to stop ourselves from putting our hand back into the bag over and over and over again, don't get me wrong I'm not bashing on Herr's or Utz, I love them both, however they're much higher in calorie than the POPCHIPS.          Do yourselves a favor and give them a try, you truely can't go wrong, even my friends family, who don't have to watch their calorie intake, enjoy them as well, so that's saying something.          Hope to read other reviews of happy calorie counting snackers!!!!!          Keep on Munching, the Healthy way with "POPCHIPS" snacks.
