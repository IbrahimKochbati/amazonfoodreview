This stuff is so delicious, it will blow your mind!  My sister lives in Texas and  ought some up for me.  I mix it with a little sour cream and then use it on just about anything.  Every time i serve this to friends they are blown away.  It's not ridiculously hot, but you will know you are eating it.  A lot of walmarts sell it, so look there first, it's about $3 a bottle.
