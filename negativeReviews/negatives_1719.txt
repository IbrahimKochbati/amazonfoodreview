Not thrilled with these.  Doubt I will buy them again.  Lid doesn't fit very well.  Messy and did not make a good cup of coffee.  Cost including shipping to me was .36 filter cup plus coffee. Don't think it is worth it as I can buy a Green Mountain K Cup for around .54 cup and they are perfect every time.
