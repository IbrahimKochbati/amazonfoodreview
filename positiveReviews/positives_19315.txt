Very consistent, great flavor and makes a great simple Mango Lassi.          Just mix one full can of this and then full the can with milk (I like whole, but you can use 2%).  Stir it to get all the good stuff off the can, pour into a vase and chill overnight.          Excellent for you and tastes great!
