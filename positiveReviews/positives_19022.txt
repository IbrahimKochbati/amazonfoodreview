These dog treats smell so awful but your puppy dog will be the happiest you've ever seen in your life. If you ever find yourself annoyed with your puppy because he she just wants to play, play, play... give em one of these little things and you will not hear a peep for hours! They are kind of messy, so be sure you give one to your puppy in a safe area. And of course, always keep a close eye on him her when they have one because there are bones in these!
