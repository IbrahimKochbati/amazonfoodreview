My dog loves the flavor of these things, but they're a bit small for a medium sized pup (she's a 45 lbs Bearded Collie). These are five inches long, but they're basically the width of your finger. They're pretty skinny! Still, it's a great price for a snack. I give one every two or three days, but don't expect a stick to last more than 24 hours. If they're a hard chewer, expect 30 minutes.          Remember it's not a good idea for your dog to consume large amounts of rawhide, as it can lead to impacted bowels. Just use them in moderation, especially since these are small, and you'll be fine.
