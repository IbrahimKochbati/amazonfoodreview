I purchased the Kyjen Dog Games Paw Hide Treat Toy.  Labs are exceptionally smart and I try to give mine, Autumn, a variety of challenging toys.  She loves her chew toys but she needs to be challanged.  First of all she found her toy under the tree wrapped and without a treat in it.  How did she do that?  With encouragement we allowed her to open her toy.  I took it away after she examined it.  While she wasn't looking I put a few treats in a few of the compartments.  It took her a few minutes to figure it out.  Next time, no challange at all.  That is why I only gave it 4 stars.  It was too easy, but I think to some dogs it will be great, others fustrating.   "
