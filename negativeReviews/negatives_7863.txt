My mother in law bought these from our vet the other day because they aren't fattening and are good for teeth. My dogs love them (I have two La adors). But, yesterday, I gave them each one to chew and my Chocolate Lab choked. He was gasping for  eath, and fortunately threw up the chew and his  eakfast. I say fortunately because I suspect he would have choked to death otherwise. My other Lab threw up over night, and I suspect it was from these chews. I'm getting rid of them and won't buy them again. These things should come with a warning label.
