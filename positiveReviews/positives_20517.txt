This product used to be at Trader Joe's (Yuzu Tisane). It was so delish in a cup of hot water, and a nice alternative to tea and coffee. Alas, in regular Trader Joe's fashion, they discontinued stocking this item. So nice to see I can still get this here, though the price is a tad high. But then I guess you're getting 12 boxes...the previous review about leaking packets makes me very wary though. This is *syrup*   not something you'd want to leak all over.
