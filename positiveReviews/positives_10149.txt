I have tried both the Tofu Shirataki and the Non Tofu Shirataki. The non tofu variety is very gel gummy (literally like little strands of flavorless gummy worms). I ate the non tofu noodles, because, hey they are sooo low calorie carb. But now that I've tried the tofu shirataki which contains only 20 calories per serving, I am sold on the tofu shirataki. Tofu noodles were more like ramen noodle consistency. Perhaps not the exact same texture as a real flour based noodle, but for the calories and carb content these are excellent!          As with any shirataki noodle, you do have to make sure you wash, wash and wash them some more. If there is any scent at all, you have not washed them enough. About 2 or 3 minutes seems to do the trick for me. I made a low carb peach kugel (dessert) with the fettuccine and a stir fry with the angel hair. I just could not believe how much better they were than the non tofu variety.          I was also very impressed with the seller (Low Carb You Foods). These arrived within 2 days on regular shipping, shipping all the way across the country. And, I bought 2 different varieties with no additional charge on the shipping! I will certainly be back again.
