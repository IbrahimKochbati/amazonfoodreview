I have a full house. Kids age 2,4,9,11. They actually like this better than the Kraft stuff with the yellow cheese. I bought it on an attempt to try to boost the fiber for the kids. Make it with a side of veggies ( occoli, sweet peas or a carrot). This works perfect for dinner as none of the kids are hungry before bed, something that was always a struggle. They really do like it. Whenever I make it there is never any left.     I do add the optional butter (real butter (unsalted)) to the mix as it adds a better smoothness to the cheese and a nice flavor kick. It is highly recommended that the cheese sauce is made separately. Cook the pasta an extra 2 4 minutes than normal, pre melt the butter and warm the liquid in the microwave for 30 seconds to a minute (I make it in a batch of 2 3 depending on if the  ing over friends). Then add the cheese packs 1 by 1 and mix with a whisk, until smooth. Since I do add butter I reduce the recommended milk by the same amount, otherwise it would be thin.     I cannot stress the importance of pre making the cheese mixture, it makes a huge difference in texture, thickness and flavor (I guess it has to rest a bit before adding to noodles.
