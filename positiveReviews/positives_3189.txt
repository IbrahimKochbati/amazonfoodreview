I really like it when my wife makes anything from her Betty Crocker cookbook, so I know when we got the gluten free pancakes that they would be good.  They are not overly dry like some of the other  ands of gluten free pancakes.          We usually have them with earth balance butter spread, and sliced bananas or sliced strawberries, chopped pecans or walnuts and maple syrup.  They are great.
