Finally a great and easy GF option for pancakes, waffles, biscuits, etc from Bisquick!! Both of my kids have Celiac and absolutley LOVE this stuff.  Wish the container was bigger. But we're just happy to have better tasting options for  eakfast now. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.  Can't taste a difference, but the rest of the family uses the cheaper stuff.
