This Jerky is close, but not quite as good as good as other pre packaged bags you can get at the gas station.  It's tender and substantial, so points there.  The flavor though is mediocre at best; poor would be a fair description.          Also, if you open the bag it will grow mold in a few days.  Maybe this is a problem with other  ands of jerky too.  I wouldn't know because this is the first time I have opened a bag and not eaten it relatively quickly (see above's flavor comments).          All in all, this isn't very good jerky.
