Switch Kiwi Berry is a good tasting, lightly carbonated fruit beverage that offers the great taste of natural fruit juice without any preservatives or man  made chemicals. Switch blends fruit juice concentrates with just the right amount of carbonation for a balance that is refreshing without being too bubbly.          Switch manufactures several different flavors of its beverages and kiwi berry is one of several fruit  flavored options. I tend to prefer the taste of citrus, but I love the taste of berries also, provided the blend is just right. Switch Kiwi Berry offers a very good  tasting blend that captures flavors like strawberry and kiwi, along with apple, grape, raspberry, and other natural flavors. The kiwi and the strawberry are most noticeable, but if you search, you will also realize there is a small amount of grape, apple, and other fruits to produce the right balance and right smoothness.          Switch Kiwi Berry is great for those who are concerned about their health. This beverage is all natural, contains no preservatives, no added sugar, no corn syrup, no artificial colors, and no gluten. Of course, the fact that there is no added sugar doesn't mean that no sugar exists. There is actually a pretty significant number of grams of natural sugar in each serving, as well as a significant number of calories. These numbers will make Switch unacceptable to those on low carb diets.          Taken as a whole, however, Switch Kiwi Berry is a very tasty beverage with lots of sweet berry taste, a full day's supply of vitamin C, and no preservatives. It offers all  natural composition with a taste that is sweet and satisfying and a carbonation level that is just enough to make it refreshing without going overboard.
