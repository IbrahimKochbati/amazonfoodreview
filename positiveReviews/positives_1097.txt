NuNaturals Stevia is the only sweetener that I use in my beverages and cooking. I have tried other  ands and this one is the best! It hasn't any odd taste, and tastes better than sugar to me. I buy the large 12 ounce container and it lasts me for months! I only wish they would put this in more products sold at the grocery stores. There is a soda that has stevia in it that I purchase at a health food store called Virgil's Zero and it comes in different flavors...it is great and I don't have to be concerned about the sugar content that is in traditional sodas. This product is great and I think is the best of stevia products on the market.
