I love the rich, full bodied flavor of a dark roast coffee.  When I bought my first Keurig machine I wasted no time in ordering all of the dark roast K cups that I could find.  I initially settled on Newman's Own Dark Roast as my "go to" coffee, but I didn't stop there.  I like to keep experimenting and looking for something new.  I happened to find Coffee People's Organic Extra Bold blend and was blown away.  It has been my favorite ever since I first tried it.  Last week I saw a listing for a Colombian dark roast sold under the Wolfgang Puck name (it is processed and distributed by Van Houtte) and decided to give it try.  Here is my impression of it:          After  ewing a cup (I used the 7 1 2 oz. setting) the first thing that I noticed was that it didn't have that freshly  ewed aroma that the Coffee People X Bold does, however the taste was another story.  It hits your palate with medium acidity and a nice, sharp bite that gets your attention right away. The finish was surprising clean with a hint of spice (nutmeg or cinnamon?) and just a slight, lingering, pleasant bitterness.  I really like this coffee but I think that I will stick with Coffee People's Extra Bold and this will be my back up  and.  However, I will keep looking for something new.  Who knows what I will find?             "
