Just looking at the bag of these yummy frog candies makes my mouth water. I love these frog candies and always added them to my candy bag when at the candy store. I like them a little less fresh when they are harder and chewier. I just love to gnaw on these things and chew them and taste them and eat them. I can end up eating so many of these and not even realize it so a 5 pound bag for me might be a little dangerous. I love the white bottom that feels like a tough marshmallow. The texture and taste is delectable. Highly recommend these.
