We have a little toy poodle puppy(about 6 pounds) and she loves this! At first she didnt know where to get the treat out, but within 30 minutes she figured it out! It keeps her occupied and gives us a  eak for about 30min 1hr at a time. She loves it! Since she's not a big dog, I dont see her chewing this up quickly. I was doubtful, but I highly recommend this!
