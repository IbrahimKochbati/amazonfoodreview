I order this cereal via Subscribe and Save and always have to order a new case before the actual new ship date. I can't keep this cereal in the house! It seems like I order 6 boxes, and then I turn around and we're down to the last one! My kids love this cereal. I love this cereal. It hits my sweet tooth just right when I momentarily step away from my healthiest eating habits but don't want to sink all the way down into actual junk food.          Also, it's nice to have a gluten free cereal that young 'uns can use to make "Cheerio necklaces" and other craft projects.
