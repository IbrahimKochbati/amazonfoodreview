I have 2 treat loving Pugs. When I  oke the bar in 2 (they are scored) my one Pug chomped his down immediately. The other one couldn't bite through so I had to  eak it up for him. They both liked them, though. I do not recommend this for dogs smaller than Pugs or old dogs with problem teeth. For all other dogs I recommend  and love the organic and healthy ingredients!
