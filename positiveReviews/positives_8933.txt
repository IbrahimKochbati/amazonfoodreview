I'm the kind of person who eats to live rather than living to eat.  So I give a lot of thought to what I'm eating and why.  I eat a little Ghee daily with Organic Honey, Bee Pollen, Propolis, and Royal Jelly.  I used to use the Purity Farms  and Organic Ghee, but find that this one has a much better flavor and texture.  I think this is due to it being pasture fed and non homogenized which is probably not true for the other product.  It is a bit more expensive, but the benefits of grass fed cannot be overstated when it comes to Ghee.  The only other Ghee I would recommend is Ancient Organics which is also prepared in the traditional way, but it is a bit more expensive than this  and.  Ghee is also one of the only oils I would recommend using for cooking as it does not change its composition when heated.  A little every day can make a big difference in health over time.
