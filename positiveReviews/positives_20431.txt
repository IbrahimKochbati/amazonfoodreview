My dogs eat a mostly vegetarian vegan diet.  They seem to enjoy this food.  They've never turned their noses up at it ... and, BTW, they are not the kind of dogs who will eat "anything".  If they didn't like it, they would leave it.     Since they've stopped eating the meat byproducts, they have stopped having upset stomachs and diarrhea. I am certain this is because they are no longer consuming the veritable slaughter house slop floor waste   all of the garbage that is too toxic inedible for human consumption is made into dog and cat food.  Not only slaughterhouse waste, but also sometimes animals who have been euthanized at shelters are "rendered" into "pet food".  I wish I could safely feed my cats a vegetarian diet, but as they are obligate carnivores, I cannot.  So, I shall continue to do the best I can and will do so by continuing to feed my dogs AvoDerm Natural Vegetarian Formula.
