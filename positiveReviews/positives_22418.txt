This popcorn is the best. Say goodbye to movie theater popcorn,and hello to great northern popcorn. My boyfriend, and I pop 2 bags a day. It is so good, that as soon as you finish eat it, you want more. It has enough salt, a buttery taste, and oil. Everything is packaged together. I love it. I'm order more today! I use to go to the movie theaters just to get the popcorn, and leave and eat it at home. I am a popcorn critic in my head, and this is definitely Top 2.
