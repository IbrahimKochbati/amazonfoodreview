Have you ever had a great cup of joe from a freshly opened can of gourmet coffee, only to wonder what happened to that 'fresh' taste as you dig deeper into the can? I have experienced this with other main stream  ands but not with 'Yuban Original' coffee! The last pot of coffee has always tasted as good as the first one. There is also a unique quality to this coffee that I have a fondness for. Of course, there will always be something 'better' out there, but it's usually at a higher price. Though the coffee is consistent, it is the wide price range ($0.18   $0.40   oz) of this coffee that keeps me at bay with a more cautious 3 stars.          NOTE:     With the "Subscribe & Save" option, you can trim costs and be assured of free shipping. Previously, I had subscribed to the 33 oz cans   right up until the option was discontinued by Amazon. I have since switched my subscription to this size and updated this review accordingly.
