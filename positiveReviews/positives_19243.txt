My dogs love this puzzle and I think have a lot of fun with it. This is the 3rd dog puzzle I've bought(each were different  ands), and this one has been the easiest so far. My one dog caught on to all the puzzles right away but my other dog is a slow learner and it took him a while to get how the other two we had worked, but with this one, he didn't need any help and figured out how to get the treats right away.
