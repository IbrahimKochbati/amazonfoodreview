I am amazed at how yummy this crunchy, chocolate y, spicy sunflower snack is! It is low in calories, fat, carbs and sodium, yet tastes great. What's nice is that a small handful really does satisfy. I will take a bag with me to the movies or to work for those times when I want a snack but would prefer that it be healthful, too. You cannot go wrong!
