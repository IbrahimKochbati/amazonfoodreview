To me this coffee was extremely bitter.  I dumped it out and made a different cup.  It made me afraid to try other WP coffees but I did like the WP Sumatra Kopi Raya.          For reference purposes my in store drink is a Starbucks Americano.          My favorite k cups are:     Starbucks French Roast     Starbucks Caffe Verona     Starbucks Pike Place Roast     Green Mountain Xtra Bold Sumatran Reserve     Green Mountain Double Black Diamond     Green Mountain Revv     Green Mountain Dark Magic          Other k cups I've tried:  Coffee People Jet Fuel ,Green Mountain Dark Magic Decaf, Emeril Jazzed up Decaf, Starbucks Caffe Verona, Coffee People Black Tiger,  Starbucks House Blend, Starbucks Breakfast Blend, Starbucks Sumatra, Wolfgang Puck French Roast, Green Mountain Lake and Lodge, Green Mountain French Roast, Caribou Mahogony, Wolfgang Puck Sumatra Kopi Raya, Emeril Big Easy Bold
