When my male dog developed recurrent anal gland infections, the vet recommended adding canned pumpkin to his meals for fiber.  Unfortunately canned pumpkin is a seasonal item in local stores.  I was very excited to find this item available via Subscribe and Save.  I have occasionally found dented cans but not frequently and not severely enough that we can't use them anyway.  Both my dogs enjoy it.
