The pumpkin is delicious.  I have a scoop of pumpkin in my morning smoothie.  I open a can, put it in the fridge and use it throughout the week in smoothies, soups and sauces.  Pumpkin deserves to be used in things other than just pies and  ead.     I don't know if the packaging is different now, but none of my cans are damaged.
