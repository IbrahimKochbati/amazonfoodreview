I've ordered this several times now. I use it when I need a neutral sweetener. I find it perfect for in my tea because it does not alter the flavor of the tea like honey would. It's fairly easy to pour from this bottle, but I purchased a smaller squeeze bottle which I reuse for better control on small servings.
