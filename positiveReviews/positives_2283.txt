This tea is hard to find   it was a joy to find it on Amazon.          Large package  6 full size boxes arrive all for enjoyment!          Sugar plum is a delicious, sweet, warm, feel good tea. Reminding you of Christmas. It has that spice palate of warm hibiscus, barley, rosehips. I think what I like most of all is the sweet aromatic taste. One of those tastes that makes you feel taken care of   a special treat when you are little. Like when mom or dad would make you hot coco or something you like that was so sweet and rare and ONLY on those special occations.          I adore this tea and rather drink anyother tea.     I am so happy to have found it!
