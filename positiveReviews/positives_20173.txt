I use coconut sugar in everything that I used to make with cane sugar:  cookies, muffins, chocolate syrup, fruit crisps, cakes, etc.  A handful of helpful tips:  (1) It can be made into a fine powdery consistency by blending it in a Vitamix, food processor, or even a good coffee bean grinder.  (2) This enables one to make powdered sugar (just add 1 TB arrowroot powder or tapioca starch per 1 cup finely blended coconut sugar).  Then coconut sugar can be used to make icing and the like.  (3) Sweetened condensed milk can also be made. (See allrecipes.com's recipe for regular sweetened condensed milk.  Ingredients are: 1 1 8 powdered milk, 1 2 cup water, 3 4 cup coconut sugar, blended to a fine consistency.)  It isn't all that pretty (beige color) but it makes wonderful lemon bars.          Coconut sugar doesn't taste exactly like cane sugar (more maple y and hearty), but there is no sugar crash since it has a low glycemic index of 35 (lower than apples and carrots).  It is loaded with potassium, along with nitrogen, zinc, magnesium and several vitamin Bs (as opposed to agave syrup, which is fairly empty of any nutritional value).          Additionally, this price that Amazon offers is less than my co op's bulk price.
