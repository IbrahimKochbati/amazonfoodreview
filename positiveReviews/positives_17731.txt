For most of my life I drank coffee black. In my late 20's I started having stomach issues and my doctor recommended that I try drinking my coffee with milk (he tried to get me to quit, but that was not going to happen). A few days later, my stomach issues were gone.          The problem is that I still like the taste of black coffee so I was happy to give this product a try. I  ewed it in a French Press and sat down for a cup. I enjoyed the taste well enough   I like my coffee more on the bark and bitter side so this was a good fit for me. I waited to see what would happen with my stomach and I was happy to discover no problems.          I read some other reviews by people who seem to have significant health problems. I cannot speak for people like that, but in my case this product lived up to its product description.
