I was lucky enough to travel to Oz last November and filled half a suitcase with Aussie junk food (not the best thing for a diabetic, but you only live once!).          Anyway, Cherry Ripe(s) are incredible, with a cherry taste and a texture similar to a Mounds bar. Of course, we don't get these in the States. Why? Who knows? I couldn't find any Diet Dr. Pepper or Diet A&W Root Beer to save my life over there, so it may be a cultural thing.          The price seems pretty steep for a candy bar, so you might see if you have any candy specialty shops (even ones that are labeled as being British) where you live before ordering. I know I could find 'American' candy over there, but you pay a hefty price for it.
