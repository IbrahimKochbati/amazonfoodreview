These are sooooo good! Addictive. Just know they're not CARROT chips fries (actual fried carrot slices) they're carrot CHIPS   think POTATO chips (actual fried potato) vs corn CHIPS (cornmeal fried chip, basically). Trying to use inflection for emphasis there. Either you love or hate but my entire family craves these!
