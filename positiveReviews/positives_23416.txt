I have been using Woeber's Sandwich Pal Cranberry Horseradish Sauce for several year, but I recently found to my dismay that my local grocers no longer carry it.  This product is an excellent condiment for almost any sandwich, and has no sodium content (a must for me).  I was so happy to find the product offered through Amazon.  Just a word of warning:  When you try it, start with just a little and build up to your taste.  It does, after all, contain horseradish!!!
