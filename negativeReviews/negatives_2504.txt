I ordered this product thinking it was going to come in a box of 24 (as it is described in the product description). I was a little unsure of whether or not this could be too good to be true, but when I saw that the weight of the item was marked as 6.1 lbs and the shipping handling was $8 I felt pretty confident that I would be receiving the 24 count box that I thought this to be. When I received the package there was only ONE bone in it. So pretty much I spent $10 on ONE bone that I could have gotten at the store for $3. Dont make the same mistake as me! VERY poor product description by Ozbo!
