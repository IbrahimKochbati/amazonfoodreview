I love these flat eads. I smear mascarpone on them and then so many diffferent things on top of that to make a wonderful snack or lite meal. Their very crunchy and tasty. I watch my diet closely since I have Diabetes and these crackers are very low in Net Carbs in addition to tasting good. The other flavors are good too. I've twice now had to move up their delivery since I go thru them quick. You'll love em and will have fun trying different toppings for them. I really like them with Lox, mascarpone cream cheese and Dr. Kracker...don't forget the capers.
