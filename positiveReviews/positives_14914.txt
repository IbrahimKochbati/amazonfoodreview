When you have Libby's on the label....sorry, the old commercial popped into my head. Libby's products always taste good. I bought this along with some other canned goods. (See other reviews.) I'm working on building up my emergency food and kits and this 12pk of cans fit the bill nicely in quantity, price and expiration date of 12 14. Name  ands aren't important to me as price, but this package was a good deal. I don't usually eat canned potatoes. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat these, but in an emergency they will do nicely.     The cans arrived promptly in advertised condtion without dents. No issues here.
