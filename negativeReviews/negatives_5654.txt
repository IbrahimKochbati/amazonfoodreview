I just cannot understand the high praise these chips have received.  I ordered the variety pack and am very disappointed.  All flavors have a really weird taste to them, except for maybe the plain chips.  The salt and vinegar especially tasted gross!  I took one bite and had to throw the bag away.  Now I'm stuck with a bunch of chips that I'll never eat.
