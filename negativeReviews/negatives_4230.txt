We just went through a bout with fungus gnats and I kept shaking my head because I keep a clean house and don't overwater my plants.          Asked the DH to pick up potting soil last week to repot my spider plant. Looked in the bag and there were bugs all through the soil as well as these tiny egg looking bits. So I sprayed pyrmethrin in the bag and resealed it, hoping that would be a good fix. So far I have only seen 4 5 gnats but if I hadn't been in a bind I would have tossed the bag in the trash.
