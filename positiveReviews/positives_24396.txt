When my parents first got their cat, they tried every cat food  and   dry or wet   it didn't matter, their cat would not eat more than a few bites.  Then they discovered The Goodlife.  That is all their pampered cat eats.          A few years ago, when I adopted my lil feline buddy from the shelter, I wanted the best for her.  I tried the expensive, all protein  ands, but my cat would have various stomach issues.  I finally switched her over to The Goodlife and again, voila!  For the past 2 years, that is all she ever eats (plus her treats).          Currently, I also am a caretaker for a feral cat colony in my condo complex and feed them a combination of the store  and stuff and The Goodlife.  They are healthier and more lively than I could possibly hope for.          Plus, with Amazon's Shop N Save program, I never run out of food for my feline best friend.
