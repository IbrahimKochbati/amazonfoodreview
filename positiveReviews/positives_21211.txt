I used two of the 5 gram pouches for a gallon of milk (one sleeve for a total of 10 grams).  I do not have a yogurt maker and used a stainless steel pot on the stove.  After the heating process, I put the cultured milk in my oven to incubate over about 8 hours (longer than suggested).  Periodically, I'd turn the oven on for a minute or so to get the mixture about 100 degrees F, but I bet the temperature fluxuated quite a bit.          I then strained the yogurt through cheesecloth for a few hours (while sitting at room temperature).  The yogurt is far tastier and smoother than Fage  and Greek style yogurt.  It's about the consistency of very thick mayonaise or sour cream.  I doubt I will ever eat mayo or sour cream again.          The starter is very forgiving.  Now that I have cultured yogurt, I'll probably use the mother instead of the starter.          If you are interested in instructions or a recipe, although I did not follow this book exactly, it's a great reference:             "
