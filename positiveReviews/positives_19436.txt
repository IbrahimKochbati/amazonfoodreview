Yeah, I know i spelled artesanal wrong, but too lazy to look it up. PB & Co in NYC is awesome, and I visited the store all the time when I lived in Greenwich Village. I am currently backpacking and these packets are excellent for on the go. I highly recommend for hikers and other travelers as they provide protein, calories, energy, etc. Otherwise, if you buy the jars, this is a great flavor, but slightly better are the white chocolate and the maple syrup (very best).
