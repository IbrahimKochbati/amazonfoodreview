I've recently changed a lot of my eating habits in order to lose weight and cutting calories was key in my plans. PB2 was recommended to me by a friend who knew how much I loved peanut butter but had been abstaining from it due to the high calorie count. While PB2 is not exactly like normal peanut butter the taste and texture are very close and similar enough not to bother me. The product mixes together very well and the calorie deficit when compared to normal peanut butter makes this a no  ainer. Give it a try!
