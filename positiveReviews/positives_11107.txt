Clean, fresh tasting olive oils.  Picual has a little kick to it which the 6 year old connoisseur in my house particularly enjoyed (for info she also is partial to only 2 year old Parmigiano Reggiano).  I personally like the single origin of the olives and the pure taste; it is also a bonus knowing that Chile is one of the least polluted places on earth. Great for gifts or a healthy splurge for your own kitchen.  Fast delivery & worth every penny.
