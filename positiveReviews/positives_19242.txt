My yellow lab loves staying busy and trying new things. After my dog, Homer played the Paw Hide Dog Toy Puzzle it confirmed how smart he actually is. There were treats placed under each puzzle piece. He was able to figure out the game and get the prize...the treats! It keeps him entertained and I can really tell that he likes it. I have been  agging to all my friends that my dog has a puzzle game and that he actually understands it. Such a smart puppy! Awesome!          This is a social writeup
