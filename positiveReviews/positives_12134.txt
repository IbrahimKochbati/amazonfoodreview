Green Mountain Coffee, Nantucket Blend &     Dietrich Coffe, Columbia          These are incredibly excellent full flavor coffees.  I love them both!  I usually do Columbia in the morning, and then a couple cups of Nantucket.  They are different flavor and texture, but love them both.  (I only gave them 5 stars because that's all there are!  Would do 10, if I could.)
