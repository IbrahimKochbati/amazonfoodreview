I try to stay away from buying any meats that contain nitrites and I specifically read carefully through the description of the Wild Ride jerky, and here's a direct quote: "Wild Ride is made with all natural ingredients with no preservatives, no MSG, and no nitrites."          We haven't tasted it yet, so I can't attest to that, but I was very disappointed to read in the ingredients list that it contains: "Curing Salt (Salt, Sodium Nitrite)."          No worries if your not concerned about nitrites, but if you are, just know this product DOES contain nitrites.
