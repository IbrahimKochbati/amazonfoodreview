It was my first time ordering food from Amazon.com.  These skittles arrived with undamaged condition.          The only reason I gave 4 stars is because these candies have expiration date by May 2012 (only 9 months left). At local convenient store or gas station, I found ones with at least 18 months left, but I guess it is acceptable as these are dry food.
