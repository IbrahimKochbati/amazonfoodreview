This product definitely works.     I was not aware that i was supposed to  eak the tablet in half. After eating a whole tablet, I ate a lemon. It was WAY WAY too sweet!     I waited 2 hours for the product to wear off so i could eat regular food.     I tried a 1 2 tablet the next day. I added some lemon to a glass of water. To me, it tasted like lemonade with 5 packets of splenda. It didn't taste like regular sugar. Which i guess is good. The sweet taste was just different.     I also ate cottage cheese, it tasted like cottage cheese with sweetener in it.     The product works immediately by the way. No waiting for this to work.          I think this product will last me a while.     The day after this review I took a tiny nibble of the leftover 1 2 tablet.I made another glass of lemon water and the lemonade was perfect for me. Not overly sweet, tasted like a lemon drop ;p     Your mileage may vary with this product.          I've heard that other  ands taste a bit better than this one.     I just ordered a pack from another company. I will report back.          I have a HUGE sweet tooth and I'm trying to lose some weight. I'm hoping these tablets will help me with that :)
