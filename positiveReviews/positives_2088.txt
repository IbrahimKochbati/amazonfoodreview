I was a little concerned to buy the popcorn, as you never know what you are going to get.  But I did and I am glad I did.  The popcorn is nice and tender, pops easy, great taste and hull less.  I have moved from the microwave popcorns and glad I did because of this product.  I like the fact the the popped corn is small but great!
