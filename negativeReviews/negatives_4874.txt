Dogs love them, this box was economical as compared to vet prices, BUT they by no means help my dog's bad  eath.  I get stared down every night at "TREAT TIME" by my golden retrieve and sheltie, until I am forced to get out of my comfy chair and give them their EXPECTED DESSERT every single night.  As always, my dogs walk all over me! lol
