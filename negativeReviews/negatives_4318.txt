I've been drinking ginger beers ginger ales all of my life (I'm in my sixties) and have never tasted anything as bad as this. It tastes like water that has had pepper added to it, with very little real taste of ginger. Indeed the can lists pimenta as an ingredient! Also the drink leaves an extremely unpleasent after taste of sweetner. I find this drink to be absolutely disgusting and would advise anyone to not waste their money on it.
