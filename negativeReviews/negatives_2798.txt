We picked these up based on the glowing reviews. My fault, my mistake. I believe they are WAY over rated. Doesn't taste morning glory at all. Instead, tastes just like any one of the other in the line ... dry, stale, dense, oatmeal "cookie," like a cookie experiment gone bad by a pre teen.          In addition, cookies arrived cracked,  oken and sticking to bag, yet are dry & stale inside. What a waste. I would have never purchased these in a B&M store had I had an opportunity to examine them first.
