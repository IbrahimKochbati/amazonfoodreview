Baird is my 1 year and few months old Shetland Sheepdog. His review of this product would involve a ton of tail wagging, enthusiastic sits, downs and any other trick he knows while he waits for me to hand him the treat!          These treats seem to be really good. Baird loved them. They don't smell like dog treats. If you really sniff them yourself you can smell the hints of apple in them. Not having that nasty unnatural dog treat smell clinging to my hands for hours afterwards is a huge bonus as well.          If you don't like to give your dog unnatural treats, this is definitely a good choice as every ingredient is certified organic. There is also NO CORN or other filler grains, which is also a bonus, especially if you ensure your dog isn't getting these grains in their regular meals. There's no point in keeping corn and similar grains out of their food if you're just going to hand off a treat that has those fillers.          One down side is that, as other reviewers have stated, these treats are on the larger side. I'd say they are 1.5 x 1.5 inches in length and width once you  eak one in half. For a smaller dog, this might pose choking risks if they don't like to chew. I was worried about how Baird would handle them, but he's responsible in how he eats and chews everything really well. He's also a bit larger than a normal Sheltie. I plan on taking one over to my parents' house and giving it to their Sheltie Kiowa, as he is more the standard  eed size for a Sheltie.          I'd say, compared to say, Milk Bones, these treats are pretty pricey. However, with Milk Bones you get what you pay for; cheap treats. If you're OK giving your dog Milk Bones (I actually do as he enjoys them and I use them sparingly), you probably won't want to spend the money for these. If you try to ensure your dog has a healthy diet and want treats to match, these will definitely do the trick.          Disclaimer   I received this, as it seems did many others, via Amazon Vine, which means I got the treats for free. This fact does not color my review as I treat every item from Vine as though I've paid for it. Plus I can't fake Baird's overly enthusiastic reaction. Though he acts the same way for Milk Bones as well, so who knows?
