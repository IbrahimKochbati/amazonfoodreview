We're huge pumpkin lovers in this house, but it's one of the few things I prefer canned versus fresh. This  and is excellent. There is a huge difference between this  and versus Libby's, or any store  and for that matter. Farmer's Market is thicker and has a much stronger pumpkin taste. And to top it off, it's not only organic but now the label says "BPA free lining" (I don't remember seeing that in the past, so maybe it's a new thing for the company?) which is a huge plus.
