Very happy to see a product that actually backed up what they said about the flavor.  Have purchased other products that stated they were "bacon" flavored and dogs love them.  Couldn't get my dogs to eat them (one of them usually eats anything).  I have no problem getting my dogs to eat the Zuke's Hip Action Natural Dogs Treats.  I've noticed a slight improvement in their movement.  Haven't been using the product that long so it will be good to see how their movement improves over time.
