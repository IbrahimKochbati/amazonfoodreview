I have eaten Kopali Organic Mangos from grocery stores like Whole Foods before and they were excellent. The ones I received were horrible. I had different members of my family try them and they felt the same way. Then when I tried to return the remaining packages Amazon could not find my account and by the time it was straighten out it was too late to return them. I will not be purchasing food items from Amazon again.
