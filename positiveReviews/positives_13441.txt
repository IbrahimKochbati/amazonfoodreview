I really like this blend.  I've had a hard time with Keurig flavors, but this one seems to fit the bill.     The taste is strong, nutty...but not bitter.  I like a good strong cup.  I find many of the Green Mountain varieties, especially the mild blends, lacking in the bite I enjoy.  This one is not like that.  I would recommend for those who like Starbucks.
