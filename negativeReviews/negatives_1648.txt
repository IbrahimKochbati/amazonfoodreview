To be blunt, I was throughly underwhelmed with this product and I am finding it hard to come up the words to describe why, but the problem is that orange SWITCH doesn't have a lot going for it, so there isn't a lot one can say about it.          To me, this product is canned orange juice and club soda, packaged in a trendy little can.          And like all canned orange juice (Blue Bird  and, et. al.) there is an off taste to it that reminds you it isn't fresh squeezed juice.  Add to that this fizzy aspect, and its just kinda, well, there.          I can't say that this is a healthy drink   orange juice has some of the highest concentrations of sugars for a fruit drink.  And its cost per can is steep, especially when compared to making this stuff at home with club soda and fresh squeezed juice.          I can't give it one star   I would reserve that for something undrinkable as Amazon requires a minimum one star to do a review.  So my two star rating should be taken to mean that you can drink it and its unoffensive, but thats about all you can say about it.
