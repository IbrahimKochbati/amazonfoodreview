I have tried a few of the gluten free  eads and they crumble when you try to make a sandwich.  I tried this  and and it was so moist and easy to cut.  I kept it in the fridge for over a week and it stayed good to the last piece.  It worked great in my  ead machine.  I look forward to trying other variations and pizza crust!
