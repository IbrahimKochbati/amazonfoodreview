Arrowhead Mills Organic Brown Rice, 2pound is a good snack. I drink 2 cups a day, one in the morning, one in the afternoon. This gives me the energy for the whole day and helps me get rid of the fat around my belly. Some of my arthritis pain seem to go away too. I will keep drinking it for a year to see how the how long these effects last.
