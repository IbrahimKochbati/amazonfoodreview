Pamela's Products are by far the best gluten free option in terms of baked goods.  These cookies are fantastic!  The flavor is terrific and there are big chunks of semi sweet chocolate and walnuts.  While I do miss the soft, chewy texture of non gluten free cookies, this product is the best is its category.  I highly recommend them.
