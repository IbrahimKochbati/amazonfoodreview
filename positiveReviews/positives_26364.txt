My 11 year old Akita's teeth sparkled after 2 weeks of use.  She chews it for at least 10 minutes.  She  eaks part of it off, softens it with her saliva and then swallows it with ease.  No more doggy  eath and her teeth looks amazing!  I read how other dogs choke on it, but mine did not have a problem.  I suspect those other dogs were not used to chewing on things like rawhide so they don't know how to chew it to soften it up, then swallow. They probably try to swallow it whole or in parts (not a good idea).
