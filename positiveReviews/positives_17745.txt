This coffee is ok for the price.  Better than most supermarket  ands.  Similar to Starbuck's House Blend.  I prefer a little richer, darker  ew than this, but I think the quality is fine.  No "off" flavors that I detected.  I forgot to add that it seems to me to be low acid.  This is a large bag I ordered and I left the whole bag out on the counter and used it from there, but it got a little stale before I used it all.  I would suggest just taking out a bit at a time and storing the balance.
