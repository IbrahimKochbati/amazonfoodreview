I recently purchased this product and thought it strange that it showed evidence of grit dirt (i.e. when I steeped the tea in a glass jar I noticed that after pouring out the tea grit remained on the threads of the jar).  When I opened the 2nd bag that I purchased, about 1 month later, I found a clump of dirt (approximately 1 2" in diameter).  I decided to first call Davidson and see how they would like to resolve the problem.  I received an e mail response back from Davidson Teas and was told that they have a number of quality control measures in place (sifting and steam sterilization) to prevent problems of this nature.  The response from Davidson Teas unfortunately was "If unsatisfied with product received, please file a claim with Amazon for exchange refund".  If purchasing product directly from them they stated "we will exchange refund without any questions asked per our PRODUCT GUARANTEE (on our website)".  Overall I feel it is a good product at a good price from Amazon but Davidson Teas quality control slipped and when given the chance to resolve the problem failed to adequately address the situation.  Not sure if they will look into this situation more closely to prevent this problem in the future or not but check product for evidence of dirt if you are purchasing this product in the future.          Update (2 27 12)   Davidson's did get back with me and sent me a new bag without charge when filling out the Amazon claim form.  Have not opened up the new bag to see if the quality has improved, but replacement bag was appreciated.
