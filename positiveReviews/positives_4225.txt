we make our own fruits and veggies to use at home or at daycare.  however, storing them while we travel is challenging so we use the earths best on trips.  the flavor is wonderful, the ingredients are simple and organic and we feel good giving this to our 7 month old.  she loved all of the flavors in this variety pack so much that we are trying to replicate them at home.  we also keep these in the pantry as back up.
