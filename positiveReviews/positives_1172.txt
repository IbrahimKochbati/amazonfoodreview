Each box is 8oz and usually I make 8oz mixed with some lean protein for a meal for both my husband and I, and if we have leftovers, it's rare.  This time however, I had half of it leftover only b c we felt full and couldn't eat anymore.  I wonder if this is b c of the high amt of fiber. Whatever, this morning my hubby tells me he's down 3 lbs. too.  I'm jealous. Also, I've been on an eating binge almost 2 weeks, always feeling unsatiated. Last night I had no strong urges to eat snacks.  I ate an apple more out of habit to eat something than b c I was truly hungry. I won't say this is the outcome for everyone, but I thought I'd share.  I'm using the leftover pasta in my bean soup tonight. I'd like to eventually try the different varieties of shapes of pasta now, too.
