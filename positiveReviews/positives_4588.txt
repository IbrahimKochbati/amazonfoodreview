I'll be honest, if you want a quick  eakfast don't purchase this oatmeal. But, if you have time to spare or don't mind waiting for some "good eats", this is the oatmeal for you.          Step 1. pour some milk into a sauce pan; Step 2. add a dash of salt [or salt to taste]; Step 3. add oatmeal, making sure it stays covered by milk; Step 4. turn on stove to low heat [not too low but definitely not too high, as you don't want the milk to evaporate dry out leaving you with tough oats in pan] and cover pan; Step 5. do some little cleaning to built up appetite making sure to ck on progress periodically; Step 6. add more milk if oats are still too tough and let it simmer for a little while longer; Step 7. get your ladle just pour directing into a bowl add a few raisins cranberries your favorite dried fruit and ENJOY!
