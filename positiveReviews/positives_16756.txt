I used this good tasting Agave in pitchers of ice tea that we drink all year long.     It blends in qickly and tastes real good too.  Also enjoy it on fresh fruit because     it  ings out the flavors of the fruit rather than overtake them. It's great on anything     you would like to  ing a touch of sweetness to.
