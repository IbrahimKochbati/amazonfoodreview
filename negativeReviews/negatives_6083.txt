I had recently tried Pocket Coffee a friend  ought back from Italy. And it was one of the best chocolate I ever had! I searched and  ought this product at Amazon... but I am extremely disappointed... This is not the same as what you can get from Italy. "Instant Maxwell coffee" in the middle of "Hershey's chocolate" just doesn't compare with the real thing...
