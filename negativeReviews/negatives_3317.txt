Let's face it  if your dog is anything like mine, s he'll eat anything. It's the same story here. Our dog gobbled these things up post haste.          Thing is they're hard,  ownish, unappetizing squares. In most cases they're actually stuck together into rectangles you need to  eak apart. and they're really hard to  eak apart. One square's pretty big for our little terrier, but the rectangles were HUGE. I tried to  eak 'em into squares  but couldn't even with a knife.          I gave up and handed the treat to our dog who was just happy to gnaw away.
