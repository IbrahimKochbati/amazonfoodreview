The oil is light, aromatic and tastes great.  The bottle is opaque, very important to protect the natural benefits of this chlorophyll, and plant sterol rich oil.  I used it on my scalp (hot oil treatment) to wonderful benefits (stopped dandruff when shampoos couldn't!), and cooked a few meals which I enjoyed very much.  I would recommend this without reservation.  Just wonderful.
