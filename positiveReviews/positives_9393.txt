My premie baby born at 29 weeks weighing 1 lb 15 oz is gaining weight very nicely.  I  east fed for the first 4 months and fortified the  east milk with Neosure powder. I had to go back to work and placed him on the liquid formula.  Now he is on just Neosure every 3 hours. He is now about to turn 7 months and still not ready for solid foods but doing great with Neosure. He weighs 12 lbs. He loves this formula. I'm thrilled with his progress. Also I love the ease of use of these disposable bottles.
