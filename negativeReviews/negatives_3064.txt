I LOVE these crackers.  They are great with everything. (Try them with a touch of pepper jelly and thin slice of Asiago) But when they come in tiny pieces, they are only good for soup!  Whatever this new packaging is, it isn't working.  My last order was ok.  What's up?  Who tests this packaging?  Sending them back is a pain in the patoot!
