I originally bought these for my husband to throw in for his lunch.     We then used it for the kids lunches a couple of times.          Kashi has gone down hill since they sold the company. When it was small it was good, healthy food.     Now the sugar has crept in, and it is no better than sugar smacks.          We have it as a treat, not as a real food. So, they're good for last minute, not recommended for a real meal.
