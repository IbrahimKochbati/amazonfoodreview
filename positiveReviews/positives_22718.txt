I bought this item back in May for $30 (including shipping).  I have seen it increase, decrease, and now it is listed at over $60.  I don't get it.  Last week it was $47 or so.  Well the product is great, but I would suggest trying to find it locally, because I am sure the "free shipping" is why this item has gone up so much in price.
