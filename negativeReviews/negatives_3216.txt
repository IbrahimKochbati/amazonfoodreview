Earl grey is definitely one of my favorite flavors, however I had to knock a couple stars off the Twinnings  and (sorry   their other products tend to be the best!) as I find the Bergamot flavor to be too strong.  It borders on fruit perfume.  Those who like the Bergamot flavor to overtake the tea flavor may rate this a full five stars, however for me it was too much like candy (I compare it to the way grape candy would come through your nose) and not enough like tea.  I find the celestial seasonings version of this tea (in decaf) to be flawless.
