Absolutely our dogs very favorite treats. They get excited just seeing the packaging. The fact that they are American made and first quality is importnat to us. Unlike other chew sticks the dogs eat these in their entirety. Never any left over. However, even at Amazon the price seems a bit high, but we still go for them on a regular basis,
