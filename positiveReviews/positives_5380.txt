There is known design flaw having to do with the gasket on the upper needle. You can hear the screams about that by reading the reviews for the 'My Cup'. The gasket moves too much and as a result is does not seal correctly. Green Mountain seems to not want to fix it since it means selling less over priced coffee, which is what these machines are designed to do.          1. No matter what method I use, I have learned to carefully reach in and pull the little washer gasket down as far as I can on the upper needle. This will ensure a better seal and avoid overflow.          2. Just as importantly when I put the DisposaKup in, I press it down to make sure the lower needle has pierced the cup completely. This will make sure you have a flow of water that streams through the cup.          3. Fill it up and then tap the cup on the counter to settle the coffee grinds into the cup, do not press the coffee down or pack it in.          The key is take a couple extra seconds and these will work perfectly and you will save money. I love mine and will be ordering more once they are available again.
