My Georgie has very severe allergies and will probably be taking meds for the rest of his life. Luckily he LOVES Pill Pockets and will snarf them down, even with a big Baytril AND his antifungal pill inside! Pill time is SO much easier now; I just wish I could find something as effective with his nasty tasting liquid meds. I'll try him with beef flavored, too, for a change of pace.
