Nothing too spectacular with these hard candy. Tried a few but first they must be removed from their individual and sometimes annoying, packaging. Sugar free is a good thing but who really knows what the term really means when they are using sorbitol? I have no time to complicate matters in my eager existence but must confess that I have been sold for a long time to the name Crystal Light. I associate that name with safe for people trying to avoid sugar, even though I have been challenged several times, perhaps by people that are trouble makers at best but obviously more informed on the subject than I will ever be.  Yes, they have their little taste for they are very tiny for all the unwrapping it requires to consume them and who knows which fruit is which, in the end they all seem to taste the same. Not like eating a mint mentos where the moment it goes in your mouth you know exactly what you are getting. Still, they serves its purpose, for the person that I bought these morsels consumes them without truce, and that makes me content, for I am trying in my limited ways to keep this person from consuming large quantities of sugar, if I can help it, which is not all the time. The price for the Feeding on Dreams: Confessions of an Unrepentant Exile seemed appropriate for what we received and for sure they will get consumed. 3 Stars at the risk of being unkind for I did read the many loving reviews about this product.
