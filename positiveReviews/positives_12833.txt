These little cans, especially when very cold, are very refreshing.  It tastes great! I liked their blend of kiwi and berry because you can actually taste the kiwi in this drink. The carbonation is just right as well, it adds tanginess without coming back up my nose or giving me gas.  Which I think, is a big plus because it is a common problem many other carbonated drinks have.          So they got the flavor and the carbonation right.  However....          Personally, I like more than eight 1 2 ounces in a beverage.  I'm a 210 pound guy and when I'm thirsty 8 1 2 isn't going to do it.  But then I looked at the calories     134!          Holy smokes!  There is only 100 calories in a regular Coke. So I looked at the ingredients expecting the manufacture added a ton of sugar.          Nope! All natural ingredients including the lightly carbonated water in Switch drinks. This is also a big plus but at some point I would think they would scale back the fruit juice to water ratio to keep the natural sugar level lower.          I think they make a tasty, natural product but it's not for me because its too small and has too many calories.
