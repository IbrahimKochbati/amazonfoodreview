kitchen of india  navratan korma  is what I am reviewing.          If you like Indian food, go to an Indian restaraunt.  If you dont have any nearby, and crave something to have at your desk or table that's a little different, already prepared, buy this.  I thought it was pretty good for pre packaged food.          I dont have any expectations for packaged foods, so perhaps I'm setting the bar a little low.  I thought it was tasty!  Pop it in the microwave for 2 minutes or so, and done! It was seasoned nicely  and can also be cooked on stove top.     I would buy again, I first bought something similar to this at a local store, and after a few years, they didn't stock the same  and, or types of foods liked. So I went to amazon and looked to see if they had it.          I think the package says it serves 2 or 3.  If you serve with a side dish like rice or salad or  ead, it's enough for 2 to lunch on.
