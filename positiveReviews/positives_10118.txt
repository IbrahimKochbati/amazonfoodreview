This is my favorite  ew by far. I have always been a french roast fan because I just love the flavor of coffee. This delivers that bold, rich taste without tasting "strong." It's smooth with no hint of bitterness at all. If you love the flavor of coffee, give this a try.     However, it's much cheaper at Walmart. I buy 18 K cups for $13 there. I wouldn't pay the prices here.
