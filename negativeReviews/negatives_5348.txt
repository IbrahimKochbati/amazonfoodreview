Okay, I'll admit it.... I am a coffee snob.  I have loved coffee since I was old enough to steal a sip from my parents' cup at the  eakfast table... and that was too many years ago for me to tell you here.  That said, I will tell you that this coffee is weak and lacks flavor, no matter how strongly it is  ewed.  I tried several pots and was not satisfied with even one of them.  I love a dark roasted, full flavored coffee and have tried many French Roasts, which this is 'supposed' to be.  It was dull and flatter than any generic decaf and truly unappealing to me.  I would rather have one cup of 'good' coffee than pots of mediocre  ew.          This is a coffee that left me feeling as if I had drank a coffee substitute and not even a good one at that.  If you are looking for low acid coffee, try a good Ethiopian or one of the many naturally less acidic coffees out there and pass this one by.  It left me totally lacking in coffee satisfaction.  The aroma was wonderful in the pot, but the taste was of the ' own water' variety.  It needs work in my opinion.
