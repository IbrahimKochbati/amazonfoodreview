Wonderfully tasty  ownies for those of us who can't have glutens in our diet.  These are so good, very moist, great taste and I can't tell them from the regular  ownies I use to make from scratch.  I add about 1 2 cup of chopped nuts sometimes to the mix and so far not one person that I have shared these with can tell any difference from regular  ownies.  One friend actually ask me for my recipe and when I told her what they were she didn't believe that they were gluten free.  Will be back to buy more of these for sure.
