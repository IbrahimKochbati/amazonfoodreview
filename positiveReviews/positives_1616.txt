Recently, my life partner was complaining about our same ole  eakfast every morning.  That is when I discovered that he "loves" pancakes. I was aware that he liked waffles. (We've only been together almost five years!)  I, on the other hand, have never cared for pancakes.  I loved my Gram's waffles, but nothing she did could tempt me to eat pancakes, no amount of butter or slathering with strawberry jam could make a difference. I just didn't care for PANCAKES!  She did insist on teaching me how to make and cook them, because my Daddy enjoyed pancakes, so I learned.     I was in Central Market on Saturday when I ran into a co worker and her husband.  They took me by the hand from the Baking Products isle to the Jams, Jelly, Syrup, Honey isle.  On the top shelf was "the very best pancake mix":  Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix. I saw the price and took a deep  eath, it was twice the price of the mix I had just been contemplating purchasing. On their recommendation, I tossed it in the cart along with some "real" organic, light amber, maple syrup.     This morning, I fixed three small (3 inch diameter) pancakes for my man and one for myself just to taste. I needed to know!     Well, I don't believe I have ever had real maple syrup before in my life, just that sugar processed krapola sold as pancake syrup. I have NEVER liked that stuff!     That pancake with a tiny dribble of real maple syrup was DELICIOUS! It was the pancake mix that made the difference.     Now I am reading reviews to purchase a waffle maker.  After tasting that light, fluffy pancake, I can hardly wait to have some waffles made from this mix.  These reviews are making my mouth water with anticipation!     I will never buy any thing else.
