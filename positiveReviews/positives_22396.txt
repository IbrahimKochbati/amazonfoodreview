My family loves the taste of the popcorn and our guest love the fact that I have a popcorn machine that I proudly display in our bar area of our home. When I say it taste better than movie popcorn is that when you couple our popcorn machine with a high quality popcorn product like Great Northern, you get a complete balanced salt, butter and movie popcorn flavor. Don't go cheap on the popcorn and you will never buy microwave popcorn again. Great Northerns 6 oz popcorn bag comes premeasured and you will never have to add salt or additional butter to get the movie taste that we are all after. Plus the upside, unlike movie popcorn where you go to that giant butter machine,squirt that liquid death over the top part of yor popcorn only to find that it never reaches the bottom of the bag. This has the same great taste without making you feel like a short order cook at McDonalds and each kernal taste just like the first. I am a part time chef (fulltime banker:)), I will never buy any other popcorn product again after eating this.  Kuddo's to Great Northern for a fantastic and consistantly GREAT product!
