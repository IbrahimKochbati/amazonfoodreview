My kids do not like the goat milk straight, but are both intolerant to milk. my solution is to add a little of the mixed goat milk to vanilla flavored soy milk. Why would I do this, you ask? I read that dairy products are the best form of calcium you can get, dairy and  occoli. Enriched products, like soy milk, are okay sources, but not as good as the real deal. So I mix the two together to make sure my kids get the best possible calcium intake they can. They wouldn't drink it just so though so improvised. This company is great! Cow's milk is just not good for people! Goat milk is infinitely better. I use to make their mac and cheese and things like that too. They can stand the little bit of lactose in the cheese powder, and by using the goat milk, you can't even tell there is anything different about the dish. very useful.
