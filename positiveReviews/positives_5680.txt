I was very happy with the way this turned out. It is very similar to traditional American beers(Bud Coors) but with an extra kick. The flavor is very smooth, has a creamy head and ends with a slight bitternes. This is a great beer to start with for new  ewers and veterans alike. If you are to anxious to wait for it to age, you can drink it after 2 weeks. It will taste good, but get better with age. Make sure to put it in the fridge after it carbonates. Lager ages and taste best when in colder conditions.
