I really like these crackers. They have a mild good flavor, very crisp and crunchy. Lots of good fiber. I very rarely use  ead anymore. I just put whatever I was going to put in the sandwich on the cracker. Yum,Yum, and Crunch, Crunch. Bacon and egg on a cracker?? Mayonnaise and sliced tomato on a cracker?? Try it, you'll like it.
