My wife finds it bizarre that I enjoy a good cup of joe just before I call it a night. Yeah, sometimes I get a little spiky due to too much caffeine intake and so I thought I'd give this decaff a go. What you get is a good cup without any bitterness but it's a little weak and I recommend dropping about 50% more into your  ewer to get a fuller flavor. Also, as it's vacuum packed into a slim cardboard box it arrived completely squished flat   nothing like the fat photo in the amazon product shot. I know it's a minor thing to complain about but I like leaving my coffee out next to the coffee maker and this item wouldn't even stand up. It was about 1 2" thick!          So you're not going to have Mr Wolf commending you for your great coffee with this one but for a decaff it ain't half bad.
