I have been gluten free for 5 years and this is the best gluten free  ead I have had.  It is easy to make in the oven or in the  ead maker (you must be able to make 2 pound loaves in your  ead maker). This  ead is not all crumbly like most  eads.  It is moist, slices good and keeps well.  It also freezes well.  It is not too bad for being expensive if you order it from Amazon.  it's an even better deal if you put it on automatic order.  My mom and niece (who do not have to eat gluten free) love this  ead.  They always eat some if I let them!  I wish I would have known about this  ead sooner.
