My lab mix with hip dysplasia and a sensitive stomach was happy to see the large box of treats come through the door.  They are easy on his stomach and certainly can't help in aiding his hips.  The price was unbeatable for a flavor that is harder to find in stores.  As a bonus they are natural and high end!
