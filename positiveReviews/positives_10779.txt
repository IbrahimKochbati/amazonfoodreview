First of all, our dog Sheila cannot get enough of these. Seriously, I just got a 10 ounce bag today and she got very greedy after getting a taste. This is a healthy, organic treat that we don't have to feel guilty about feeding (in moderation) to our three year old pointer.          My wife and I try to provide good nutrition for our dog. Corn, wheat, and soy are basically useless filler when it comes to dogs. They can't digest it, and furthermore many dogs are allergic to wheat. These Newman's Own Ranch Style treats do not contain any of those ingredients. They also do not contain any artificial additives, not for flavoring or coloring.          Also important: these treats are NOT a product of China. I would sooner prepare all my dog's food from scratch than feed her any dog food treats produced in China. These treats are a product of New Zealand.          Grains are not an essential part of a dog's diet, but the one grain included in these treats   organic barley   is (from what I understand) generally an acceptable one. It's the first ingredient, followed by lamb, carrots, apples, palm oil, and molasses. Again, all organic. And that's it   very simple.
