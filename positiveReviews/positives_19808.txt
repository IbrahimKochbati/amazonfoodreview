The product is terrific if you like pink grapefruit.  I'm mainly rating this item because my initial bag I received was torn with some candies scattered in the box (everything else in the shipment was perfect as is usually the case).  I sent amazon an email about the problem and they immediately shipped out a new bag which I received the next day which to me seems amazingly fast.  This is one reason why I do business with amazon and recommend them to a lot of people I know.
