I needed something for my young dog to chew on besides her toys and my vet suggested these.  I orginally purchased the beef flavored but opted for these because the flavored have an odor.  They keep my collie busy and save money because I don't have to purchase so many stuffed toys for her to destroy!  They are also very digestible unlike rawhide which can cause damage to a dog's stomach. Your dog will really enjoy them.  As with any other treat, I only give them to her while I'm around.
