The only reason I'm "dinging" these cookies 1 star is because they are a little pricey at $1 a cookie (for a boxed product).          Having said that, I (and my kids) thought they were yummy, but be sure to have a glass of milk handy since they are on the drier side.  Nice and moist and not too crumbly.  The packaging kept the product sealed nicely over time and the cookies didn't dry out or get hard.
