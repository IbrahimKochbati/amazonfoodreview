I thought these were ok. Not great but not terrible. I'll end up eating the rest of them but I don't know if I'll continue to buy them. I like that they are individually packaged. I like their medium size. I like that they are soft baked.          Otherwise I thought they were rather dry and tasteless and they did a lot of crumbling.  The almonds were whole but small and the chocolate was in small chunks but there weren't enough of either to be a very strong taste.  I even thought it could have used more oatmeal which maybe would have kept it from being so crumbly.          I guess I was just expecting more of a sweet taste from something with chocolate and almonds.  Adding  own sugar probably would have ruined the nutrition label but it would have helped the taste problem considerably.
