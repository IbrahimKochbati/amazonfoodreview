I make for my wife capuccinno in the mourning befor she goes to work.     And I use flavored coffee in the esspreso machine and it is hard to find     Hazelnut flavored ground coffee at a reasonable price or finding just flavored     beans. This 5pound bag from Coffee Bean Direct was an excellent price and     the flavor was very good also. A great choice for paople who grind their     own coffee beans.
