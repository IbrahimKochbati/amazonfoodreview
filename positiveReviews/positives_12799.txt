The Switch Kiwi Berry is a reasonable alternative for soda pop drinkers who want a more natural alternative and the juice drinkers who want something with a bit more fizz.          The taste is somewhere between apple and strawberry though kiwi juice is in the ingredients (maybe I just don't know how kiwi juice tastes!).          *** Positive Points Include: ***            Light Carbonation       Made from 100% juice (blend of apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, rasberry, and strawberry, with a bit of vitamin c added.          *** Negative Points Include: ***            A bit on the sweet side, then again most juices are       Not a low sugar drink with about 33 grams of sugar       Somewhat high price          Overall this should be a good alternative drink for kids who cant seem to kick their soda pop habit.  The carbonation is much lighter than regular soda pop so the damage to teeth will be much less while providing 100% fruit juice.
