I ATE BEER NUTS ALL THROUGH MY CHILDHOOD YEARS AND INTO MY 20'S. AFTER THAT YOU COULDN'T BUY THEM IN UPSTATE NY. WHEN A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE SAID HE WAS LOOKING FOR THEM, I CHECKED OUT THE NET TO FIND THEM ON YOUR SITE.     THEY ARE HORRIBLE. WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT. THEY TASTE MORE LIKE SPANISH PEANUTS WITH OUT THE SALT. THE BEER NUTS I REMEMBER WHERE SWEET AND SALTY, JUST LIKE THE LABEL SAYS. THESE PEANUTS ARE BLAND, BLAND, BLAND.
