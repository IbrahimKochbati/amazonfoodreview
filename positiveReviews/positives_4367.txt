When I was diagnosed with diabetes 5 years ago, I thought I was doomed to a bland diet for life. Not true! Especially, when I found Wasa Crisp & Lights, it solved some of my problem. With a thin coat of "You Won't Believe It's Not Butter" and thin slices of banana, I have a desert or tasty snack; without the banana, I can just eat them as  ead, and they are so light and thin with the spread; they are so tasty, and I don't feel guilty after eating them. I can put cooked or raw tomato on them, with a dash of sage & basil to add to the flavor. I have successfully kept my blood sugar normal consistently with diet control. I am not doomed to a bland diet, after all.        "
