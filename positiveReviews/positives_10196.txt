In the past, my family always hid dog meds inside  aunshchweiger so they would take them.  It works great, but it's so smelly and messy.  When I took my beagle Regal to the vet for eating something weird in the back yard (at least that's my guess), our verterinarian recommended Greenies Pill Pockets.  What a dream come true.  No mess, you just slip them in the little hole and seal them up, and the medication is down the hatch without finding it spat out on the floor in some place the dog thinks is clever to hide the evidence.  They don't smell, and both our dogs love the way they taste.  They're a little pricey, but if you want your dogs to take medication mess free and fuss free, these are an excellent way of doing it.  They make a nice little treat when the pills are gone too.
