My dog is a destroyer of every toy I buy her, so I was looking for something that could keep her attention and something she couldn't easily destroy. Thankfully, I found this! My dog loves it and it keeps her entertained for hours! I use Cheerio's instead of dog treats, I think its a healthier snack and its certainlly cheaper! I would definatly recommend this toy for any dog.
