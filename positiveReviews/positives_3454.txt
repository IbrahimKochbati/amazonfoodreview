I purchased this tea for someone who enjoys Trader Joe's white pomegranate tea, and unfortunately it was not a good substitute. Though I haven't tried it myself I was told it had a strong floral taste and aroma which to that particular tea drinker was undesirable.  I am rating 4 stars since this is such a subjective judgement, and I have no doubts about this being a high quality product.
