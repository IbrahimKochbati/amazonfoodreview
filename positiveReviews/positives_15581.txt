I buy this flavor by the case   it has a very sweet, nutty, cake like flavor which is great on it's own or even better, I combine it with another tea and it's even better. My favorite companion to "True Blueberry", making my tea taste and smell like a blueberry muffin hot from the oven. This is great stuff, I'm glad even when I can't find it in stores in the summer, I can order it here.
