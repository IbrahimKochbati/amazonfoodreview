One of the best we have tried and continue to use.  It seems that most of the K cups have very little coffee in them and as a result are very weak...Donut house if very good.  We first tried a Keurig system and took it back because the coffees that came with it, mostly Green Mountain, were no where near as good as our old coffee maker...and we don't make strong coffee.  We then tried a sample of some others at the store and thought to try the Keurig again.  THis time we purchased a decaf sampler kit from Amazon and found that Donut House and Caribu were the best.  We now enjoy our Keurig much better.
