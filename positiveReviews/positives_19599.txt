I have been looking for this  and of kitty nip for over 10yrs. I bought this  and long time ago & my kitties were in heaven. This is a safe product for your pet, I trust it completely. I give it a rating of 100+. My pet is picky & when the package showed up & I opened the box, put the jar on the floor my kitty was all over the jar trying to open it up, it was hilarious. He new it was his. If you wanted to buy just a 1 2oz 10yrs ago you paid $10.00 for it. When I saw the price of this 4oz jar I was flabbergasted, I just had to snap it up in a heartbeat while I could still could find this  and. It is very hard to find it in the stores now days (go figure something that's good for the pet)I'm the cats meow in my pets eye now! It's like a kitty Valium in green form,lol. So look no farther you have found the BEST & SAFEST product for your pet right here and the price is out of this world (inexpensive). Believe me the other catnip on the market today is bunk junk & will cause health problems for your pet, Cosmic Catnip will not cause health problems, I know because the other stuff almost killed my pet.
