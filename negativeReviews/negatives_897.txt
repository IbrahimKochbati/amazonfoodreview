Some issues with the product    some of the pods are not sealed properly so the grounds spill out (either before use or after use into your coffee); it is wasteful that each pod is individually sealed    would rather they be packaged like the Senseo pods; the pods don't really fit my Senseo coffee maker    too fat for the single and too small for the double which causes problems sometimes when I  ew a cup.  On the plus side    price.
