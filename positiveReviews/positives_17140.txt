Anybody who grew up around islanders, specifically Cubans, like I did will know that this is what Cafe Con Leche' is supposed to taste like.  I never drink coffee, but this stuff will make you a coffee drinker. My sister bought me a can for my birthday and she hit the nail on the head with this stuff! I am ordering a case of this stuff as soon as I finish writing this review!
