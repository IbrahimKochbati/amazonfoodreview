We've been buying happy hips for a while   online and at stores. I feel that if I'm going to give my dog a treat, one that's closest to something "healthy" should be it. My dogs LOOOOOOVE them, I think it's their fav. Treat by far. I'm subscribed to Amazon's delivery so you do get them for a little less money and you don't have to think about going online and buying them, you will automatically get them. I love that feature   would recommend using it if you buy these regularly.
