I purchased these to give to children who come to my place of business.  When they arrived, it says clearly on the back of the individual wrapper "MADE IN CHINA."  NO WAY I'm giving these to children if they were manufactured in China, following the whole poisoned pet food debacle.  The fact that these are made in China needs to be highlighted much more clearly.
