I had lot of problems  east feeding my first child. She had latching issues, and then my milk supply reduced and finally I gave up.     With my second one, someone suggested this and I started taking it right after I delivered. From the third day I started getting abundant milk. After a while I thought may be I don't need this, may be it would have worked even without this supplement. So, I started reducing the dosage, and realized my milk supply started going down.          This is a harmless supplement, I even checked with my gynec to make sure it is ok to take it.
