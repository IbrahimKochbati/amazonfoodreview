First of all, I would like to comment regarding previous reviews. I do not think the first review in 2005 was done by an employee, and that's not really a fair statement but rather an assumption lacking any real fact or evidence. It seems like a very small company that just enjoys making cheese straws and wants to share them with others. I sincerely doubt that, at the great price they are, the company even makes a ton of profit   which is a shame.          Secondly, after tasting Aunt Lizzie's cheese straws for the first time this Fall, I will not eat anyone else's. I literally threw away a package of a VERY POPULAR cheese straw company that I received yesterday as a gift because when I tasted them, they just tasted bland and floury. I could not even  ing myself to finish them. I crave Aunt Lizzie's cheese straws so much. (I recommend trying them with some Shiraz or other wine!)          Our company gave out Aunt Lizzie's cheese straws as a corporate customer gift this year, and I bet that Aunt Lizzie will have a slew of new customers after that. Thanks, Aunt Lizzie!! :)
