I have a 10 year old Aussie shep heeler mix with chronic skin allergies    I tried him on every premium dog food including grain free protein only formulas    and none helped.  Other organic dog food also make him itch miserably.  But on the Newman's Own he's stopped the itching and shedding, and he absolutely devours this stuff.  LOVE IT!!!!
