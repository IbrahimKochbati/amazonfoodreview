I would actually give this coffee 2 1 2 stars, as I don't hate it, it isn't awful, but very "meh" for me.  As others have said, nice raspberry aroma and noticeable raspberry taste, but that's it.  The only flavor I detected (close to overriding the coffee altogether, so you could almost be drinking flavored hot water) is the raspberry.  The coffee is WEAK, no buts about it.  If you like coffee with body "legs", you won't be happy.  Very watery tasting 'mouth feel.'  I can say it's weak because in order to fill my 14 oz "cup" I  ewed *two* K cups   one 6 oz. and one 8 oz.   likely smaller than most people would  ew.  It was still weak.  I suspect that if I had  ewed two 4 oz. cups it would still have tasted like raspberry water to me, because of the flavoring itself.  Not sure what I'll do with the remainder. Maybe try adding 4 oz. shots of it to a full bodied coffee.
