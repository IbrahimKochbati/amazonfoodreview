This food is a vast improvement over the store bought crap. My dog's coat got softer within days, his  eath stopped stinking immediately and he smells a lot better. He is more active and seems healthier and happier. No more rendering plant floor sweepings for my dog! $20 a month is a small sacrifice to make for my dog's health and well being. I honestly don't know why everyone isn't more concerned about what kind of inedible junk they put in regular store bought dog food.
