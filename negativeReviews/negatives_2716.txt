This cereal makes getting your fiber easier, but it does not taste as good as the other products in the same line. I was expecting "Caramel Delight" to have a powerful caramel flavor, but found it lacking. It's not that the cereal is inedible   it tastes fine, but the flavor gets a little lost once you add milk. It's like you're eating "healthy" cereal   the "clusters" options make it much easier to feel like you're indulging and taste much better. Just be warned   don't eat too much. Don't snack on it like it's popcorn. It's got fiber, even if you can't taste it   and your body will let you know when you've had too much.
