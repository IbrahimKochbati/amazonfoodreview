This very crispy sugar wafer is perfect with ice cream, or with coffee or tea.  It's got a lovely burnt marshmallow flavor.  I really like these  they seem to harmonize with anything.  I'm allergic to GMo cornstarch, so it is hard for me to find cookies I can eat.  This one is lovely, and it's safe for me to eat.
