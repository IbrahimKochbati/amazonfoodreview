Sure you could  ead your chicken with flour, egg and  eadcrumbs and get basically the same result.  But then you have 3 dishes to wash all that glop off of.  With Shake 'N Bake all the mess stays within the plastic bag.  Simply wet down your chicken, toss it in the bag with the mix and bake it.  I found some of the coating peeled off when I turned my chicken half way through cooking, so I just patted on some more of the mix to fill in the holes.  The chicken was tasty and moist with very little effort and zero mess.  The mix adds 40 calories and only 1 fat gram per piece of chicken which is probably no more than the traditional egg method.  Super quick way to throw together a tasty home cooked dinner the whole family will love.  I plan to try the coating out on some cod since Vine was kind enough to send me a full 12 package order :)     UPDATE:  The cod was yummy!  Didn't stick quite a well as on the chicken, but the flavor was perfectly compatible with fish.
