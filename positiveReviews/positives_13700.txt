I first found out about Jaffa Cakes from the popular YouTube show, the Yogscast. I wanted to try them myself, so I ordered these because they were the cheapest option available. They shipped quickly, and when they arrived, they were in great condition. I order the product from this seller frequently. The Jaffa cakes themselves were delicious. Would definitely order again. Delicious!
