I have a serious green tea addiction and I'm always looking to explore different flavour profiles and various additions to the wonder that is green tea; this didn't disappoint. The  own rice comes through with it's nutty flavour but doesn't overpower the green tea. My only concern is that it will oversteep and get bitter pretty easily and anything over about 2 minutes is too much as opposed to other  ands I've tried and it only deepens the tea strength. Otherwise it's a great start to my mornings!
