I usually eat Libby's canned pumpkin; pumpkin isn't on the Dirty Dozen list [...] so buying organic wasn't a priority for me. But I eat pumpkin year round and the stores around me were low on canned pumpkin, so I decided to order it.          I hadn't actually tasted this particular product before ordering it from Amazon. I was a bit nervous that it would taste bad and I would be stuck with 12 cans.  Luckily, this canned pumpkin is delicious and I think it tastes better than Libby's. I usually eat it mixed with oatmeal or yogurt or in pumpkin smoothies.  Sometimes, I just eat it with some pumpkin pie spice and sweetener.          All the cans arrived in perfect condition.          I ordered this  item on December 17, 2010.
