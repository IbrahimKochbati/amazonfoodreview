This mat is so small, and as others have noted, the "turf" is pointy   so it probably hurts cats' paws (it hurts my knees!)  My cat jumps right over it and I end up with litter kicked up all over the place.  Seems like a good concept, but I would bet it doesn't solve most people's problem of trying to contain the litter.          I just bought an extra large Petmate Litter Catcher that has 4 1 2 stars.  Hopefully, I'll have more success with that!
