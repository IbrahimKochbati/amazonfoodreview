I'll admit that I was a little wary of buying food off the internet. You can't see, can't touch it, it might be stale or gross or not what your thought it was. This product is exactly what it looks like. The awesome candy you get form the store for 7.99 a pound! Plus this is FRESHER than the store.          We bought ours about a month or so ago and put it into a zip lock bag (since we didn't really need 5 pounds of it) and its really fresh and tastes delicious!
