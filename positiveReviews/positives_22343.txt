I like these bars because they are all natural and I feel like I'm getting a snack while still eating healthy.  The sugar grams are a little high, but at least they're coming from natural sources (honey, glucose) and not refined sugars.  They're not TOO sweet... they just taste very natural   like you dipped mixed, raw nuts into honey and ate it.  They're very crunchy and satisfy hunger cravings very well.  I love to get these at Borders bookstore as a nice healthy snack option while I'm out shopping.  I looked here to try some of the other flavors, but I'm hesitant to stray from the Nut Delight because it seems the other Kind bars have more saturated fat and more grams of sugar.  The Nut Delight seems like the best option of the bunch.
