My two elderly Lhasa Apso dogs loved these organic and healthy treats.  We compared them to the treats we usually give them, and they made it clear that the Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog treats were every bit as good as their old time favorites   and I am sure they were much healthier.  The only problem we had was with the size of the treats and the hardness of them for dogs that are as old as our two pets.  We did have to  eak them up into little pieces but then they quickly devoured them, seemingly having no trouble chewing up the pieces.  We did a test by placing their old  and of treats on a plate along with the Lamb and Barley treats; they finished the latter first and were looking for more so I surmised they felt the extra chewing was worth it.  I would definitely recommend these for younger dogs with better chewing power than our 16 and 17 year old family pets. Anyway, a "thank you" from Mopsy and D. J.
