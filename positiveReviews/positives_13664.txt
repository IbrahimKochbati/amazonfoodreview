My husband has Celiac disease, so we try lots of products.  We found this mix recently and loved it.  I added a few extra chocolate chips.  My kids had no clue it was GF, and I didn't feel the need to make a second pan of "regular" wheat based  ownies.  As with most GF  ead products, don't over cook.  We like these better than Betty Crocker, which are kind of sugary grainy, though still pretty tasty.  We also like them better than Pamela's (though I liked Pamela's fine, personally...my hubby was indifferent, and he's got to eat the stuff.)
