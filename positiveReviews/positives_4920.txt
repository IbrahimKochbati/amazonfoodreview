we had been looking for King B  and jerky for months before contacting Jack Links to find out what happened.  They informed us that their Smokehouse  and was indeed new  anding for the King B products.  With speculation on them keeping the same recipe, we orderd a jar and were not disappointed!!  The product was exactly what we had remembered the original King B to be. I will definetly be ordering this again!!
