Saskatoon blueberries grow in profusion on saskatoon bushes, mainly in the northern regions of the US and southern Canada.  The berries taste like blueberries, but are not quite as sweet.  They make an excellent jelly, and this one is excellent.  One often cannot find saskatoon blueberry jam or jelly, so this is a rare taste treat for toast. This jelly is also good spread on waffles and pancakes.          kone
