I hadn't had Cheddar Popchips before and as soon as they arrived, I started "pop"ing.  WOW ~ very tasty!  around $1.25 a bag with 3 servings (I open the bag and immediately put them in snack bags), it's about 50 cents a bag.  Well worth it with a weight watcher points plus value of 1 !  These are also fantastic by crumbling them on top of casseroles after cooking.  They have a lot of flavor to offer!  I can't say enough about them.  Buy and find out for yourself ~ give yourself a treat!
