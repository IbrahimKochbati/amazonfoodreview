We've been giving these chews to our dobies for at least the last four years.  Our (now) older dog had a dental cleaning and we started giving these chews about a week later.  The vet has never recommended a cleaning since.  We have a new pup (almost two years old now) and he still has super model teeth thanks to these chews.  They do seem expensive, but I have struggled to find a chew that is this effective for a lower cost.  We give the dogs a chew every night because they won't leave us alone until they get one.  I do agree with the comments in one review about the bag containing various sizes and thicknesses, but after purchasing so many bags over time I feel like it all has averaged out (some bags do have large, thick chews and no smaller chews mixed in).
