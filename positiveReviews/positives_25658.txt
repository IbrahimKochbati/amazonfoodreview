1. I love Starbucks coffee.     2. Amazon has manager's special and this week, this Sumatra coffee is a manager's special.     3. Last and most important   free shipping.           I will someday check out the Starbucks website. There is a Port Rico Importing website that has inexpensive coffees. Fresh ground daily. Love them. When they figure in my zip code (which is in the same region as they are), the shipping costs are twice the cost of the coffee!           Again, important   free shipping.
