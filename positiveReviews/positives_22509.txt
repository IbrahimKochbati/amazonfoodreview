We purchased our machine from Great Northern Popcorn 18 months ago, and have managed to consume several cases of this product for use in the machine.  Completely satisfied, as the consistency provides the same great product time after time.  Have recommended to our friends, who love not only the taste, but the machine.  Could not ask for a better product.
