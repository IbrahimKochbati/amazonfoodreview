Bought a bag of the hickory smoked flavor, and this stuff was salty enough that you could throw it on the driveway to melt ice.  Great price if that's how you like it, but I've had just about every type of Jerky commonly available along with a few that aren't, and this is by far the saltiest of any I've tried.
