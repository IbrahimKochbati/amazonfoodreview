We switched over to this cat food a couple of months ago and my cats are very happy and healthy.  We have 2 indoor cats, 1 indoor outdoor cat and feed 2 outdoor neighborhood cats, and they are all getting this cat food.  We were spending twice this amount on our indoor cats and feeding the outdoor neighborhood cats meow mix (we also have racoons dipping into the supply) but at this price we can eliminate storing 2 separate large bags of cat food and feed them all the same.          The indoor cats love this food, plus they have stopped vomiting on the floor.  The cat box does not have a foul smell, either.  Our cats range from 8 lbs. to 25 lbs., and they all seem to be thriving.  Our extra small, elderly female has no problem with the kibble size and neither does our 25 lb extra large, slightly handicapped male (he had trauma to his head as a kitten   causing him to loose an eye, partial sinus and has had some mouth repair.  We do not know what happened to him, he had been operated on prior to our adopting him from our local animal rescue.)          So, in my opinion, this food covers the entire scope of kitties' and their needs.  We are very thankful for finding this food :)
