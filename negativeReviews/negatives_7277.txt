While I usually like Nell's products and buy a wide variety of them, this product falls short.  The little candies are very inconsistent in texture, ingredients and flavor.  It's like they didn't stir the batch enough, or it settled or something.  One will melt in your mouth and not have much flavor and the next will be rock hard, but have more of the ginger "snap" that I look for.  The Altoid  and is better: more flavor, and more consistent.
