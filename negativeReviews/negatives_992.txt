I actually was delighted to find this product, and my family and I loved the recipes made with it.  However it has sugar as the 2nd ingredient AND worse it has aluminum in it.  Why would I intentionally feed my family something neuro toxic when I am trying to avoid gluten to keep healthy?  I sure wish those companies who jump on the GF bandwagon would keep health in the equation.  My kids bowel movements are gluten free too, but I wouldn't serve it to them for  eakfast.  Just sayin...
