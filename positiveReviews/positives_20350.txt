My 7 month old LOVES to eat this cereal! I found that he prefers it plain than mixed with food! He likes the natural sweetness of it! I love the fact that it has quinoa and amaranth which is highly nutritious not to mention delicious. I also love the fact that it has probiotics because my baby has not had any digestion problems. The fact that it's all organic makes it all even better.
