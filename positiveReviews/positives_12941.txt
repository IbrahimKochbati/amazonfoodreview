This carbonated 100% juice drink tastes incredibly good! You'll love this for yourself, for sport events, and for kids! These ought to be in every school vending machine (instead of sodas!)          This is made from 100% juice, so great for adult (Or kids') lunches, picnics, etc. A great drink for exercise as well, and doesn't have the sugar in it, so no spikes in blood sugar... Likely a good choice for diabetics as well, and without the artificial sweeteners!          I prefer the tangerine orange version. This one is a little tart for me, but if you like tart, this one is for you!          I would still prefer to drink this over any soda!
