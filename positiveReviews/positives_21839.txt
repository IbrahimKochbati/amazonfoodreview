Yes, it is smokey. Yes, you have to add a dash of salt or it stays a little bitter. BUT, this is by far, the best marinade I have ever used for beef fajitas. Never tried chicken (and I'm kinda skeptical to,)but I use this on flank steak to make the best fajitas a white southern girl can make ;)YUM! My mom made fajitas with this growing up and I used to always sneak a few pieces before and after the meal.
