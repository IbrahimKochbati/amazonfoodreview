I bought a Tassimo coffee machine for my daughter and her college roommates. They absolutely love the machine and the Peppermint Mocha disappeared quickly last winter. It appears that this flavor is seasonal. My daughter wanted more as soon as I found it available. The delivery was quick. My daughter said this Tassimo selection is even better than Starbucks and is far less expensive. Well worth it.
