Thought they were okay at first.  They seemed a little more oily than normal.  By time I got to bottom of bag the last 4 5 ears had a weird molding stuff on them.  Ended up throwing away.  May have just been a bad batch.  Probably came from China.  I think the Chinese have some sort of conspiracy to kill our dogs.  Seems to be a lot of recalls over dog treats that come from China.          My newest batch came from some good old boys in Iowa.  I'm feeling a lot better about them.  Few more bucks, but hey, my pets are my kids.
