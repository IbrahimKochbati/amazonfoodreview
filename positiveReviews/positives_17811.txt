On a nostalgic whim, I wanted to see if my favorite lollipops from my childhood in the mid 70's were on Amazon.  The answer was: of course they are!  Unfortunately they're not quite as I remembered, in look or taste.  Not as much sour to contrast with the sweet, which was was the main thing I really liked about them (hey, I was a weird kid.)  Granted my tastebuds were much younger and more sensitive then, so maybe it's just me.  Different packaging, too.  I remember an opaque, colorful, square wrapper that was just "twisted" on, instead of the clear, sealed, somewhat less tamper proof plastic.  In fact I have a heck of a time opening them, but at least I won't be inhaling the whole box anytime soon.  Sadly, the wrapper may just be a sign of the times. All in all it's still a good product but I probably wouldn't buy this again.
