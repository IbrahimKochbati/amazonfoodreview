My husband loves these.  They are pretty good.  They are moist so they are not like "real" jerky in that sense but otherwise the texture is very similar.  I wish they had a variety that wasn't so sweet but I definitely recommend trying some before getting an entire package   luckily I got to try each of them, which are all good.
