Only 4 stars because I don't think they are worth $1 for each cookie. The grandkids loved them and so did the adults. Plenty of chocolate to have some in each bite but not as many almonds as I would have liked. They were moist and chewy and tasted like they could have been homemade. Tasted fresh. I think the price is in the individual packaging inside the box.
