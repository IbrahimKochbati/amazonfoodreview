I really enjoyed this drink!  I am a lover of both orange juice and sunkist type drinks so I was very eager to try this drink.  It is the perfect combination of sweet and fruity!!!  The tangerine I believe helps give the extra lift of the sweet taste.  If you're trying to cut back on pop, I highly recommend this drink or even just for a refreshing treat!
