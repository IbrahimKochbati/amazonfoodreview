I'm angry that I didn't try this sooner.  It beats the pants off of the powdered stuff in pre measured packets, that's for sure!  I love the hint of cinnamon.  When I made the first batch, I thought that it may have a grainy feel, because it looks a little grainy, but it does not have a grainy mouthfeel at all.  My husband was hesistant (he thinks cinnamon smells like armpits (???)), but anyway, he was in love with it, too.  Wish I would have tried this many years ago!
