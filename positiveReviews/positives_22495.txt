We use this popcorn in our Paducah Popper from Discount Tommy! It makes the best "Going to the Movies" popcorn. We bought the popper & popcorn for parties and it works out great!  We stick with what works, so no need to try anything else.  It is easy to make since everything is included in one bag. Just cut off the top and dump in. I highly recommend this popcorn   tastes great   pops great!
