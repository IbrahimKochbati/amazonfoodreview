I was surprised how many haters there are for the Lite version. Disclaimer: I've never tried the full fat version and I'm sure it's delicious, but if you're watching your fat intake, there has to be some compromise.  I saw this at the grocery store next to the regular Baconnaise.     Lite version: 2.5 grams fat per 2 Tbl.     Original version: 9 grams fat per 2 Tbl.          I'm used to eating lite variations (though not fat free, yuck) of sour cream, mayo, salad dressing, etc.  So this wasn't a big leap for me. First sandwich, I was not impressed. Second sandwich, meh. By the third sandwich I was hooked. When by bottle ran out I had a hard time going back to plain mayo. I've been eating it so much that I don't even want to try the fattier version b c then I'll be eating even more, yikes!          It may not be a good taste for everyone, and I can understand that. But it's yummy to me : )
