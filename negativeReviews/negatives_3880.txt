This flavor has a much more mild flavor than the Black Cherry flavor I reviewed earlier.  While the juices in this can are apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry, and strawberry in order of their respective strengths, the strawberry flavor stands out the most.  I enjoyed this flavor more because the sweetness was not overpowering and the carbonation remained light so I didn't feel like I wanted to drink a glass of water immediately after.  It's a little expensive for an 8.3oz can but I'd purchase this again.
