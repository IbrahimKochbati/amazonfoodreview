I've never had duck fat before, so I don't know how it compares to other  ands. In comparison to other oils though, it is supreme. I find it adds a savory touch to class up your meals. If you're not sure how to cook with it Google duck fat and you will find plenty of recipes. The portions in the six pack are perfect if you are cooking for one or two. Finally the price is excellent for this product esp. with the Subscribe and Save program. The only complaint I have is that Amazon runs out of this product all the time. An amazing product at an amazing price!
