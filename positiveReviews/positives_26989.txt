This is by far the best jerky available on Amazon.  All of the pieces are tender and thick.  No jerky crumbs, no itty bitty pieces.  All thick strips.  Very flavorful.  Even my wife who normally dislikes jerky can eat these.  I ordered the Spicy flavor.  It has a nice blend of spice and sweetness.  Nothing overpowering.  Thumbs up for any Jerky lovers out there.  Definately better than the common store  ands.
