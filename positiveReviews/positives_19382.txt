Chef Morito's is a GREAT Addition to the Puerto Rican   Carribbian Island Seasonings.     It adds great flavor to all the dishes that you create with the seasoning.     I would highly recommend this seasoning to anyone and including all of my friends and family.          I have learned about this seasoning from my sister that also uses it.
