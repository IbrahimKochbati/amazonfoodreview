Well, hubby liked these and I did not.  He liked the variety of "stuff" in them  oats, choc. chips, coconut.  I thought they were a bit dry.  They are deceptively packaged.  Each box has 5 bars in packaging that is about twice the size of the actual bar. I anticipated that these might be a healthier choice but, after reading the ingredient panel, was disappointed.  These have as much junk in them as other bars on the market.  If you are in need of gluten free products then I guess this is a good choice for you but,if not, I recommend looking elsewhere.
