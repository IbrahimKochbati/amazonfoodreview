All three of my cats are wild about the Chicken Pot Pie variety of Petite Cuisine.  It's real chicken in a clear  oth, and it actually looks like something you'd serve yourself.  All the ingredients are "real"    no meat by products, wheat gluten, preservatives, dyes.  There is actually quite a bit of  oth, which concerned me when I opened the first can because I thought the can was mostly water.  However, it's real  oth and evidently pretty tasty, because my cats practically inhale it    they love it!  Once they finish the  oth, they start working on the chicken and always clear the whole plate.  I'll definitely buy more of this.
