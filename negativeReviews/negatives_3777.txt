I have this coffee in the past and really enjoyed it. However this one I received was so weak that neither my sister in law or I could drink it. It was left for my mother who likes weak coffee. It feels like it's only half full so it may have been a bad box. Like I said I've really enjoyed it the past when I've purchased it at the grocery store.
