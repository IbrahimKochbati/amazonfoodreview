I have three toy fox terriers and they a crazy over the Duck and Sweet Potato Treats. This product is Awesome!!! Your dogs will love them!! Smokehosue products are the best. I buy several different kinds of their Treats for my dogs. The Chicken Breast Strips are another favorite for my dogs. I don't think there is one of Smokehouse Treats that my dogs don't like.
