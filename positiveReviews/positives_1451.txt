I won't get into all of the specifics of these chips as they are listed here on Amazon. However, I will talk about the product overall. It is very well packaged, the PopChips bags aren't flimsy or too loud. You don't have to worry much about these getting smashed while they're in a bag with heavier items. They hold their own. When trying new foods, snacks, flavors, I tend to purchase a variety pack so that I can sample everything. Let me tell you, these chips are packed with flavor but, it's not, in my opinion, too heavy or saturated. My favorites are the Barbecue Potato and Cheddar Potato by far. Very realistic, savory flavors. Then, there a couple that are not my favorite but, tasty with time. The Sea Salt and Pepper Potato and the Sea Salt and Vinegar Potato are a bit strong at first and, if you don't like those flavors, I would say you wouldn't like those chips but, they certainly accomplish the taste of those ingredients. Original Potato and Sour Cream and Onion Potato are also tasty but, nothing to necessarily rave about, for me at least. I would not call this a "diet" chip but, a healthy alternative to over processed chips. I saw a few complaints about the PopChips being "too salty" or "high in sodium". The chips can come across salty to a person who doesn't consume much salt but, per bag, these PopChips contain about as much sodium as a cup of plain yogurt. Overall, great buy. You just have to decide if the price tag is okay for you, and for me, it is.
