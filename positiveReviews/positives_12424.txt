The best oatmeal there is!  Great texture and cooks up nicely in the microwave.  here is what I do.  I eat for  eakfast at work.  typically I put it in a microwave save bowl, put it hot water from the water cooler, turn the microwave to 3 minutes at 20% power (ours is 1000 watts max), and voila! it's ready. Typically I stir for 10 seconds to get the texture just right.  Then, I add 1 teaspoon of sesame oil and just a drop of soy sauce.  I don't add sugary stuff like  own sugar or any kind of fruit  (whole wheat or not, this is already full of carbs).     This should be available everywhere.
