It's a lot of cookies, but the price is very good compared to the local grocery store.  The packages were in good shape and the cookies were fresh.  My order from January 25th has an expiration date of April 28th.  Not bad, but I would have preferred a later expiration date.  Other than that, no problems.  Exactly the same Chips Ahoy you would buy in the store.
