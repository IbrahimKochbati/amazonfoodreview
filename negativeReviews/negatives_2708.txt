This pecan meal is more like  an flakes than pecans.  I had thought it was ground pecans, and the name would indicate that.  The container it came in is very light, which was my first clue it was not exactly the whole pecan nut meat.  The "meal" is flaky.  The price might have been a clue, I suppose, since the per pound price of pecans is over $12 most places.
