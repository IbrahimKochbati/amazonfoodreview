I just got this and so far my finicky cat loves it!     One of my friends recommended I try this for my cat as she has allergies     that we think are food allergies and so far nothing else has helped.     Friend's cat no longer has allergies on this food and I hope the same for mine; only time will tell.          Addendum:  She still loves it but for $20 plus in shipping which it now is, I'll be switching to something else.
