This is one of my favorite quick meals. (I usually divide the pasta and cheese powder in halves.) Just a 5 minute boil, to keep it from getting too soft (it says 6 1 2 to 7 1 2 minutes), and a quick mix of the cheese powder with milk and butter and you're done. Reduce your intake of white flour and get some (5g) fiber too!
