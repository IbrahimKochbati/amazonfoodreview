The Amber Lyn sugar free (!) DARK CHOCOLATE & COCOA NIBS bar, weighing in at 34 grams with the ingredients unsweetened chocolate, maltitol (from wheat), cocoa butter, unsweetened cacao nibs, soy lecithin, and natural vanilla is good eats even if you're not a diabetic. (Maltitol is also commercially derived from corn and potatoes, which is good to know in case you want to whip up a batch at home.)          An ever bigger endorsement comes from my nutrition conscious wife who, while wagging her finger at my dietary lapses and counting up the potential life insurance payout from my expected cheese burger induced demise, finds nothing overly objectionable in the candy's Nutrition Facts for the 1 bar serving: Calories 170, Fat Cal. 110, Total Fat 12g, Sat. Fat 8g, Trans Fat 0g, Cholest. 0mg, Sodium 25mg, Total Carb 19g, Dietary Fiber 2g, Sugars 0g, Maltitol 15g, Protein 2g, Vitamin A 0%, Vitamin C 0%, Calcium 1%, Iron 5%.          After munching a bar down, the wife's comment was "Smooth, with a nice crunch!" (I must mention at this point that she's the dark chocolate aficionado in this house.)          While I think the bar is pretty good also, I'm the cere al type that finds more of interest in the product packaging. There is the tag line "Fine Belgian Chocolate", as well as the reminders that the confection is "gluten free", "carb controlled" and "all natural."          Interestingly, while the Total Carbs dose is listed as 19g, the Net Carbs is but 2g and the "Non Impact Carbs" is 17g. I had to ask the in house expert about that last bit, and she said that was the non digestible total represented by the 15g Maltitol plus 2g Dietary Fiber. Gee, who would've guessed?          But, for me, the MOST INTERESTING component of the label is the very small print advisory that "Excessive consumption may have a mild laxative effect." What's that all about?          A bit of research reveals that maltitol is one of several polyols, i.e. low digestible carbohydrates, which can cause flatulence and, um, loose stools. It seems that each polyol has a certain laxation threshold, which is the amount of the polyol that can be consumed on a daily basis before the laxative effect is likely to kick in (though the outcome, so to speak, differs among individuals). The threshold is expressed as the LTV, or Laxative Threshold Value. The relevant point here is that the LTV for maltitol is 100g   or just over six DARK CHOCOLATE & COCOA NIBS bars! Is seven excessive? (I wonder if that many cheeseburgers have the same effect. Maybe if they're double doubles. You think?)          Also of note was the fact that Amber Lyn Chocolates, Inc. is located in St. George, UT. I've driven through there twice without taking much notice. I may have to go back; perhaps the company has a factory outlet store. If so, I'm in!
