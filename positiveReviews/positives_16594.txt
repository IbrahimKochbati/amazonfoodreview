My two babies just LOVE this product   they cannot get enough.  They usually get their treat just before bedtime.  When they know the time is nearing, they sit on the bed and anxiously await their bedtime treat.  Although the bones are small, I cut each bone into four pieces so they think they are getting multiple bones.  This item is a win win for my little ones!!
