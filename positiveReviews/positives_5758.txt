My nearby Fresh and Easy Market (an English company) has a variety of English fruit spreads and I'm enjoying trying them out. One of the latest is James Keiller & Son Dundee Ginger Preserve. Oh, my! This stuff is just delicious. I've always liked ginger, but as a spread it's just fantastic! What a nice flavor for my  eakfast toast! I can hardly wait to try this out on other folks. Or I could give a jar here and there as gifts. I'm sure they'd be appreciated.          Gary Peterson
