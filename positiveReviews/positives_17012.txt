I have a pitbull mix who is just a year old.  She was a stray I found at our school.  She chews everything (leather shoes, her bother's ears...) and she is inqusitive so I began a search for the perfect toy for her.  We have tried toys that are for aggressive chewers, many only last a day!  If she can't get it started one of her  others help her out.  She is smart and needs to think as she chews.  We came across the Tug a Jug and decided to give it a try.  She took to it right away.  It has holes in the bottom so the smell of the treats continue to hold her interest.  The screw on lid has fine threads so she can not unscrew it.  The rope cord is frayed on the inside to hold in the treats for longer play time.  The unit is made from strong plastic and is too big around for her to use her powerful jaws to crack it.  The rubber ball end is a good place for her to hold as she carries it around the house. Once I fill this toy with food I know she will be ingrossed for at least an hour while she works on getting all the treats.  A couple of things to keep in mind, the treats add to the dogs calorie intake so you have to cut down on meal time, and it can be a weapon if your dog likes to throw it around (I know this from experience!).  The first one I got for her, the cord was much more frayed on the inside so it took longer for her to get all the food. The reason why I had to purchase another Tug a Jug is she finally chewed through the rope.
