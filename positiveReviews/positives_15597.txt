This food is a delight to give to one of the most important members of the family.  She's a bit choosy & will walk away readily from many foods. So, it is really something to watch her just gobble this down!          The smaller sized can is nice as well for it insures that she'll eat the whole thing down to the carrots. With the larger cans, she'll leave a third or more sitting there and it goes to waste.          Petite Cuisine may cost a bit more, but nutritionally it is a very good meal for the kitty and she likes it, so none goes uneaten!  So, in the long run, it is a good value.          On inspection of the cat food, it is composed of very good ingredients and is a high quality product.          Our kitty loves it and gobbles it down at one sitting!
