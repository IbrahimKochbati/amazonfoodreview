Sorry!  The sweet and sour chicken dinner should be called sweet and sour water chestnut dinner.  I found almost no chicken, other than tiny pieces, and LOTS of water chestnuts, which I don't like. Even if there was more chicken, the flavor leads a lot to be desired. This is one dinner that will not find itself on my grocery list.          I remain, totally disappointed,  Shirley
