I had never tried Bob's Red Mill pumpkin seeds although I have used and been very happy with many of their other products. I was looking for pumpkin seeds from pumpkins grown in the USA. Most of the organic seeds are from China. The Bob's Red Mill seeds are from pumpkins grown in Oregon.          I took the plunge and ordered 4 bags of these seeds, and they arrived in less than 48 hours.     Four sealed bags were also in a sealed Bob's Red Mill box and then packaged in a larger amazon box.          I just opened one bag of the seeds to try them. They are WAY better than what I was getting at my local whole food store in bulk. These seeds are chewy as they should be and not hard or stale with any off taste.     These have a slight pumpkin taste, which they should have. This variety of seed is rounder and flatter than some of the other pumpkin seed varieties I've had, which I like (no pointy ends to stab me as I'm munching them down).     All in all, a great buy!          Seeds   5 stars     Grown in the USA   5 stars     Total   10 stars!
