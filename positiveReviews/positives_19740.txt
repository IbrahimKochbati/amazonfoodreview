Ever since I was introduced to non fried, fresh spring rolls at a Vietnamese restaurant, I've been obsessed with them.  Immediately I started experimenting and making them at home.  I have bought a variety of  ands from Asian markets to Whole Foods and they are decent, but I've always been a bit bothered by the fact that they are made from white rice which is not nearly as nutritious as  own rice.  I did not think  own rice wrappers existed!          Once again Amazon comes through for the consumer and gives us access to great products like these superior spring roll wrappers!  I didn't think they'd actually taste much different or better than the white rice wrappers I usually buy, but I was SO wrong.  These wrappers are delicious  they taste fresher, are not gummy or thick like the white rice wrappers (my husband LOVES them and whenever we make spring rolls for friends, they rave about them).  Also, the ingredients are superior  they are made from premium whole  own rice, unlike the white rice wrappers which are made from "white rice flour" which makes a big difference on so many levels  taste to nutrition.          I also read about this company which was started by two women.  They are a small company; they are ethical and care about the quality of their products and farmers that they deal with...unusual in this day and age.          One more thing!  Don't be afraid to make these at home!  You can fill these wrappers with anything!  Simply dip the wrap in a bowl of water for a few seconds,  lay it on a table and fill!  I dip 2 wrappers in water at a time (much faster) and spoon in everything from chopped veggies and tempeh to noodles and tofu.  They are simply delicious.
