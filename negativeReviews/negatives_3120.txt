I'm not much of a coffee snob. Heck, I'll drink whatever dreck the greasy spoons are serving without complaining. At home, I'll even reheat a cup that's been sitting around all day, as horrid as that sounds. I totally eschew that dark, burnt tasting, supposedly gourmet Starbucks (jokingly called Charbucks in our home) simply because it's far too strong for my tastes. But when it comes to my fresh cup of coffee in the morning   you know, the one that gets you going, the most important cup of coffee you'll drink all day   I like it to taste robust, hearty, sensual and strong.          Coffee made in drip coffee makers always seems to lack this quality. Coffee from those popular machines always has a somewhat "cardboardy" flavor, in my opinion. So it was with some trepidation that I chose to receive Melitta's Cafe Collection Classique. When I actually do make drip coffee or perked coffee (for dinner guests and the like), I grind the beans fresh which helps both styles have that coffee shop flavor you can't seem to get any other way, unless you own an espresso machine or a french press, but I digress.          Since this is already ground in the bag, I knew that my best bet would be to make it over strong to help the situation out. I don't own a french press, an espresso maker or any other fancy coffee gadgetry. Instead, I made a single, large mug with 4 tablespoons of coffee grounds tucked in side a Melita coffee filter (stapled shut) and  ewed for about 6 minutes on high in the microwave, much the same way I make coffee from Folger's coffee singles.  And it worked, the coffee smelled great, was a nice dark color and I looked forward to my first warm sip.          And that's when I became disappointed. As dark as the color was, as rich as the aroma was, the flavor was...  lackluster. It simply didn't stand up to my cheap, easy Folgers singles. And that's a shame, because now I have almost an entire container of coffee to go through. And about that container...  It was almost impossible to open. The gold wire wrap that is supposed to keep the coffee closed later fell off immediately. It took a pair of scissors to open the bag and even then there was some trouble. Compared to simply tearing open a Folger's single, this put one more hassle in my morning that I didn't need.          All in all, it was just OK coffee. For a premium roasted coffee  and, you'd think this would knock me out of my slippers but instead left me pining for something else. Coffee, anyone?
