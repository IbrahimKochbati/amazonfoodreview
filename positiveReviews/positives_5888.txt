I love to feed my kids goats milk. But to buy it fresh from the farm is so expensive, so this is a great substitute. I started my kids on this when I stopped nursing and they've loved it ever since. They eat it in their cereal and drink it straight from the cup. I think goats milk is the next best thing to  east milk!
