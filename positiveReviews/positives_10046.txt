If you're a coffee lover like me, then I suggest you try Melitta coffee.  This particular coffee is ground finely enough to be used in an espresso machine, but works just as well in a drip coffee maker.  I really like this coffee because I love the taste of strong, rich, and aromatic coffee, but I do not like when it is so strong and dark that it tastes bitter.  Melitta Cafe Collection Classique fits the bill perfectly.          My husband, who is also a coffee drinker, but doesn't quite appreciate it the way I do, only drinks coffee from a drip machine and has to make it very light and very sweet.  He is notorious for using the flavored coffee creamers.  When he he drank this coffee, prepared the same way he prepares his regular Folgers  and coffee, he didn't notice a difference and had no idea that I had let him try a new type of coffee.  So with that being said, if you're a regular supermarket  and coffee drinker who has to mask the flavor of coffee with sugar or flavored creamers, then I recommend not spending the extra money on this coffee as you probably won't notice a difference.  On the other hand, if you are like me, and truly appreciate coffee (I don't use sugar and use minimal creamer) then do yourself a favor and try it!
