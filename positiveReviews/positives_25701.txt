This is a dark coffee, and not bad, but nothing to get ultra excited about either.  I like it better than Starbucks, the price is a bit better, and it has a good smooth rich flavor with plenty of body.  I'll buy it again it's a good everyday kind of coffee, and I love the Tassimo coffeemaker anyhow.
