I do not know a whole lot about dog food, but I try to avoid corn because I noticed it makes my dogs stink.          This very much looks like a quality dog food in its texture, from the ingredients listed, and the fact that it's not bone dry like some of the cheaper dry foods. It reminds me of some of the premium  ands in its color, texture, and....this is a bit gross, but the compactness & darker color of what came out of the dogs after they started eating it...!          I like it, the dogs are eating it and doing well on it. I will definitely be buying it as their regular dog food from now on. The price is probably better than the other store premium  ands because there is no advertising.          I recommend it.
