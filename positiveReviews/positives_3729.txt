I have two small dogs who have [[ASIN:B00139ZPKM Newman's Own     #0174;Organics Advanced Dog Chicken & Rice Formula, 12.5 Pound Bag]]  Their only treats were Cheerios.  When I switched to Newman's Own  and, I was pleasantly surprised to notice they stopped their occasional vomiting.  With all the trouble caused by lack of standards in the industry, I immediately thought "if I can't trust Paul Newman's foods, whose can I trust".  And, they love it.
