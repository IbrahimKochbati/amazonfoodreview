This is really good stuff. I was looking for a healthy alternative to white sugar, and read that agave nectar and sucanut are not really that healthy after all. So even though I'd never tried coconut sugar before, I was intrigued about how it tasted.          I was pleasantly surprised, as it tastes like a mild  own sugar, and most importantly I don't feel a sugar spike after eating it.          I've put it in my organic coffee (yummy!), and cooking with it seems to work just fine (the company says to use it 1 to 1 as a replacement for sugar in recipes).          I like that this company uses the profits to support the economy of small farmers in Indonesia. Good karma and great taste!     Recommended!
