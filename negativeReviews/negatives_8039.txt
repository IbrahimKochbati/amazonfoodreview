I stopped buying Beef Jerky to avoid the preservatives, Nitrates Nitrites etc.  Thinking I found one without, I purchased this product after reading the words "all natural" in the product description.  Now that it has arrived, I found Sodium nitrite is listed on the package. Also, I might mention that after the blurb about the "Texas Rancher" looking for something better, I wasn't expecting the advisory on the bag that the Beef was not only sourced in the USA, but in Uruguay, New Zealand or Austrailia. Oh well, a guy can dream.          Tastes pretty good if you close your eyes.
