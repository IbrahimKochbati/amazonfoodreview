I think Shake and Bake can truly be a lifesaver. I've tried store  ands, but this is definately something you want the name  and of. Chicken and pork comes out tasty and it's so easy to make.          The only complaints I might have are that I think it should come in a resealable pouch  I never use the while pack at once and generally the cooking times recommended on the box are about 5 to 10 minutes short.
