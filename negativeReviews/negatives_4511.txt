I purchased two boxes of this because previously I had purchased Happy Baby Chick Chick and my daughter loved it.  When I opened this pouch up I couldn't believe the smell and texture of the "food".  It smells just like cat food because it's fish.  And the texture is just like canned cat food.  I have two boxes of this that I can't use because my daughter gags as soon as I  ing the spoon up to her mouth.  I don't blame her, I'm gagging as soon as I tear the package open.  The nutritional facts are outstanding but they need to make it taste and look better.  The Happy Baby Chick Chick is an actual hearty puree with pieces of chicken and pasta.  This is not even close.
