Kinda expensive for cheese product...would expect ssomething closer to the $3 per pound price I can get in the supermarket, but it is so versatile...can be used in any recipe that calls for cheese.          My favorite use is to SUPER CHEESE both store  and and even Kraft boxed mac n cheese...sometimes that little packet of cheese powder just doesn't give me the cheese i ness I want...so after mixing the mac n cheese according to the directions on the box, I put a few slices of Velveeta on top, nuke it for a few minutes, mix it in, and VIOLA..!! Try it, you'll never want to eat mac n cheese out of the box again.
