Sometimes coffee bothers me being too acidic, this one did seem to bother me less then most. I only had one small sample to try and it's difficult to give a solid opinion on just a 2 cup trial. Right off though It lacked the full body of Starbucks House Blend or Italian Roast that I love but it's still pretty darn good coffee and I liked it better the more I drank it. If you have acid issues this may be worth a try. It is high in caffeine apparently because I felt a bit more wired then usual after drinking it so don't mistake low acid for low octane this still packs a punch! I would like to try this again, it's pretty good stuff.
