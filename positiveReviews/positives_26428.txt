My buddy (some prudes would say "my master" but my guy is just another big dog to me) bought these chews for me.  We have long walks and long talks and both have better days.  He scratches my ears and that really itchy spot just in front of my tail.  I wag my tail and sleep beside his bed.          Anyway, I didn't buy the C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews, he did.  I really like them!  I cannot wait to get one every morning.  I jump and whine and wag and do everything I can to let him know how great they are.  My doctor says my teeth and gums are better because I get them.  Personally, I would rate them as "four paws up!"          Thanks for asking.  If you ever get near the Oregon Coast, look me up.  I will take you for a run on the beach.          Daisy
