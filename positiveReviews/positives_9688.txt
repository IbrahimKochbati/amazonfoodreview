If you have heavy duty chewers like I do (2 pit bulls), then this is the bone for you.  I think I have tried every bone on the market and these are the only ones that really stand up to iron jaws.  They are a little greasy first coming out of the package (but not smelly), but your dog will make short work of that extra 'flavoring'.  2 thumbs up!
