I can have chips around for ages...but not these suckers  once I start, I'll eat half a bag and it's gone in a day or two! I haven't eaten the chemically laden version in years...but remember the neon orange junk that got stuck on my fingers. Robert's Pirate Booty is just delicious and addictive. You have been warned!
