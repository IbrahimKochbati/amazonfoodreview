After a second purchase of a 12 oz Beer Nuts Peanuts 6 pack, I can level no complaints. The shipment again arrived without any adverse settling such as clumping inside the cans. Although the flavor may be a bit duller than my abiding childhood memory of them, this may be attributable instead to the diminished taste buds of a middle ager. Nonetheless, everyone I know who has tried this product likes it.  Either as a stand alone snack or as an adjunct to a couple of beers, Beer Nuts is a tasty, if understated winner.
