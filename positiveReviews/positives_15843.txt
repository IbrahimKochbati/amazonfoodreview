I have mixed feelings about this cat litter.          When my cat first poops, the litter mixes with the smell of the feces and creates a horrid porta potty smell. However, after about 5 minutes, the odor is COMPLETELY gone. It clumps poop very well, but if you have multiple cats, this litter does what all litter does  makes the "wet sand" consistency at the bottom of the pan (and it smells like ammonia when you scrape it out.)     Get A&H Super Scoop if you are sensitive to perfume (it works the same as Double Duty, just a bit less feces odor control.) Get double duty if you would rather smell chemicals for 5 minutes than poop all day.          This litter also has the tendency to stick to paws. If you get it, keep the box on a non carpet surface so you can easily sweep the granules that your cat may track out.          Overall, good product, just be prepared for a nasty smell for 5 minutes when your cat takes a dump.
