These crackers are great  the beauty is not in their own flavor, but the fact that they are a perfect, crispy, low calorie, gluten free delivery mechanism for all manner of spreads and slices.  They don't come with over powering artificial flavorings to compete with a topping of your choice.  Some of my favorites are...peanut butter and banana or laughing cow cheese with turkey pepperoni.
