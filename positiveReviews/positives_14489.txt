I have been drinking Celsius now for around 6 8 months. Prior to that, I had tried several of the other energy drinks out there, and always regretted it later because of all the extra calories in them. When I first found Celsius, I figured it was too good to be true (it claims to actually burn up to 100 calories per can). While I cannot comment on the calorie burning effect, I do find it has a great taste, the best of any energy drink out there that I have tried, and does give me a "boost" of energy. I drink one every morning.          Overall, I love this product. I will purchasing this from Amazon (which was almost $20 cheaper for the 24 pack than the store I normally go to) on a regular basis from now on.
