My dogs are usually fed raw, but it was getting hard to find alternative meat sources for my highly allergic Lab X. I ordered this and the venison after a holistic vet tech recommended it, and it is AMAZING. I add some cooked veggies and water, and they go gaga over it.          Thank you, ZIWI Peak, for making a product without fillers! (For dogs that are allergic not just to grains, but also to rice, potatoes and sweet potatoes, as well as eggs and chicken, it's slim pickings out there!   Other pet food makers, take note!)
