great purchase and a great value from a wonderful company who stands behind their product.     Had four of the trays for about five months, and they were in CONSTANT use. We definitely got our money's worth!!          After five months, we had a little issue with a funny smell (it did not smell like any of the food we froze) so I tossed the trays.  Scandinavian Child replaced them immediately.  they even tried to match the colors we had!     they REALLY stand behind their product. Their customer service was amazing; their genuine helpfulness and accountability for their product is so refreshing!!          I look forward to having they trays again, and I would definitely recommend them.
