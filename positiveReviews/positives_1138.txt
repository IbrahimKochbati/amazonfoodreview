I've been eating the McDougall Right Foods for a few years now, and this is by far the best.  It takes exactly the way the name suggests.  It tastes great with cooked vegetables such as  occoli and cauliflower, and it is very easy to make.  The only problem I have with it is that the noodles aren't thick enough for me, but I think one time I let them sit in the microwave a little longer and they became thick.  Other than that, I'd recommend this product to anyone who wants to eat healthy and who enjoys noodles and peanut flavor.
