I drink tea every day after giving up coffee a few years ago. I have a variety of black teas and a few green depending upon my mood that day. When I'm in the mood for something strong, this is my tea. I skip the double pot and just  ew up a pot full and store in a carafe. Use boiling water and steep for at least 10 minutes.
