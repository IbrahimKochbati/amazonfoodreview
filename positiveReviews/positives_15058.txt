i got this tea super cheap and it's pretty good. main point, it's organic! organic and tea and cheap are usually not things that go together. is it gourmet? no. but it's the best i've seen for the price. so for value, five stars, easy. if this was thirty dollars a box however, i would be on here writing a one star review.          mild green tea flavor, no grassyness, not a ton of theanine (just guessing by how it makes me feel) but enough. medium caffeine content, on the low end but not non existent.          only complaint, on the package is a picture of a tea cup with what looks like high end gyokuro or something, full leaf leaves floating in it. rip open a bag though and you find dust. not a problem at all really, just silly to put that on the box when that's in no way what's inside.
