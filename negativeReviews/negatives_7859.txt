I have a 1 year old lab Shepard mix and she is a very active chewer.  I ordered the CET chews to keep her teeth clean.  She absolutely loves the flavor, but because the rawhide is so thin, she tears them in half and tries to swallow them in large pieces.  The first time she did it, I thought maybe it was a one time deal.  I saw her choking and stuck my hand down her throat to remove a piece of rawhide blocking her throat.  Just today, she choked again, and I wasn't able to pull it out but in my efforts I must have shoved it down and she could  eath again.  It is a very scary moment to see your dog choking and gasping for air.  My dog was looking to me for help and once her throat cleared she laid in my lap for 30 minutes...I am guessing it traumatized her.  I threw the rest of the bag in the trash.  My dog also has loose stool whenever she ate these, but she does have a sensitive stomach to certain foods so I am sure results will vary.  I will stick with  ushing her teeth and getting her teeth annually by the vet.          My dog   70 pounds, 1 year old lab Shepard mix.  She eats the beef Orijen food blended with California natural.          Edit            My dog Taro is now three and a half and I see these chews at the Vet clinic I go to.  I also see that this product has really great reviews so I am sure that it works for most people's dogs and people love the product...I just urge you to be very cautious if you purchase this chew and stay with your dog when they are chewing on it.  I just wanted to edit this review because the risk is so high with these chews that I felt compelled to warn potential buyers of the product.          I think the manufacturer should at a minimum put a strong warning on the front of the bag to warn owners that this can pose a major choking hazard to some dogs.  This would be the responsible thing to do.  Pet products are not regulated like products for human use.  Most people like me view their pets as children and essential to their lives.  If this were made for children, the danger of this product would make news and force the manufacturer to address the choking hazard.          It also seems fishy that almost all of the 5 star reviews are from people with 1 4 reviews on other products.  Plus the number of "is this useful votes" is usually less than 5 votes.  It seems as these reviewers are fake...just seems fishy to me.  I hope this isn't the case because they would be toying with the danger of killing our dogs.
