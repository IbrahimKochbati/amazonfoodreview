Very disappointed in this.  Heed the bad reviews.  I am now at the lowest amount of  ewing and it still tastes watered down.  Need to dump some Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate in there to give it flavor and that point, what was the purpose.  With the product already being overpriced (shop elsewhere)as it was and tasting watered down; it just wasn't worth it.  Skip it!  Maybe a different  and will be better.
