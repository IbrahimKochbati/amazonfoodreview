You get to large cans of the powder. The flavor is rich and the best part is you can make it as sweet or as week as you like. One scoop per cup is usually plenty. I mix mine with a little milk to for a more creamy texture. I've tried a few other mixes and some have had a nasty smell and after taste. I used to buy the Target  and in the green can but they discontinued that and now make it in a silver can and its one of those fake chemical smelling and tasting mixes...YUK.          The only complaint about this is that 25% of the can is empty so you really don't get a full can. Other than that the flavor is great. Very close to the Duncan Donuts kind.
