These organic, all barley biscuits are hard as a rock and I was afraid the dog would  eak some teeth... or at least chew on them a bit longer. Not so: Our tiny mutt loves them, and because I trust the Newman's  ands, a good, good buy. Organic apple, lamb and lots of good stuff in a small batch treat for the dog (made in New Zealand). Classy goodies to be sure.          I couldn't  eak a biscuit in half without pounding on it with a heavy bottle, so expect to be humbled by them.  Dog adores them!
