Received the shipment promptly but to my dismay, it did not contain the mini treats I had ordered, but "small", which were not that small.  I have very small dogs and I really wanted the minis. I contacted the seller (Petco) and after several days, they responded that I could return them but if I reordered minis, they would still send the small because Amazon had the item numbers wrong and they don't have minis. They said the simplest thing would be to return them for credit. This did not seem economically feasible, so I am  eaking each one into small pieces which is very inconvenient.
