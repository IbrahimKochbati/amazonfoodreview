I truly enjoy a good cup of coffee. I've tried most major  ands of coffee, from the makers of specialty coffee such as Starbucks and Peets to makers of commercial grade coffee such as Folgers, Maxwell House, and Yuban.          I must say I thoroughly enjoyed the Melitta Cafe Collection Supreme Ground Coffee. It definitely ranks as one of the best coffee I've ever tasted. It is medium bodied yet rich, aromatic, and robust. I usually associate a darker gourmet coffee with flavor, but Melitta has changed that perception. It is not bitter and very smooth to the palate.          I generally prefer a darker, more full bodied coffee such as Peet's, so I was surprised that I enjoyed Melitta a fair bit. While it doesn't displace Peet's as my favorite coffee, it offers a very nice departure from a full bodied coffee without compromising on flavor. Another plus for me is the Melitta packs quite a punch in caffeine!                  If you like a coffee with a lighter body, you will enjoy the Melitta Cafe Collection Supreme Ground Coffee. If you're accustomed to a darker coffee, the Melitta may or may not be suited to your taste. (You won't know it until you try it!) The bottom line    The Melitta is without question the best quality coffee I've ever had in this price range.
