My cat loved milk and always nagged me for some. Unfortunately it gave her the runs. I was so happy I saw this at Petsmart. She loves it and her tummy tolerates it well. She gets about a tablespoon every night before bed and I would hate to forget to give it to her. Would get no sleep that night for sure.
