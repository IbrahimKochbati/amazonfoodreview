So... my preferred  eakfast is 9 or 12 grain toast with peanut butter. But at the end of the week that's a LOT of calories and fat. So I started having cereal or oatmeal and I started losing some of the 10 pounds or so that I've put on in the last couple of years.     No matter how much I exercised or ate carefully, that peanut butter was doing me in.  Now I mix a bit of PB2 every morning and save hundreds of calories per week   and I still get to have my preferred  eakfast.     The taste? Not going to lie  it isn't exactly the same. But it's damn close and was EASY to make the switch. I don't even measure anymore   just add a few drops of water at a time till I like the consistency. It takes about a minute   long enough for my  ead to be toasted  so no big deal.     I'm lazy and always hungry   but this absolutely works for me.     I'm so delighted to have discovered it.
