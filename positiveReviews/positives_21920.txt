I first tried this gum about a month ago. First of all, it is sweetened with xylitol   a natural, plant derived sweetener. There is no aspartame or saccharin   common synthetic sweeteners in gums. This gum will not give you chemically induced migraines. Secondly, licorice has been used as for digestion, for centuries. It also sweetens the  eath. Plus, the gum is also affective in preventing tooth decay (xylitol). I found that my stomach ache and cramps diminished after chewing this. So much better than many gums on the market, today. I recommend this highly!
