I am type ONE Diabetic.  I dont have time for  eakfast in the mornings so I grab this high protein drink and it is very tasty and good for you and I dont worry about my blood sugar as it is just enough of carbs, calories for a nice  eakfast. I just wish it was not so spendy... but when you think about it... it is only $2.00 a drink so pretty cheap  eakfast.
