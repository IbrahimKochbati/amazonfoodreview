I found this product at a grocery store that I don't usually shop and was thrilled my find.  I had been considering this product on amazon and had been contemplating ordering it.  I am quite glad that I picked it up.  It tastes great in oatmeal!  I am happy with this product because peanut butter is one of my all time favorite foods but has been cut out of my diet due to the high fat content.  I recommend giving it a try.
