I gave these treats to a friend for their dog.  The dog seemed to enjoy them, he did not choke, and everything seemed to be dandy.  I am not a dog person, do not have a dog, but I know lots of people have them and love them.  This treat worked well for someone's dog, so it would probably be good for yours, too.
