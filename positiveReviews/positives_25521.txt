LOL Don't be intimidated by all these exotic Goya products, the company     is actually the oldest and most revered of all the commercial Spanish foods     companies and Chimichurri can best be described as Argentine Pesto.          This is my favorite Chimichurri sauce, and its properly made with olive oil.     But not just any olive oil....Spanish Extra Virgin Olive Oil and in my book     it just doesn't get any better than that. (note: avoid similar products made     with vegetable oil)          Following the traditional recipe, this makes a delicious dressing for any     grilled meat including burgers and sausages. But where this really shines     is as a marinade rather than a finisher. This has a tangy herbaceous flavor     and you will taste the blend of garlic, parsley, onion, olive oil, apple cider     vinegar, oregano and white pepper. Want more flavor, add your own herbs or     garlic but I think this blend is perfect right out of the jar.          It can also be used as a spread with  ead or to add a boost to vegetables,     salads and soups. And while mainly used for steak, this stuff works really     well on fish and grilled shrimp too or for making Bruchetta, or even just     with cheese and crackers. Its very versatile and you will find any number     of uses for this terrific concoction.          IMO, this is the Heavyweight Champ of commercial Chimichurri sauces.
