Bob loves these treats better than anything and lets me know every day when it's Greenie Time.  I cut them in half because they are so expensive but I've been able to find them at much better prices on Amazon than in the pet food stores even with the manufacturer's infrequent coupon.  If your dog loves these, buy them online and save.
