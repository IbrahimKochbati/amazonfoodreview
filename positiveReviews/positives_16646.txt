Most dogs LOVE Greenies, and they are supposed to be great for their teeth, but they are also quite expensive. I found this 96 count package on Amazon for under 25.00!!!! Note that this is the petite size as I have little dogs, so if you are looking for the larger Greenies you need to check the pricing. The product arrived within a couple of days, and is a great value. Normally a package of 6 or so petite Greenies cost aprox 7.00!
