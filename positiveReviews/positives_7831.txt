My day had been nothing exceptional.  I had forgotten to take lunch and the afternoon was dragging.  Upon returning to my desk I saw a bag of these on my desk that had been here for a few days; a gift from a friend.  I decided to take them to the microwave and give them a try.  I fully expected to "pop" them and open the door to the worst smell I could fathom.  Imagine my surprise when the bell dinged and I opened the door to the delicious smell of still sizzling savoriness that is Lowrey's How n Spicy Bacon Curls.  It was like cherubim descended from heaven and placed God's favorite snack in my mouth.  I was bathed in a pillar of light and from nowhere the volume rose to a crescendo of Beethoven's 9th Symphony.  At that moment I realized that my life had been building to this moment ... this one perfect instant in time.  I felt as if my tongue was nodding in approval and I shed a single tear of joy.  If I have another son I will name him Lowrey.
