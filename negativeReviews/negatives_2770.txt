I purchased this product over a year ago, and the best I can say is this is an ok product for me, but could be perfect for you.          I used to always reach up to the top shelf, grab my box of k cups, sift through them to find what I wanted, and then make my coffee. I tried to use the wooden box, but when you can only hold 20, and you use multiple k cups per day, I just felt like I was always filling it, and didnt have enough room for variety.          I bought this thinking it was perfect, holding 36 cups should last me a few weeks minimum. The Keurig would sit right on top and take up less room. What more could I ask for? Then when I  ought it home though the truth came out.          The draw is very well made and works perfect. However you are adding about 3 inches to the size of the keurig. Due to the height of my cabinets, it raised the machine just enough to not longer be able to open enough because the handle hits the cabinet. For a few days I was pulling it out and using it like that, but that got too annoying. Instead I now use the draw, but not with my coffee maker on it. It now holds my knife block instead, since those can still come out just fine.          If your keurig is set up with no cabinet above it, this option is beyond perfect. However for me, I feel like it just added a bit of clutter, but I am willing to deal with it for the convience of the drawer.
