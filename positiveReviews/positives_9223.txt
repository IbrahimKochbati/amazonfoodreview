A good range of reviews here. I especially like the one that seeks to educate. That is unfortunate there are no more canneries here in the States.          Here's my reality:          I believe this company is out to put out quality products. And if your really concerned about their business practice do some due diligence. They have a website.          I stopped for years eating anything out of a can. And for a single person I can't afford buying wild fish in bulk. I love the fact that this company puts out this product. Being of a Pacific Island decent (born and raised in the U.S  and proud to buy american) the food my ethnic community eats is a horrible combination with all that msg and salt. Not all asians eat vegetables. Particularly Filipino's. They fry everything and eat too much  ead. It's the  ish influence. I respect their dietary choices but it didn't work for me.          About 10 years ago I gradually shifted my health. I believe in moderation. And I do research the companies I buy from. I've never considered sardines. Then I tried the Sardines in Olive Oil and I am hooked.          I study the health benefits of all things. I've been doing it for 10 years now. I study psychology and do yoga.          Health first comes from your mind. It comes down to testing and learning what your body likes. It doesn't help to scare people into health. It doesn't work in the long run. I've met health freaks that worry so much about the negatives that it physiologically affects their health. There is such thing as too much information. You have to enjoy what you eat. Simple.          I eat this stuff out of the can. The flavor is fantastic. It's great with some  own rice and veggies. I haven't quite made the transition to totally raw and I don't think I ever will but this is the next best thing.          Price is not comparable to the price of your health. Most don't know how to measure that. The way I watch people waste their money on things like eating out, booze and claim they save money to buy one dollar microwaveable meals doesn't compare. Those "frugal" individuals suffer long term when they get older. They are the same people that poke fun at folks like me who take supplements and do yoga. I see a long term investment that most people tend to neglect: YOUR BODY! Your health needs to balance on ALL levels: mind and body. That's when you reap the benefits.          If you want great healthy food for an affordable price and still support the planet, then support this company. Your body in the long run will thank you for it.
