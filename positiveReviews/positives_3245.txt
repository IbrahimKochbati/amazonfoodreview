We use gluten free Bisquick to make coated baked chicken, waffles, pancakes, biscuits, chicken pot pie.  There are many recipes available to make quick easy meals.  We really like it.  Everyone can eat it instead of just making a gluten free meal for the one person who is gluten free. Reasonably priced for gluten free.
