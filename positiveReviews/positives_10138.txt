OK, you may have tried the regular Shirataki noodles.  They have a texture nothing like a noodle.          These Tofu noodles are excellent!!  I purchased them and have used them with tomato sauce, Asian dressing in a cold noodle salad, and also in a fritata with eggs and sauteed veggies.          Just rinse under cold water for 2 3 minutes, then microwave for 2 minutes, pat dry and go for it.          Amazing!
