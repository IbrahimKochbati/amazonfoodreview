Wonderful product! I began to use it for my daughter who was about to turn a year old. She took it with no problems! It was recommended by a friend who also used it when she too had to stop  eastfeeding. Much better for a child in my eyes. I had tried a formula sample I had received in the mail  it left a greasy film in the bottle... gross. This does not! My daughter will drink it warm or cold  so easy for on the go as well. The canned was a bit harsh and she wasn't into it.. it tastes like a goat smells  this just has a suttle hint of goat. LoL
