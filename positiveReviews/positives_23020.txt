I love my coffee and have tried all the name  ands as well as some generic.  I always come back to Folgers Classic Roast.  It is the perfect medium blend and the taste is rich, suberb and totally satisfying.  Great for the morning pick me up or any other time of day.  But coffee is getting expensive.  The large containers of all  ands used to come in 39 oz sizes.  Then they went down to 33 ounces for the same price.  Now many are going down to this new 22 ounce size.  I am amazed in the stores at the high price of coffee now.  This Folgers coffee here on Amazon is an amazing deal for price and quality of coffee when you use subscribe and save.  You get three canisters, a total of 66 ounces, for $19.49.  It comes out even cheaper to what two 33 ounce used to cost in the store.  And my local store just had this 22 ounce size on sale for $8.99. For 3 that's $8 more than this great Amazon deal.          This review is definitely about the superb Folgers coffee though.  I must add that I also find the 22 ounce size very user friendly for the coffee stays fresh longer due to the smaller size.  Same amount of coffee in 3 canisters rather than 2 for the same price.  But as always there are some sellers on here trying to rip the buyer off when Amazon is out of stock.  No coffee is worth the ridiculous prices some will charge.  $47 for this?  Be real.  Just be certain to purchase it from the ever reliable Amazon themselves and you will be getting the best coffee out there at an unbeatable price.  Love Folgers and Amazon.
