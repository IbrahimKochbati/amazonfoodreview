I'm not quite ready to fully switch my dog to this, but at this price you really need to give it a try. Our regular feed is Halo which costs around $3 per pound. It's totally worth the price if your dog has digestive issues or allergies, but sometimes I just can't budget a new bag. I use this in a mix with Halo and so far we haven't seen any sign of allergies (which is why we changed to Halo in the first place). If you feed your pets the store  and or mass market crud you're missing out on a crucial, easy way to maintain a healthy pet.
