We have tried other natural dog foods, but they all had grain fillers in them and while our dog liked some of them she never reacted the way she does with this natural no grain dog food.  She can hardly wait at feeding time and she gobbles it down and licks the bowl clean.  She seems to be more energetic since eating Canidae no grain.  I doubt that we will ever change.
