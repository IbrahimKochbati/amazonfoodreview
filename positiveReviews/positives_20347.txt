I am picky about what I feed my daughter. Her health is in my hands and I intend on caring for it to the best of my ability. This is an amazing product. Probiotics are essential for human beings and babies are not an exception to that fact. We have the multigrain and oatmeal variety of this product. My daughter loves to eat both. I believe  eakfast is one of her favorite meals of the day and it because she loves this product so much.
