My dogs absolutely love these, and they do keep the teeth clean. Just do not give to dog unsupervised.     Our previous dog, a 60 lbs aussie would eat it down to the last inch, then would try to swallow that last bit whole.  I needed to keep an eye on her and take it away before she finished it off.  There is just no way for a dog to "hold and chew" when it gets down to such a small size.  Of course I always felt terrible taking it away from her, but I certainly did not want her to choke.     Just pay close attention to your dog!
