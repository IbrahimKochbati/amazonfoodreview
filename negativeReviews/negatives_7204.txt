I have two Australian Shepherds and they love this product.  I put one in each treat ball and then fill with the small treats.  They get the treats out quickly and then start on the everlasting treat.  If by "everlasting" they mean one day, then ok.  They are agressive chewers, but I was hoping that these treats would last at least a week.  They do love the flavors and there is peace a quiet (except for the loud chewing)for one evening, anyway.  We also end up wasting the last bit of the treat as it is under the lip of the ball and they cannot get at it.  All in all, I will continue to buy this product as a special treat for them from Amazon as the cost is less than at PetSmart.
