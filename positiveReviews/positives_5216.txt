I loved it! Good taste, pleasant carbonation, fun can.          Ok, so all it is is carbonated fruit juice.... big deal, right?  But it actually is a big deal if you are a soda junky and want to cut down on the negative effects without losing all the experience.  I hate diet soda because it just doesn't taste right and has way too many synthetic chemicals in it. However, this drink has no sugar, corn syrup, or preservatives. I suppose the CO2 may not be the best for you, but you gotta live a little.
