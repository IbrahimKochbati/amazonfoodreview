These days it is not easy to find US made dog natural treat with relatively low price, and having treated my 3 year old Westie long time with Healthy Partner beef turkey strips, I gave Zuke's a try; yet as soon as I opened the bag, I knew that my dog would not like it; it dosen't look good or smell good and I don't even like to taste it, how my dog would like it ?
