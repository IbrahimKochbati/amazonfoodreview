Pamela's  ead mix is a wonderful product. Honestly, just eating a plain slice reminds me of Cake... It works extremely well in my  ead maker.  I was using Udi's GF  ead product at $6.00 per 12oz loaf. Pamela's gives me a 2 pound loaf for approx. $5.00. That's 1.25 pounds more  ead for a dollar less than the cardboard tasting Udi's multi grain product. I might add that it also comes with one packet of yeast included in each package, so you have everything you need to make some great  ead. I think this could be the beginnings of a beautiful friendship...
