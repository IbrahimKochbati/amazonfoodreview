Baronet Coffee Decaf 100% Columbian Medium Roast Pods did not disappoint. They fit very nicely in either a one cup or two cup Senseo coffee maker. They  ew a medium to light coffee flavor. In order to enhance the fullness of the flavor, combine it in a two cup Senseo coffee maker with a stronger regular Baronet Coffee Pod that is packaged in a pouch rather than those that are individually packaged in a box. The individually packaged Baronet coffee pods are too full for the Senseo coffee maker.
