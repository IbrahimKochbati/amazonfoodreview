This is my very favorite blend of coffee in the Keurig k cups form.  It is rich and dark and is still that way when you make a large mug of coffee...some of the k cups are weaker as you make a bigger cup.  I love that it's Fair Trade and an Organic Blend makes it all the better.  I wish that I could find it in a decaf version that was larger than a 12 pack.
