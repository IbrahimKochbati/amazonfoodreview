We have used Purina Cat Food for our cats for decades with complete satisfaction. I'm truly amazed and puzzled by the bad results some of the other reviewers have been experiencing.          We shifted to the indoor formula several months ago because we do not let our cat outside. We had been giving her the regular Cat Chow but she seemed disposed toward eating the living plants we had in the house so we hoped the indoor formula would help relieve this tendency on her part.          Since we shifted over she has seemed to enjoy her food and has exhibited no adverse effects that we have observed; again I am really puzzled by the results some of the other reviewers have gotten. We still keep a little Cat Chow around and will give her some for variety's sake.          To complete an earlier thought on eating plants, the indoor formula didn't seem to make a difference so we've moved the living plants outside.          If anything changes I'll update this review and in the meantime I wish the best for the cats with the problems!
