This is the first and only meal replacement that I have ever tried but I have read and heard about how the taste of some are just awful. With that being said I consider myself lucky. Simply because the Naturade barvarian chocolate and strawberry flavors are really pretty good.          I usually mix with either lactaid milk (2%)or rice milk (vanilla flavored)and I have tried water. I shake mine, does a very good job (IMHO) but you have to really shake things up. Works better than a blender, I think.          Using lactaid (10 oz) the drink is kind of thick if you use the two scoops recommended which I do,  my wife uses one scoop in 8 oz. Using water or rice milk both have the same consistancy which is much thinner with a loss of some flavor. I prefer the lactaid milk...          The powder is very fine and can be packed like moist chalk dust. With that being said packing the scoop makes mixing more difficult, which I believe maybe the source of the lumps.          I drink one 10 oz cup in the morning with my vitamins and another after work then a have a smaller helping for dinner. When I first started I would have all kinds of cravings so I started eating more fruit during the day so from that perspective I do eat more little meals through out the day, but I have lost 6 lbs in a month without any excercise.          I would strongly recommend at least giving Naturade a try...
