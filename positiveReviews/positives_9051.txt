I just got a Keurig for my mom who is 82 and disabled. It is so much easier now for her to get her cup of coffee and tea. I read over many reviews to decide whether to buy the carousel or this storage drawer. I finally decided on this for the space saving design. It was the right choice. It is sturdy, durable and somewhat attractive. It slides out smooth and quiet, and holds a nice amount of cups. It pulls out far enough so you can see the cups far in the back of the drawer. I am hoping that they will make one that has 2 drawers, one on top of the other, so I could store more cups at a time. This isn't beautiful if your looking at the aesthetic value of it, but works for what it is intended for.
