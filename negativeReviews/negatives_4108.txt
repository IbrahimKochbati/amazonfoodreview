After reading the positive reviews I thought I'd give this product a try. I do not know how anyone can say this tastes like sugar. This stuff is awful, the after taste was agonizing. I could smell the difference in the coffee let alone taste it. I am so glad I do not have to use this in place of sugar I was just trying to cut some calories. I am so glad I have alternatives to choose from. It's Splenda for me. The site would not allow me to place the review without giving the product a star but it is a zero in my book.
