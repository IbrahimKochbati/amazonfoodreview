I was pleasantly surprised when I tried these crackers   I am always a bit wary of trying GF products since so many have a strange taste and or texture. These, however, are delicious. They do remind me of Ritz crackers (at least what I remember from eating them 2 years ago) except not quite as oily.          Good:       They taste good and have a really nice texture.       I don't think they are exceptionally bland   they have a slight buttery flavor and seem like generic crackers to me. Definitely more flavor that water crackers       I don't taste the funny aftertaste that one of the reviewers mentions. Perhaps some people are more sensitive to that taste than I am.          Bad:       Cost       Broken crackers: I agree with other reviewers that the packages often contain a lot of  oken ones. This is not just when they are purchased online; it is also true of boxes that I've purchased at a store like Whole Foods. I guess these crackers are just fragile and need special packaging.          That combination of downsides makes it a tough choice for me about whether to buy these crackers. Do I really want to pay a lot (3 4x as much as "glutinized" crackers) for a box of  oken crackers? I haven't decided. For now, they are a splurge that I indulge in occasionally.
