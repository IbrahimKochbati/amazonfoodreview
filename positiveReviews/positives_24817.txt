We've been buying food on Amazon to test out that service. We bought this for trips in our RV. It allows us to store in non refrigerated places, and heats in the microwave in 30 40 seconds. Perfect when we don't want to cook on the stove.  Our kids our between 3 6... 2 out of 3 agree that it's a good product.  The other one?  Well, that's just how it works with multiple kids in one family. If we wanted 100%, we'd have had to have had only 1 child. At any rate, portion size seems good for our kids' ages. Only thing to watch, this things can literally hop in the microwave when cooking, so don't over cook.
