I have two Dogs, 12 and 1 yr old, medium size and a bit larger. both have strong health teeth, chewing bones like this for most of their lives. I was told by my Veterinarian one of the main reasons (besides no soft food) the have great oral hygiene. these natural bones are the right size and the dogs never leave them alone until they are gone or I take them away. Dont give these to them before bed time (crunch crunch crunch). I notice they develop a thirst after chewing for awhile. No digestion problems as a result of eating on these. a great bang for the buck as far as dog treats go. Strongly recommend for dogs that have good teeth.
