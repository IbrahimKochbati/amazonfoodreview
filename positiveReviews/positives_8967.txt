Both previous reviewers rated this very low b c they claim these drag&eacute;es cause cancer... not true. They may be referring to the SILVER or GOLD drag&eacute;es that are not longer available in CA b c the FDA ruled that b c there is trace amount of metal, they must state it's for decoration only, though people have been eating these for centuries... you get more metal in tap water and cooking in pans than from the few cookies you eat decorated with these during occassional cele ations. (BTW, the CA law can be traced to one lawyer who made this his sole platform... google it.)     These PEARL drag&eacute;es are perfectly safe and do not fall under the same FDA restrictions and are still available in most baking supply shops (who've pulled the metallic ones off their shelves just avoid legal trouble.) While those who are looking for this product will probably already know this, those who are exploring new ideas for decorating will benefit from learning the truth. (The only reason I don't rate this higher is b c of shipping rates.) Happy Baking!
