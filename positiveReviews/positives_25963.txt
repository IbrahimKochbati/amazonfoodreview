I first tried this at Walmart and I believe they have them at Trader Joe's as well as at Walgreen's.     It's a healthier alternative to eating potato chips  although they are quite addicting and the temptations to down the whole bag is great...          It's a good snack if you like the cheddar popcorn or just have a craving for a salty snack.
