I have had real truffles only once that I can recall, and that very old memory is of a sublime taste.  The slippery terminology used for 'truffle' oil gave me pause, but I decided to take a chance.  To me, "infused" implies that something has been marinated in a liquid, not that a chemical has been simply mixed in.  Sure enough, the ingredient list on the bottle is limited to olive oil and truffle "aroma."          When I opened the bottle, I could only detect a garlic like aroma, pleasant but not sublime.  I first tried adding 1 4 teaspoon to a small serving of scrambled eggs, and could detect nothing.  Today I made a 'two egg' (1 2 cup of eggbeaters) omelet flavored with tarragon and filled with simple sauteed potatos, scallions, and mushrooms.  I drizzled on a full teaspoon of the 'truffle oil' after the omelet was set, immediately before filling and folding it.          Again, I could discern no flavor or aroma other than the above ingredients.  I rated this at 2 stars rather than one on the charitable assumption that a younger nose might detect some sort of aroma.
