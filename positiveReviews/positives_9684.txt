Our Minneapolis Indian shops stopped selling Darjeeling tea over a year ago. I love this tea as it tastes like the stuff I grew up drinking in England, altho I drink this black, no sugar.          A year ago, I bought a couple of pounds online for $15 pound including shipping. I have done a lot of searching to find out why Darjeeling has seemingly disappeared. The Indian grocers are mystified, and online there is no clue. Apparently, green label Darjeeling is Lipton's most popular tea. Hard to believe if people can't actually purchase it. The name changed from Lipton Green Label to Lipton Finest Darjeeling.          iShopIndian has 250g for $6.99 but have a flat shipping fee of $10, so one would want to buy several boxes. I have not bought through this vendor, but I plan to.          I have a friend visiting India and hope she will find room in her suitcase to  ing me back a pound (or 3). I plan to ask if there is a shortage in India.     Good luck finding this tea at an affordable price!
