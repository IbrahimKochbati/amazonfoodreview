For those who remember cracking almond shells, this tastes the same.  Love that there is no salt added and perfect protein, natural snack  between meals or as a meal for people like me who always forget to eat. I've got them strategically placed to make sure something gets in during the day when I'm studying or writing.  If you prefer Blue Diamond dry roasted excessively salted almonds you probably won't like these.  I like both, just don't use salt except in baking.
