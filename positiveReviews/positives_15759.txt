Opening both the Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;e and the Chicken Pot Pie, there is not a lot of aroma, it looks like chicken soup with carrots and it is  othy and wet.     Having so slight an aroma, I thought my cat may not like it, but she does like both flavors.     Small in size like Fancy Feast, one can isn't a meal. My cat eats dry food and this is a treat for her.     It is expensive though. It seems like a very high quality food for cats.     I would recommend this to someone whose cat is very fussy.
