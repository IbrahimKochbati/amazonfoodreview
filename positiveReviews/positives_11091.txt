This tea seemed to really help my stomach issues.  I have fi omyalgia and I started to have symptoms of IBS just recently.  I also had terrible acid reflux.  I do not know how much this tea helped the acid reflux.  It does seem greatly reduced.  The IBS symptoms are gone completely.  It could all be a coincidence, but I'd like to thik that this tea had something to do with it.
