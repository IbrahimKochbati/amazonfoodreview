This is a dark, smooth  ew (darker than Timothy's French Vanilla), But as with Timothy's it has only a slight hint of vanilla. This is my third "taste test" searching for the best vanilla flavored coffee.  Gloria Jean's was undrinkable.  Timothy's was pleasant but not as deep a roast as this. If it only had more vanilla flavor this would be my hands down favorite.
