Annie Chun's Vietnamese Pho Soup is delicious and convenient! Since the noodles are fresh,they're a great deal less salty than Ramen. Unlike some instant Asian meals,they're made here in the US  in San Rafael,no less. The pho soup has a fresh,gardenlike flavor. Indeed,it's fresher than the pad Thai. It has a slightly citrusy flavor. Add some vegetables,tofu,and a dab of hot sauce to it  and it's perfect! It's like going to Indochina without paying the air fare. Serve some up!
