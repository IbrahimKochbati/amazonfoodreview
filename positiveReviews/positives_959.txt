The normal 15oz can is too much SPAM for one person.  The 7oz version is perfect for me to make two sandwiches.  I cut the block in half.  Each half I cut into 4 slices.  The 4 slices are perfect to lay on top of a toast.  With some salad green and 2nd toast, it becomes a quick and filling lunch sandwich when I hike or backpack (need sodium to replace electrolyte).  The 2nd half will become my 2nd sandwich if I do overnight backpacking (for dinner).
