My dog is allergic to most dog food.  I have used Newman's Own  dog food  for several years now and I am quite happy with it.  I live in a small town that is 60 miles away from the nearest big city and I am unable to obtain the dog food locally.  It is a real convenience for me to buy this from Amazon and the price is equitable.
