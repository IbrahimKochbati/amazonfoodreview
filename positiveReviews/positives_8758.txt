I don't know if they use less salt or not, but all I can say is these olives were a pleasant surprise the first time I bought them in a store.  They have a wonderful buttery ripe olive flavor and don't seem quite as salty as most olives do.  I wish these were easier to find at the grocery store, or that Amazon would carry this as a subscribe & save item so the shipping wouldn't be so high!  I can't imagine paying twice as much for shipping as the cost for one can of olives!  They don't weight that much!
