These were a great price that's why I gobbled some up [lemon, toffee, chocolate & strawberry].  I've tried the lemon in some of the WuLong tea [ick..guess I should try a better tasting tea?] noticed the after taste, as usual.  I've also tried the strawberry in some carbonated water [suggestion from the 101 Recipes for the HCG protocol] and that's not too bad.  Definitely something you gotta get use to...because of the after taste. [I know this product and other Stevia products are natural so this taste doesn't mentally affect me as does the Aspartame, Splenda and other man made sweeteners   those are just plain bad for us but the after taste of these Stevita products remind me of those man made sweeteners   ICK].  I've actually had a little better luck with the Nu Stevia powder, as long as I am careful on the amount [for example I use it in my smoothies, i.e. 1 packet for a 16 20oz smoothie].  So the '3' rating is for the taste...and after taste.  : (
