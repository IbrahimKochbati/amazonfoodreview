I have tried Lavazza's Crema y Aroma, and their Gold whatever and I like this (Tierra) the best so far.  Taste is subjective so I am not going to go into any flowery details.  The coffee just seems to have the taste that I remember when in Italy   no bitterness, smooth and just, well, tasty!  When I bought this, I also picked up a can of Illy on an impulse and, honestly, while the Illy was a "bit" better, it was no where worth the price difference.
