ThinkThin are the best tasting of the low carb and gluten free protein bars, in my opinion. They are now available at many more stores than when I ordered a box from Amazon awhile ago. And they are much cheaper at every store I've been to than the online price. At even Whole Foods, I typically pay $1.69 per bar, and get a slight discount for buying an entire box. Once you add shipping to Amazon's prices, they are more expensive online. Also, keep in mind the season when ordering them. All of the coatings had melted and were stuck to the packaging, then fell off in pieces when opened, due to having melted during shipment. But if you can get them locally, give them a try. There are many flavors to choose from, though most stores seem to only carry a few.          Those people who claim they are awful tasting probably haven't tried other protein bars that are low carb and gluten free, and expect them to taste like candy bars or high sugar bars that may be more tasty, but are also full of ingredients that render them nutritionally useless.
