Close your eyes and the entire room smells like a gin and tonic!  Obviously, I like gin and tonic so that's my issue but the oil of bergamot in this  ews pungency might be a bit much for some. It certainly will keep the insects away too.          But I like fragrant teas so I recommend this as an exhilarating Earl Grey as     the black tea base is superb as well.
