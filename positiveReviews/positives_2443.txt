Crisp crunchy and thin  very low in sodium. I usually prefer mine plain but shared a package with a friend who enjoyed these with a tuna salad topping. A great alternative to the expensive styrofoam varieties sold at most stores. Excellent product. The rice cakes for this  and are also wonderful and for those on a no salt diet, 0% sodium.
