I went to graduate school in Buffalo, and spent quite a bit of time at the Anchor Bar. On weekends, there was live jazz. Good food. But it was the chicken wings that made visits there special. Once, several of us scored tickets for a Buffalo Sa es' hockey match at the Aud. Before going there, we had dinner at the Anchor Bar. Unhappily, the first one to order requested hot wings. Filled with testosterone, the rest of us simply had to go along. Result? Lots of sweat, a deep burning sensation, red faces. . . . It was a fine adventure  but not necessarily enjoyable! Man, it was raw fire! The medium wings there  ing heat  but at a tolerable level.          This product represents the Anchor Bar's own recipe. But it is pretty clear to me that it is tamped down a bit, and not as spicy as the actual "medium" wings that you would get if you ate at the Anchor Bar itself. My son and I just tried this wing sauce and ended up adding some Texas hot sauce to ramp up the heat. Perhaps the "hot" version that one can purchase also would be more like the "real" medium sauce at the Bar. That will be our next experiment.          Still and all, this is a tasty sauce for chicken wings and I would be happy to recommend it for others. It tastes better than the sauce I made just a couple weeks ago, before I discovered that one could buy it online. However, if you want the fire, maybe have a little Texas hot sauce to spice it up a bit.
