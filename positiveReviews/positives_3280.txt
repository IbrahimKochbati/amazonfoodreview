Our family has been wheat free for 3 years and gluten free for 1 1 2 so we've tried just about every mix out there.  I just found that Bisquick has a GF mix while in the grocery store and decided to give it a try.  This is DEFINITELY the best mix that we have ever tasted: smooth, not grainy.  I don't know that side by side with regular wheat pancakes that you would notice the difference!
