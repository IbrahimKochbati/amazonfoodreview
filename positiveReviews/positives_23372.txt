I picked up one of these bars at a bodega on a day when I didn't have time to get  eakfast, and I was instantly hooked. I haven't tried any of the other flavors, but the white chocolate chip bar is delicious. The only problem I have with the 10 pack packaging is convincing myself I shouldn't eat all of them in one sitting. (One bar really does leave you feeling satisfied, though.)
