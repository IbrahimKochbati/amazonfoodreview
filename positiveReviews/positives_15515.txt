It definitely depends on which area you get it from. I just received my 4 year old Juniper Bonsai from Florida and its amazing!! Better than the picture, lush and healthy! Its windswept at a super dramatic angle and is at least a foot tall. It came carefully packaged and looked healthy right out of the box! It even came in a awesome oriental ceramic dish with tan pebbles on the soil. There was even a card attached so I can contact the owner (Lou Rindner) with any questions! The website he left me was [...].          I purchased a bonsai from this exact seller that came from California last year, it was basically a short bushy twig and died after 3 months of me intensely taking care of it and trying to revive it.          If your going to get a Bonsai from this seller, make sure it comes from Florida, or anywhere but California!!
