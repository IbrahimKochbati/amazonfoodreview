Started buying these for my dog and he loves them. They are easy on his teeth (not too hard, etc) and my vet complimented that his teeth are in good condition. Your dog may need teeth cleaning once in awhile (it's not a substitute) but it mitigates the tartar buildup effectively when given daily. Will buy over and over again.
