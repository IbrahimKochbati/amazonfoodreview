My dogs love them. They swallow them before realizing a pill is in them. The only bad thing is that they crumble easily, but they can be squeezed back together.  I used to use cheese, but the dogs figured out pills were hidden in them, they got where they wouldn't take it anymore. With these, they just take it immediately, pill & all.
