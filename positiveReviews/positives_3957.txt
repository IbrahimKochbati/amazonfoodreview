If you want a quick pick me up in a small package, each one individually wrapped this is my choice! I have one in the car mid compartment, and in my  iefcase they would be great and a pre aerobic workout snack. Great flavor, moist & not too sweet. Beware if you are allergic to nuts these are out. I took them out of the box and divided into zip lock bags and froze. When I needed more I just pulled one bag from the freezer and it worked out great.
