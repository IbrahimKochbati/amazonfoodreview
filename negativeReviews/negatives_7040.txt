I just received 3 Boxes of Kellogs Rasin Bran as a Subscribe and Save purchase.  I like to check the "Use By Date" at the stores because it may sit awhile in our pantry before we use it.  I bought Kellogs Rasin Bran at Sam's Club last week, and it has a date for June 2013.  The boxes I just got from Amazon are dated for Fe uary 2013, so I will have to use them up first.  It is mid Sept 2012 now, so there is still time to use the 3 boxes.  But dissapointed that they are closer dated than at the stores here. Also, the Box from Sam's shows Battle Creek, Michigan   and these from Amazon show being from Mexico. Based on this and other reviews here mentioning Kellog's ingredients being altered, I think I will change to another  and and cancel my Subscribe and Save.
