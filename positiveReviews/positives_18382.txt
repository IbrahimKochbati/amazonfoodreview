Hey!!  these things taste good. At first I thought they would be like Pringles," which I don't care for " but they are not. Hard to explain since I don't know what to compare them too. I guess I would call them light and fluffy and yet nice and crisp with a great natural flavor.           These have taken some of the guilt out of eating this type of snack for me. I love potato chips but they are loaded with lots of unhealthy things. I'm not saying these are healthy, just a lot less unhealthy than chips.           For starters these are all natural with very little fat and fairly low in carbs for a food of this type. My sugar is high but I feel comfortable eating these in moderation since the carbs are lower than chips.            I originally bought the variety pack so I could try them all, and I liked them all although somewhat partial to the Cheddar. It's just a matter of what mood I am in as to which one I'll choose.      Unfortunately they are a bit pricy if you don't get them on sale. I just wish these came in a larger bag as opposed to the individual servings which are always more expensive.           Everyone has a different idea of good, so this is something you are going to have to try for yourself to decide.
