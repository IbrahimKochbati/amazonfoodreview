I hope that this is really as nutritious as the claims.  I chew on this like the Romans and Greeks and it gets stuck on my molars.          These seeds were easier going down when sprinkled on top of crab and egg fried rice.  Go figure.          I incorporated a 1.5 cup into the regular white loaf recipe from The Breadbaker's Apprentice and found that the addition meant more warm water was needed to hydrate the dough and I did not get much of a rise, so I baked the loaf with tin foil over the loaf pan and the  ead rose to its usual height.  Since white  ead is not that healthy, I will include flax seed ground in my food processor to ameliorate the ill effects.
