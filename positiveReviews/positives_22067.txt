I recently bought some trail mix that had some wasabi peas in it and they were the first thing that was picked out of the mix. I soon ordered this bag after seeing the positive reviews and great price. I received a single large sealed plastic bag full of strong wasabi peas. Very satisfied, and when I run out (it will probably be a while, as you can't eat them too fast.) I will probably be reordering. Thanks!
