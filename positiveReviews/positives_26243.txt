fYI: entire package   about 1 cup of stew.  Not that much! Would definitely need rice nan plus a side dish (salad?) to make this a meal for two.          As another reviewer noted, the stew was not overflowing with cheese and cashews as image depicts but they were still there (maybe 5 10 in a package).  We added our own peanuts and cashews which was great.          Aside from those small quantity issues, we just loved it.  My mom got this, and I grabbed some cause it sounded easy to make and it really was.  5 minutes max!  Smelled and tasted awesome and was perfect over rice.
