in truth, this is the only kind i have ever purchased, so i can't make a fair comparison.          what i CAN say, however, is that even if you go to the manufacturer's website, this deal they have on amazon is a better deal pricewise PLUS it comes in the cans instead of the bags.  PLUS each can comes with a scoop, so there is no need to measure anymore.          and lastly, there is the inclusion of the HOT CHAI LATTE Famous Barista Recipe.  now in all truth, i have always said i was making myself a chai latte, when i wasn't.  the barista recipe is the latte in that it adds the milk, which i never did.          so that's my take on this.  i hope it helps you in your decision making.
