I loved this product and participated in the subscription service. However, my last shipment came in a newly designed box and the formula of the coconut guava mixture had changed.  There is more guava juice now, which I find overwhelming.  The sugar content has also increased.  I've had to purchase plain coconut water to mix with my last order to tone down the guava flavor.  I am not a fan of the change and plan to cancel my monthly subscription.  Beware if you were a fan of the old true splash of guava formula.
