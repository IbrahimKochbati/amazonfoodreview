We were looking for a good quality tea biscuit and searched Amazon for some with favorable reviews. These seemed to fit the bill so we ordered some. They are simply a perfect biscuit. They are tender and flaky and absorb tea without falling apart (as long as you dunk them quickly). I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a delicious biscuit.
