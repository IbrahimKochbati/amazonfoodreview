I thought I was purchasing a high quality item but it's not all that. The chocolate is very sweet and as you chew on this product you can tell the chocolate is loaded with sugar by the crunchy texture. I'm going to say it's not worth the money and I'm not satisfied.     At the same time of purchasing this product I also bought Sunmaid chocolate covered raisons which I rate from a 1 10...a 10. Now we are talking about yumminess!!!!!     So customers...if you are going to choose...let it be the Sunmaid...you won't be dissappointed
