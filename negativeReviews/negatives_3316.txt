We have three large dogs   two malamutes and a husky mix. I'd read a few of the reviews on here that said that these treats were only good for large dogs, so I figured they'd be perfect for my three chow hounds. Unfortunately these are much smaller than I thought they were. Two, three bites tops and my dogs would have them down, and they didn't seem to like them as much as they like their regular bones (cheap, regular bones). So, nope, I don't think that these are that great, and apparently neither did my dogs.
