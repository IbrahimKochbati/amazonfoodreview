I love Kristian Regale Black Currant sparkling drink  so thought I'd try the peach.  I never know if I'm going to get a syrupy sweet flavor when I get peach flavored items, but this was really good  somewhat tart, and tastes like fresh peaches.  The bubbles are tiny  so not like regular sodas, but a 'grown up' sparkling beverage.  I will order this again, and would have no trouble giving this as a gift  if I didn't drink it all first !!  I hope Amazon gets the pear flavored (not the listing for 50+ bucks, either.  I'm sure that would be good as well... but the peach and black currant are definite winners !!
