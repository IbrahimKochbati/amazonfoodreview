This is now my favorite herb tea  full bodied and extraordinarily flavorful, it doesn't have the "weakly flavored hot water" taste of many herbal teas. I keep trying to find another plum tea that I can get locally but to no avail; they are all just pale by comparison. I'll have to keep ordering it online!
