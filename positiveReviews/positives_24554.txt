Our dog LOVES this! we buy the pumpkin or the butternut squash on a regular basis.  Our dog can't get enough. It's organic, which makes me feel better about what she eats and its high in fiber . . . which makes her BM's extremely well formed and regular.  treats diarrhea, constipation and its healthy.  a staple in her diet.
