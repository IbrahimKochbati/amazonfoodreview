This may sound rediculous, but I actually ordered the wrong  and of potato chips when I ordered these Kettle  and jalapeno chips.  At the time I placed my order, I couldn't remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked, and the Kettle  and chips were packaged in a similarly colored bag.  But, it all worked out for the best because I do really like the Kettle  and of jalapeno chips, and will happily munch away on them during upcoming TV football games.  When I run out (probably sometime next year!), I will likey purchase Miss Vicky  and of jalapeno chips, and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettle  and chips.  Imho, Kettle  and chips are excellent and I recommend them to all potato chip 'affection ados'.          Sincerely,            ยง homiedog ยง
