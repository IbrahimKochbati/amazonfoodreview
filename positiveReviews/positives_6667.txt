Recently purchased a case of Mori Nu from Amazon ... I'd had this tofu before and the product I got from Amazon is fine. Though, a word of caution   my case only has about 4 1 2 months to go on its "best by" date. The date on the box represents one year from manufacture, so this product had been sitting around a while. Not a huge problem but I'll be looking for silken tofu recipes now (vegan ice cream!), to use this up, rather than just having silken tofu on hand for a while, as I'd hoped.
