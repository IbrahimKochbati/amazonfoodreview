We got this coffee for my wife, who is nearing the end of her pregnancy and is slowly starting to resume coffee drinking. As someone who will be giving birth in a month, she was starting to experience minor heartburn.          As far as the heartburn goes, this coffee made no difference in the positive or negative directions. So we're just rating it as coffee, not as a lower acid alternative. As coffee, it was pretty average, with a mild, wimpy sort of taste. It wasn't unpalatable by any means, it was just sort of ho hum.          This might be worth a try if you have serious issues with reflux or acid in your diet. But it's a pretty bland cup of coffee, all told.
