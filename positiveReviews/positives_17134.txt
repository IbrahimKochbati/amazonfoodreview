From the Gerber website:     BPA is not used in making the plastic cups for GERBERÂ® pureed baby food products. It is important to note that even products with the number 7 plastic are not made with BPA, (the number 7 refers to recycling information, not the presence of BPA).          We have confirmed with Gerber that their organic baby food containers are a mix of plastic types numbers 1 and 2 and because they are a mix, they are not recyclable under either such category and are given a number 7 code for recycling. See the ZReport on BPA for more information.
