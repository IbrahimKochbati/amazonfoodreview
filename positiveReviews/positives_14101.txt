I go along with a number of reviewers that this isn't a very strong tea.  It has a nice mild malty taste that holds up to milk and sugar but if you try to get it to a strong malty taste it gets bitter.  But the price is good, it comes with rapid Amazon shipping, and it is better than anything from the grocery store.  And it is organic.  So, overall, I'm good with it.  For a bit more though you can get a stronger malty organic tea from one of the other on line bulk tea stores.
