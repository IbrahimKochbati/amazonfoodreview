Twinings is a great tea maker. And their Earl Grey is the best IMHO. I love to save money, especially when buying K cups. You can buy a 25 pack for $9.99 at the Twinings USA website. Buying 2 packs plus shipping is still less than the $30 advertised here.(depending on where you live). So if your a fan, buy from the source. Happy Hunting! And also a place called [...] has good prices too. I don't represent any of these websites, I am giving back to consumers, because we sometimes pay too darn much for things. Pay it Forward and share good value! Smiles...
