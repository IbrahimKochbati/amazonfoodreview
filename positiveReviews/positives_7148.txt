I was intrigued how this particular blend got such an exotic name, and I wasn't disappointed.  There is an ever so slight coconut aftertaste that makes this so delicious,  I don't like strong coffee, and this is perfect for my husband and I.  I get it send regularly now and it's one of our favorites!  Second only to Jamaica Me Crazy by Wolfgang Puck.  Wolfgang is much tastier than the other  ands.
