The K cup for Keurig Brewers is perfect for our home, as I am usually the only hot beverage consumer.  I had such good luck with the coffee I didn't want to jinx my tea.  I finally made the purchase for the product via Amazon; not only did it arrive swiftly, it tasted great!  Perfecto!  The right amount of tea delivered in a nice hot cup every time.  Cost?  We figured the machine and K cup paid for themselves already.  The energy it took to boil the water, cost more.  Don't misunderstand, the ritual of making a good fresh pot of tea is still so pleasing, but when you want one cup this is the way to go!   "
