I read the reviews of this dog food and everyone said their picky eating dog loved it. I have a miniature schnauzer who is 10 months old and he is a very picky eater! He was eating Nutro Max Lamb & Rice for puppies but started to show a little dis interest in his food. I wanted to try something new and I chose this product. He did not like this food at all! I wouldn't buy it again, personally. The ingredients are good but my dog just didn't like it.
