1.  Walnuts are the most unstable of all nuts.  While most nuts have a shelf life of a few months, walnuts go rancid within just a few weeks of being exposed to air and average 65 75 degree temp.  So if you buy 6 canisters of these and eat an ounce a day to help your cholesterol levels, they'll last you about 7 8 weeks. Which is the longest you should expect them to stay fresh.  If you want them to last longer    freeze them in the unopened containers for up to 4 months.  And I'm guessing that jars or bags of walnuts are just wasted if sent through USPS military mail channels to soldiers in Asia.  It's too hot and too long a trip.          2.  If this product    or any other for that matter    arrives stale, then why aren't you calling Amazon or the supplier to return them and get your money back!  This is one of the reasons I try to buy items from Amazon that say they are sold and shipped by Amazon   because Amazon stands behind what they sell and I've never had a problem with getting  a replacement if something arrives in unsatisfactory condition.  To all those reviewers whining about stale products    grow a pair, pick up the phone, and stand up for yourselves.          3.  Read the reviews, and if you don't want seasoned nuts, don't buy these.  Not only are they seasoned, they also have a little sugar.  Not enough to raise the calories beyond those of raw walnuts, but it is a different nut than a fresh cracked walnut.     IF YOU WANT RAW WALNUTS, BUY WALNUTS IN THE SHELL.          I agree that for internet buying purposes, the manufacturer should INSIST all the contents  be listed on every site, and should rename the product: SEASONED DRY ROASTED WALNUTS.          The bottom line is, they have an excellent mild seasoned flavor, and a very DRY dry roasted texture.
