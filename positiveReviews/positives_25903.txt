I have been buying this for at least two years now.  It makes great peanut butter and jelly sandwiches that are figure friendly.  My daughter has used it in smoothies and likes it too.  I must say though the price on Amazon is higher than buying it directly from Bell Plantation.  I will probably purchase it next time from them.
