My 20 month old Toy Fox Terrier mix has been eating Canidae since I adopted her and changed her over from Science Diet, so I don't have an amazing transformation story.          However,     1. She's only been sick twice to speak of. No unexpected need to go outside NOW or accidents in the house because of illness. What comes out of her is as predictable as the sunrise, albeit somewhat less pleasant overall.          2. This 12 pound, high energy dog eats just under 1 cup a day. A 40 pound bag lasts me about 6 MONTHS, which calculates as less than $7 month for food. Canidae may cost more than better known  ands, but it's a bargain for the improved nutrition and related benefits (see 1 and 3).          3. It never occurred to me that it could be because of her food, but it's true she has basically no smell, as others have mentioned. She's in every way glossy, happy, clean, and puppy like.
