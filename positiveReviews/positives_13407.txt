When I first got my K cup machine a couple years ago I ordered virtually every coffee tea cup  and except for the inane.  The Newman extra bold is the best "every day" coffee IMO.  There are others of course!  So order the Newman extra bold,  the Emeril big easy bold, and the sleepy time tea and you have the bases covered.  At least for my family, yer mileage will surely vary.
