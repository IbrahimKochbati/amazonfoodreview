My pediatrician sent me on an online hunt for immune boosters for my son's diet when he contracted mono at age six  specifically for this product among a few others.  After ordering it and trying it out as chocolate milk, we found we actually preferred it as a "mix in" type of powder rather than stand alone chocolate milk.  It worked mixed with milk, but turns pretty greenish after a few minutes and that was a visual turn off for my six year old and for me to be honest.  Mixed in with pudding, yogurt, oatmeal (Mom was a huge hit the morning I had the chocolate oatmeal a ha moment) and to make chocolate peanut butter banana smoothies, it has become a daily staple in our home.  We also use the fruit flavored mixed with greek vanilla yogurt and smoothies  it tastes sweeter to me, and is the second favorite.  Just a heads up for Mom's who may not be aware of what these super concentrated dark veggies and berries will do upon exit...don't panic when you see the end result in the toilet as unusually dark.
