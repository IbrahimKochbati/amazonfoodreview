I like that this item has flax seed in it but the whole wheat flower makes it very grainy.  It is also very oily even after you cook it.  If you do not mind gritty  ownies then get this product.  Also, they are not very chocolately so I added chocolate chips to the recepie.  It makes it have more fat and calories but they taste better this way.
