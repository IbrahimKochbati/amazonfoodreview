Lets face it, $11 isn't going to get you the most succulent chocolate in the world.  But it does give you a GREAT everyday cocoa in a 6oz  ew. Great to mix with a coffee for an instant mocha, and no sugar needed!  Kids will LOVE it. VERY happy with this purchase.  Will keep this in my pantry always!
