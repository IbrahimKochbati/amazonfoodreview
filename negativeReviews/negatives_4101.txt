I decided to purchase this product based on a blog by one of the     supplement oriented doctors on the internet, hyping erythritol as     superior to xylitol, which I use regularly and find the closest     to sugar in taste with almost no aftertaste and no side effects     to my knowledge.  The problem I find with erythritol is its lack     of flavor.  On cereal, I barely notice any real sweetness, even     when I put as much as a tablespoon and a half on a normal size     bowl.  When I use Ideal, the name of the xylitol  and I use, it     has the same sweetness as sugar in the same proportion.  Don't get     me wrong, erythritol isn't unpleasant, it just has very little     sweetness relative to how much you use.  Not worth the price unless     you want just a hint of sweetness compared to what you get with     sugar or xylitol.
