My dogs love this item and the other Chunky Chews.  They chew on them forever!  It's like giving them the world when they see me pull them out of the box.  I have 4 dogs from medium size to extra large (120 lbs.) and they all love them.  They cannot chew these up in no time like they can other rawhide chews from other companies.  I definitely recommend buying any of the Chunky Chews!  They are also great because you don't have them swallowing pieces of rawhide and choking it back up   they actually have to chew on these to get anywhere!  Love them and will definitely buy them again!
