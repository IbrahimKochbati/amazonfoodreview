These dates were absolutely delicious. I was a little bit worried because the one product review that it had was only one star. But as I looked at all the other date reviews, the trend seemed to be bad reviews in the Fall timeframe. I had these delivered mid January and must say they were quite exquisite. Many thanks for a great treat at a large dinner party.
