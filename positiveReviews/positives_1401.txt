I love these chips. They are excellent! On the Weight Watchers plan they are only 2 points per bag which is GREAT for potatoe chips. LOVE the single serving bags for portion control. Also love Amazon.com for selling them. Can't find them in the stores. I will be ordering these forever. Great product.   "
