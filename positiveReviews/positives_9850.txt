My veterinary dermatologist recommended these for my 1 year old yellow lab as a crunchy replacement for rawhides while we try to figure out what he is allergic to.  He absolutely loves them!  A large piece only lasts for a few minutes for him, so they're not really a replacement for the rawhides, but at least it gives him something crunchy to chew on to clean his teeth and satisfy his need to chew.  The vet told me that they would stain my carpet, but they don't.  My only complaint is that they are a little expensive.
