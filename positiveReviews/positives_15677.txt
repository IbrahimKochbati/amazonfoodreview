All 6 of my cats delve into their dishes when I fill it with one of the selections from this multipak.  The handsdown favorite is the Tuna and Shrimp   I can barely get the food in the dish before it is inhaled.  They walk around licking their lips and looking for seconds! One cat, in particular, tends to be very picky about what she will eat   but no problem with any of the varieties.
