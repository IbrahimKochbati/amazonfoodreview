This Cheesecake is easy to make and easy to love!  I love to bake but don't always have the time to start a cheesecake from scratch when I need one.  It's easy to make this unique with adding swirled chocolate sauce or cherries to decorate...I like making the mini ones, people can pick one up and devour!
