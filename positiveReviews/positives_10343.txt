We bought this mix a while ago from the Sprout House, along with four other mixes from a different vendor. Now that we're finally running out, it's time to write a review.  This mix is wonderful (and the only one of the five we'll be buying again).  It's delicious, it sprouts really well, and it holds up well afterward (we always have multiple batches of different mixes at the same time, and these sprouts can last the longest).  And I had no idea that radish sprouts taste just as good as radishes.  I look forward to trying other mixes from the Sprout House.
