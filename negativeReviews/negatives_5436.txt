I have several health issues that prevent me from drinking coffee, and have really missed being able to start the day with a steaming hot cup of wonderful smelling coffee.  The slightly high price tag would have been worth it if this product had lived up to its hype.  I had hopes that this  and would be different, but it wasn't.          The morning after this arrived in the mail, I had a friend over for morning coffee and we both had a cup together.  I  ewed it using a drip method and we sat down to see if this really was better than the average coffee.  She thought it tasted very good, but I didn't think the taste was anything special.  Still, I hoped it would leave me feeling better than coffee usually does.          At first I was OK, but about an hour after drinking my coffee, the old, familiar burning sensation in my gut started.  Then, the inflammation in my joints and soft tissues.  This experiment had failed miserably and I had to endure an entire day regretting that I had tried this coffee.  At midnight, I was still feeling bad from a cup of coffee I had drunk at 8:00 am.          Just a side note about low acid coffee:  ANY coffee (no mater how cheap) can be made low acid by a cold  ewing method.  Just type "cold coffee  ewers" into Amazon's search engine and you will see all kinds of contraptions that will make low acid coffee.  It is the  ewing method that develops acid, and not the type or  and of coffee you use.  ALSO, there are health problems associated with coffee that have little to do with acid. If you have any kind of inflammation,  ewing low acid coffee will not help that because coffee is intrinsicly inflamatory.          I will not be using the rest of this.  It might be low acid, but it seems that any acid at all is too much for some people.  Coffee is just not worth the consequences for me.          UPDATE   October 2, 2011:  5 DAYS LATER, my joints still hurt from this experiment.  My daughter is a professional barrista, so I gave her a cup to try and asked for her "expert" opinion.  Her verdict was that it is poor quality coffee that is extremely bitter.  Not a very good reccommendation!
