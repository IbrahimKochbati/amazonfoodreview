I saw these at Publix for $3.99 a few weeks ago and decided to try them out, I like popcorn and seemed like a healthier alternative to chips.  The chips were good, tasted like popcorn and the white cheddar taste worked well with it. Since I liked them checked them out here on amazon, the price is 1 2 the price so it was a no  ainer picked up the twelve and have been snacking on them since.
