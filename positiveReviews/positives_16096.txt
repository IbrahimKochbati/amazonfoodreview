If, like my wife and I, you're blessed with soft tap water, and like a good robust "English Breakfast Tea", I've found that this blend (mostly dark assam) is a pretty decent choice, and a good value.  I believe it's packaged by the same company that makes "PG Tips" in the handy pyramid bags.  The quality is comparable.  I generally buy the  ooke bond loose for making everyday tea by the pot, and I buy pg tips pyramid bags for travelling.          Anyway, I buy the Brooke Bond loose on a regular basis   either online, or at a local indo pakistani grocer.  I've also bought the Taj Mahal label by the same company, but they appear to be interchangeable, and differ only by the art on the box.  The loose tea is in small granule form, and comes sealed in a foil pouch, for freshness ... it's not flushed with neutral gas, and they dont vaccum pack it because they dont want to crush the tea, but otherwise the quality is pretty decent.  It comes in a variety of sizes, buy the most common size I buy is 900 grams (2 lbs) or 1800 gr (4lbs).          The resulting tea is not quite as floral as some assams I've had (hey, it's bulk tea), and there's often a modest amount of tea dust in the bottom of the pouch, but the dust is easily removed by pouring the dry tea into a fine strainer, and tapping the strainer over the garbage (to winnow it), before  ewing it.          In my household, I generally buy loose tea in bulk, de dust it, then repackage it in one or more 40 fl oz glass jars using a univeral vaccum sealing lid (see Tilia Food Saver), and then I use those to periodically refill a smaller 16 24 oz convenience container that I keep near my stove, for whenever I want to  ew a fresh pot of tea.          I've found that 1 4 cup of loose tea is sufficient for a 6 cup pot, and 1 4   1 3 cup is sufficient for 8 cups.  After  ewing is done (3 5 mins), I pour the  ewed tea through a fine tea strainer into serving cups, and the surplus goes into a lidded glass carafe that gets stored in the fridge (after it cools) for subsequent reheating by the cup (re: microwave), or for use in iced tea by the jug (just add some simple syrup and fresh lemon juice to taste, and some optional  uised mint leaves, and you're good to go).          Bottom line   for an inexpensive loose bulk tea, this  and is very decent all purpose choice, suitable for both hot and iced tea.  Recommended.
