I saw this item in my local grocery store, and I thought I would give it a try.          I have to admit, I was very surprised about how much I enjoyed this item.  I found it refreshing, and I felt that I had a bit more energy. I would happily purchase this product again and again.          A word of advice to people complaining that it doesn't taste "coconutty" enough.  Coconut water and coconut milk are two very different things.  Coconut water comes from a green, immature coconut, while the milk comes from what we all think of when we think of a coconut...a hard,  own, fiber covered shell.  Just like a green banana and a ripe banana taste different, the same can be said of coconut.  If you don't think of this as a coconut drink or a pina colada, you will probably enjoy it even more.
