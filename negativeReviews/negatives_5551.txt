The product was recently reformulated and, IMHO, isn't as good as it was.  The box states it has black tea, honey and vanilla & spices.  The envelope containing the chai mix states honey, black tea & spices.  Used to contain dried black tea and now contains instant black tea.  Don't know if the instant black tea made the difference, but now it has a disagreeable after taste that it didn't have before.
