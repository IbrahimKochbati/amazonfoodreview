I haven't had Hibiscus tea before, despite living in Hawaii for a long time.  I saw Dr. Oz recommend it for high blood pressure and lowering cholesterol, as well as other benefits.          I drink regular tea all the time, every day.  But it has caffeine and I try to reduce my caffeine intake.  I received my order very quickly and was surprised by the volume, but had to remember these are whole flowers.  I  ewed my first teapot (I only drink iced tea), and was SOOOOoooooo happy!  I sweeten with stevia, so i sweeten the whole pot and then pour over ice cubes.  I was so pleasantly surprised.  It is absolutely DELICIOUS!  and no caffeine.  These blooms are just FIRST rate!  I Highly commend this product and will purchase again.  It's just Great!
