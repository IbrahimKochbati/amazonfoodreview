I've bought the Lady Grey teabags for years and enjoyed them...However, the loose tea is even better!!!  It is not as harsh as the Earl Grey but with a more subtle citrus flavor.  This has been a favorite of mine for years and hopefully for years to come.  (Twinings  please don't ever discontinue this flavor...It is superb!)
