I mixed 1T of PB2 into 2T of sugar free preserves and made an open face PBJ sandwich, which was lovely.  (Yes, the "contrast" of peanut butter and jelly is not the same, but the taste is really quite good.)  I have also added 1T to a CLICK protein drink (Vanilla Latte), and it was also very good.  I plant to add plain PB2 and the chocolate PB2 (which is also delish) to a banana smoothie over the next couple days.  The Thai noodle recipes on the manufacturer's web site are also very good, but, as with any other recipe, you need to play around with it a bit to find the heat salt level that works for you.          Unlike other reviewers, I don't find PB2 to be too salty, nor do I think it has an aftertaste of any kind.  The texture of it when mixed with water is not exactly like that of regular peanut butter, but then it wouldn't be, given that it doesn't contain any oil.          Bottom line: I love PB2 (and chocolate PB2), and will be ordering this product again  either from the manufacturer, or Amazon.
