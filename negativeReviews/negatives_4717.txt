The cans are tiny, and filled mostly with water, so be very, very careful upon opening.  The force needed to bend the lid up is just enough to send the "chicken pot pie" concoction spraying onto everything in vicinity, leaving a puddle with some carrots in it for your cat.     My cat doesn't much care for the carrots.  Or for the lumps of wheat glutenish chickenfood, 3 5 per can.  This is more of a soup course, or an after supper tea.  Seriously, this barely passes for food, and in no way requires so much packaging.          The sesame chicken, however, has earned a spot on my cat's, and on all of his outdoor pal's, favorites list.  The sauce is just viscous enough for genteel lapping, and the julienned meat a considerable presence.  Plus: no carrots.  This cat food's presentation qualities place it right up in my own top three: if you ever indulge the pre dawn feeding cry, you may grow to love this stuff too.  Feeding can be done half asleep and one handed: give the can a shake, pop the top off, and upend it into a tiny cat bowl.That's it. The interior walls of the can are very smooth    they may be plastic coated, so check your recycling outfit's guidelines and then discount my next point    so smooth that the gooey stuff pours right out. No rinsing needed. The odor is quite inoffensive.  But if your cat begs to eat it outside, watch out: if the neighborcats smell it, there's gonna be a rumble.          At $4 pack retail, or $1 for three weensy ounces of liquid plus some bits, I canot recommend the signture chicken pot pie.  If the  and ever markets the sesame chicken solo, however, and promotional discounts are offered, I'd definitely stock up.
