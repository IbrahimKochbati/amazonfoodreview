My mother is restricted to a low sodium and potassium diet.  This seasoning does has a salty flavor and has added some quality taste to such a bland diet.  Eating eggs and other certain foods without salt is not palatable.  I tried this seasoning and was pleased with the salty flavor.  She really enjoys it and we take it with us when she is in the hospital to season her meals.  We will probably buy the pound bag next time.  Five Stars for this product.
