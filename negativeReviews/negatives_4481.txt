My 1 year old will eat anything...well that was until I gave him Happybaby Gobble Gobble. Immediately when I opened the package I was turned off by it. It looked and smelled awful...this does not look like tastey baby food at all. Against my better judgement, I still let my son try it. The first bite he choked and gagged. I thought, "ok, it's just too thick". So I thinned it out with a bit of formula and tried again. Second bite he spit it out and tried to scrape off what was left on his tongue with his fingers! My son is NOT a picky eater by any means and loves food in general, so I knew this MUST be awful if he wouldn't eat it. Rather than torture my kid, I threw the rest out. Thankfully I had only purchased two pouches at the store before commiting to a pack of 16 on Amazon. If only I had read the reviews first!          Bottom line, don't torture your kid with this OR waste your money!
