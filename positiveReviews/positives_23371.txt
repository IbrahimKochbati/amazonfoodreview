I'm very happy with these bars and Amazon's great price & quick shipping!!!!  I wanted a good, healthy, high protein, low glycemic, etc. meal replacement  snack bar to eat on the go that I can keep on hand to help me reduce my caloric  fat intake and stop me from eating unhealthy, fatty foods so I can shed a few pounds.  I went to Whole Foods and asked the employee working in the health bar area and she told me that this  and was a favorite for high protein, no sugar, and pretty good tasting.  She also told me that Chunky Peanut Butter and White Chocolate Chip were the favorite flavors.  I bought them both and liked them and saw that Amazon has them cheaper so I bought a box of each.  I was concerned when I read the reviews on here and someone said the bars were stale  old  not fresh, so I was prepared to send them back if need be. I checked the expiration date and they expire in a little more than a year.  I checked the wrapper of my bar from Whole foods and it expires 11 months from now.  Amazon's is fresher, go figure!!  Also, my boxes and bars in pristine condition (no melting or chemical smells or taste, as some reviewer said)  With subscribe & save I'm saving like 60%...LOVE IT!!
