I saw this on the Dr. Oz show and ordered it.  I have diabetes and have been looking for a natural sweetener that doesn't send my blood glucose through the roof and that tastes good.  I think this is it!  I have tried this for baking, in my coffee and oatmeal and it is really great tasting.  No sugar spikes either!  Now I can have a  ownie occasionally.
