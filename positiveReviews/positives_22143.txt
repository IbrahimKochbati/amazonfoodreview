I've been suffering through an incredibly hot season, more sauna than summertime. I've had enough sweat rolling down my back to charge neighborhood kids three bucks a pop for a Slip 'N' Slide ride, and I'm finally at the end of my sweaty rope. I came here looking for something, anything, to help me beat the summer heat.          I've watched those Peppermint Pattie commercials for years. Eating one gives 'the sensation of shushing down a snow capped mountain,' they say. It's like 'yodeling in the frigid Alpine snow,' they tell me. It feels like 'a giant soothing Sno Cone down your pants on a hot August afternoon'. So they say, in these commercials.          Hogwash.          On a particularly sweltering recent afternoon, I put their advertising to the test. I ate forty six of these little patties    and I got a 'sensation', all right. Not of skiing or crooning or cooling my undies, though. More like the feeling of three pounds of chocolate crammed down my colon, and a faint minty tinge to all five senses. You ever HEARD peppermint? I can't recommend it.          Bottom line: Eat a Pattie if you're looking for a nice sweet treat. But if you're suffering through a summertime heat wave? Drop in a Sno Cone. Your colon    and your BVDs    will thank you.
