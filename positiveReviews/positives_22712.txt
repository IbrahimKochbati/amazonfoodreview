This is great tasting movie theater popcorn that can be enjoyed in your popcorn machine for days after being popped. It is good to have a convienent 4oz package to easily make up great tasting batches of popcorn when wanted. We have a Nostalgia Electric 4oz Movie Time Popcorn Cart in our home theater room and this makes it perform like a professional model producing real movie theater popcorn. You can even add a tiny bit of Orville Redenbacher's Buttery Flavor Popping and Topping oil to get extra butter flavor, like when adding butter topping at the movies. We were concerned about possible lingering popcorn smell in our theater room, but this has not been an issue at all. Clean up is a bit more involved than after using just regular oil and popcorn (more oil and seasoning thrown around), but it is not too bad and worth the effort. This is a great product for 4oz machines.
