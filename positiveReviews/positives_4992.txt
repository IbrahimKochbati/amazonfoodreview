It wouldn't be very smart to replace real veggies with these veggies straws but if you want a healthier salty snack I personally can't think of a better one on the market.  The portion size for 130 calories is absolutely gluttonous.  One portion is equal to 38 straws.  That is quite a bit of snacking for 130 calories.  These are crispy and taste great.  There is no trans fat, no preservatives, and kosher certified.  The single serving does have 7 grams of total fat and 11 carbs.  Eating these all the time might not be great for your diet but when you want something this is fantastic option.  I have lost 92lbs in the last year and half by following a sensible diet and I am happy to say this  and of Veggie Straws has helped me along the way.
