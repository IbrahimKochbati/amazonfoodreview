I'm challenging myself to give up soda 100% this year, but I needed something with flavor to replace it. After searching online for Tea reviews, I decided to give this tea a try. I just made the first batch of Iced Tea and it's FANTASTIC!!! The tea has a clean, crisp taste and you can definitely taste the mint!! It's not overpowering but it's definitely there! I used 3 teabags , steeped it in a 2 quart pan full of hot water, added a teaspoon of sugar and let it sit. The tea really is very delicious, and leagues better than the yucky pre made tea I've been buying at work. The tea is a bit naturally sweet, but it needed a teeny bit of sugar.          I'm so pumped! Here's to a healthier 2012 with Numi.          P.S. amazon prime rocks. Received the boxes in perfect condition.          M~
