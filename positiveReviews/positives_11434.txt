My husband's 86 year old father set us with the task of finding him some turtle soup.  When an 86 year old asks for something you make sure to find it!  We assumed that since we live in Louisiana, where seafood is plentiful, this would be an easy task.  We were very surprised when we could not find it anywhere locally.  When I have trouble finding something I always turn to my reliable friend, Amazon.com, and tada it is found.  I must admit that I was a little surprised that it seemed a bit pricey but after researching turtle soup I realized that it is priced right. I ordered the 6 pack and had it shipped directly to my father in law.  He was overjoyed when his package arrived and tried it immediately.  He was very pleased with the taste.  I am sure I will be placing another order for this product sometime in the near future.
