I was looking for organic pure maple syrup that was made in USA, not Canada because I had read that syrup doesn't need to be 100% in Canada to be called 100%...anyway, that's why I bought this product, company is very reputable looking as per their web site and the price beats any store in my area by far!  I just wish it came in glass and not plastic though it is a good plastic at least #2.  Also, gets a little messy around spout as there isn't a nice pour spout on this, but small price to pay for the money saved.  We use this every day for oats or waffles pancakes.
