Everyone who has tried this that I know absolutely loves it. There isn't a lot of heat, but for me that is fine. The flavor is spot on and reminds me of the old fire crackers (before they changed the recipe to dry sticks of meat probably made of orphan kids). I'll definitely will be buying this again. Only downfall is the stupid shipping costs...
