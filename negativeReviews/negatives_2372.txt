My cats go crazy for the Party Mix and mainly the cheese flavor. It sells for $1.50     to $1.89 a pouch in my local stores, so I was looking on amazon hoping to find a better     price. I looked at this listing because of the price of $6.48, assuming it was for several     pouches, like most of the other listings here. But no number of pouches was listed and the     only indication comes from looking at the shipping weight: this ia apparently the price     for a single pouch. This is a problem with amazon  quantities are not always posted     and you can really get ripped off overpaying. I saw one review for Friskies canned     food, where the reviewer thought she was ordering a multican pack for $12 but the     actual number was not posted and she ended up receiving ONE can!
