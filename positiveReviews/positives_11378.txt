I purchased this carbonated lemonade at a local health food store on a whim and I love it.  I've had Mediterranean rose water lemonade before which I liked but it did not have ginger root nor was it carbonated which adds a lot of zing.  Also, this lemondade is botanically  ewed and has distilled essential oil of rose.  The rose oil seems to  ing out layers or dimensions of flavor from the lemon and the ginger.  It's very refreshing and very unique!          Ingredients are as follows:     Carbonated Water, Lemon Juice Concentrate, Cane Sugar, Glucose Syrup, Fermented Ginger Root Extracts (ginger root, water and yeast), Pear Juice Concentrate, Lemon Flavoring, Citric Acid, Tantaric Acid, Natural Color (grape skin extract), and Rose Oil.          The Fentimans Victorian Rose Lemonade isn't cheap, but it's worth it for a treat.  Definitely a more sophisticated "soda" for the less processed palate (Sprite and Mountain Dew lovers need not apply   lol   you may not like it!).  It adds so much to a meal... even as a dessert!
