My 5 year old lab mix gets one of the X Large chews every evening, and he loves them.  I've never had to have his teeth cleaned because the chews, combined with a little  ushing every now and then, really work well at keeping build up off of his teeth.  A bit of a warning. . .don't let the dog have one of these when you're not around.  More than once my dog has tried to swallow the last "little" piece which gets stuck in his throat and has to be removed.
