Im not much of a Starbucks fan and most of their coffee turms my stomach in knots but not so with Sumatra!This is a low acid coffee of high quality and at a very competitive price. Coffee used to give me all sorts of gastric reflux problems but coffees such as this...and $$$peaberry$$$ allow me to drink coffee again!
