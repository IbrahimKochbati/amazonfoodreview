The Stash Tea Company's Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea is soothing for a stomach that feels a little "off", as when you've eaten too much of a good thing or have discomfort from heavily seasoned foods.  This is not to make medicinal claims for the tea  but only that it eases and soothes.  It's also a tea to relax with for no particular reason, as are most herbal teas.  In my experience, Stash teas are of excellent quality.
