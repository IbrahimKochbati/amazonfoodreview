I never get low acid coffee but, getting older, it seems like a good idea. I like coffee; I was looking forward to trying this.          The flavor was a little more "roasted" than I usually like, but I don't drink black coffee and it was good (not great, but good) a little weaker and with milk and sugar. I did feel it created less acid and was easier on the digestion. I think it would be worth the price if you like the flavor  some will, others may find it "too bold".
