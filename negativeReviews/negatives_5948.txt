I love snow balls and Hawaiian Shaved Ice sells good flavors...I've bought a few.  But the Pina Colada Snow Cone Syrup is a little too sweet.  Please understand that the taste is good but it needs to be watered down a bit.  So far, this is the only flavor that I found to be a bit too sweet.  I will definitely buy from this merchant again, however, I think I'll pass on the Pina Colada...for now.
