I found this to be 'middle of the road' blend.  I was not expecting it to be more than that, hence the 4 stars.  There are other richer blends with a more full body taste that I prefer.  Note:  This is personal preference, not the fault of Folgers.  I have dropped the size of the  ew on my Keurig and it has helped considerably.  Unfortunately, I often forget to do that at 6:00 am in the morning   not terrible coherent without that first, fresh cup !!!          If you like a milder blend, try this.  The price is right and it is nice to keep different blends in the house for guests.
