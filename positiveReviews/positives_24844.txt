My wife and I love this tea.  She is a tea drinker, keeping all kinds of different teas in the house so she has what she wants when the mood strikes her.  I love this tea in particular because of the warm wonderful feeling I get as it goes down. Mmmmmmmm. Our local store stopped carrying it so here I am on my old stand by.  Maybe I should just stay home and buy everything through Amazon. Try it with a bit of stevia powder.
