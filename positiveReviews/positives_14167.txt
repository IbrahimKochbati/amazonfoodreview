These are the normal sized packets that we all know and love.  Good ol' Regular flavor so it doesn't have all that extra sugar and stuff.  I use 2 packets and about 3 4 cup water.  Just boil the water first in the microwave, then dump it into the bowl which has the oatmeal and sugar and butter.. stir... let it sit for a minute...  makes Breakfast in just a few minutes.  This box has 48 packets so you will have enough to last you a long time!          For me, oatmeal does't get better than this (Quaker  and   Regular flavor).  So go for it, you won't be disappointed.
