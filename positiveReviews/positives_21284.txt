Totally delicious treats. Excellent, excellent quality milk chocolate. Colorfully wrapped, and buying 60 treats in a red box like this one just looks good, you know? Everyone needs a red box of treats in their pantry. This isn't dark mysterious film noir 99% cocoa solid new age hipster chocolate from Seattle, it's more like familiar, loving, home and hearth delicious. Really delightful.
