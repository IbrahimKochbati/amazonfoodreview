I was so happy to find this food on Amazon.com. I love this food for my cat. It keeps his teeth fresh and makes his  eath smell better. It's a little pricey but well worth the price because I find that it's healthy for my cat, meaning he likes it and I don't have to get scratched up trying to  ush his teeth, OUCH!
