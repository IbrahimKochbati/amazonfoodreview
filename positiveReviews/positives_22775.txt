I love this popcorn so much.  I pop it in my Whirley pop stove top popper, and it comes out perfect everytime.  I just had a bowl and it was scrum del e icious.  nowhere near as greasy as microwave popcorn, but still just as flavorful.          Update 2012          The first time I bought this popcorn it was so delicious, but I noticed when I received the 2nd box a few months later it wasn't nearly as good.  the popcorn was a little stale.  I thought it was because I switched to a new popcorn popper and it was over steaming the popcorn.  Now after reading some of the current reviews I am a little scared to buy it again.  That's too bad cause it was once really good. I see the price has gone up a few dollars too.  So now you have to pay more for lower quality.
