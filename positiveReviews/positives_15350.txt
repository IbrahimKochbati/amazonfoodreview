Just like the other reviewers, I find myself competing for this product at the local grocery store.  There are not many Asians where I live, and the Asian Aisle at my local Safeway of course is just a narrow shelf.  This is perfect for Filipino rice noodle dish [pansit bihon].  The noodles do not fall apart.          Gluten Free!
