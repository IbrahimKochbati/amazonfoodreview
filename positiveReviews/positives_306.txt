I was pretty pleased with these mushrooms. They were mostly large pieces, re hydrated well and had good flavor. I'd estimate about 25% of the contents were  oken into medium to small pieces, most likely due to the shaking about in transit. Not a problem since I sometimes  eak the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes. There was a small amount (perhaps an ounce or so) of very small minced size dust like pieces. Still useful to add into gravies and the like. Nothing gets wasted!          The label says it is a product of China and Italy. Nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country.          I'm quite fond of dried mushrooms. While they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones, the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus. Additionally, I find the  oth used to re hydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews. To save time and add flavor, I sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without re hydrating them. Really helps meld all the flavors together. I also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta. The pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroom infused water.          This was the first time I used the Roland  and (got it on a price dip from the Amazon Warehouse), and would certainly buy them again. Highly recommend.
