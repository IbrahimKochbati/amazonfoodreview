Bottom screws open for easy loading. Last night,  I took some of their favorite treats,  oke them in pieces, and placed inside the jug, along with standard kibble. They could smell the food but couldn't quite figure out how to get to it.  I played with them with this toy, with food spilling out erratically, and once in a while, one of their favorite treats spilled out. They have not quite figured out pulling the rope part, but they were rolling the bottle, bouncing it up and down, etc. to get treats out, whatever works. One of my dogs worked for 2 hours last night getting a handful of kibble.  My other dogs are watching, interested, not sure what this thing is, but I believe they will become engaged soon.
