I was like, wow whatta huge package of tea!  when it arrived.  The taste is good.  I like plain dark tea, iced.  The flavor is nice.  I would like the ingredient list to specify what kind of black tea it is exactly, but I do believe it's organic and it tastes good.  I appreciate Paul Newman is helping kids with my purchase.
