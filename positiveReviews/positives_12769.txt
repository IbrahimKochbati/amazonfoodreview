When we visited Turkey last Xmas, we drank straight or honey sweetened Turkish tea along with delicious baklava several times a day to make up for the cold. My boys fell in love with Turkish tea there. Back home, we tried to find some good Turkish tea. I ordered several kinds. After doing thorough testing (!!) we decided that this was the best tea among the 4 kinds we sampled!          The taste: very clean and pure. A light, well pitched, fragrant component. A hint of sweetness in the background.          We  ew it in a cast iron Japanese tea kettle, pour boiling water in it, then dilute it in the glass or mug to the concentration we want. Purists beware: we often sweeten it with honey, and I typically add a drop of lemon: )
