The C.E.T. HEXtra Premium Oral Hygiene Chews with Chlorhexidine are super fantastic! Just ask my dogs! Buy the correct size for you dog and it will keep him her busy for a while and will keep their teeth gums healthy as well.  If your dogs are small (12 lbs and under) I'd recommend the "petite" size because they are made from "pressed" hide and are easier for them to digest.  My dog is 75 lbs and she needs the Extra Large ones.  We've been huge fans of HEXtra Chews for several years.  Do you and your dog a favor and keep them on hand!
