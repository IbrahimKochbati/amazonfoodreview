I was very impressed with the taste of this peanut butter. After playing around a bit with the water to powder ratio, I got a smooth creamy spread that was fantastic on a piece of  ead.          Be sure to measure out the amount you want by weight, not volume. I am dinging them one star because their serving size is 21g or 2 tbps. I found that 21g came out a bit over 1 tbps, but it is definitely not 2! Since most people are likely buying this to watch their calories, that's a big error. You still end up with enough to comfortably cover a piece of  ead.
