Coconut water with a hint of pineapple, shipped to the US from Indonesia, packaged in (usually) non recyclable, disposable containers, and catering to the... sports drink market ("good source of electrolytes")?          I took a  8.5 ounce container and poured 6 servings, for 4 teenagers and 2 adults.  First impression?  The teens (serious athletes) were not told what the drink was, but I did mention that it was being marketed as a potential sports drink.          The result?  No negative votes, but no one would choose it over existing drinks.  Everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly.  "It leaves a strange feeling in my mouth," one teen said.  This was probably the coconut water; it had a residual flavor and feel.          There was no straw included with the package, so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife.  It's mostly (cane) sugar water, so why bother?          But the biggest issue is the waste.  Coconut sugar water from Indonesia?  What's the carbon footprint of this product?  And the container has 2 "recycle" symbols on it, but, like milk cartons, it is difficult to find a community that will actually keep them out of the landfill.          Bottom line?  It's not that tasty, being little more than sugar water, and the transport and packaging waste really don't fit into a culture (for me) focusing on sustainability.
