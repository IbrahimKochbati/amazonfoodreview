You know how short ead can frequently be boring?  Patterson's does a nice "finger style" and Royal Edinburgh does the very best petticoat tails, so it is helpful to only open these when you are sharing or just don't  eak the seal on the package in the first place  they are nicely crunchy without being too crumbly, and really nice flavor so the little devils call out to you when they are in the house.  Better than I bake on my own  and I have had practice!
