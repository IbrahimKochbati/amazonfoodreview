I really like the flavor and crunchiness of the Cinnamon Toast pretzel sticks. And 10g of protein in a tasty convenient, wheat and dairy free snack is great. I wasn't so impressed with the butter flavor. I think most of the reviewers that didn't care for the sticks were referring to the butter flavor.          In response to another reviewer, yes, the package states that this product is made on the same production line as products containing soybeans, dairy, tree nuts, and wheat. That does not mean it is not gluten free. It may or may not be an issue for you depending on just how sensitive you are.
