My best friend turned me on to Cavender's back in the 70's.  I use it in so many recipes, I'd be lost without it.  It goes in salad, on pasta, on veggies and meats, in soups.  Ok, I never used it in a dessert recipe!  I backpacked up the east coast of Australia once for two months.  My Cavender's was the only thing I made sure was in my pack...the jumbo size.  I've introduced more people to this seasoning; it is the "secret ingredient" to some of my most popular recipes.          Lately, I've been making "simple salad"   torn bibb lettuce leaves, olive oil, Cavender's, a little grated parmesan, a little balsamic vinegar.  Nothing else.  I can't get enough.
