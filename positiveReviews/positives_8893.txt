I'm somewhat of a foodie food snob and this ghee is excellent as well as containing all the health benefits that ghee should contain.  The cows are grassfed which means more of the fat burning, cancer fighting CLA, they use non homogenized milk (which is linked to heart disease) and tastes amazing!  I'll be buying more of this!
