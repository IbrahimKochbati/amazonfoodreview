Of all the cups I've used, this has the most rich flavorful on the large setting (for my 2 size machine).  Absolutely no chocolate left in cup   came  out clean looking   and no mess left in the machine.  My machine directions recommended doing a hot water cycle through after  ewing chocolate but no need with this one. YUMMMM.
