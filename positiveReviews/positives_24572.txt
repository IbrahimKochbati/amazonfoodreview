I bake a lot of vegan cookies, quick  eads and muffins... and pumpkin is a great ingredient to add moisture and flavor.  My grocery store is out of canned pumpkin more than half of the time so I've turned to amazon, and discovered this  and in the process.  The flavor is good and the price is great.  I always prefer to buy organic over non so that's a big plus.  I've ordered two cases thus far and will definitely reorder when I run out!
