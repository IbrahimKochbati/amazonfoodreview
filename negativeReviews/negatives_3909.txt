The flavor is pretty good.  It's sweet, tart, and tangy.  The calories are okay, 135 calories in an 8.3 oz can.  You wouldn't want to drink a lot of it every day, but 135 calories is fine for once or twice a day.  The fizz is light, similar to Fanta, which is something I really like about this product.  The only thing I don't like is the taste that the vitamin c adds.  The extra vitamin c gives it an aftertaste similar to red bull and other energy drinks.  I think this product would taste a lot better without it, and I don't see any real value in having it.  Vitamin C is one of the easiest vitamins to get.  There aren't a lot of people in the modern world running around with scurvy.          The other concern is price.  This stuff is very expensive, almost $1 per 8.3 oz can.  The idea here is suppose to be that this is a soda replacement.  At that price, I don't think so.  A 12 pack of soda (with 12 oz cans) typially runs from $3   $5.  The Switch costs more than double that.  If this product wants to compete with the soda market they really need to  ing the price down.          If you like this, just get some low sodium Pellegrino and some concentrated juices.  You can mix your own for a lot less and not have the vitamin c aftertaste.
