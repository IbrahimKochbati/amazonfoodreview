good price and very easy to use, just heat up your popper for 3 5 minutes then cut the top open and pour it in, a few minutes later....movie theater quality popcorn for .50 cents a pouch.  wish i had a larger popper, but this is a great product if you have a 2.5 oz popper.  it is coconut oil (the same kind that movie theaters use, so you get the same taste, fyi they use it because of the high burn temp, so it does not get that burnt taste when cooking)in case you are wondering, since the description does not state the type of oil included and the salt and popcorn are premixed. will buy more.  very fast delivery.
