My family has two cats who are just over a year old.  We usually feed them dry food, but give them the canned stuff once in a while for a treat.  Our large sized male cat LOVES Petite Cuisine, and gobbles it up.  Our dainty little female though, refuses table scraps and won't touch any wet food, including Petite Cuisine.  My kids helped me to take notes on this food as we offered it to both cats.  The same thing happened with every flavor  little cat A sniffed it and walked away, while big fat cat B ate it up as fast as he could! I guess it's all a matter of preference.           I feel good about the fact that this stuff is natural and looks like food.  it is not full of fillers, and it has everything a cat requires for a healthy diet.  The cans are the right size for a single serving for an average to big cat, so there's no messing around with storing half empty cans of fragrant catfood in the fridge.
