Neat concept. Other contraptions to use your own coffee have prepunched holes and are designed much differently than the K Cup. This is like a do it yourself K Cup. However, because this consists of a disposable cup, filter, and a cap and is punched by the  ewer, I would not be surprised if this mechanism infringed on Keurig's patents. Oh, and the video review submitted by the other reviewer looks suspiciously like the video on the manufacturers website :)
