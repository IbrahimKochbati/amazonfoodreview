I adore sardines.  I'm used to the Bela  and, but decided to try these for variety's sake.  I opened up a can and it smelled like nasty cat food.  I tasted them anyway, but was totally grossed out.  In the trash it went.  Stick with Bela, super clean flavor, fresh and better sourced.  Totally different food product.  Try them with Siracha.
