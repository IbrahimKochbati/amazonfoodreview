Delicious!  Because of the fine grind, I thought the coffee might be a little bitter, but it's not.  It's delicious and smooth.  My favorite coffee is Caribou, but this is not far behind.  I followed the instructions exactly, using two teaspoons per 6oz of water.  I have a coffee maker where you put the beans in one side, and the water in the other, and press a button. . .  so measuring ground coffee is not my thing, but this worked great.  I didn't have a problem using it in my non Melitta coffee maker at all.  Very enjoyable.  .. rich flavor. . . smooth. . . What's not to like? ; )
