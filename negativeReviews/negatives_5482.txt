While I wanted to try this coffee because of an acid reflex difficulty I was having for me personally it did not taste at  all like what I would call real coffee.          I've been used to drnking either Starburcks or Petts which I think have what you might call a robust flavor.  That may be the reason I was disappointed in this.
