I'm torn. I love these strips. They feel like the real thing and they taste great (even my dog loves it...he doesn't care if it's veggie), but they're so moist. They're marinating inside the package, and I understand that it probably needs to stay that way to keep the flavor, but it just doesn't feel like real beef jerky because it isn't dry. I've had thoughts about buying a dehydrator and laying these things inside for a few minutes. I've laid them out on napkins to dry them out, and that worked fine, but...bits of napkin get left behind and they aren't as tasty.          I'm giving these 3 stars because they're good, and I do like them, but I really feel like they're just too moist to be considered jerky.
