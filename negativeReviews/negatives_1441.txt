I absolutely loved Newman's Own pretzels with the pepper baked right into the pretzel for just a little bite. These are not as tasty and yes, they are messy and overly seasoned.  Not really a fan of this line of flavored  oken pretzel pieces, although this was a little better than some of their other flavors.          Someone out there needs to try making the baked in black pepper version again, please. Not sure why Newman's Own stopped.
