I watched a YouTube video on guayusa tea, and heard very good things about it there and on the amazon reviews as welll so I thought I would give it a try. Money well spent! This tea is smooth and easy to drink, and is absolutely delicious with sugar and honey.     Another awesome thing about this tea is the dreams you get. My mother hasn't had a lucid dream in years, and I offered this tea to her one day, and that night she had three vivid lucid dreams! She was so thrilled she bought two more boxes of the Runa guayusa tea. I am so satisfied with this product, and would definitely recommend to anyone who needs some steady energy, focus, and vivid dreams. :)
