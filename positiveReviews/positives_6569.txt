I am having a blast with my new Keurig machine   trying out a bunch of new flavors including the Dark Roast. It's nice and flavorful   particularly since I run each of my cups through the small cup  ewing cycle 2 times to fill my large mug.  This works.     Tried the chocolate donut flavor the other day and loved it.     Love the convenience and bargain prices of the subscribe & save.
