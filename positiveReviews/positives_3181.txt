Great price for what you are getting.  Recording via a USB port ROCKS!!!! The only thing that could maybe be improved is the durability.  It feels like a toothpick in your hand.  It may be more durable than it feels, but I'm still going to be very careful with it.  But, for the price this is only a minor gripe.  Great product, I would recommend it to anyone.
