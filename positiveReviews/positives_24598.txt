After reading about how many people received dented cans I was hesitant to buy these but I love pumpkin and after the massive crop failures it can't be found on any shelves anywhere! I'm glad I took the chance because all 12 cans arrived looking just perfect   no dents nor even scratches   just pure luscious pumpkin which will be pumpkin bars by tonight!
