I was looking for a simple and inexpensive way to provide my own supply of "home made" K cups. This product is all that it is described to be;fairly easy to use and does not adversely affect the cup of coffee. Clearly, the cups and lids are in fact reusable albeit a little messy.     I have used all 50 filters so I am at a point where I need to decide if I want to continue on with this regimen or go to plan B.     I am electing to try one of the reusable style cups that don't require the use of a filter. My hope is that it will be a little quicker and less messy to use.     However, if plan B does not meet my expectations I can always order another supply of filters and continue on with this DisposaCups system.
