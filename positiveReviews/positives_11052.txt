I drink a lot of coffee and refuse to drink without creamer. This subscribe and save service has been a blessing for me. I can now always have creamer ready for me in my fridge at a much cheaper price. I am now on my 3rd delivery. Several other reviewers said that some of theirs busted and leaked and make a mess. When I first got mine I had about 6 of them that were leaked on me. But on the 2nd and 3rd box, NONE were busted or leaked. When I removed mine from the box the second time, I was more careful and removed them slowly by hand not just dump them in the container I keep mine in. BTW I put 3 in per cup  )
