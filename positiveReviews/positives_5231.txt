The Switch is marketed as "100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't"...meaning, the only things in the can are juice and carbonation. There is no added sugar, no corn syrup (high fructose or otherwise), no preservatives, no *artificial* colors ("natural" flavors and colors ARE added), and no gluten.          The Orange Tangerine flavor seemed to taste almost like carbonated Sunny Delight   according to the label, the juice flavors are apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola. It was quite tasty and had just the right amount of carbonation   almost like a soda that has been opened and left to sit for just a few minutes to let some of the excess gas escape. It was light and, dare I say, refreshing. For what it is marketed to be, it does quite well.          The only downside is that I could probably do something similar at home   buy some Sunny D and add some sparkling water or seltzer, and it would probably be cheaper. However, if you're out and about and need something light, tasty and not loaded full of extra nonsense, then this would certainly fit the bill.
