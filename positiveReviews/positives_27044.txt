Sukhi's sauces are amazingly good.  Seriously, the BEST quick indian food I've ever had (and I've had a lot!).  My in laws are from Kerala, and I wouldn't be embarrassed to cook them a meal using these sauces (and then hide the evidence, of course!  what?  me use a pre made sauce?? never!)  Everything I've ever tried, from the vindaloo to the masala to the spice mixes for potatoes, etc, have been wonderful, and you can switch up the meat (I usually use chicken  east, but sometimes use lamb or pork instead, and sometimes just veggies).  Last night was the first time my husband and I had tried the korma, and it might be our favorite now.  It's got a bit of a kick to it, which is unfortunately rare in most americanized indian sauces.  I added skim milk instead of cream, and it still came out great.  I usually saute onions first (but not always   if I'm in a hurry, they get left out), then  own about a pound of meat, next the sauce packet and milk, and then add a a couple of boiled potatoes (cubed) and half a can of peas.  I then simmer until the potatoes have absorbed the flavor.  Each packet is for about a pound of meat or veggies, but I've used one packet for a pound of meat plus about half a pound of veggies and it was fine   very strong, concentrated sauce.  Last night I used 2 packets because I used about a pound and 1 2 of chicken  east, 2 large potatoes, and peas, and the meal lasts for about 3 night for the two of us. It makes for a easy, fast meal, and goes great with rice or naan.  If you live near a specialty grocery store, you might check to see if they carry the frozen sukhi's meals, too.  The samosas are especially delicious, and my husband and I practically live off the frozen naanwiches during the weekends!
