I'm not a fan of fruit flavored sodas, usually I find them to be too sweet. Thankfully this wasn't overly sweet, but I still don't think it's something I would drink on a regular basis. I tend to prefer my fruit drinks to just be the fruit juice. I don't need the added carbonation added to the drink.
