The sugar apple tree is a very beautiful tree to have in your backyard. First, it grows relatively fast compared to other trees. Second, trees germinated from seed will produce fruit in 2 3 years. Third, it is easy to grow in sunny weather. Now, here comes the best part, the suggar apple fruit is AWESOME!!!!!, and likely it will become your favorite fruit after you eat it. So down to business, how do you grow the tree? Get a small pot with good soil (rich in nutrients), and put 4 seeds next to each other and about 3 mm or so deep in the soil. It is important that the seeds are covered by the soil but not deep into it. Next, water your pot+seeds. Important, these seeds like rain water and germinate fast with it. Good luck with your tree adventure my friends!!!!!
