After reading several glowing reviews about this product, I decided to buy it and see for myself how great it is.          After following the instructions, I taste tested a variety of items, that were suggested on the packaging. None of which seemed to have any affect. On lemons, I noticed a slight taste change, however the lemon was no sweeter.          Bottom line; the product is over hyped, and in my opinion, is not worth the buying. I know it's definitely not something I will ever purchase again.
