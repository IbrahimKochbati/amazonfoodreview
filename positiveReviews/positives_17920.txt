I confess: although I'm a foodie, sometimes I really crave the meals my culinary challenged mom used to make. Shake N Bake pork chops were one of her mainstays, and I was very pleased to discover they taste just how I remembered.          This product makes pork chops so simple that even my 11 year old son can make them. Simply pour the crumbs into a plastic bag or a bowl with a well fitting lid, add the chops one at a time, and shake, shake, shake. After that, it's off to the oven for a while then, voila, you've got tender, juicy pork chops with a nicely seasoned coating.          If you're watching your diet, you'll be pleased to know the sodium levels, the carb count and even the calories on this aren't outrageous. They've used spices and herbs to make up the flavor, and the coating is light enough that it's nothing like your usual battered or  eaded meats. Plus, there's no oil involved    use a cooking spray on your baking sheet, so with leaner pork you'll be eating lower fat, too!
