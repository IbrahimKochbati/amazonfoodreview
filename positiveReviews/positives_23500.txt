I wouldn't go so far to say this cereal is bad for you, but with the amount of added sugar it isn't great. I suppose that is the only way you can make  an appealing to the masses though. Bran is the nutritious cardboard part of a wheat grain. I personally would like to see them reduce the added sugar and add more raisins for a natural sweetness. As far a a amazon rating though it is, in my opinion, a good (not great) tasting cereal and has a good bit or fiber and protein. Also it's price is great for to the door delivery and you don't have to wait for it to go on sale at your local grocery store.
