This is a very dangerous product. It is not labeled as to identify "Pepsin: A name for several enzymes secreted by the stomach to  eak down protein; An enzyme produced in the stomach that splits proteins into peptones; Also used as coagulant, comes from the stomach of the pigs; An enzyme from pigs' stomachs, used with rennet to make cheese." I flushed my money down the toilet   don't be fooled by the Pure Fun Organic Candy Pepsin Swirl Mint Pinwheels   These are horrid and made me sick. I allowed a 7 year old to have one (thinking it was exactly as the package was labeled) CANDY. Stay away from Pepsin Swirl which in my opinion is fraud and the FDA needs to investigate this product.
