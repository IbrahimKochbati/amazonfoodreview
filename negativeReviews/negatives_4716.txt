I had a whole case of this to try, so thought it would be fun to try it on as many cats as possible. Thus, by recruiting 5 friends, we ended up trying Petite Cuisine chicken cat food on 13 cats  7 males & 6 females; 4 inside cats, 5 outside & 4 inside outside. Their ages ranged from 1 year to 16 years. Their weights ranged from 8 pounds to 16 pounds. Twelve of these cats eat Purina One Chicken & Rice dry cat food or Purina One Senior formula, which is a chicken formula. Four of those also eat other types of dry cat food. The sixteen year old cat eats Purina One Salmon & Tuna. Eight of the cats only eat canned tuna or seafood type canned food  namely Meow Mix's Market Select types with no chicken or wheat gluten. The other 5 eat seafood, chicken, turkey or beef canned foods.          I was surprised at the results...only one cat, a one year old outside male, of questionable ownership, ate both the Chicken Pot Pie & Chinese Chicken every time he was offered it. Actually, he eats anything he is offered, and is very well fed. He loves meat, too. Another outside cat  a 2 year old male  ate the Chicken Pot Pie every time he was offered it, but would not eat the Chinese Chicken. A third male  a 16 pound inside outside orange tabby  would consume all the juice of the Chicken Pot Pie, and would eat only some of the chicken. Most of the other cats would also consume the  oth of the Chicken Pot Pie, but would not touch the meat. The Chicken Pot Pie has lots of  oth, which I think is  illiant, since all the cats I know always like the  oth of canned cat food or tuna best.          I don't know why this canned cat food was not better liked. It has great ingredients and smells like human food. I hope to try Petite Cuisine seafood catfood one day...I think they all might like that much better.
