My dog loves this game.  As soon as he sees it, he runs over and waits for his command.  Even though there are 7 areas to hide treats, I usually only do 4 or 5.  When I give him the commad "Find the treats" he sniffs by each cover until he finds the one with the treat.  Then he gets his jaws around the cover and tries to pull it off, sometimes not on the first attempt.  He goes around until he has pulled off each cover that holds a treat.  The ones that are empty, he does not bother to remove the cover.  Really AMAZING Toy!!!!          I would recommend keeping the toy hidden until it is time to play, especially if your dog is a chewer.  The covers are small and can be chewed up quickly.
