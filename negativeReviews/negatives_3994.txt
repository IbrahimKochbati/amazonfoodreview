I'd eagerly awaited for delivery of this vanilla candy that I vividly remembered from childhood and was disappointed with this ersatz version of Bonomo's Turkish Taffy.  It's not as rich and creamy in the mouth and doesn't have the real vanilla flavor that I recall in the original.  I would bet that the ingredients are not the same; for one thing soy is now used.
