I love this coffee!  I am not a strong coffee drinker and this coffee is perfect!  I have no problems with it working in my Cuisinart Keurig Brewer, I aways get the perfect tasting cup of coffee.          I gave it 3 stars because one of the 2 packs contained only 13 K Cups and not the 24 that it was supposed to have.          The decaf 24 count (pack of 2) arrived with the correct amount of K cups and is as yummy as the high test!
