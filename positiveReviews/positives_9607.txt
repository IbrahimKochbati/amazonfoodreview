I ordered the decaffeninated French Vanilla, because the regular wasn't in stock at the time.  I'd been meaning to cut back on caffeine anyway.  What I found is that the decaf type actually had a more pleasing and more intense vanilla flavor to it which I really enjoyed even more.  I plan to stay with the decaf variety from now on.
