They sent me the French Roast which is not a favorite of mine at all. The coffee advertises as low acid, but after two cups, I was feeling the acid. I'm sure it is most likely because of the dark roast rather than any extra acid in the coffee. The flavor is good when fresh  ewed, but it doesn't sit in the pot well. It would be best for company when the whole pot will be served rather than as a daily pot for one person. It is very strong, and reminds me of New Orleans coffee without chicory.
