This tea is a great price and had great reviews which is why I opted to try this. In the past, I had purchased my bulk hibiscus from Dragonwater and the quality was amazing. This isn't quite as good as the Dragonwater kind, but since they went out of business, Davidson's seems like the best economical alternative. The petals are really large, but this isn't an issue for me since I use what is essentially a giant tea ball. I make iced hisbiscus tea to make transportable to drink while at work. To make a large quantity at a time, I purchased a 3" spice ball like this one available from Amazon.  [...]     I use this spice ball in a large pot of heated to proper tea temperature water and steep accordingly and then I have a large container of iced hibiscus tea.     I gave this tea 4 starts as opposed to 5 because they could clean up some of the odd bits in there (they seem to throw in other parts than the petals). It's not really a big deal, but doing so would make it more 5 star quality. Good product, great price.
