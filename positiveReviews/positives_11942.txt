This a wonderful treat.  my 3 Labs just love them.  very healthy and natural.  the small cubes are great for hiding in toys and a great mental challenge for the dogs  to figure out to get to the treats. I work in the animal field and every dog I have come across just gobbles them up. Just a few little cubes go a long way
