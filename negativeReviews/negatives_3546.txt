I got this for my 12 year old cat who stopped eating his regular dry food, as the kibble was a little too hard for his teeth.  I ordered this because it was described as having soft kibble, but was just as hard and looked exactly the same as the Science Diet I had been feeding him.  He eagerly went for the food when presented, but stopped eating it after a few bites because it was too hard.  Luckily, I didn't buy a huge bag, as this food is expensive.
