Of the Erin Baker products, the Fruit & Nut Mini Breakfast Cookie is my favorite!  I have one mini  eakfast cookie (about 100 calories) with a cup of coffee in the morning and I feel satisfied and ready to start the day.  Very healthy, low in caloreis, and super delicious is what makes the product work for me.  Try it, you'll like it.
