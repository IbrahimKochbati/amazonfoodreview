Just received the sugar free assortment.  Very happy with it... they all taste good.  Just have a request and observation. Request...PLEASE carry these with the glass bottles instead of the cheap plastic bottles!  I received Torani in plastic bottles (which I had never seen before) and was not pleased about that.  Not too thrilled about having syrups sit a long time in plastic bottles...yuck! Looks kinda tacky sitting on the bar too...the glass is a nice classic presentation.  Also, can we add some more flavors to the AMAZON stock? You guys seem to be EXTREMELY limited... more flavors, more sales! Makes sense. :)
