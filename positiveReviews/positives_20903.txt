The beef jerky you get at the store, the stuff you see advertised on TV, is nothing compared to this.  I'll never buy that crap again.  I hate the sugary taste of that jerky with its sometimes squishy texture.  This is salty, slightly spicy, sink your teeth into, beefy goodness; just like jerky should be.  My only regret is that it is actually MORE expensive online than in my hometown in PA.  Regardless, the price is a drawback because it is likely this package will disappear quickly, especially with a family, but quite possibly by yourself.  Can't stop at one piece!  Try this jerky and you will judge all others by it.
