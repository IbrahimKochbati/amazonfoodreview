I HAD to have pumpkin for my dogs so I rolled the dice after reading the mixed, but mostly dissatisfied reviews. One third of the cans were very dented. However, none were bulging which is the sign of spoiled food. We are using the dented ones first without issue   on the third of four right now.     I must agree that it looks like a manufacturers "error". The dented cans were hidden in the middle of the case, surrounded by good cans. I would bet my last dollar that Farmers Market Foods is using Amazon to dump what they knew wouldn't sell on the supermarket shelves!     Lastly, I will purchase this item again, dents or no dents and use it unless it's bulging. But it's unnerving knowing that something sneaky is going on at an organic food manufacturer.
