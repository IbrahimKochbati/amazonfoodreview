I have a golden retriever and a golden chow mix who was rescued around age 11.  When the rescue group took him to his in take visit at the vet, they saw that his teeth were in horrible condition and he even lost a tooth on the spot.  When he first came to live with us, his  eath could have killed a gorilla.  I first saw these at his vet and bought a bag to try.  After almost 2 yrs of eating these a few nights a week his  eath is almost normal and his gum disease and teeth have greatly improved. My golden's vet always comments on how great her teeth look for a 10 yr old.  I highly recommend and Amazon does have the best price around.
