The Melitta Tea Filters, 40 Count (Pack of 6) is a wonderful way to create tea bags, spice bags, bath salt bags, or whatever you can think of for a secure and economical system.  I generally place loose tea leaves with herbs and spices inside an unbleached bag, then put it into a teapot.  After adding hot water and waiting for the prescribed time period, I easily remove the bag and have a pot of tea with a minimal amount of residue in the  ew.  Because a filled bag will remain open, I've also created some gifts by attaching a cotton string and little hand decorated tag to the bags.  For the unsealed bag, be careful that the longer end does not hang over the edge of a cup, mug or teapot too much or you'll run the risk of the hot water being absorbed all the way to the upper edge, saturating it and possibly dripping onto the table top.  This happened to me once because I forgot to retrieve the bag and the teapot sat for about a half hour.  The bags can also be used for mulling spices because they are rather large.  I love them!
