I researched all the medium priced good quality foods made of lamb and rice and this was the only product that actually had real lamb as the first product followed by lamb meal, then has rice, carrots, peas, eggs, etc.  Only nonfood items are the required minerals to balance diet and taurine and glucosmine.  More natural than the natural products.  Couldn't ask for more.  Plus comes in 35# bags not just small.  Definitelt recommend.
