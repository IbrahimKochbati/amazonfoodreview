My 60 lb Ridgeback mix is just crazy about these.  By about 10:30p he starts anticipating getting his nighttime treat and he won't leave me alone until I give him his Greenie.  I had a Sheltie mix who didn't care for Greenies but this guy loves 'em.  The vet says they're good for him and we've never experienced any problems digestively speaking so if your four pawed friend is a Greenie fan, too, this is certainly a great price.  Shipping was reasonable, as well ... particularly when ordering several boxes ... and quick.
