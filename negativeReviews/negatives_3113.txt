I was expecting a very high quality coffee but this wasn't quite it. It's a lot stronger than I was expecting due to the serving size printed on the label. It was pretty strong even for me and I like strong coffee.          However, I adjusted the amount of coffee and after a couple of tries I got a nice pot. It has good, but not great flavor. Definitely better than Folgers and the like but not top tier quality.          I recommend this to anyone looking for something a step up from Folgers.
