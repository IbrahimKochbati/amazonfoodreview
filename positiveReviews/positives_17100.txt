My husband and I have two English Jack Russell Terriers under six months old. They're both much more interested in playing than eating, but my vet was adamant that letting them graze all day would make house training significantly more difficult.          The answer has been to make their eating more of a challenge. We've got two oversized Kongs that we'll fill with their  eakfast, but they eat out of the kongs very quickly. In the evening, we needed something that would keep the puppies busy for at least ten minutes, so one of us could get some food in our own mouths before it was time for the pack to go out.          The tug a jug has been great. Both puppies are challenged by it, but not so challenged that they lose interest. There's a perfect balance between work and reward. It holds a lot of food and assorted small treats, it's pretty easy to load, and the beasts haven't figured out how to unscrew the bottom lid.          Some of the pictures for this product on various websites show a rope. Mine actually came with a silicone "rope" that's got a cone shape at the end, which ensures something gets scooped to the neck almost every time they pull on it.          Only downside for my two is that if the food drops below a certain level they lose interest... might be because it's too much work, or it might be because they're full. Either way I have to make sure to dump the leftovers into a kong or a dish at least once a week so they get to eat the food before it gets stale.
