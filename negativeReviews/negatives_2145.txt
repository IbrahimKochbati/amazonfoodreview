Well the creme caramel was on sale so I decided to give it a shot. Plus the fact that each K Cup is individually prepared by Mr. Puck himself. Anyway I quite enjoy these. I never buy flavored ones so overall I'm happy with these but they are definitely not my favorite as I usually buy the bolder ones and these are fairly mild.
