Give Walden Farms credit for making a no carb sauce. It's just a shame it doesn't taste better. Still, I do buy it on occasion and mix it with other tastier sauces to lower the over all carb content. However, the smoke taste is so overwhelming that more than a proportion of 1:4 leaves only the taste of this product in your mouth. This product cannot begin to compare with the taste of the now defunct Kraft's low carb barbecue sauce. Mostly, I make my own low carb sauce from scratch and then just add a bit of this to get the smoke taste, but too much and even the best batch of homemade sauce is ruined. However, if you are on an extreme low carb diet (such as Dr. Bernstein's) this may be the only product that fits.
