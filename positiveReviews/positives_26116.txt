I drank this tea at least 4 days a week during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy.  I wish I did it the entire last trimester and everyday!  I had a 6 hour natural labor and delivery and I only pushed for 15 minutes.  My contractions, even at their most intense, only felt like strong menstrual cramps.  I  ewed my tea double strength and then drank it with lemonade.  Delicious and refreshing!  Even on it's own as a hot tea, it's pretty palatable.  My last trimester was in the summer though, so I always drank it iced.  I also used Evening Primrose Oil suppositories for the last 5 weeks. I really believe that these two factors are the main reason why my labor and delivery was so fast and EASY!
