I love rye. Used to eat the thick rye crisps, but my old teeth just can't handle them anymore.  But I still love some crunch. I also like to eat healthier and these crisp thins are whole grain and have more fiber than many  ead options.          It was getting harder to find them locally so I started getting them here on Amazon so I never have to be w o my favorite cracker! Another bonus   I've had these around the house for years but my kids never showed any interest (just some weird thing mom ate) until I ordered a whole box of them last month. My last daughter still at home thought maybe she should try them since I bought so many. Now she's hooked so she's taking them off to college with her!
