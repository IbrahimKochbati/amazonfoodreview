Switch kiwi berry is very sweet, heavily flavored (almost overpoweringly so), and is lightly carbonated.  My husband said it was good, he'd drink it if it was free, but he wouldn't go out to buy it.  I'd say the same.  It was okay.          I could taste a lot of grape flavoring that lingers along with a touch of apple.  I might even taste a tiny bit of kiwi, but I wouldn't describe the flavor as kiwi berry    more like grape apple.          Switch is too syrupy for me.  I'd prefer something more light and crisp.
