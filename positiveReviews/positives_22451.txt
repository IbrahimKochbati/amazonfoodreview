When I read about Great Northern Popcorn packs, I was skeptical.  I thought it was just another gimmick to get me to buy everything prepackaged at a premium price.  After all, popcorn is all the same, right?  My wife insisted that we try it and I am glad we did.  If you love movie theater popcorn, this will be the closest you will get to making it at home.  I tried others and they just do not compare.  I am not sure if it is the type of oil they use, the type of salt, or the popcorn itself, but this popcorn is second to none.  Also, everything is conveniently measured out for you, so this makes the task of making popcorn so much simpler.  If you try it, you may be surprised how much more popcorn you start to eat!
