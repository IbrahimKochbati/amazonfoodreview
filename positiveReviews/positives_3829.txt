I have a Pit Bull who is a little over a year old. To say he is food motivated is an understatement. However, with that being said he is still picky. He adores these treats and others from Darford. I do much research before I feed treats food to my dog and I could not find any bad information on this company. I promote these treats to family friends that have dogs and their dogs are also hooked. Good wholesome treats.
