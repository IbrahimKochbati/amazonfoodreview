I am one of those people who believes that the predominant taste of any kind of oatmeal should be the oatmeal and not whatever the added flavoring might be.  This Quaker product has a subtle aroma of maple and a hint of sweetness that enhances rather than overwhelms the oatmeal.  I did not find it at all artificial and there was no strange after taste.  My preference is always for longer cooking oats but busy mornings are not always conducive.  The consistency seems better when cooked in the microwave as opposed to pouring boiling water.  For a quick and healthy  eakfast or snack, this is a good option.
