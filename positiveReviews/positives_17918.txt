I've always had a hard time cooking pork chops, Shake & Bake makes it easy, and much lower calorie than my usual method.  This is the sort of thing you keep around for those times when you have no prep time for dinner, yet don't want to feed your family something from the microwave, or a fast food outlet.          I only a couple of pork chops to cook, and my packet said it was good for six, so I took some chicken thighs and coated them along with the pork.  Both tasted very good.  I've also used Shake & Bake BBQ, which is particularly good, for another easy, yet nutritious meal. Shake & Bake is light years ahead of a meal like Hamburger helper as far as nutrition goes, so I like to always have some around for emergencies.  I'll even try it on fish if that's the only meat I happen to have around.          Just the right amount of spices, easy, low cal, everything you want for a fast, and easy meal with the family.
