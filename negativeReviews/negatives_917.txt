I love the product.  But, the bottle design is terrible.  In order to get the last 1 3 or so of the body wash out of the bottle in a timely manner you would normally store the bottle upside down.  With the pointy top that is impossible.  So, you must stand in the shower the try to shake the remaining product the length of the bottle to squirt it out.  This takes much more time that you'll want it to take.  Redesign the bottle with a flat top...please.
