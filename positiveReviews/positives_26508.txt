I love this stuff! We use it all the time on back country trips. It makes a great sauce on on dried pastas alone (or with a little cheese for the gourmet). And it really gives a lot of flavor to bland freeze dried meals. Well worth its weight. I liked it so much that I even use it at home, now thats good camping food!
