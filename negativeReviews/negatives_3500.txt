This is great sencha tea with just a hint of orange.  Being whole leaves rather than just the fines really makes a flavor difference   almost as good as  ewing from bulk leaves and certainly more convenient.  It's too bad it's packaged in what appear to be nylon bags, however.  They do not seem to be readily decomposable   not a good thing since we try to compost and recycle everything we can.
