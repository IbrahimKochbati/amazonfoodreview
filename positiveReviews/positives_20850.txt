Soyrizo is the best thing to ever happen to veganism. I love this stuff so much, I could eat it everyday. My favorite way to prepare it is with oven roasted orange peppers and red onions, on a bed of  ish rice. I have also served it to many meat eaters and they love it, even a Spanish meat eater who still eats the traditional chorizo when he goes home to Spain. YUMMY YUM YUM!!! Thank You Melissa!
