I gave each of my two dogs one of these bones after I picked them up grocery shopping on Monday evening. By early tuesday morning one of my dogs was already throwing up (first time on my white bedding, of course) and everything after her first bowel movement of the day was pretty much water. She had diarrhea on the carpet in MULTIPLE areas while I was at work, and then two more times during the night. She was very lethargic and unable to keep any food down at all. Meanwhile, my other dog has now gotten horrible diarrhea as well. Wednesday morning I made them some boiled eggs, but the one dog that was already throwing up ended up losing her  eakfast a short while later. I gave her white rice with a little bit of chicken stock for dinner that night and she held that down. But sometime during the night, one of the dogs had diarrhea in the house again! Today is Thursday and both dogs are still loose, but (knock on wood)it seems like the vomiting is under control. I called the vet and she said to split an Immodium AD between the two of them and make sure they are drinking plenty of water, which they have been all through this debacle! I will keep my fingers crossed that my carpert will still be clean when I get home. I will never, ever buy another Hartz product again!
