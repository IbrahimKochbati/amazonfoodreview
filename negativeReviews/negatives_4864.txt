I expected to recieve a box of Greenies, which is why I ordered this.  I thought that it would be a nice and neat way to store them.  Instead what I recieved was a bubble bag full of individually wrapped greenies.  Not neat and easily stored at all.  The picture of this item shows a box, but I did not recieve a box of greenies.  I wish I would have just ordered the bag of greenies, with the ziploc top, at least that is easily stored.  My dog also has a sensitive stomach and food allergies, even though greenies don't have corn in them he still pukes them up and doesn't seem interested in them when I try to give him one.  My larger dog has the bigger size and he likes them just fine, so I guess it just depends on your dog.  My main complain about this purchase was that I didn't recieve the box of greenies that is described.  Maybe they ran out and just threw 45 individually wrapped greenies in a bubble mailer, either way, that was disappointing.
