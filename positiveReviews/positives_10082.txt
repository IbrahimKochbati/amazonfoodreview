I stumbled across this in the local hippie dippie overpriced grocery store.  On an impulse, bought it.  This is about a thousand times better than any other almond butter I've ever tried.  Just, I don't know how they did it, tastes bizarrely good.  Possibly the roasting (I've only ever tried raw before).
