This product claims to be a healthy carbonated product. This particular flavor is very heavy on the orange taste (which is to be expected). As a matter of fact, I found it very close to normal orange soda.          Here are the claims of the product from the label:          100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, All Natural, Carbonated, Great Taste and Refreshment.          No Sugar Added, No Corn Syrup, No Preservatives, No Artificial Colors, Gluten Free          Nutritional Information:          Serving Size 8.3 Fl. Oz.

Contains Soy.          Compared to soda, it is healthier in that it doesn't contain added sugars or corn syrup.  But it still has a bunch of calories.  Eating fruits whole is better than juice, but if you want a quick soda like pick me up (and you love orange soda), I would recommend this product over regular soda.          I gave this product 3 stars because I don't think it really is that healthy, but is a decent alternative to regular soda. Also, the taste was ok, nothing remarkable.
