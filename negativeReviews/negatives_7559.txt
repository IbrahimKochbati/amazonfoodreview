They seemed like good raw hide treats and my dogs thought they were pretty good but I don't really like the chlorine like smell. It makes me a bit queazy. I'll probably see if any friends want them. Also, I think it was a bit too much raw hide for my greyhounds. It didn't agree with their stomachs but I think that's an issue with rawhides in general not a particular problem with this product
