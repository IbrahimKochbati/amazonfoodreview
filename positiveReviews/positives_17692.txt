I'm sitting down to a fresh cup of this coffee on a Saturday morning, with a day of good work ahead of me ... drinking it straight up, nothing added ... I have to say, it's pretty rich and flavorful. I am the kind of coffee drinker who doesn't have a "pot a day" or anything like that (and some days I don't have any coffee at all), but I can be considered a "Starbucks snob." I don't really like the plain cheapie supermarket coffee, and I can't  ing myself to choke down instant. I like flavorful coffee. And this Puroast Dark Roast definitely has a lot of flavor. I cannot tell that it's low acid. The typical coffee bitterness (I tend to like it strong) is nice here. Good stuff.
