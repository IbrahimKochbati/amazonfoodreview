The Paris Bistro is my 2nd favorite flavor for Senseo.It's a nice, mild flavor that does well for a late afternoon pickemup. I've enjoyed Senseo in Europe for years on my visits there and waited till finally, it was available here. I get my regular Douwe Egberts coffee at a local European Deli, only one in the Dallas Ft. Worth metroplex that carries it (Henks). I think Americans expect stronger flavors in their coffee than the Europeans. This is mildly flavored, just the right touch.
