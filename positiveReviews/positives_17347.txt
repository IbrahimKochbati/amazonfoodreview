I've had Teavana, Mighty Leaf and many other green Sencha teas, and this one seems the freshest and strongest, but not bitter.  In fact, I can use about 1 2 of this and get the same "oomph" as the other teas.  It REALLY swells up when the water is added.  DELICIOUS. It seems it's less stemmy and more leafy.  Yum.  I'm a green tea lover, and I understand that the Japanese green teas provide more polyphenols than most of the Chinese green teas, and Sencha is one of the best for polyphenols.  Highly recommended!
