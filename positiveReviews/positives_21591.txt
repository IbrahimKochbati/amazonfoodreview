"Real Theater Popcorn" is the easiest way to get the best theater style popcorn at home (especially if you use a whirleypop popper)          But you should be aware that most resellers are selling this stuff for more than you would pay if you just buy direct from the source (and yes it is available online popcornpopper dot com)          $1.10 to $1.60 per pouch depending on the volume you buy is closer to what you should be paying, not $2 and up.
