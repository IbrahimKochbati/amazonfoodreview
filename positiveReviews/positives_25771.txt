I purchased this product after reading the book "Water and Salt" by Dr. Barbara Hendel. I would highly recommend both the book and the Himalayan crystal salt. I make the salt sole solution by disolving the crystals in Figi water and take a teaspoon of the sole in a glass of the Figi artesian well water each morning when I first get out of bed. It wakes me up and makes my body feel alive! Knowledge is power. Read the book. It is very informative as to the benefits of Himalayan salt verses the adverse effects of regular table salt. It is an eye opener!
