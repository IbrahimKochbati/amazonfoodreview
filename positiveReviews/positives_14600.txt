A lot of the other reviewers describe this as basic, sort of low end but decent tea  I think it goes beyond that.  It is strong and it will get bitter if the  ewing temperature is too high  so don't let the water boil!  My husband and I have been drinking this tea for years now, and while we've tried much more expensive teas such as Teavana, we keep coming back to this over and over.  It's our favorite and if it's  ewed just right it has a tangy, smoky complexity that's just unbeatable.  I always get sick of drinking other teas after awhile, but I never, ever get tired of this one.  I drink it throughout the day  it's good hot or iced.  How nice to find it on Amazon in bulk.
