Most of the coffee houses I have been to use Torani syrup(s). And by coffee houses not the K Cup or pump dispenser ones.          Some Torani flavors are better then others but the Hazelnut is one of my favorites.          This is the same high end stuff most coffee houses charge 50 75 cents for.     Just using one bottle of syrup will save you a small fortune.          Some feel it tastes artificial. Just make sure you are not ordering the Sugar free variant, like diet anything, its pretty bad.          And don't compare it to Starbucks. They use 5 or more pumps for what you would call a shot. The coffee is so muddy you would need that     much sugar syrup just to taste the sweet and not much flavor there at all.  If you like, you could get the same effect buy dumping in 5 bags of sugar and one teaspoon of Hazelnut syrup.          The old bottles used to be made of glass but the plastic bottles are easier on the counter when dropped and haven't  oken yet.     Out of the three pack I keep one in the office and one at home all the time. The third is a back up when one runs dry and before the next order can arrive.     A lot of enjoyment for less than a $20 bill.
