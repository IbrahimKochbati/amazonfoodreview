When I first tried this coffee it had a dark, rich, overly strong flavor and color. In fact it was a bit bitter and was definately not a blend I would recommend. I decided to work with the amount used for each pot and ultimately ended up using less than recommended and it turned out to be very good. I like my coffee black but not bitter or unduly strong and usually use Starbuck's or Seattle's Best French Roast. I still prefer them over this  and but would definately buy a bag of this without hesitation. It had a very low acidity content and even after being in a thermos for a number of hours it retained it's flavor and aroma. If you like a strong, rich blend this is the coffee for you. By using the recommended amount you will end up with a strong, rich, flavorful cup of very good coffee. The fine grind is a nice touch and gives one the feeling that all of the ground beans are being used. Definately a vast improvement over the usual store varieties. Give it a try and chance's are it will grow on you.
