This product is shipped so fresh that even if it takes your family months to eat their way through the box, the last 'Bit O Honey' will still be fresher than anything you can buy off the shelf at your local grocer.  These are the large candy bar sized, wrapped in wax paper.  Because they are fresh, they are soft like taffy and so a  eeze to extract from the wax paper, plus have the fullest flavor ever.  Enjoy!!
