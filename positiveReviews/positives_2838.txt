The hot chocolate K Cups don't work like the coffe K Cups.  The coffee K Cups have a screen inside the cup to keep the coffee grounds in the K Cup, it also makes the last drop of liquid to fall into your cup as much coffee as the first drip.  These Cafe Escape Hot Cocoa K Cups don't have a screen the chocolate powder empties out of the K Cup as fast as it can, so that the last amount of water to come out of the Keurig is mostly water and it sits on the top of your cup.  So STIR it before drinking it, otherwise all you taste is the sweetener.  Also these K Cups are made for 8 oz serving size, so use the appropriate cup size for your taste.
