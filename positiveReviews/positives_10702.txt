My faux Beagle mix agrees.  Lucy, the hyper active dog who looks like a beagle but really isn't, accepted and munched on the Newman's treats just like she would any other.  Not sure what else to say about it other than to try to translate her barks.  She sat up and begged like the other treats and head butted my hand asking for another.
