I am amazed at this tea.  I was miserable for 3 1 2 months with a lung infection after quitting smoking.  The prescription medicines I used didn't ease the misery of this at all,  so I ordered this tea hoping for some relief.  After using this tea for one day,  I had dramatic results;  no more sore, irritated lungs;  less congestion;  better mood!!!  Wish I had tried this 3 1 2 months ago.  From now on, this tea will be in my cabinet;  I won't be without it again!  I am stunned that an herbal tea works better than the meds my doctor prescribed.
