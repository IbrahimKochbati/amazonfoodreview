I've found the holy grail of gluten free cookies!! This short ead is simply PERFECT: wonderfully light, crispy, and buttery; flavored just right; not too sweet  and I can eat it despite my numerous dietary restrictions! In fact, it's easy to forget that these wonders are gluten , egg , dairy , corn  and transfat free, because they just taste like a really well made cookie (which they are) and not like some substitute laden excuse for a cookie (which I'm sure you've endured if you have these dietary restrictions). I've also tried Sun Flour Baking Co.'s lemon short ead (also sold here), and it is equally as satisfying. Maybe the "lots of love" listed in the ingredients is what is doing the culinary trick here, but whatever SFBC is doing, I hope they keep it up for a very long time! I am hooked!
