I grew up eating Bisquik, so finding a gluten free version of the quintessential baking mix was wonderful.  However, a 16 ounce box only makes two batches of pancakes!  I would love it if the GF Bisquik could be made in a box size like the conventional Bisquik   especially since my family eats up the pancakes this makes even more than the regular ones.
