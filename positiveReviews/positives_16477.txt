Finding this product on Amazon was like finding an unexpected Christmas present!          Highly recommend by the vet, because of price, I save it for special occasion (always once a day) and, by far, the treat my dog just loves.  True story.  Since I am not able to walk my dog, when the mail lady delivers my mail, she often leaves screen door  open so Scrappy can take off and run for exercize.  She leaves screen door open, whe he has been out running when he should be back, the mail lady hollers "Greenie, greenie" and this 15# of black fur runs full speed ahead, into the patio and the door inside (which I left open.  A good testiment for a fantastic product!!
