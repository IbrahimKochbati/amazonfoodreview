Yum!! These dry roasted walnuts are a really tasty treat which I originally found in stores then couldn't find. I have had them shipped to me several times and never had any bad ones. If you haven't had them before they have the similar seasonings to what is on dry roasted peanuts. Why anyone would buy them without reading the ingredients then complain about them is wacky, but if you don't like what is on doritos and snacks like that then you may not like these. These are one of my favorite snacks because I love the lightly crunchy, salty taste and walnuts are good for us!!
