Our dogs love Barksters (all varieties), so when my friend needed to potty train her new rescue dog I recommended them to her.  They worked like a charm!  Since they only have 12 calories and can be  oken into smaller bits, she could give a piece every time the dog went out.  It's hard to describe their texture.  They are puffed and crispy, but not fried.  They are crinkly like a potato chip but much thicker.  The best part is that they are all natural...oh, and made in America!
