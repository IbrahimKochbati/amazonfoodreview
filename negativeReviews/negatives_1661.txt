When I saw the Switch Orange Tangerine was available, I knew I had to try it.  I liked the Kiwi Strawberry quite well (better than some other reviewers did, it seems), so I was sure I would enjoy this one just as much.          The initial taste of this Orange Tangerine carbonated juice is rather tart, and the carbonation just seems to make it more tart.  The aftertaste is rather pleasant, so if the aftertaste is what you're looking for in a drink, this is the drink for you.  My wife thought it tasted a bit like champagne, if that's any indication of what to expect from this drink.          The flavor is different, and not at all what I expected.  Not very refreshing at all.  I would buy the Kiwi Berry drink, but I think I'll take a pass on the Orange Tangerine in the future.
