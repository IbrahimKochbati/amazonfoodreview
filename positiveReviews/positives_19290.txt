I am on weight watchers and these noodles allow me to have pasta for half the points!  I like them.  If you are picky about your pasta these may not be for you, they are just a little different.  They don't have the different shapes of pasta and to me the texture is "al dente"  I like them though and once I finish my six bags I will be buying them again.
