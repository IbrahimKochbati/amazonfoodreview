I did a research project on different coffees to find one I really liked to wake up to in the morning.  This is it!     The Hazelnut Maxwell House.  It beat out all the other  ands, including the expensive ones...They don't make it in bigger than 11.5 oz. cans, unfortunately, so I have to buy it in bulk.
