Based on the reviews I read here I was looking forward to writing my own positive review, but I made two batches in accordance with the instructions on the bag and the flavor was mediocore at best.  I did not care much for the rice in the chili either and talk about some serious flatulence! I'm just saying!  I have made my chili homemade for a number of years so in all fairness perhaps I was expecting too much from a pre mix 25 minute chili but even after 6 hours no big flavor imporvements.  I won't be making another purchase.  I'll give the remaining bags to someone in my neighborhood who wants or is willing to try this product.
