I got this from my mother and love it! Named him Harold and though I don't have any flies to give him, he is growing well. You have to be diligent and make sure your trim any heads that start to turn black, and not let the plant dry out, but isn't that much work. I can't wait to get a bell jar for him and keep him in my windowsill.
