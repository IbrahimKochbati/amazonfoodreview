I have been a Subscribe and Save customer for a few years.  Amazon has recently changed their packaging of this item.  For the second order in a row, I've received the case with a label on it.  There's no bubble wrap or larger box around it at all.  So what I have received is going to essentially be six boxes of cracker crumbs.  I'll be returning the order and canceling my subscription now.  I'd rather pay a higher price for a box of useable crackers than get a case of crumbs.
