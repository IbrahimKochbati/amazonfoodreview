I have tased a variety of molasses  ands over the years , and Brer Rabit is definitely the best . I use it to make BBQ sauce and baked beans. For ginger ead cookies and other dishes, I prefer the Dark version of Brer Rabbit , rather then the Bladkstrap . My dog also loves Blackstrap Brer Rabbit molasses. The only way she will eat dry dog food is if it has 1 tablespoon of molasses stirred in.
