I love the mix of flavors in this cookie.  The cookies are very moist and they are also very filling. The only thing I didn't like about these is the strong nutmeg taste.  Unfortunately, nutmeg is not my favorite spice.  I would have enjoyed more raisins but my kids are glad there aren't that many.  I love the fact that I can keep these handy for mornings when we are running late and for when we take trips.  They are easy to freeze and seem to keep rather well in the freezer.
