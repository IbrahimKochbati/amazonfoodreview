My parents love this stuff (and they're actually Asians, so that speaks volumes).  It's such an easy quick convenient food to stock up for them for whenever they drop in to visit me and I haven't nothing but "white people" food lying around.  But I'm sure that it'll go a long way toward feeding the starving college student types as well.  I think that it's a perfect combination of flavor for price.  But I have to admit that I would not purchase this item at Amazon as it is far more affordable if you buy from an Asian grocery.          If you found this review helpful, please let me know.
