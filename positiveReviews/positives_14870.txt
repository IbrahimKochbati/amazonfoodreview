This is the most delicious Earl Grey tea I have ever tasted. The aroma is wonderful, and the amount of bergamot in this blend is perfect. I use about one and one half tablespoons in my 17 ounce tea press and steep for 4 minutes. You can use less or more tea, to taste. I love the fact that I can re steep the same tea leaves a second time, and enjoy another pot of tea that is as delicious as the first. If you are already an Earl Grey fan, I promise you will not be disappointed. If you have never tried Earl Grey, why not start at the top? Enjoy!
