I purchased this item and then saw it for $20 less in a big retail store.  When I contacted Amazon I was told that they couldn't do anything for me and the price I paid was firm.  I wrote them and told them I was going to return the item and buy it where I had seen it for much cheaper and they just didn't care.  When I asked how much my refund was going to be they told me approximately $3.00 more than what they had credited me for.  I don't like to be deceived and I thought you get the best prices with Amazon, but that is not true at all.  Keep checking other places before you purchase from Amazon and there Customer Service stinks in my opinion.  Furthermore, I received my item from the other place and I love it!
