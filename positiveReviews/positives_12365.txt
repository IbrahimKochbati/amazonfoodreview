There's a reason why this noodle soup won the Chefs Best Awards, because it's just good, perfect flavor, perfect noodles and perfect amount of spiciness.          Instructions are easy, you know the drill, add water and microwave, it doesn't get any easier than that.          bottom line is, I love these noodles and highly recommend them.
