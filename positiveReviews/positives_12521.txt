I typically prefer espresso when I drink coffee beverages. However, when my in laws bought me the Keurig I decided to start drinking regular coffee. I enjoy Breakfast Blend because it is a rich, smooth coffee without being too acidic. I can make iced coffee out of it and it doesn't get too watered down or lose it's flavor (assuming I wait about 15 minutes after  ewing for the coffee to cool before pouring it over ice).
