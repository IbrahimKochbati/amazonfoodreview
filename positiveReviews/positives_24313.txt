Big Train Vanilla Chai is absoulutly amazing. I never hesitate when it comes to buying this for my wife and I. As my description says, it is better than Starbuck's Vanilla chai by a long shot. I am planning to get a coffee expresso machine that also has a steamer built on becuase that is how our local coffee shop makes this with milk, and that is how it taste's the best. This is a great value as well! this last us for a very long time, and the money is well worth it, considering it cost you $3 $5 for a single cup of this at your local shop. it taste great, and for the coffee shop fell, just add some ready whip or Zip Whip to the top and your good to go. Great Taste, Great value!
