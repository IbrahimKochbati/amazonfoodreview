The coffee had a nice bold, flavor, but the foil on the cups were not properly sealed, and I mean all of the cups. Every  ewing left grounds in the cup and sometimes made a complete mess because the water wasn't going through the  ew tip.  The flavor of the coffee was not enough to warrant a better rating because we get this product for convenience and easy clean up, as much as for the flavor.
