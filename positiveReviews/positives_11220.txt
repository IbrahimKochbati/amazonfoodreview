i have tried 3 pamela's products:  the  ownie mix, the pancake mix and the  ead mix.  first the  ownies    best i've ever tasted   i'm addicted to these things!  i tried doing the applesauce substituted for oil and i don't recommend that   the  ownies were too dry.  the oil recipe is definitely the best    also substituting espresso for water was yummy    the pancake mix is really good too.  i've made the pancakes and the waffles   the waffles are the best i've ever tasted, with or without gluten.  my co worker used the pancake mix as a substitute in a regular recipe that called for all purpose flour and said it worked great.  finally, the  ead   my friend made me a loaf of  ead in her  ead machine and it was pretty good   not dry like most gluten free products.  the only thing was that when i tried to toast it, the  ead remains moist   it won't toast!  weird...anyway, i recommend all three products and buying them off amazon will save you $1.50   $2.00 off the package price at the supermarket!  A++++ on these products!          karissa, texas
