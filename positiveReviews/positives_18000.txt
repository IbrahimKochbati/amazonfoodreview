While you can make your own chai tea, it does take some work to gather all the spices and then steep them in milk. The Oregon Chai tea mixes are rather easy to use. You can either make regular tea and add the packet like you would milk and spices or you can serve this with hot milk or even just water.          If you are looking for a very creamy version, you can make a 16 ounce cup of hot water in the microwave and then add one packet of Oregon Chai Tea Mix, 1 packet of hot chocolate and 2 Constant Comment tea bags. That is my favorite combination so far.          While the tea bags are for an 8 ounce cup, I make a much larger cup of tea, so this is perfect to mix with a tea bag and more powdered milk.          Ingredients: Sugar, dried whole milk, dried nonfat milk, natural flavors, dried honey, tapioca maltodextrin, decaffeinated dried black tea and salt. Yes, salt!          Each packet is 100 calories.          Also look for Ready to drink individual servings and liquid concentrates where you just add milk.          If you are just using a packet of this mix and 8 ounces of water, you might still want to add some powdered milk to make it extra creamy. Whipped cream and nutmeg also make the drink more delicious.          ~The Rebecca Review
