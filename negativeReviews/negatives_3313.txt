Normally when UPS drives up, my dog (mixed poodle, 20lb), goes nuts because he knows there's a good chance a package of goodies is being delivered.  If I tell him he's got a package, he'll happily and eagerly  open it himself.  This time, after a few sniffs, he couldn't care less.  He lost interest in the package right away.  I took two treats out for him and he just looked at them and walked away.  To be fair, he IS pretty picky.  Like all treats, some dogs will like them, some won't.
