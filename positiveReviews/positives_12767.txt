My family loves this oatmeal... it is tasty and it is healthy.... Of course oatmeal is good, but Kashi does it a step further with less sugar and an amazing taste.  We tried everywhere to find this locally, and it is not easy... many stores carry other Koshi products, but not this... but Amazon had the item, shipped inexpensively and no driving around to 5 stores to see what is in stock.          My daughter just loves this and would highly recommend it... why not get something that tastes really good and is good for you!!
