My boston loves this toy!  It keeps her busy for quite a while and she's a heavy chewer, so it held up... for a while.  Like others, she has managed to chew her way through the rubber rope that comes out the end, but only a little at a time.  I keep a good eye on it and when it looks like she's about to get another piece off, I just cut that little bit off with a pair of scissors.  But the fact that it can be cut with scissors might give you a clue as to the constitution of the rubber rope.  Also, the plastic jug is fairly durable, but in her frustration to get at the kibble inside, Roxy has done a little damage to the plastic, making it hard to screw the lid back on straight.  So the good news is, great concept for a little dog (it's a small toy, don't give it to a lab, that's not what it was meant for), but maybe not as indestructable as they might think.  I'll buy another one, mainly because Roxy went into hysterics when I tried to hide it from her for a few days.  Clearly her favorite of all toys!  Doesn't want to eat out of her dish anymore!
