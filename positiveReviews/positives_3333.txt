We've been using Pamela's for making pancakes and waffles, but I saw Bisquick and grabbed a box to try it.  It made the absolute BEST waffles we'd ever had   gluten free or not!  Pamela's has you separate the egg yolk from the egg white and made making our Saturday morning waffles tedious.  I added two packets of Splenda to Bisquick's batter and everyone (including my super picky kid) came back for seconds.  I was a little worried because the batter seemed a bit gritty, but they baked up very smooth and fluffy.  My husband made fried chicken from the mix as well.  We didn't have any left overs of that, either.          Way to go, Bisquick!
