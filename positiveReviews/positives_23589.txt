These cheese straws are very yummy. Unfortunately, I felt that they were making me gain weight as part of my low carb diet. I gained three pounds in the week that I bought them eating maybe a couple of handfuls a day. So, while very delicious, they may not work well for my diet.          Update: I see that the product Amazon took me to write this review was not exactly the product I ordered. I ordered the low carb tin.
