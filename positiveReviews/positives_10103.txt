I've tried a lot of KCups, looking for the fresh, dark, really rich espresso roast flavor that I love; all of them seemed weak and or flatly bitter compared to my dark beans by the pound favorites. I'm almost a coffee snob and only bought the Keurig because my mornings are just too rushed, sort of a shocking decision. I love the convenience of the machine, but it was like grabbing a cup at the convenience store taste wise   just the required morning medication, eh.          So I was really, really surprised and delighted when I discovered this one. I hear they pack the Barista blends with more coffee   that does seem to be the case, they're plump little cuppies.     And wow, a real espresso taste, zero acidity, darkly fruity and full bodied, and for once not tasting watered down. If you don't like espresso you won't like it, especially neat. But with half and half and sugar this one's really wonderful, too.  Love it, love it.
