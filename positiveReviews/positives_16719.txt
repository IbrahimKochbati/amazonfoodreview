I use this particular type of agave nectar as it is recommended in my almond flour cookbook.  This size works perfectly for me.  It's not too heavy to pour a simple 1 2 cup of product and the price is way better from Amazon than from my local health food store.  This is a win win!!  Thanks Amazon for another amazing deal.
