We have made friends recently with an abandoned tabby cat we call Mr. Whiskers. I am sure he would be grateful for most anything on a plate at this stage, still he appears to be a gentleman of discernment. And at first whiff of Petite Cuisine, he settled down to some serious feeding and joyously licked his whiskers afterwards.          This is an obviously high end cat food and looks and smells good enough for humans. (Let us hope in this economy it does not come to that.) As long as I can afford it I will continue feeding him this  and. I have seen pets fed cheap food develop terrible tumors on their poor little bodies, so I am committed to serving him the best I can find   afford.          Bottom line: if you care about your pet and can afford it I highly reccommend this  and. I was quite impressed by the quality.
