Freeze dried sweet corn is so delicious!  I first found it easily in the local markets.  Now it's no where to be found locally and I don't know why no one is carrying this delicious item?!     So it's online purchasing and I found it on Amazon.com.  Harmony House Foods offered one of the better prices for the value.  It arrived in a timely manner and it's delicious.
