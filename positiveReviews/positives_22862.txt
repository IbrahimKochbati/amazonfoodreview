Working odd hours I'm always looking for the latest greatest energy drink that doesn't make me crash and actually does it's job.  I'm not a coffee drinker so these energy drinks are my only saving grace.  Having had the others out there, I loved the increased alertness I had after drinking Energy 2000 and it seems to last for over six hours.  It makes sense since according to the label it has 25% more "energy" than it's counterpart energy shot.  So it lasts longer AND it costs less?  Count me in!
