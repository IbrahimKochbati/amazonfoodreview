First time I've tried these was in Miami.  A friend gave them to me to try and I've loved them ever since.  Then I found them by accident at Target, in the macaroni aisle?? They should be in the peanuts aisle.  The price is great, if you eat too many of these in a day, you'll need to take some beano pills!!  Great stuff, they also kill the morning  eath!
