I love this tea      I have been trying Davidson's teas     I like just plain unflavored teas    This is great value too    It has a smooth taste    It makes a great iced too     This tea has a clean simple taste to it      I have tried other types of Assam Banaspaty Estate Tea and this has a very good taste to it      I have hot water  ewer that gets the perfect temp and it helps tea  ew correctly      If you love loose tea I would invest in hot water  ewer     because it does make a difference in taste of the teas    there is no guess work on temp    I am really enjoying these teas from Davidson's  !  I highly recommend to a friend
