These are fun little shapes for kids.  We love them and they work great for our GFCF diet, however, they do fall apart quite easily   and that's with cooking them just until done.  Unlike traditional pasta, they are not the greatest when they are "leftovers" because they lose a lot of moisture and harden.  Overall, a pretty good product and we are happy to have them so that we don't miss out on pasta simply because we do not eat gluten.
