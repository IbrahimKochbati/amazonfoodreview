Really enjoy this mix, very tasty and full of nutrition.  I'm not a big health food fan myself, but I really took to these!  They are great on salads, in pita sandwiches, and I've even tossed them in with my fruits and veggies in my juicer.  Great price and a good product.  The product arrived on time with minimal packaging, a major bonus in my book.  I give it 4 stars only because I encountered a few "duds" (seeds that didn't sprout)...but this could also be because I'm knew to sprouting.
