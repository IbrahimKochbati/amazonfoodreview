This was my first time ordering something from the Vine that I could not really review myself.  And our dog, Lucky, can't speak...English.  I do, however, understand a little Dog speak.  When first presented with one of Newman's Own Lamb and Barley NZ Style Dog Treats, he snarfed it down just as expected, just as he does with all treats.  But the next day, as he  saw me go for the bag a second time   he went ballistic.  When I gave him the treat, he retreated into the den with it as if it were a bone.  Same thing happened the third time. Conclusion:  Lucky says "Big Yum! to Newman's Treats.          JMT
