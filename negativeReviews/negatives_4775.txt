I bought the packs after a trip to NYC    and due to the long wait    could not get into the restaurant.  It was pretty bad.  The chocolate had a weird after taste.  I would have been better off making a chocolate milk shake.  In order to use up all of the packs, I am going to try to add coffee to the milk to try to mask that funny taste.
