These are definitely a healthier alternative than your standard potato chip   each bag (roughly 20 silver dollar sized chips) has only three grams of fat and 100 calories. They are also kosher, gluten free and vegan.          Instead of baking the flavor into the chip, Popchips add seasoning once the chips are "popped" (as opposed to fried or baked). This, however, is also the cause of my problem with the chips. I found the flavor to be wildly inconsisent from bag to bag, and sometimes from chip to chip within the same bag. One bag's lime flavor was so overpowering I almost gagged, while the next was a nice, uneventful snack. The lime flavor is also much, much more noticeable than the chili flavor.          As a healthy alternative to potato chips, these are a viable option, but keep a glass of water handy   with the almost randomized flavor intensity, you're not going to know how intense the lime flavor is going to be until you open the bag.
