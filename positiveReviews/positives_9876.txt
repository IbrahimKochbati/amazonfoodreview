As a self proclaimed pizza expert, originating from St. Louis, then residing in Chicago, and sampling pizza around the nation, at some of the most prized pizza joints in the country, as well as international attempts...I began making my own pizza's again..this time using Pastorelli's own pizza crusts (thin, crispy style) and the different varieties of Pastorelli's sauces.  The full flavor and balance of spices in this stuff is fabulous enough to literally 'eat if from the can'.  Seriously.  What amazed me is that I have asked dozens of pizza shop owners, and new restaurant 'attempts' at pizza recipes, what sauce they use....many going with food service items from wholesalers (Pastorelli DOES sell food service quantities).  Bland is the word with many sauces, and some too strong in their spices.  This family owned business has this science and art nailed down, and the quality of all of Pastorelli products is premium, without a high price tag.  If you want to really enjoy the best home made pizza, then Pastorelli's pizza sauces are the ONLY way to go.  Buy a can, jar (squeeze), and grab some of their new crusts, and then make up your own recipes and see for yourself.  The sauce 'carries' the pizza.  Their pasta sauces are amazing, yet not easy to find....hopefully their distribution will expand.  Personally, I love Amazon....so I'm set.  Thank you Rick Pastorelli for continuing the best in tomatoes.....   "
