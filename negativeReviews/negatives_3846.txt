The can is pretty, a vi ant carnation pink. But although the can purports to contain 100% juice, a quick inspection reveals that apple and grape, not kiwi and berry (strawberry, raspberry) get top billing on the ingredients list.  Unsurprisingly, the flavor seems a little muddled, a little tangy, awfully sweet.  One family member described it as bubble gummy, another noted that it tasted metallic but "maybe in a glass bottle it would taste okay."          As other reviewers have pointed out, this product is heavy on fruit sugars, though I appreciate the absence of that cloying corn syrup sweetener that contaminates so many popular soft drinks.  There is nothing particularly nutritious about Switch, but maybe some parents (presumably the target market) won't be able to figure that out.          It's not the worst carbonated beverage I've ever tried, but it's nowhere near the best, nor does it have the fresh wholesome flavor that we spoiled consumers expect from our fruit juices.  I'll stick with water.
