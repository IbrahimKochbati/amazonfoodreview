We've tried Newman's Own dog treats before, and our 26 lb. French Bulldog loves them. When I saw this new flavor (at least new to us), I decided to give it a try.          I wasn't expecting the treat to be so big, but that was my fault for not reading the package. My dog was a bit overwhelmed by the size at first, but quickly grew to love the treat. Of course, I never sampled the product myself, but I can only assume from my dog's reaction that both the flavor and texture are good. I would definitely purchase these treats for him again.
