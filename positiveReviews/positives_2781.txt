So this stuff is a must have for making true pizza napoletana.  I'm really thrilled that it is so accessible here in the USA.  This flour makes the most silky smooth dough I've ever had the pleasure of getting sticky with, and it has a different (better for pizza) taste than the all purpose store  and flour.  Sure It costs a little more, it's coming from Italy, but given that you can make about 6 pizzas per bag ... who's counting?  Get this stuff, some D.O.P. tomatoes, grow some basil, and make some Mozarella (okay, I admit, haven't done this one ... yet) but given the first couple items there and you're well on your way to the origins of pizza in Naples, Italy. Is it worth it??? I say Si!!! Mangia!!! (And Taylor's Market always comes through for my home shipments!... Cheers!)
