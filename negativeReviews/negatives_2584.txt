We fed this to our bulldog when she was a puppy, and at first she did wonderful. Then the corn and preservatives took their toll.... She was itching and had a chronic ear infection and her face had a terrible yeasty smell ALL the time. She licked her paws constantly and scratched her face raw on any surface she could find. Then she started vomiting. We HAD to change her food. Now she eats a fully carnivorous raw diet and is thriving! No more itching, no more ear infections, no more yeast, no more paw licking.
