I went to Egypt and had hibiscus tea in Nubia...and all I could find at WalMart was this blended Tazo passion tea!  It was good, mind you, but not pure hibiscus by any stretch of the imagination.  I was very happy to find this tea (and so cheap, too).  Tastes just like it did in Nubia.  I mean, it's a one ingredient thing, so it's kind of hard to screw up.  But for the record: this stuff is exactly as described.  I am pleased.
