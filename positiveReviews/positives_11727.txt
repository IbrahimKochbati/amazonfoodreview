Because they are both gluten free and wheat free, these soft, chewy bars seem to be trying to masquerade as health food.  In truth, however, these "bars" are barely distinguishable from cookies  perhaps a slightly more wholesome version, as they are relatively low in sugar (8 grams) and filled with other beneficial ingredients (e.g., 180 mg Omega 3s, 9 grams of whole grains, and 2 grams each of fiber protein).          BUT, being a cookie bar isn't necessarily a bad thing!  Although each bar is a bit high in calories fat (180 9 grams), especially for the smallish size, the individual packaging of the bars assists with portion control.  And perhaps more importantly, the taste of these bars is excellent!  As promised, they are moist and chewy, very similar to a cookie that you would purchase from a bakery (or even something homemade).  Biting into the bar, you can taste flakes of coconut, pieces of nut, and small bits of chocolate.  Overall, these were definitely a yummy treat!          I suspect that these bars will mainly appeal to those looking for gluten free snacks, but others will enjoy this product as well.
