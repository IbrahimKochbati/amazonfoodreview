Ok, let's be honest.  There was no doubt in my mind that Harry, Pepper, and Honey would love these treats.  Dixie, on the other hand... well, I wasn't sure.          Dixie is right there with everyone else when the treat bag is opened, but when she gets her treat, more often than not she goes back to her spot, lies down with the treat in front of her, and she guards it for a while.  Later we'll find it under the furniture or half buried in the yard.  The really yummy treats (hot dogs, anyone?) are gulped on the spot, but everything else is hoarded for, I guess, the day we forget to feed her.          But not these.  Dixie was right there in the lineup, waiting for her treat.  Everyone got one, and there was much loud crunching to be heard.  A couple of minutes later, everyone was back, doing the cookie dance, trying to convince me that I'd somehow forgotten them, and Dixie was right there with them.  The second cookie was crunched as quickly (and as loudly) as the first.          This was shortly after dinner, so I know it wasn't starvation that drove her to it.          Honey is the smallest, at about 50 pounds, so these are big dogs, and a whole, un oken treat was the right size for them.  I'd guess that  eaking the treat at the halfway mark would make them the right size for a medium sized dog.  Toy  eed owners might want to get out the hammer.          These are very hard treats, so they're probably good for the teeth.  They left quite a few crumbs when crunched, but the crumbs were gone in seconds.  The package was hard, too... you should be able to tear it at the notch, but mine was still sealed when I tore off the top.  You might want to have scissors handy.          Currently the package promises "Made with organic barley   no wheat   no corn".  The ingredients are "Organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic apples, organic palm oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols, a source of vitamin E), organic molasses."  Hey, these dogs eat better than I do!          Guaranteed analysis:          Crude protein: 9.0% min.     Crude fat: 4.0% min.     Crude fiber: 4.0% max.     Moisture: 11% max.          Of course all that information may change, but since it's not in the description right now I thought I'd include it.          Seems like good ingredients, might be good for dogs with food allergies, and they sure are popular here.  They're a little out of my price range, but that's understandable given the organic ingredients and lack of wheat, corn, and meat by products.  Eight paws up here!
