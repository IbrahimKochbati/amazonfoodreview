I bought these on special when they were only about $13 for 24 .8 oz bags.  It's an absolutely wonderful deal.  But unfortunately I don't like them... at all!  I've tried Salt & Pepper, Original, BBQ, Salt & Vinegar; but these are just awful!  I've loved all the other flavors and I like Sour Cream & Onion chips normally, so I'm not sure why I dislike these so much.  I'm hoping I can somehow return them.
