I loved Mounds Bars as a kid decades ago.  Every few years now, I succumb to my desire for one and always am disappointed.  I suspect that the recipe has changed to lots of ingredients and preservatives  that were not used way back in my kid days.  Anyway, what I am getting to is that these Oskri bars taste really similar to what I remember.  They are delicious, and they are surprisingly satisfying although they are fairly small.  I like them a lot!
