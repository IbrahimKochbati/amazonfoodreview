We had ordered some of these pouches after trying some other Happy Baby products that my baby loved. These had very little flavor and my baby tried a couple bites and then started to fight me. She even gagged in the process. Bummed that I had ordered a whole box, we tried again to no avail. Next, we  tried to feed it to the cat because she seemed interested when I opened the pouches. My cat won't even eat it. I recommend getting a small quantity to see if your baby likes it before ordering a whole box.
