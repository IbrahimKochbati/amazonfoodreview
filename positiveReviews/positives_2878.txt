This is without doubt the finest sweet chilli [sic] sauce in the world.  I use it with hot or cold dishes, including chicken, venison or roast beasts.  It is superb seasoning for a plain rice, quinoa, bulghour or cous cous.  Sweet, hot and authentic.  I buy 2 of the larger bottles at a time, refrigerate the open one and save the back up as insurance.  Could not run my varied menus without this great red elixir!
