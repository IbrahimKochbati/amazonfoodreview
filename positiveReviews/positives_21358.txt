These are the GIANT Smarties candy rolls.  I was not reading carefully and thought these were the smaller rolls. However, these work very well.  You can hand them out as treats using just one roll instead of three or four smaller rolls.          The price was good compared to others advertised on Amazon.  I would make this purchase again.  Check on saving shipping by ordering more than one box at a time.  That makes it an even better bargain.
