If you eat one of these bars you will want to eat the whole box!  I am very impressed with these grain bars as I am with most of Pamela's Products.  They are very tasty.  In the sample I received the bars were very balanced with chocolate and coconut flavors.  The grains are soft and chewy, speckled with seeds that give a faint crunch.  They are sweetened just enough.  I find them most welcome to my gluten free life, as I've never had a gluten free grain bar that was any good.          I am not thrilled that they are sweetened with agave.  Based on reading I've done I just don't find that it's saving me much in the way of health or natural foods.  It's also still packs a decent whop on the glycemic index, if you have to be careful about blood sugar.  As well, these bars had almonds and potential traces of dairy.  So if you need to steer 100% clear of such these may not work for you.  They are not protein bars, so they wouldn't be a good meal replacement, or even a healthy snack if you are monitoring carbs.  They are, however, great for when you just need something a little sweet.          If they are priced in the store as they are on Amazon, they are the same as and or less than other traditional grain bars and gluten free snacks.  I'd also like to point out that the item description says there are 6 in a box.  There are 5, as the box clearly states.  I would most definitely get them again, and I'm curious about trying the other flavors.
