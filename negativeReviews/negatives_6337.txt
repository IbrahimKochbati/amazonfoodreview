I love this rice!  It truly is "tender and delicious" as stated on the package.  Keep in mind that even though it is a product of California, this is a Japanese style  own rice, thus more polished than American style  own rice.          Unfortunately, a few months after posting this review I have had some  bad batches of this rice, regardless of the place of purchase (I tried a nearby Japanese food store as well as a mail order Korean store).  I also had that experience when buying it already cooked (as part of the bento lunches at a nearby Japanese cafe). It is as if the rice is on its way to being rancid.  If anyone knows what the problem is and how to recognize it before I buy a pack, please let me know because when it is good, it is outstanding.
