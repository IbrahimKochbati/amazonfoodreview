There are very few things that are even remotely as versatile as Cavender's.  Fantastic on chicken, beef and pork.  I have never tried it on fish, but I'm sure it would be great there too...  I try to keep at least two or three cans on hand at all times so I never run out, and when I'm feeling generous I even give them away to friends.
