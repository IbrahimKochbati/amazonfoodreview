At my house, we call it Hot Vanilla.  This is the BEST hot chocolate type drink I've ever tasted.  I am a lifelong chocoholic, but now I order Stephen's French Vanilla by the case because all the others pale in comparison, and I just don't want them anymore.  You won't regret springing for a case of it.  Makes a terrific gift too. Mmmmmmm......
