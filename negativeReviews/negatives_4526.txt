This used to be a hearty and great meal for my twin girls who have both loved it since they were 9 months old but they recently changed the recipe and it is watery and disgusting now. Very disappointed. And it seems that amazon does not allow you to complain directly to Happy Baby or return the product even though it has changed. seems unfair.
