Works great for my GSD with one exception. I had to remove the rubber rope from the bottle. Otherwise it would be impossible to get the food out!! Maybe this is because his food is larger I really dont know however, with the rope gone he stays active until all the food is out. Good buy since I purchased it from target at the clearanced price of 3 dollars!
