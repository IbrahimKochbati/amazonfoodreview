If you want a rich, smooth tasting, strong, but not bitter cup of coffee, I highly recommend this product.  It is not as dark as I normally buy, but it stands up quite well using my espresso machine (an inexpensive non pump).  I was surprised at the crema it produced.  In short, it's everything I look for in a delicious cup of coffee.
