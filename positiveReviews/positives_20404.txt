Dr Sears knows babies, and his recommendation of this product went a long way in our decision to purchase it.  At first we were making our own rice cereal out of organic ground  own rice, but of course couldn't add the DHA and probiotics.  Our baby gets those through  eastmilk, but it is nice to be able to supplement with the cereal.          It is very easy to mix and use, and tastes good.  Much easier than making your own, and way better than any of the Gerber products.  I'd recommend any of the HappyBellies products.
