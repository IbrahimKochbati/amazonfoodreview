I bought this in the large size to keep my 7 month old mini aussie occupied.  It took her a little bit of time to figure out that when she plays with it   she gets TREATS!!! Now, she LOVES it! The picture appears to have an actual rope coming from the bottle   it's actually made from some sort of durable rubber, which I think works better. Anyways, I fill the bottle up with a few treats and some of her kibble mixed in when I leave the house in the morning   it keeps her busy for awhile. I HIGHLY recommend this for any dog owner.
