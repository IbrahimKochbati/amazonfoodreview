I love Sky Blue sodas. And when I saw the Creamy Root Beer, as someone who loves all root beer, I ordered a case. Got it today, chilled a six pack for a few hours. Then poured one in a glass. Tasted it. Almost vomited. And then proceeded to dump them all down the drain. Horrible, horrible taste. I don't get how this can taste so bad, and all the others are so so good.
