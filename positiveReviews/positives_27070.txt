I Love love Yogi Teas! I drink them all the time, almost everyday to prevent any ailments. I usually buy them separately, but what I do not understand is, why or how come they don't tell us what's in the Sampler Bag or bags!? Besides the Cold Sampler descriptor on the box, nowhere on the page do they  eak down what else is part of the "COLD SAMPLER" box. That's rather frustrating to me! I need more info in order to feel good about what I'm buying!
