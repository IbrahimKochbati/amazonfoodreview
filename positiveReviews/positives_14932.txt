About 3 months ago I purchased a few of these packets and made a meal for 10 people. Not only did they rave about the dinner, the next day they were all out at our local supermarkets to get some of these packets, and much to all of our dismay, we were told the stores were no longer carrying them.     I contaced Lawry's Corporate office and they advised me to ask the Store Mgr. to carry this product again, but they informed me that stores change products and add new one to their shelves once in a while, and to check on Amazon, (my favorite sight, I might add), so I did, and here it is. Can't wait to be notified its available.     This is one of those meals that is not only easy and quick but Gourmet tasting. People will think you've spend hours making it....
