Disappointed in these on flavor or make that lack of flavor.  They taste like a cereal bar to me.  Nice and soft, just not much taste.  I think you would be better off with the lower cost oatmeal cookies at the bakery.  The only advantage to these is the convenience of individual wrapping, but that is what plastic baggies are for.  Sorry, these strike out as being tasty.  There are better cookies at your store bakery department.
