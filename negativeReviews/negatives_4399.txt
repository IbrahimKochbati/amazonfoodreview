I was probably expecting that real mincemeat pie taste I got many years ago from my great grandmother's homemade mincemeat pies.  This is not it.  While it doesn't taste bad, there is some off flavor, almost like you can taste vinegar in it.  And one of the spices is overwhelming.  I won't throw them out, but I would never purchase them again.
