A reliable soft oatmeal cookie among  and name manufactured choices, as compared to homemade. I review, thus, on what it is, a 5 star, but my wife's oatmeal cookies are 6 star, of course. Being older, diet conscious, and needing to watch nutrition labels due to health conditions, I found this cookie to compare favorably with another  and recommended by my doctor & nutritionist. Honest! The big difference is the other had a serving size of 30g while this individually packaged cookie is 42g. Quaker oatmeal cookies had 3 ½ inch diameter, full ½ inch thick, with a shelf life of 4 months after arrival into my house. Too good to keep shelved that long. Grandkids approved.          Comparing nutrition on equal gram basis, the oatmeal was fractionally more on calories & fat, but considerably better on sodium and fiber (things important on my diet.) Ideal for moms packing lunches, or office people needing a snack, I'd recommend this since the cookie is large enough to halve, making 2 snacks, or use as is. Being less than a chocoholic, the bits of chocolate were just enough. Being a giant nut fan, the ample almonds won me over. Almonds are the healthiest nut according to my nutritionist. Being a 64 year old Quaker Oatmeal fan may have helped, as I enjoy oatmeal in meatloaf,  ead, cookies, pie crust, corn ead, biscuits, granola, and any form except hot  eakfast.          I will be trying another Quaker oatmeal cookie flavor.
