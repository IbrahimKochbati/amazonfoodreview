No matter how wholesome a snack may be, it's worthless unless the girls approve. In this case they both give the Science Diet Jerky Treats two paws up. I like that beef is the first ingredient in the recipe and there are none of those unrecognizable ingredients created in a science laboratory.          The treats are a nice size and have just enough chew to satisfy. For Piper, our shih tzu with a few missing teeth, I  eak the treats into smaller pieces so she can manage them.           On the package:     Use within 3 weeks of opening.     100% satisfaction guaranteed     Keep this bag out of the reach of pets and children.
