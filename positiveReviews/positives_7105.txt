I want this coffee in bed every morning, just like it's name "Breakfast in Bed".  I ordered this 24 2 box shipment on the automatic 2 months plan.  I used it up way before the next shipment so I changed the plan to every month.  Now is looks like it's out of stock.....ugh....I hope it comes back soon.  It is a delicious choice!
