I used to drink Crystal Light over 10 years ago.  The choices were minimal:  Tea, tea with lemon, lemonade and pink lemonade.  At my job we have an area set up so employees can buy snacks and this variety pack.  Tired of soda, I opted to try the Crystal Light On the Go Wild Strawberry Energy.  I instantly LOVED it.  This is coming from a person who really doesn't care for strawberries.          Unlike another poster I didn't find it too strong.  I DO find the Cherry Pomegranate a tad powerful, but still yummy.  The last two lemonade and raspberry lemonade  are also delicious.          Having tried the Wild Strawberry at work I thought I'd see if Amazon had it and it did.  While I know purchasing an item this way is more expensive per serving, I prefer it this way.  When I make a pitcher of a drink I tend to get tired of it and it ends up going down the drain.  Now THAT is a waste of money!          If you like Crystal Light then I'm pretty sure you'll like these flavors.  None of them are my favorite (I prefer fruit punch and pink lemonade) but I really like this product.
