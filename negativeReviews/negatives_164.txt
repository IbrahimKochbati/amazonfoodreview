Bought this at a local specialty item store because I adore chutney.  Because of the higher price and being sold like a gourmet item I wrongly thought it would be better than the affordable  ands sold at the supermarket.  Wrong.  It is mostly gel (jelly) with a few fruits sprinkled throughout and tastes like cheap thickened jelly you put on sandwiches...I've had much better and that's just talking about the supermarket  ands.  Very disappointed.  Money does not buy quality.
