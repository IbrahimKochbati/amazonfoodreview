I've tried all flavors of Pamela's Whenever Bars, & all of them taste good in my opinion. However, if you're more of a chocolate lover like me, these are THE BEST! : ) They are relatively low in sugar (8 grams per bar), wheat free, gluten free & non dairy but honestly taste very much like a chocolate chip cookie!! They have a good amount of whole grains & some Omega 3's as well. The taste of other  ands' bars I've tried pale in comparison!
