I haven't used any Shake 'N Bake in years (and when I did use it, I used the version for chicken) so I was curious to see how the product was after all these years. I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised. It has a light flavoring   tasty, but doesn't overpower the flavor of the pork and using the coating kept the meat juicy. And it was very easy to use   like the name of the product says, shake on the coating and bake. It's easy to use and tastes good   it doesn't get any better than that.
