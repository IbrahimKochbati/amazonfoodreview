I have 2 husky shepherd mixes. The first is 13 months and has a finicky stomach   if he eats too fast, drinks too fast, or eats anything out of his routine, he would  ing it back up. He also wouldn't eat more than a few nibbles at a time. The 2nd is 7 months old and came to us with severe diarrhea (vet's food didn't fix it either). He would eat anything and everything if we let him. Within a day of both dogs being on Harmony Farms (No fasting, just a quick switch), both dogs digestive issues are gone. My oldest (the finicky eater) is healthily eating his meals without pause or hesitation. My youngest has solid, regular bathroom  eaks and has been able to relax his water intake as a result. They're both more relaxed.     We purchase at our local grocery store (Hannaford here in NY) for about $1.31 lb. For the price, ingredients, and results   you can't beat it.
