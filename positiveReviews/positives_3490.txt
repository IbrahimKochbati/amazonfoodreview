Melitta Cafe is a smooth, flavorful coffee that compares well with regular coffee.  This is not the typical weak decaf blend that is true of many American  ands.  Melitta has a rich, deep taste and a nice dark color.  Tastes great black or with cream.  As a stand alone coffee (no cream sugar) it has a smooth, though strong flavor just like regular coffee.  This coffee is especially great as an after dinner drink.  Strong enough to taste like regular coffee but decaffeinated so it will not prevent sleep later.  Great coffee.
