I suffer from stomach issues, and have to be very cautious about how much coffee I consume. I struggle with that because I am a picky coffee addict. I have not enjoyed other low acid blends. The Puroast Low Acid Coffee is a dream come true for me. It tastes like the best of specialty coffee house grinds, yet it does not hurt my stomach. It has a rich, clean flavor. There is no hint of burning or over roasting, though, so the coffee is light but full flavored, with a rich, almost chocolatey finish. The aroma is wonderful. I am so excited to have found this product. It is a definite win!
