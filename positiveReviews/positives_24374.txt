When you're vegan, you have to be prepared especially if you're going somewhere that isn't familiar. These bars taste good (they're not candy bar good, but they're also much healthier than a candy bar) and are convenient and not messy. Other raw bar makers can take a lesson in how to make non greasy raw healthy bars.          There are quite a few vegan energy bars out there, and these are some of my favorites.
