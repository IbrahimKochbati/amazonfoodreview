I'm not sure what makes these "new Zealand" style, but my dog loved them. Each 10oz pack has 6 good sized treats. They're seemingly hard as rock but my dog, a fairly large 6 month old mutt, loved them.  He just crunched away for about 10 minutes on each one. He definitely preferred them to Milkbone and his  eath was better. I don't know that they would be suitable for a puppy without all his adult teeth, but mine was fine.
