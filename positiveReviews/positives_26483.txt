My vet recommended these chews to help with the tartar on my older dog's teeth and said she needed to come in in 3 months to see if she needed a teeth cleaning (over $100).I began feeding her one a day. After a month I looked and most all of the  own junk near her gums was gone. Little did I know that dogs do not have the enzyme to  eak down this stuff as humans do. Such a deal and my dog loves them. They are a little expensive but seem to do the job.
