Today I tried the spaghetti Tofu Shirataki noodles by House Foods. I would give these noodles a five stars if it weren't for the pre preparation that is involved. I found these at my local Asian mart for about $2.00.          First you must rinse these noodles well because the liquid they come in smells like a lake (you should prepare yourself for the smell). Second, you need to lay out the noodles on paper towels and press down removing as much of the liquid as possible before use.          Next I fried them on high heat with a small amount of oil and butter. After a few minutes I then added my frozen stir fry vegetable medley. I then added some  oth, soy sauce, and finally a thickener such as corn starch. Stir it up,  ing to a boil, and turn it off.          Really it tasted great  very much like the ramen noodles.  It is important to note that the noodles themselves have "no flavor" and actually absorb the flavor of whatever ingredients you are cooking them in. So let them sit it whatever flavor suits you.
