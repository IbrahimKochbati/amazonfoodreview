My son (age 7) has several food allergies.  This is by far the best pancake mix! To one full bag, I add two scoops of sugar, cinnamon and pure vanilla extract.  When adding water, I make sure the batter is a little thick.  The pancakes, when cooked on a medium heat griddle are the perfect consistency and delicious.  I have tried every mix on the market for those with wheat, nut, dairy, egg, sesame and peanut legume allergies.  This mix has the best flavor and consistency.  it is definitely worth the money!
