I enjoy weekend backpacking adventures, and I like to enjoy a hot cup of soup or vegetarian chili around the nighttime campfire. I saw that the white bean & pasta was a vegan product, so I decided to give it a try. For this past weekend's outing, I  ought along a few containers, and prepared it with boiling water. Other than my taste preference desiring a bit more spice (a couple dashes of hot sauce would do the trick), I thought this soup was good. I did not have any issue with the pasta not 'cooking' like some of the other reviewers, but perhaps that is because I used boiling water and not the microwave to prepare it. (I actually never use a microwave) I'll definitely purchase again, and would recommend to other vegetarians and vegans.    "
