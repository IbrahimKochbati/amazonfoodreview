My dog will happily eat Sorel boots, pens, old work gloves, and any paper product but chewed on one of these treats for a couple seconds and just left it sitting on the floor.  This is the first time I've ever given her something to eat that she didn't basically inhale.  How do you eff up making a dog treat?
