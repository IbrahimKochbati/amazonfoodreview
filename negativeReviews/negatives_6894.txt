I have no complaints about the quality of this tea it is very good. My only complaint is that I do think it is     completely misleading to call it plantation mint without stating somehow that black tea (and hence caffeine) is an ingredient.     I am always on the look out for something tea like to drink that does not contain caffeine. I find decaffeinated teas coffees to taste funny and like to drink something that has not been altered to be caffeine free. When I see plantation mint I assume that this product is  made with only mint leaves until you read the fine print on the ingredients to find black tea is in it. This is the only thing that bothers me about this product which is otherwise quite nice.
