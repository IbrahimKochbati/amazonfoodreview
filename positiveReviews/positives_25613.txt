I recently read a study suggesting that 3 cups day of hibiscus tea lowers blood pressure. I thought I'd try it out and was happy to find this product at amazon.com. I searched for organic and 4 stars or better. This tea came up. You'll be surprised how big the bag is: I mean, it's a pound of dried flower petals! Received it yesterday, followed the package directions to  ew my first pitcher of tea to put into the fridge. I added sugar to tame a bit of the tartness. My plan is to drink 3 cups a day (morning, afternoon, and night) and then see what happens with blood pressure in a month.
