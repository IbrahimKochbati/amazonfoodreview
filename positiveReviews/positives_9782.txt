My Maltese absolutely loved the old Greenies.  Then they changed their "recipe" and she wouldn't even try the new version.  Turned up her nose and that was that.  I can't recall the exact names of the other types of "Greenies" out there and there are only a few, but regardless, she didn't like any of them.  We moved on to another type of treat because I didn't think there was ever going to be another "Greenie" type treat that would measure up to the original.  On the outside chance she might like these, I gave them a try.  Turns out she really, really likes them.  So my search to replace the original "greenie" is finally over!
