Reading in earlier reviews that these were genuine chinese fortunes, I served them with a chinese Christmas dinner and was greatly disappointed, as were my guests.  Three sample fortunes are:  "Life is not a struggle.  It's a wiggle."  "Management is doing things right: leadership is doing the right things."  "If you're feeling down, try throwing yourself into your work."  These are not fortunes, they are self help mini bites.  A fortune is:  "Your love of travel will soon be satisfied," and it doesn't matter if they are predictive or not.  What matters is that they state a fortune.  "Beware the dog in the corner house," would be fun to get.  "Life is a wiggle" is boring.     The cookies arrived on schedule, as promised, and in good condition in their individual wrappers.  All of that was as I'd hoped.  But content counts, in fortune cookies especially.
