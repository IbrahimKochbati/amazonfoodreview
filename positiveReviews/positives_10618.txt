You have to understand, kittens need things like bones and shards of feathers and meat. That's what cats eat!          For people to complain about the ingredients? For this? I see someone going behind and reading the label as some form of justification and I have to wonder if they know what kittins eat in the wild. This is formulated specifically for kittens too small to eat chunks o          The kitten I have loved Fancy Feast Appetizers, just raw meat with juices from the meat. SHE LOVED IT. I had to get her to start eating this so I mix in the Fancy Feast Appetizers (mostly fish apps) with this and she LOOOOOOVES eating this now. one can of this mixed with two viarities of Fancy Feast Apps and that should do it.          So you can mix this in with something else, kitten formula, a little water, and this mushy but soft food will adapt and work with what you put in it.          I highly recommend it for people who want to feed their kittens, even if you can't get them to eat it. Whatever is in this, it's making my kitten super healthy. She has grown out of this food and now is ready for Royal Canin Canned Cat Food, Kitten Instinctive.
