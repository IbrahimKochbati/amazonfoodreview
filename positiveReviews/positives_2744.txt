This is the best dog food I have ever purchased, and having been a dog training for over 4 years, I've purchased A LOT! We first tried this food when our new addition (an 8 week old German Shepherd) joined the family, and we wanted to keep him on a natural dog food. With any pure ed dog, health can be an issue, and you don't want to fill your dog with by products and plant fillers from day one. This food is praised by unbiased pet food reviewers, and I don't understand why there isn't more publicity for this product. Our other dog, a 5 year old English Bulldog with constant skin allergy issues, was switched over when we discovered this  and, and she has not had an allergic reaction since! We didn't realize how much it had to do with diet. Her hair used to fall out in spring (not just normal shedding, but actual balding from hair loss), but this has alleviated that problem as well. Now our shepherd is a year and a half old, and he's eating this Large Breed Adult Lamb & Rice flavor. He's not a big eater, but he loves this food! Will definitely keep him, and all future pets, on this  and as long as they keep their standards as high as they are now!! Kudos Diamond for making a wonderful natural dog food.          SIDE NOTE: I would never buy regular Diamond  and food. If the bag doesn't say "Natural" on it, the standards they are kept to are WAY lower and the quality suffers immensely. Stick with Natural (it's a couple dollars more at most!) and your dog will be happier and healthier and live a longer life! Isn't that what we all want?!?
