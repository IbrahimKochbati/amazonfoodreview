These are delicious.  They are very light and can almost melt in your mouth.  White cheddar is used so your fingers don't turn orange.  The bad part is that you can easily eat the entire bag and they are NOT low calorie.          I would have given this 5 stars but I experienced the same thing as some of the other reviewers.  Several packages of the Pirate's Booty had popped open and were stale.  Because of this problem, I haven't reordered.
