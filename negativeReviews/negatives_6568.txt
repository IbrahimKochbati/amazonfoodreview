Running off to work without  eakfast?          Sometimes a product is just right for the consumer.          When my daughter in law noticed my box of Quaker instant oatmeal maple and  own sugar, she told me her children, age four and two, love it.          So many children skip  eakfast and the Quaker Oatmeal gives a person fuel to start the day with energy.          It's also good because it has zero saturated fat and is only 160 calories per packet. It's so tasty that it doesn't need anything to add to the flavor but sliced peaches or blueberries are a nice touch.          Since the product comes in handy packets, it's also convenient to  ing to work and have a quick, energetic snack, all that's needed is to add milk or boiling water and it's all set.          It's also microwavable. This is a very good product.
