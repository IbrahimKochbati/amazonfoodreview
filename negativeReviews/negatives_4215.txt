I've always bought Miracle Grow, it WAS good.  The last 2 years it' has really gone downhill fast.  I've tried their potting mix, African violet soil and the worst of all, Moisture Control.  I also get gnats flying all around my house.  The soil is so bad!  I have found every thing from sticks to rocks in the soil.  And when watering plants, the water just sits there on top.  The soil doesn't soak up the water.  The African voilet soil also does not retain water, shoots right through to the tray and then won't soak it back up into the pot, the water just sits there.  The Moisture Control soil is a nightmare!  I've had plants actually rot at the roots, and I didn't water them for over 2 weeks!  My plants have never looked so sickly.  My husband laughingly looked at it the soil and asked me if I were planting my flowers in peat moss?  I didn't laugh.  The soil I bought just this weekend for outdoor pots, smelled horrible!  I had to keep the windows open during the trip home.  I've also opened bags of soil that had mold in it!  This company needs to change, change back to what they were previously 'cause I for one am going to look for a different  and.
