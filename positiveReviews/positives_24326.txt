I think this is the best one on the Market for at home. If you like Dunkin Donuts at the drive thru, this is the closest thing you're gonna get at home. I consider myself a Chai Drinker I buy at least 4 at Dunkin Donuts and have at least 4 of these Big Train Chai's at home a day. The only suggestion..... I make is make it with milk, it is awesome that way. I haven't seen this yet at any donut or coffee shops yet. Does anyone know who serves it?
