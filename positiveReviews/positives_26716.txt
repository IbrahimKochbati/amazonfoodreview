Colman's mustard is as essential an item as salt, pepper, ketchup.  If you don't already use it to make your own mustard, and in rubs, sauces and marinades, you have a treat in store. It has a million uses and, once you begin cooking with Colman's, you'll never want to be without it. If you're not sure what to do with it, or how to use it, a little googling will present a whole world of possibilities. Shop around for the best deal   this one is terrific, as I write this review but as we all know, prices can change. I made the mistake of buying this at my local grocery where I paid $4.99 for 2 ounces!
