I first received a bag of Harmony valley as a prize on a contest on ecorazzi.com. I was very pleasantly surprised at the texture and taste. I made stuffed green peppers with it just as you would a traditional recipe substituting the mix. My husband, who is a avid meat eater really enjoyed it and said he would not mind eating more often. I also made the sausage style in an omelet with peppers and onions and it was tasty. I ordered a pack of six of the burger mix right here on amazon!
