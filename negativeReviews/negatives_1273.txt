I dont like the taste of this at all.  I have some other fennel tea from another company not on amazon and it is fantastic.  Cant remember exact name but think it is something like MB   is a french company and I got it in canada and by mail order after that.  It is much better to my taste.  Never dreamed there would be this much variance among fennel seeds as only ingredient.
