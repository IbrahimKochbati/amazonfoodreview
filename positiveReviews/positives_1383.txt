My son and daughter in law told me about these chips and they purchased a few bags at a store and I will say they are higher in stores then you can get them online on Amazon. They  ought me a bag and I was hooked! So I ordered popchips online and they are the "BEST" chips!! There wasn't a flavor I didn't like or that my family didn't like. I am a (chipaholic) and these are better for you and a great tasting chip. I highly recommend these to anyone that can't do without eating chips either with a sandwich, hamburger, or just to munch on midday.     You won't be dissapointed.
