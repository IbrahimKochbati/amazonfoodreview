This is funny I bought the flax seed to make  a neck warmer  I made said to use Flax seed and warm in Microwave for 2 minutes.  Bought 4 bags only needed 2 so decided to make use of the rest. Grind and put over any food the benifits are great.     I put mine in Yogert and Cereal. Will diffently keep useing. After this last bag will be ording again.
