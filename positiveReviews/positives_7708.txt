I'm diabetic and manage my weight and blood sugar levels medicine free with a low carb diet.  They don't sell these anywhere I've seen locally but in the "south" I would think they would be a hit!  They're a good product and blow away any already prepared pork rinds and if you're on a low carb diet it's really hard to find a crunchy snack and these fit the bill!  They are flavorful and tender yet crisp.  Thumbs up.
