This cappuccino is very good and tastes almost as good as Starbucks Latte Primo, T Discs for Tassimo Coffeemakers, 8 Count Packages (Pack of 2). The cream foams up well in the Tassimo machine. The only difference in taste between this Cappuccino drink and the Starbucks Latte Primo is that the coffee flavor is slightly stronger in the Starbucks product. Also, with the Cappuccino you  ew the coffee first and then use the milk disc. With the Starbucks Latte Primo you  ew the milk first then the coffee.          Overall, I think this is a bargain buy. As long as you are not looking for a slightly stronger coffee flavor, I'd suggest purchasing this instead of the Starbucks  and as both products use expresso coffee and milk discs.
