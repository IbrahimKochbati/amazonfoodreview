I love all things coconut, and was first drawn to coconut sugar when I turned to a paleo lifestyle. I love that it is an organic, low glycemic sweetener. The blonde variety can be used as a sub for either white OR  own sugar. I make everything from pancakes to muffins to cookies with this and recommend it to all of my friends looking to make a healthy, easy swap for refined sugar in their pantry. Added bonus that palm coconut sugar doesn't clump up as much as traditional refined  own sugar!
