You need to make sure the pieces are evenly distributed throughout the bag before you microwave it. With my microwave I find 1:30 on high is the best, shake bag well when you first pull it out (for at least 10 seconds). This ensures the hot and spicy seasoning to be evenly coated. Then enjoy, I eat em with a beer.
