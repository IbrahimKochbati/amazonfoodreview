If you are a farmer with lots of farm cats, this is the perfect food   and because it is primarily sold at most farm and fleet stores I think that it is meant for farm cats. The ingredient list is marginal quality though, which can be expected. Most of it is corn and grain products, with a few meat by products here and there. Better than Iams but not by much.          I've been feeding my cat on Diamond Maintenance for 2 years without a problem but I will be switching to something with more substance soon. If you're looking for a cheap option for lots of cats, this is a good product to buy in bulk; but if you have a domestic cat you wish to keep around for awhile, I'd suggest something else.          And hey, if you're looking for a good alternative, get Chicken Soup For The Adult Cat formula. Great stuff, doesn't cost a lot, and is much better than the regular Diamond food.
