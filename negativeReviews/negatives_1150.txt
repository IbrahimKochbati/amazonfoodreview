The wrappers are GOOD but it would have been easier if the filling was already in them.  The fact that it wasn't meant I had to look     up what goes into a wrapper and buy water chestnuts, bamboo shoots and bean sprouts to help me make up my own filling.  The     wrappers are GOOD but more work than heating up a frozen appetizer.
