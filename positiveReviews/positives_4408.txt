I love oatmeal for  eakfast, but it takes so long to prepare it and then sweeten it and add mix ins that I usually don't have time. This instant granola is just about perfect. The only thing wrong with it is that it's a bit too sweet. When I don't have time to make oatmeal in the morning, I throw one of these packs into my bag and make it when I get to work. It's also a great portion manager; it takes the guesswork out of how much oatmeal is in one serving.
