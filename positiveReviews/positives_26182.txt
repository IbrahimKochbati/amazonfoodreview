I have a friend who is a dandelion warrior.  Everytime she see's one, she pounces and that plant is history.  As a little joke, I ordered and sent her the tea.  To my surprise, she reported that she actually liked it, mentioning it had a rather nice smooth flavor.  Although that has not stopped her from still being a dandelion ninja, I give it 5 start just knowing that if she liked it   it HAS to be good!
