The coffee I tried had scarcely any flavor or aroma.  I feel that the hazelnut additive was more dominant than the taste of the coffee, and even that was quite weak.  I did not find the flavoring nutty either; rather unnatural tasting.  I generally have my coffee with the addition of half and half only; it is quite possible the people who enjoy this are accustomed to using syrups which might compensate for the blandness of this coffee.  Speaking of syrups, if you like hazelnut then I'd recommend instead a hazelnut syrup or liqueur added to a better coffee.  I found no advantage to the whole bean either; I've certainly had better pre ground Folger's coffee.  This is the second time I've both tried and been disappointed by the Eight O'Clock  and, and so I am beginning to suspect that I was not merely the victim of an old or otherwise bad batch.
