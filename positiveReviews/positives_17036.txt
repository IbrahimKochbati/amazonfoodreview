Our lab mix, Walter, is a power chewer and most toys that are not very hard don't last long with him. I saw this silly looking toy at Walgreen's and it said it is bullet proof plastic so I got it. My husband was skeptical and asked, "Yeah, but is it Walter proof?" It is!!! Of course, the rope was history before 2 minutes passed and nearly all the rubber is off the top, but the hard plastic is scratched but still intact. I  eak up his hard biscuits and feed them through the top (the bottom screws off but if you put them through the top, you know they can fall out during play) and Walter flings it to the ground and rolls it around the get the treats to fall out. He loves it and it's almost always in his mouth. This is, hands down, his favorite toy. But, he's a smart dog and learned from a different toy (rubber ball with a hole in it) how to work treats out of a toy. You may have to demonstrate how it works to your dog.
