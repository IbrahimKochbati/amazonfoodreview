I am always on the lookout for healthy but tasty foods that are low in calories. These crackers are good, not in a "omg" type of good, but they have an interesting yet addictive taste that I can't really explain. I would definately recommend them. Everyone I give them to keeps asking me for more. I guess I should stop sharing.
