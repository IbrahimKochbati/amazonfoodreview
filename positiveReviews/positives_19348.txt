Get your hands on a box of these. I've tried all flavors (mostly as a kid) but now stick to strawberry.          I remember buying a box a couple of years for the summer. My friends saw and asked (they had never heard of the  and) what it was... I told them to just try one... box was empty in less than a week.          Thanks Amazon for having this item in stock. Great stuff.
