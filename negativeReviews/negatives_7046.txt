Not a huge fan of Kellog's Raisin Bran for a variety of reasons:          1. Relative to other flakey cereals (Special K, Total etc.), the flakes are sometimes not always fresh (I don't know about Amazon's batch) and it really makes the cereal sort of gummy and yucky     2. In general, the flakes themselves, even when fresh,a re not real crunchy (admittedly, they are  an flakes, not pure rice, wheat or corn flakes, so they seem more like a  an fiber cereal) and they get mushy in milk pretty quickly.     3. Amazon used to have a four pack for nearly the same price, so this is not a big savings anymore with the three pack (pricey NYC stores typically always have Kellog's Raisin Bran on sale and it's usually $2.99 20 oz box).          On the plus side, I DO like the raisins. They're plump and not sugary coated.
