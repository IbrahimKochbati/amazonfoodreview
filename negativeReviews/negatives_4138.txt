This review is primarily for the PB2 product (not the chocolate). As an avid PB fan, I wanted to try these, for the obvious caloric advantage over any other PB on the market. The PB2 has a definite "natural" PB product flavor, and can be mixed to lend a similar consistency to peanut butter. That being said, I found it is not as fulfilling when snacked on alone, with a spoon. That being said, I imagine it would make an amazing replacement for real PB in any cooking recipe or blending protein shake. I did enjoy the chocolate flavored PB2 on its own, and would definitely buy it to snack on by itself again. :)
