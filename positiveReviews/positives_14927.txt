I had to switch to decaf coffee because of the supervised diet I'm on.  I tried other  ands of decaf which had little or no flavor. Then I tried Baronet Decaf Colombian coffee pods and it tastes like fresh  ewed regular coffee...not decaf. It is bold and delicious. Now I don't mind being on my diet since I don't have to give up delicious tasting coffee!
