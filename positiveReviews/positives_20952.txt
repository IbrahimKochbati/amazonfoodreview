My grandsons love chocolate chip pancakes and I gave them a can of the Stonewall mix at Christmas.  They wanted more and I looked everywhere for it .  Then it occurred to me to look on Amazon and there it was!  I bought the pack of three and they are thrilled.  The boys can get up in the morning and make pancakes before they go to school.  It is easy and they always turn out beautifully.  Yum.
