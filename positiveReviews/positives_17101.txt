This isn't a vegetarian sauce (shrimp is an ingredient)  for those concerned about such things.  It has a little bit of kick to it, but not much.  It says sour and spicy on the bottle, but I would call the flavor of the sauce more of a sweet and sour.  I made a zucchini stew with basically this sauce mixed with the zucchini and cooking  oth and it was pretty good.  4.25 stars.
