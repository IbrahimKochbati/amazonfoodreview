I made the mistake to give a Greeny to my puppy without reading reviews about this product. It was a bad idea. The poor puppy got very sick after eating a Greenie. He vomited and had diarrhea.          I took him to urgent care and the Vet's verdict(informed on the X ray)was: "a Greenie got stocked in his intestine".          I was very lucky to get the puppy recovered with medicine. But surgery was being considered by the Vet (mind about $7,000). On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3 4 days.          After this unfortunate incident, I looked up for reviews about this unsafe product  and not to be surprised  I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. "Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the  eath freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds". Dogster com          Note that as the product label says: Greenies are not 100% digestible, and if you read with more attention, the label has a Warning saying that: dogs may get sick or even chock when ingesting a Greenie!          At the end of the day, it's hard to believe that there are companies like Grennies that don't address these issues, and just care about marketing and profiting  not so much about producing a healthy, safe treat for our best buddies.          In any case, I'd recommend to ask your Vet or read more dog owners reviews before giving Greenies to your dog.
