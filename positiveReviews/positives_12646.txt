I love this coffee.  I'm a fan of lighter roasts.  I like the lack of bitterness and higher caffeine that comes with them.  This one is my favorite.  For most K Cups, even lighter roasts, I have to run the machine twice through one K Cup to get a decent, not overly strong, cup of coffee.  These come out perfect for me with one run.  I do tend to go through them more quickly because of that, but that's okay. The great coffee is worth it!
