A year ago, I was in search of a natural sweetner to replace pancake syrup which contained ingredients I wanted to delete from my family's diet, so I tried Madhava Organic Agave Nectar. Oh boy did I hit home!It's all natural, from a plant I'd never heard of, (agave plant). It's delicious not only on pancakes, but in teas and just about anything that requires a sweetner! My wife bake some chicken wings yesterday and she coated the wings with the agave nectar, uuummmmm! Wish I could give you guys a bite, but sorry, ALL GONE! I Highly Recommend this product! I keep 4 of the 46 ounce light jars on hand at all times!...And no, you can't borrow some from me, GET YOUR OWN!
