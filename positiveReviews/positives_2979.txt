Not sure it should be legal. We put this   and a few other spices I won't share here  on some lamb chops and just fried them. They were AMAZING. This spice tastes pretty hot by itself, which makes it a bit hard to figure out how a blend with it and other spices is going to turn out. The end result, strangely, was not hot at all. Since I like spicy, I would usually have been disappointed, but this was so good, I did not even CARE. Seriously  you have to try this. I ordered two other spices at the same time, neither of which will be getting a GOOD review.
