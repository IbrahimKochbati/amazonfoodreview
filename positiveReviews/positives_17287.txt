Why?  Because the noodles come SOFT, sealed in plastic!  If you are tired of noodles that "crunch" or that have to be reconstituted out of the original cardboard, you are in for a treat!  Available in something like a dozen different varieties, try them all and then subscribe to your favorites in order to get the lowest price.          Note: The seasoning comes in a sealed pouch so if you tend to prefer yours less salty or less strong in taste, don't use it all to start.  You can always add more in later.          Note: Since the bowl is made partially from cornstarch, it will biodegrade completely so toss it in the trash when you're done without feeling guilty.  (For this reason you should NOT attempt to reuse this bowl like you may have done with other  and instant noodle meals that came in plastic bowls.)
