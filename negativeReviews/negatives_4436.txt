I ordered the basket based on the picture that showed the Keebler  anded packages of cookies but when it arrived it was the Murray's sugar free cookies instead (the Rugers cookies were also in the basket as described). I contacted the seller who told me that they are made by the same company. However, I was looking for something different and if the photo had shown the Murray's packaging I would not have purchased it.
