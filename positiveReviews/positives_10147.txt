I LOVE these noodles and I really enjoy them in place of ramen. For those dieting, Ramen is the worst thing you can eat, boasting 65% of your daily saturated fat due to the palm oil. To prepare, I rinse well with hot water or drop in boiling water for a minute (best) the let dry. As for flavoring, I find these to work best in "Soup" applications with strong flavors. Like tofu, these will absorb whatever they are cooked in. My fave and easiest method is to simply sacrifice a $0.20 Run of the mill beef ramen, steal the flavor pack, and cook my noodles in the  oth. I also add  Heinz reduced sugar ketchup to add body to the sauce and give it a lip smacking goodness. A bit frugal, but it is really good. I have given this to other people and they dont even realize its not the real deal. Prep, Boil, Add to flavorful  oth. Done.
