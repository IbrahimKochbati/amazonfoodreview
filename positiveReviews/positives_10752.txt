Newman's Own Organics Dog Treats   It was a nice surprise to see a quality made, healthy treat made for dogs.  The bag comes with a zip lock top to keep the treats fresh and makes for easy storage after it is open.  Each treat is scored in half so you can  eak it down to a smaller size.  A whole treat was great for our basset hound and 1 2 of a treat worked best for our beagle.  It would be nice if they came in an even smaller size too, as the 1 2 was a bit much for our terrier.  They are too hard to  eak in 1 2 again without additional scoring.  Our basset hound often has a sensitive stomach, so the organic ingredients made it a safe treat that she loved. There is no greasy residue, like some special diet treats can have, and they are crunchy enough to help keep our dogs' teeth clean.  I would definitely recommend these to our friends who have dogs with food allergies to corn or wheat.  This is a quality product that our dogs enjoyed and I would purchase in the future.
