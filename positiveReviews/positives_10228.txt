I consider myself a connoisseur of types when it comes to sugar free candy.  I have been in search of the perfect sugar free treat for years and I may have found it!  These licorice flavored candies pack a great flavor punch   remind me of chewing on black licorice jelly beans as a kid.  The texture is a bit too grainy but there is no weird aspartame type aftertaste to them so I can overlook the grain.  Just be conscious of the warning on the label and limit yourself to 4!
