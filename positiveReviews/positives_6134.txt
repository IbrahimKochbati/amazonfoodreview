I have a very hectic lifestyle and need time to relax. I have always had trouble sleeping as my head is spinning. I have tried lots of methods to try and sleep well but nothing has worked. I saw this product in my local walmart and thought, what the heck, I'll try it.          Wow, Why could they not have  ought this product out years ago. After about 20 minutes my mind was able to let go and relax and I had the best nights sleep in a long time. The taste is awesome and it does not feel overwhelming like other products.          I am ordering more to stock up my fridge, Just Great!!
