I am not a big fan of Starbucks coffee but I have to say this istant one tastes the same as their house coffee they  ew. So, that puts it on the highest shelf within instant coffee family by far. It also has the     "kick" of a regular  ewed coffee due to the microgranuls of real coffee beans in it. Must have if you are on the go or have no coffee maker near you...
