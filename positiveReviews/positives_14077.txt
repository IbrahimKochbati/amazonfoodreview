We loved this!  We ordered it for our Christmas dinner so we wouldn't have to slave over a hot stove.  They both warm up in about an hour.  The turkey was so moist and very flavorful.  The ham was just delicious.  With our kids     taking left overs home with them we ended up eating every last morsel.  I will probably make this an annual tradition and maybe even order it for other holidays as well.  It arrived within days, not weeks, but kept nicely in the refrigerator.
