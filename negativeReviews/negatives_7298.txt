I've bought this pumpkin before but cannot find canned pumpkin in the grocery store during non holiday periods, for some reason.  Although the consistency is not as nice as Libby's pumpkin   this is a little watery, the fact that it's organic scores big points.  I mix it with my dog and cats foods, so the wateryness is not an issue.  My complaint is that it was not well packed for shipping.  Almost half the cans were damaged to a point that I would not have purchased them in the grocery store.  The contents seem to be fine, but I will try to find some other source next time, as the shipping seems to be a consistent issue in other reviews I have read for this product.
