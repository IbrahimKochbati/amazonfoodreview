I haven't been able to drink coffee for over 5 years due to gastritis and indigestion with even a few drops of the stuff.  Coffee is my favorite and reaching desperation I gave Puroast a try.  This stuff is a miracle  not only am I symptom free, it is good coffee.  I am so thankful to be able to have coffee back in my life!
