The ingredients+price almost seem too good to be true.  That's my main thing lol...          But basically I tried this food out because I am a vegetarian...because I do not like the way livestock is raised and what not.  It may seem stupid but switching to a fish based dog food is much more appealing to me than random parts of abused lamb, chickens, etc...not that my dog cares.          When I opened the bag the biggest thing I noticed was the smell.  Not overly appetizing for me but it smelled like...food!  Burnt toast mostly...but it didn't smell like greasy crap like most dog foods do.  My dog also noticed this and was reluctant to eat it the first day.  She has warmed up to it a bit.  She still eats smaller portions but I believe that is because it is probably higher quality and she might feel full sooner.
