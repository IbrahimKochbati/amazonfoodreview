I have three dogs. Two miniature schnauzers and a Giant Schnauzer.  I like two things about these biscuits. One is they are a large and hard biscuit, hard enough to forces my Giant Schnauzer to actually take the time and crunch them up rather than down them in one or two gulps.          The second thing I like is they are bar type cookie and have an indention in the middle so you can snap them in half for smaller dogs.          I haven't seen them for sale at any store yet so after my Vine sample was gone I ordered them here on Amazon and they were shipped by the seller rather quickly.
