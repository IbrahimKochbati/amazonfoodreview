Just about 9 out of 10 of these would not work in my machine.  Its not my machine we have run hundreds of cups of coffee through it without an issue.  Had to toss most of them in the trash and clean up the mess they made.  They would just stop filtering about a third of the way then just pop and spill grinds everywhere!
