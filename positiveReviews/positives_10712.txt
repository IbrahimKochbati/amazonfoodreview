I wish more companies were as good as Newman's Own. You feel like you are getting quality food at a good price. That's why I jumped at getting these for my dog when I heard about them.          They are the same consistency as "Milk Bones" maybe a little denser. They come in around 1"x 2"x 1 4", they can be easily  oken in two because of a seam in the middle. I have a minature Maltese and they are kind of big for him but I just  eak it into quarters for him which is a little hard to do but it can be done.          He seems to enjoy eating them and I know they are better than most of the stuff out there since they are made by a company with such high standards for food.
