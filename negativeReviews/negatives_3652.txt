I enjoy starting the day with a cup of coffee. Once upon a time, I just used instant. Some were decent quality; some weren't. Then, I tried Mr. Coffee. Sorry, not my cuppa! Back to instant. Maxwell House had some nice instant.          But my family wanted a Keurig coffee maker, so  for the holidays this year  I bought one. The coffee that came with it was a Newman's Own blend. Pretty bold and tasty (better than instant and quite a bit better than my memory of Mr. Coffee). I recently ordered this through Amazon. It is not quite as bold as the Newman's Own k cup coffee. But it does have a smooth taste that starts the day off nicely. So, I have encountered two good coffees for the Keurig coffee maker!
