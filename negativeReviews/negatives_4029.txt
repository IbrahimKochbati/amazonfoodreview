The thick plastic that this mat is made of is really easy to clean, as you can just vacuum up any excess litter.  Some cats may not like the pointed surface of the mat; my cat doesn't seem to mind.  The main problem is that the mat is so small that most of the time my cat ends up exiting from a different side of the litter box, and thus the mat doesn't do any good.  I'm looking to purchase a different mat, because the small size of this one renders it all but useless.
