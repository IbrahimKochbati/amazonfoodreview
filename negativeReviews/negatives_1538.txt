I was looking forward to tasting the Switch Orange Tangerine drink since orange and tangerine flavors are two of my favorite but I was disappointed in the result.          It was tangy. It tasted of ascorbic acid. It smelled of orange candy. It reminded me of  eakfast. It reminded me of, yes, powdered Tang mixed with carbonated water followed by a strong unpleasant artificial aftertaste.  I found the the drink to be, simply, not very good.          I tried to like the beverage and I did appreciate the concept but considering the unusual flavors, high calorie count of 140 cals 8.5 oz, and cost of almost a dollar serving    I cannot recommend Switch.
