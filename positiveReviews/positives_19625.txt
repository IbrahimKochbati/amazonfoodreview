I wondered how corn meal pancakes would taste with syrup and berries, which is the way I like to eat them, but these were delicious!  They just had a nice, light "corny" taste, and I knew I was eating healthy organic grains at  eakfast.  I'm a fan of most anything "Bob's Red Mill" and these did not disappoint!
