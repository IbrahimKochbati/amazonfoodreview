I buy most of my flours from Bob's Red Mill in the 4 pack boxes, if only because having all the bags and boxes the same size makes it easier to store them.  It's good flour, and the bag's a good size for baking for a small family   also a good shape that will stand up on the counter while you scoop flour out of it.
