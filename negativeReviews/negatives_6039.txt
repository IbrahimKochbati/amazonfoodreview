Having tried just about every other vegan jerky item on the market I was excited to find one that is completely gluten based, offering a very reasonable protein to calories ratio (~10%), a reasonable price per ounce, plus great reviews to boot.  Got the product and discovered to my great chagrin that it requires refrigeration after opening!!  Not only does that fly in the face of what jerky is supposed to be, it is not disclosed anywhere in the Amazon product description.  Ouch!  So much for taking these 4oz packages on the trail, or anywhere else for that matter.          Also, be aware that the product    unlike several competitive vegan jerky products    is made in Taiwan which could mean it uses Chinese gluten.  That's a source I personally try to avoid because of significant food safety issues in the past.  However, I contacted the manufacturer and was told that their gluten is "imported from either Australia, Western Europe or the USA......most all our ingredients are from these sources.  We manufacture in Taiwan because they have ways of cooking with soy and wheat gluten that are not found in the west."          All that said, taste is pretty good and the "wet" packaging gives it a softer texture than competitive products (which I personally still prefer).
