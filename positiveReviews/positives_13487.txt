I have tried many kinds of herbal teas from different  ands. This is my favorite among all the other teas I have ever tried. It is organic, tastes really nice(you have to try it!), and have calming effect. One of the herb used in this tea is gotu kola, I heard gotu kola has an unique vitamin only present in this plant. I take this tea every night before going bed. I feel fully rested in the morning when I get up. I highly recommend this tea.
