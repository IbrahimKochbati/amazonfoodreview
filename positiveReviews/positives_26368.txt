I have been using C.E.T chews for my dog for many years. It prevents a $ vet bill for teeth cleaning. Three strips, M, W, F, helps to keep her teeth nealry tarter free. The cost for the chews is much more at the vet and even 1 800 PetMeds for the same item. I will definitely order on line in the future.
