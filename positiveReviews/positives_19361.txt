HealthWise's Low Acid Coffee did the trick for me.  I use 1 2 HealthWise and 1 2 regular coffee.  My GERD is not out of control, so for the time being it soothes my irritated tummy to the point where I can enjoy my real coffee with caffeine. It was the answer to my question "Do I have to give up my coffee?"  The answer is NO, not yet.
