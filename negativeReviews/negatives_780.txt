I just got a Keurig a few weeks ago and wanted to get some hot chocolate for it as an alternative to coffee.  I didn't have super high expectations, but these are absolutely awful.  There is a very strong plastic chemical taste to these k cups.  I tried all of them and tried putting some milk in them to help mask the chemical taste and nothing will help.  The only reason I gave these k cups 2 stars is because my boyfriend can "tolerate" them, but I don't trust him because he'll eat just about anything.  In his opinion they are "not that good" but he will still drink the mug.          From what I've read of other hot chocolate k cups, you'd be better off just buying a regular mix and doing it that way!
