I purchased a set of these salts to give as holiday gifts last year.  Everyone who received one of the blends continues to rave about it!  One evening a friend of mine  ought over a black bean dip that she made from the recipe on the Artistic Taste website, it was absolutely delicious! After that, I ended up buying a set of the salts for my own kitchen.  Being a vegetarian, I am always looking for creative ways to enhance the flavor of the food I cook   mostly so my meat loving friends will stop complaining : ).  These salts really  ing out the flavor of my food!
