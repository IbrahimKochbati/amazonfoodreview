Packaging was very good, comes in 2 separate well sealed containers bags, in a cardboard box. I liked that it's divided into 2 portions which means freshness. It's much cheaper than buying it from ALL local big and small shops I've bought it from, and is fresher.          My mom has always boiled some anise when someone had a stomachache and it seemed to work. I make a big pot and warm up a cup after certain meals that are a little heavy on the stomach or are gassy. Hope this helps.
