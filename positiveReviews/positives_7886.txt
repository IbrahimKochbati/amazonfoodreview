My  other and I were talking about candy that we enjoyed as children.  I bought the Chuckles Theater boxes as a gift for him. Moist, tasty and there's plenty to share. The quantity may be too much for some, but they always have a houseful of kids watching movies and eating snacks.  This is a great movie treat for all ages at a good value.
