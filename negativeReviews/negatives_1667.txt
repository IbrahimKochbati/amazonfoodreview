Disposakups....great idea, because K kups are expensive and aren't necessarily available in your favorite coffee.          Disposakups fit well into the Keurig coffee maker, the lid snaps on firmly to the disposakup after you fill it with your favorite coffee or tea.  However, the problem comes with the filter which wicks the hot coffee under pressure out of the disposakup from under the lid.          I tried several of these disposakups. After the first few leaked I thought maybe I was not snapping the lid on tight enough, so I made up some more disposakups and made sure the lids were on REALLY tight, no gaps! They still leaked about 5 or 6 drops from each disposakup, which then drips outside the k kup holder chamber...and outside the catch area.  I needed to clean up around the coffee maker after use.          I give this item 3 stars because they do work, and are a great idea, but the design of the filter protruding from around the cap causes the leaking.  If you don't mind a bit of cleanup after each use....you'll appreciate these.          I'll use the rest of the box, and continue cleaning up after each use, but I won't buy more.          The seller offered a refund, but it would cost me almost as much to send them back as I would receive as a refund.
