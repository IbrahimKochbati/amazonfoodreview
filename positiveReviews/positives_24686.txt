I home cook for my dogs, including plenty of fiber containing veggies,  own rice, barley, etc., but one little guy has "poop issues" and literally cries out in pain.  Just  eaks my heart.  So I started adding pumpkin to their doggie stew to make things a little softer and easier to pass (was that too much information), and that really helps.  Unfortunately, canned pumpkin is only available in my area around Thanksgiving and Christmas.  What?  Don't people eat pumpkin other times?  Not really expecting to find it, I decided to check Amazon and was delighted to find this product available and on "autoship" no less! A little worried about getting a bunch of crumpled cans, but really needed it, so placed an order, and thankfully only one can had a tiny dent; I've seen worse on the store shelves.  Not a pumpkin fan myself, but I did take a taste, and the flavor and texture is much better than what I usually get in the store (so maybe I'll become a fan after all), and the furkids love, love, love it! Whew, what a relief!
