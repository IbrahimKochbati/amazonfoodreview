It's basically carbonated fruit juice, but it's heavier on the juice than a similar drink like RW Knudsen's (the latter seems to never hit the spot). This drink is a great balance of fresh fruit taste, the right amount of bubbles and something like "zing". Very refreshing and tasty.          Highly Recommended.
