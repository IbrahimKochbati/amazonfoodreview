From a coffee snob's perspective, this coffee is really good.  It's not great, but it's good, and I'm drinking it, which says a lot.  What I really love about it is I'm supporting fair trade, a cause I support.  So I get to drink coffee and help someone at the same time.          It's not as good as the Green Mountain National Wildlife Blend K Cups, which I have also reviewed.  But it's good and I'd buy it again.  Hope this helps those of you who don't believe a pod coffee can measure up.
