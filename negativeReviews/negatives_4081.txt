For those who are looking to avoid soy, this product contains soy lecithin which is not listed in the product ingredients in the Amazon description.  The candy packaging does not indicate "organic non GMO soy" so it likely derives from (as does most soy) genetically modified sources. Soy lecithin is a waste product created when crude soybean oil is "degummed". After some searching, found some outstanding chocolate with no soy lecithin   Alter Eco.  This chocolate has a variety of flavors   midnight crunch with quinoa, dark chocolate mint, cacao, etc .  I have tried all three and they are excellent.  I do not think they have a coconut   which is why I bought the Oskri.  Alter Eco is USDA organic, fair trade, vegan, gluten free, soy and GMO free, no chemicals at all, no emulsifies.  Very good   should not be this hard to find food that is pure, simple and has no nasty additives.  Oh,before I read the fine print on the wrapper, I did try this, good flavor, fairly tough and chewy consistency but not bad flavor.
