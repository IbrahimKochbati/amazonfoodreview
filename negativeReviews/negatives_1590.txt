This had a nice citrus flavor, but it was too sweet and actually flat. I did not get any kind of fizz or sparkle. For the amount of sugar and calories, I rather would have eaten a piece of fruit and drank a glass of seltzer water   less calories and more satisfying in my mouth. I got this on GB special for about $13.52 for the case. I don't think I will purchase again.
