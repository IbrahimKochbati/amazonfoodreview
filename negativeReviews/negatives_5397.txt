I like the idea of a low acid, but not decaf coffee, because I love coffee, but have been absolutely flattened before by acid induced stomach pain (and GAWD forbid I give up my cup of coffee in the morning!).  But I'm not a fan of the Puroast Low Acid Coffee, French Roast.  It leaves a funny taste in my mouth that I can't quite identify, and I tried this coffee black, with sugar, with sugar and skim milk.  That unidentifiable funny taste was still there.  As I've never tried a "low acid" coffee before trying this product, I don't know whether to pin it on Puroast as a  and, as something they do with their beans, or if the strange taste is a trade off in low acid coffee.  In the days since trying this coffee, I've had other  ands kinds of coffee and have not had that weird taste, so I don't think it's me.  Your experience could be different, but I'm not a fan of this one.
