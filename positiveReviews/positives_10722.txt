My dog is not a picky eater.  If this treat tasted like cat poo he would eat it.  with relish.  What I like is that it is not a big dog biscuit.  My husband tends to feed Jack snacks between meals and because he is a bigger dog he usually gets bigger treats.  This treat is less than 1 2 the size of his usual biscuit and he does not notice he is getting less. I am hoping this will take off some chunkage around his middle.
