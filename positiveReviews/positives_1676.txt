Well, maybe I'm the first one to review this wonderful treat, but I know I'm not the first one having tried them! This treat is so safe, healthy, and yummy! In my native language, Miam Miam is for Yum Yum!     There you go. Not too sweet, yet not lacking sweetness. You can't taste one ingredient above the other one (OK, besides the coconut, since it's mostly made of it), it's so good.          This is a raw food product that has been dehydrated at low temps, it's really nice to give to our kids. (We have 7 of them, and they love it). Of course it's a bit more expensive than your average treats candies, but hey, who wants to complain?          Do you want crappy candies with dyes, chemicals and cooked (so basically poison), or you want to give REAL FOOD for yourself and your kids?          I bet if people learn to do prepare these treats and give that to their kids, school would be less filled with Asperger Syndromes, ADD, ADHD kids etc....          This is a treat that you won't regret having spent money on it, unless of course... you are so used to the chemical loaded pesticide herbicide overly cooked High Fructose Corn Syrup dyed candy, then it's not for you.          Keep your money instead, you'll need it for the bills you'll have when you go to the numerous Docs that can't help you and your kids. Sorry....:(
