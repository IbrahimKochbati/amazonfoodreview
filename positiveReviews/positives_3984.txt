Live with digestive problems, and you eat a lot of mint: mint lozenges, mint tea, and those 'curiously strong' mints.  You can get tired of the taste of mint.  Especially in the morning.  I gave up coffee months ago, (and I still whimper some mornings), so I'm looking for some kind of substitute.  Forget decaf anything.  Forget chocolate.  Forget tea.  Some people swear by hot water with lemon. I don't. Too acid.  This fennel tea sells elsewhere as 'tummy tamer tea.' It does.  It's better than chamomile tea, which doesn't do much for me in terms of flavor or calming anything.          I've used this fennel tea in desperation those mornings when nothing else will settle in.  When even mint leaves or herbal teabags of mint leaves are too much, this goes down nicely.  But if you're not a fan of vegetable soup or celery, this might take a little getting used to. Me, I like it. The smell reminds me of hops.
