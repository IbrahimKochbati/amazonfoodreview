The glasses were raised and so were the smiles when I served champagne accented with Wild Hibiscus Flowers in Syrup. This unique product is a way to create an instant party with a touch of glamour.  I ordered several jars and I'm very glad I did. My guests have been surpirsed and delighted.This gourmet treat also makes a special, one of a kind hostess gift. Cheers!
