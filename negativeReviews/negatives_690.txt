I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic  and or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).          The main ingredients are Chicken By Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.          Also, By Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc.    Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either  vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.          My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try  ands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.          I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.          TRY THIS INSTEAD:    "
