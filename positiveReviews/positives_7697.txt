These taste great and if you don't cook them all the way the tiny bits of pork rinds stay crunchy and hard (Which I love!)     It's very reminiscent of porchetta skin.          I keep a case of these at work and one at home. That way I have a quick snack at the office and a nice substitute for popcorn at home. Honestly these taste better than any popcorn I've ever had. If you are on a ketogenic diet these are a must have.
