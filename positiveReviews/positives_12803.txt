I've tried other flavors of Switch before, and I think this one (Kiwi Berry) is my favorite. The flavor is much better than Red Bull or Rockstar, which I've consumed my fair share of over the years. It's more like a carbonated fruit drink than an energy drink. I will definitely be purchasing more of these Switch beverages. I like all the flavors I've tried so far. If you are tired of the way energy drinks taste, maybe it's time for you to make the "Switch".
