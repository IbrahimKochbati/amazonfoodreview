I bought a case of these on sale.  I haven't eaten them since college.  I grabbed the last can (&lt;2 weeks after they arrived) and sat down to enjoy it.  The microwave can lid works really well.  Nothing spilled, no mess to clean up.  The ravioli could have had meat (as advertised) cheese or even spinach inside... it's really hard to tell.  The pasta is soft and gooey.  My kids are begging for more.  This must be kid comfort food.          Somehow I doubt it's really nutritious.  I believe everything in moderation is ok though...  Think I'll wait for a few months before ordering another case.
