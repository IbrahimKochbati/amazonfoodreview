As other reviewers have pointed out, these crunch dried apples have their own unique consistency.  I find them to be much more like other freeze dried snacks as opposed to the consistency of a dried apple.  Because of food allergies, we're quite limited in what fruits our children can eat and what can be added to them.  It was truly a relief to find organic apple snacks without a list of additives and other fruits mixed in.  While others may prefer different types of fruits mixed together, we need snacks that are limited to the fruit that mentioned.  For example, fruit leathers often include pear even when they're listed as grape fruit leather.  These are what they claim to be...apple!          The second most important aspect for us is that these snacks are from the USA.  Unlike the other  ands, these are not from China.  We make every effort to avoid toys from China, and definitely have no interest in eating food from China.          While these are extremely expensive, amazon makes them more affordable than my supermarket.  Because of the food allergies, we have so few snacks we can eat on the go.  These are a nice alternative to cuttting up apples and packing them.
