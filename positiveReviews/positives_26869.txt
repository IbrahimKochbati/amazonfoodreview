I was looking for a mild flavored tea that I could use to make a lemon tea and this organic chamomile tea is perfect. It does have a lovely aroma but I don't like drinking it without adding the juice of half a lemon and a packet of stevia. Then I add a little honey. I'd recommend using two tea bags for one cup or mug.          ~The Rebecca Review
