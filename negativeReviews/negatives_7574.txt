I really wanted to try this for my daughter.  Unfortunately it arrived with the seal  oken and powder spilled out into the box.  I tried to process a return to get a new sealed container but this item is ineligible for returns.  I left packaging feedback about the issue and have not gotten a response.  I really hope I can get a replacement, this stuff is not cheap.  I gave this one star because we could not try it.  I will update if we get a replacement and can try it.  We have used the berry flavor.  I think it tastes terrible because it is very very sweet with an artificial sweet taste but my daughter will eat it mixed with plain unsweetened apple sauce.
