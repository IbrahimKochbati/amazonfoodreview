I actually, Gasp, tried this stew. I got to try this at the Texas Scottish Festival in Arlington earlier this year at the Caladonian Kitchen booth (then bought a few cans). The stew was quite good considering it comes from a can. Probably a fairer star rating would be 5 stars, if comparing just against other canned stews. I'm not entirely fair though, because I'm comparing it against stews I've had at irish restuarants. So, I have had better. But, still a good product in it's own right. I also liked the whiskey cake from the same company.
