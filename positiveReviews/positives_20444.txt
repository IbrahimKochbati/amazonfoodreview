It is definitely authentic guarana powder. Seems to give u a good caffeine amount. Only problem is it never seems to incorporate into your drink. I've tried using a blender, a spoon and even soaking it overnight in water but you always have to shake it before you drink it cuz it doesn't disolve. Tastes not bad with just water though.
