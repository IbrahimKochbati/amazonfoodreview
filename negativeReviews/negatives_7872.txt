FIRST OF ALL!! Believe the reviews saying this is a choking hazard because my dog ( a rottie mix) almost chocked on this garbage of product. Also some of the chews are cut paper thin and all those do is cut your dogs gums. This product is a rip off you can bet on that!! Oh and not to mention it did not help clean my dogs teeth. My vet discontinued selling this product at her office do to all these complaints. She said that there is a product called TD bytes which do not have a choking hazzard so I will look into that. BUT NEVER AGAIN will I buy this garbage. PLEASE, PLEASE take good care of your dogs they are our children and do nothing but love us and ask very little in return.
