I am on a low carb diet, so pork rinds were a natural. I bought the Hot and Spicy.  These are great, they taste better than any others that I have tried from the stores.  The package says less than a carb per serving (there are 3.5 servings per 1.75 Ounce package).  I would like to know how many carbs for a full package, because I often eat more than one serving.  Give these a try, they are awesome.
