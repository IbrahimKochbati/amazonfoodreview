Having lots of problems with Green Mountain cups. Coffee is fine, but plastic seems heavier than other  ands and does not fully drain into cup, but drips considerably when removing to dispose. Will probably choose other  ands in the future instead. Have been using K Cups for over a year and only have had problems with this  and.
