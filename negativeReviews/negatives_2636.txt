I was wondering how my cookies which were a spin on the America's Test Kitchen perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe could have come out tasting like crud. Well it was the butterscotch chips. I basically took ATK's recipe and adjusted it for oatmeal insead of the chocolate chip by using their base and adding oats, raisins, chopped mac nuts, cinnamon and these chips. It would have been just as amazing as the chocolate chip cookie recipe if I would have ommitted these chips. Now as another reviewer said, the cookies with the chips in it are destined for the trash.
