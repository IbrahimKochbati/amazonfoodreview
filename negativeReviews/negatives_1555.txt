I wasn't sure what to expect with this citrusy, fizzy drink. It was okay, though not something I'd buy often, and certainly not worth the price in my opinion.          It wasn't as orangey as I expected and it wasn't until I had half of it gone that I read the ingredient list and saw why  orange juice is actually the fourth juice listed on the ingredient list, with apple and grape juice first and second, and the tangerine that seems to tone down the sweetness slightly the third on the list.          When you look at the nutrition information, this product has about forty more calories than Coke Classic, and despite not having any *added* sugar, the grams of sugar in this product is MORE than an equivalent amount of Coca Cola!! The only bonus of this over "real" soda is the Vitamin C and A...there isn't much else nutritionally to speak of.
