I love coffee, but I also love not having to messing with the coffee maker sometimes.  This instant espresso is the best I have tried and I have tried about 7 different  ands.          Not overly acidic at all, melts instantly in hot water (no sand dunes left swirling at the top if your cup), travels wonderfully (compact jar) and is very versitile to have around for cooking:              I but a tsp. in a batch of  ownies to deepen the dark chocolate flavor              I put a Tbs in a BIG batch of chili to compliment the spices and add extra richness.              I add a bit to mexican mole sauce for punch.              I also put it in: chocolate granache icing, chai tea with milk for a java chai latte, coffee drink mixes for extra umph, etc.          It is over 5 bucks at some supermarkets, when if you can even find it, so it is nice to know it is cheaper at amazon!
