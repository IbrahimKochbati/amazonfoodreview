I have tried many many many different  ands. I also did my research on what's the best for my Dane and most of it is expensive. I found this to be very good quality and a good price among Chicken Soup and Canidae.     My GD loves this he eats 7 8 cups a day and he would love to eat more. He has a shiny coat, no allergies and his sensitive stomach thanks the food. I highly recommend this. But I am buying it somewhere else a little cheaper and 2 day shipping. ;)
