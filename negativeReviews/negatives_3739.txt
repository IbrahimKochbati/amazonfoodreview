I don't know if I got a bad batch but this coffee has a nasty plastic flavor. I think the Nantucket Blend is good and the Dark Magic is excellent. My room mate tried it twice and she also thinks the Breakfast Blend is terrible.  Green Mountain makes some very good coffees but in my experience this isn't one of them.
