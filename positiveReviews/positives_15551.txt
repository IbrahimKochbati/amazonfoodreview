By far the best chai tea I've ever bought.  I love this stuff, it's not as sugary as Oregon Chai is and has more flavor than Pacific Chai ( and a killer variety ).  I can't recommend this stuff enough if you're a sweetened chai fan.  My only complaint is that my wife and I have to compete for the can and since she's home all day she usually gets most of it.  So the moral of this that it's good stuff but they need to invent some wife proofing so I can get some of it.
