These are simply one of the best chocolates I have ever had.  If you don't believe me, you should look at the way my my nephews and nieces act when I  ing these for them.  Their eyes light up instantly, and the way they simply ignore everything else in the world when they are enjoying the chocolaty goodness, is a five star review in itself.          Four stars, because it's pricey!  But that never stops me from buying more ;o)
