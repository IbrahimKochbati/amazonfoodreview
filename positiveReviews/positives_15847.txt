This is some of the best litter I've ever purchased for my cats to use. It really does help with odor, clumps perfectly and keep clean up very low maintenance. I have two cats, but only one uses the litter box with this litter in it. The other is very particular and only uses the pellet litter in the Breeze system. This litter would be optimal for multiple cats. I have a robot litter box and use this litter in it. I never have an issue with the waste shoot sticking or litter piling up inside the box.  Amanda
