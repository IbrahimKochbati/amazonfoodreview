I really enjoyed this drink.  It tasted just like an orange soda, but I liked it more because it was 100% juice, and didn't have any extra additives.          The only negative is that since it is 100% juice (and has no artificial sweeteners) it is high in calories  140 calories to a can, to be exact.          However, if I were to choose between drinking this or drinking an apple or orange juice, I definitely would drink this as a treat.  Plus, it would be really fun to pack in a cooler, especially for the young ones in your family.          Please note, it is not just a single type of juice.  It is a blend of several juices, so it is not "carbonated OJ", it is something just a little different.
