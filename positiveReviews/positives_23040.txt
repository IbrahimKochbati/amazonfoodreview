This salt has a pinkish color and is said to come from sea salt deposits deep in the Himalayan mountains.  Ok.  All I can say is it tastes great.  If you taste this next to regular table salt, you will never use that nasty tasting table salt again.  We also taste tested it against another  and of sea salt, and this one was much better tasting.          I wish I had the words to describe the taste, but sadly I do not.  I feel at a loss for words, like when cigar taster James Suckling reviews cigars in Cigar Aficionado magazine and describes the taste as "chocolate, earthy, with hints of leather and cinnamon"  ???  I just don't get it, I have smoked those cigars and never taste chocolate or leather, or some of the other wacky flavors.  But they do taste good, and his descriptions make them sound soo much better.          All I can say is get some of this salt, you will not be disappointed.
