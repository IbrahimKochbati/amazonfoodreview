Yum! I had tried the original and the Bar b q and really liked them so decided to get the variety pack. For whatever reason the 24 pack is cheaper then the 12. The flavored ones do contain a yeast extract which is similar to MSG and gave my grandmother a bad headache. So if you know anyone that has a sensitivity to MSG, do not give them these.  These are tasty and a nice substitute for a greasy potato chip but they are not filling. You are better off eating a granola bar.
