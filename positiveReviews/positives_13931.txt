I tried this PB2 after reading about it in the Hungry Girl Cookbook. I was amazed at how wonderful it was. You can tell that there is no oil in the product so it is a little less creamy than real peanut butter. I LOVE peanut butter, but was doing weight watchers and couldnt justify using my points for real peanut butter. With PB2 I could eat peanut butter all the time and not feel guilty! It gets a little creamier when used with warm toast or on an English Muffin.          I  ough PB2 to work one day and introduced it to my co workers. They asked to buy the jar I had left! They then ordered SIX jars for themselves. If you dont mind the calories, you might want to stick to regular peanut butter. But if you want an alternative that tastes just like peanut butter without the oil... this is EXCELLANT. I now actually prefer this to real peanut butter!!
