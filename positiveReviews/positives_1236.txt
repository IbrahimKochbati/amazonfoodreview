While on a family camping trip with Josh our 8yr old Golden, we ran out of dog food. Stopped at a Wegman's market in Erie PA to shop for a quality food. Settled on the Harmony Farm's chicken. Josh liked it right away.     We've been mixing it with his normal food (Canidae).     He's very healthy and playful, his coat is shiny. He's a happy pup.
