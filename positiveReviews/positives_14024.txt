I was, at first, very skeptical about this product, wondering what peanut butter sans the fat would possibly taste like. But a friend of mine suggested it and said it was really good, so I decided to give it a try. Since I love peanut butter, PB2 is really helping me stay on my lower fat diet, since I can use it just like "regular" peanut butter. It's great for those times, late at night, when you want a snack  just mix it up and smear it on an apple or a banana  very satisfying, and for very few calories, too!
