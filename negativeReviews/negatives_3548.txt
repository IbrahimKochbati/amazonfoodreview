I am not a foodie, but I do like to eat.  Some would say that I love to eat.          The basics: Each packet contains regular microwave popcorn and an envelope of cheese powder to be sprinkled over the popcorn.          Flavor:  The cheese flavor doesn't taste like any cheese that I'd like to eat, if it tastes like cheese at all.  I can't quite place the flavor, but white cheddar?  Not at all.  If real cheese tasted anywhere near this bad, I wouldn't need to go to the gym.  Even people that eat blue cheese would stay away from this stuff.     I bought a single package from my grocer thinking: Hey it is only $1.19.  What could I lose?  Well I lost $1.19 plus tax!     Flavor is a complete bust.          Popcorn:  Nice and fluffy.  If I hadn't sprinkled the mystery powder over all of the popcorn, I would have enjoyed snacking on the plain popped corn. But nooo, in my enthusiasm to finally free myself from the grips of my local gourmet popcorn dealer, I sprinkled the pack of powder on all of the popcorn.  But I digress...  I counted 31 total un popped or partially popped kernels.  The popcorn would have been awesome if not for the `cheese powder'.  (Of course, your results may vary according to your microwave oven and superior button pushing abilities.)          No stars for flavor     Five stars for popcorn.     Overall: One star. There is no need to pay an upcharge for powder that will render your popcorn inedible.
