My Chihuahua has always had problems with the larger sized dry dog food, because he has a very small mouth that is over crowded with teeth. I picked up Solid Gold at my local PetCo after searching for a replacement for his normal dry food (Iams, I know, I know! But I had tried another high quality food a few years ago, and he developed a bladder infection). I didn't realize how small the pieces were until I opened it, I had purchased it based on the  eed size on the bag.          He loves it   the small pieces are perfect for his little mouth and he finishes his serving at once, unlike anything he's eaten before. His coat his healthier, with less shedding and I have noticed less drainage around his eyes.          This is a great product, I highly recommend you try it for your dogs if you're looking for a healthy alternative to the more mainstream commercial dog foods, especially if they are a small toy  eed.
