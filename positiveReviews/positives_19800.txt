Just tried this and love it! Perfect refreshing soda on its own. However my sister added this to a glass of cabernet that I had and it tasted like a wonderful sangria! I am going to snap these up and keep on hand to add to red wine for those that don't love the taste of red wine by itself. Add a little fruit and voila...sangria.
