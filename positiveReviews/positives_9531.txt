These nuts are to die for! And I agree with the other reviewers ... they are absolutely addictive. I'm not a coffee drinker so I wasn't sure I'd like the taste. But they are delicious. Just barely a hint of a coffee flavor to them; it's more of a caramel flavor.  I can't wait until these are available from Amazon.
