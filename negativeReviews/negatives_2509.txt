The 4 pounds of sliced meat itself are contained in a single cardboard box; no vacuum seal or even plastic wrap.  That box is placed in another box that is lined with styrofoam sides, styrofoam peanuts, and three frozen "ice" paks.  It was shipped FedEx 2 Day (that's what the label says), not Overnight or next business day, which begs the question, what exactly did the $52 in shipping charges for 4 lbs of meat and minimal packing materials actually go towards?  I think I know, and it wasn't shipping.          Years ago "Grecian Delight" (the  and on the box) was sold in a local supermarket chain in Gyro Kit boxes   each contained a pack of sliced gyro meat, one pita, and a small container of tzatziki sauce.  I loved them, but I haven't seen the kits in decades and was happy to find a way to once again stock the freezer with gyros in waiting.          The gyro meat itself, which I have ordered before, tastes just like ... gyro meat!  As I said, I love gyros, but there's no place nearby where I can drop in and enjoy one.  So I have ordered the product in the past, but in this case, I've ordered for the last time.          I've gotten the individual 1 lb vacuum packets before 3 at a time and they've arrived frozen or nearly frozen. Not so this box.  The meat was not only thawed, it was only slightly cool. I'm afraid I'm going to be throwing it out.  Too risky.  For $52 shipping charges, it should have arrived in perfect condition. Overnight. I won't make this mistake again.  I can't afford to.
