I love Earl Grey tea, but I'm trying to avoid caffeine. I was happy to find the Twinings Decaf Earl Grey tea, because locally I can only get herbal tea K cups if I want to go caffeine free. I have had the Twinings  and Earl Grey tea (with caffeine) in both tea bags and in a Tassimo T disc. The K cup version of their Earl Grey tea seems to have a much stronger bergamot taste than the other versions. I like my tea on the weak side, so I  ew on the 10 oz. or 12 oz. setting   even so, the bergamot taste is still very strong (almost too much). If you are looking for Earl Grey K cups and don't mind caffeine, I would try the Celestial Seasonings or Bigelow  ands   they are better. If you are trying to avoid caffeine, these will give you more options and although not great   they still make a decent drink.
