While in Thailand for 3 weeks many years ago I discovered "ginger tea" which was (to me) a tasty and warming beverage that calmed my stomach. It took a long time to find an equivalent drink once I got back, but this seems to be the same thing. (ginger tea in tea bags is not the same product, and I could not seem to re create it by boiling fresh ginger) This stuff is great for stomach problems, but I drink it for the taste even when I am fine. I was surprised to find it here on Amazon   I used to have to search larger Asian stores and odd corners of the internet to get it. I am pleased to see that it has become more available.
