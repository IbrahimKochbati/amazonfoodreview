My son loves this pasta!  He is on a GF CF SF diet so has limited food choices.  He used to grab the bag out of the pantry to ask for it.  Now I have added it to his picture cards so he can flip through the cards and ask for it.  He loves the texture and the shapes and colors are fun.  The rest of the family will eat it as well.  It has a great texture when cooked al dente and when stored in the refrigerator does not get mushy.
