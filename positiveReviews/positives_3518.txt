Soon as I got this bag of decaf I made a big mug and it filled my house with the wonderful aroma of high quality fresh  ewed coffee.  It is very finely ground but I still used the same amount I normally do and it turned out great.  I added some soy milk, sat back, and enjoyed my rare treat of an after noon coffee  eak!!!  Definitely will buy some of this for the winter months so I can treat myself to excellent hot coffee any time of the day or night!
