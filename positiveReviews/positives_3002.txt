Since the factory burned down that made Firecracker  and pickled sausage I have had to get by with the individually packaged version which doesn't remotely taste like the kind I grew up with, not to mention they are half the size.  These are the best pickled sausages I've had since my last jar of Firecrackers a couple years ago.  I saw the crappy review and I had to show my support.  As a person who grew up on these things I definitely know what I'm talking about.  If you want burn your mouth out hot then look elsewhere but if you want the best tasting pickled sausage on the market currently look no further!
