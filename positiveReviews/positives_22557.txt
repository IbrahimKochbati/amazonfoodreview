i just bought this to go along with my great northern popper. unfortionaley for me, the popper arrived before the popcorn, so i was left with a  and new popper and nothing to put in it. i ran to the store nd purchased a bag of poping corn, got home, and faced epic dissapointment. it was gross. nothing like i, or the fiance expected. i clened up my popper and unplugged it, figuring it would just sit in our theater as an ornament from then on. the next day, my package of great northern portion bags arrived. we decided to give it another shot, with these portion bags. made one, and holy smokes. so good. just like the theater! the 4oz bag made enough to fill a 52oz tub, with lots leftover. the corn came out yellow, buttery, and delicious. the only downside for me is the salt. very, very salty. next time, i will use only half of the salt.          i also noticied the price difference isnt much for the 8oz portions, it may be more cost effective to purchase them and save the leftover.
