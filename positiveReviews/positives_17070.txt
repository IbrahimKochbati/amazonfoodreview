I got the small for my chihuahua.  He loves it.  I'm giving it fours stars because the bottle is much bigger than what I expected(It could be my fault for not understanding the dimensions).  The dog food comes out easily at first and as the food level drops it does get more challenging.  It keeps him engage and slows down his intake of food.
