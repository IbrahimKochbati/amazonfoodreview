Can't say enough about these chips.  They are only 3 Weight watchers points and are very satisfying.  Hard to believe they are healthy.  I like the portion control of single serve bags for myself and they are quick to pack in a lunch.  One of these bags is a lot more filling than a small bag of chips and taste even better.  I also bought the 3 ounce bags since my entire family loves these. Try these once and you will be hooked.
