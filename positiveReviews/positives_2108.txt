I bought a bowl to pop the corn in along with this popcorn. And put two handsful in the bowl and set the microwave on Popcorn. But it needed more popping for all to pop, in fact almost twice as much time. But the results are great.     Today we will get the seasoning I bought for it and look forward to using it to have a woderful snack while watching TV.
