In the beginning I tried to cancel the order because I felt that it was not what I wanted exactly which is (Lindt Gold Bar).     But It was a great surprise to find in the package what I wanted exactly. The image here is an old one that should be updated.     The packaging was great with thermal insulation and cold packs for the chocolate not to melt in the hot summer.     the price is really the lowest. I searched the internet to find a better price and the best I got was 7.50 usd per each + shipping.     That's why I said it is JUST PERFECT. It made my day
