I am giving these two stars because they did taste sorta good at first.  But like the other reviewer said they do smell funny and they left a bad taste in my mouth.  And they are very salty.  I only cooked them for 90 seconds, the bag was still expanding when I stopped it but they smelled burnt when they were done (they said to cook until it stopped expanding but thank goodness I didn't do that).  Nice idea but I don't think I will buy these again.
