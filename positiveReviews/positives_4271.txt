I really liked this popcorn, and the price is much better than purchasing at a regular supermarket.  If you have at least a 1,000 watt microwave, it is best to use Power level 7 (70%) to start with, and set a timer for one minute until you arrive at the best power level and time for your particular microwave.  Otherwise, smoke or worse may lead you to believe this is a bad product.
