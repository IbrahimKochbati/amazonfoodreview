We just got a new shipment in, and it is not the same Chick Chick our son has come to know and love.  This new stuff resembles the texture of their "Gobble Gobble" food, which our son absolutely hates.  I'm sure this stuff is great, but if you aren't sure your kid will like it, don't spend money on 16 of them up front.          Be aware that you can't return this item.
