After several failed attempts at making yogurt, I discovered the small slip of paper included. It states, to paraphrase, that the unit will only hold the correct temperature for making the yogurt if the room temperature is between 68(F) and 72(F). If the room temperature is higher.. "It is important in summer to use the yogurt maker in an air conditioned room....". I can't imagine turning on the A C to cool the house down to 72(F) JUST to make yogurt! When I DO turn it on, I set it for 80. In the winter, the kitchen is usually 65, so I imagine that would keep the temperature too low for proper incubation.          Unless your kitchen is always around 70 degrees, I'd say pass on this unit.     I'll be listing it on the local FreeCycle board to get rid of it.
