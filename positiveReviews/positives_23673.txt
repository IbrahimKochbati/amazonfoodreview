I originally bought these chips because I'd heard great things about the company and their customer service, but I was a bit underwhelmed with the taste of the product.          Pro:       lower calorie, baked not fried: this is definitely a huge plus!          Con:       I was expecting something more potato ey. Instead of being made with potato bits or mashed up potatoes,  it's mainly potato flour and starch. Therefore, the potato flavor is lackluster to non existent. They're more of a delivery method for the flavoring than a tribute to the great potato.       The salt and vinegar flavor wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, especially since more salt and vinegar wouldn't really increase the calorie count very much. Also, because the underlying "chip" was kind of bland, more flavor would have been beneficial.          Overall   a great snack alternative to chips. I would recommend it for anyone who loves snacks with the texture of cheetos and those puffy rice crackers. If you're looking for something with potato flavor as well as salt and vinegar, you might want to look elsewhere.
