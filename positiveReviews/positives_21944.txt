What a relief that Tinkyada rice pasta exists.  The other  ands don't compare in flavor, consistency or the way that they cook. Most need to be rinsed several times after cooking in order not to be gloppy, but we don't find this with Tinkyada.          Because we're purchasing this for children, we're so pleased that Tinkyada offers several different shapes of pasta.  Often, I can cook the same shape of rice pasta and classic pasta for my husband.  My only hope is that Tinkyada will add even more...farfalle, Tinkyada??          Great product, and amazon offers the best price.  Hopefully, it will one day be offered as a s&s item.
