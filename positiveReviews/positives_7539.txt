Chia seeds are an amazing nutritional powerhouse   and to me, they don't even really taste like anything (which is a positive; no funky taste here)!  They are great sprinkled on salads, added to a smoothie, used to make raw vegan pudding, etc.  Its uses are many!          Also   I wanted to add that this is a really good price.  My co op charges almost $20 lb. for chia seeds, and Amazon has them for just over $13!
