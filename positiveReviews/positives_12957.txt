Most of the carbonated juice drinks I've tried have either been far too sweet, far too carbonated, or just plain nasty.  So I tried The Switch with more than a little trepidation.  But this is not like any other carbonated juice I've ever had   it's actually good.          First thing that hits you when you open the can is the scent    it actually smells like fruit!  I know that may seem like a "DUH!" moment, but trust me, I've had some that didn't smell anything like the fruit they allegedly had in them.  The Switch is lightly carbonated; one thing I really hate is when the carbonation overpowers the drink, but The Switch doesn't do that at all.          Since there's no added sugar in this drink, the sweet comes from the fruit.  That means it's not sickeningly sweet when you drink it, but it's also not bitter.  There did seem to be more strawberry than kiwi in the drink, but it was very good; a welcome change from typical juice or soda.
