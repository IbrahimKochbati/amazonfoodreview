If you suffer from heartburn, acid reflux, this is the ideal way to continue enjoying coffee drinking.          Being low in acid does not really alter the coffee flavor to a great degree.          I would describe the taste as mellow and more subtle, but it does have that delicious coffee aroma and flavor.          I will try the other flavor, Low Acid House Blend as well.          Being one who has frequent heartburn, I recommend it highly. You woj't be disappointed.
