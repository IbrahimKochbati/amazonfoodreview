My family has been through many cans of these wonderful Royal Oak peanuts. The peanuts are large, crisp, and have just the right amount of salt. The biggest problem is trying not to eat the whole can the day they arrive! We have little salsa bowls in which we put 1 3 oz of peanuts at a time to limit the overeating. In addition to using them for a snack they are just fantastic for a trail mix (mix equal part peanuts, M&Ms, and raisins...you will never buy pre made trail mix again). And they are also great in Kung Pao stir fry dishes.  Oh, the heavy gauge aluminum foil seal that you have to  eak to get to the peanuts can be deadly if you are not careful. I recommend piercing it with a sharp, serrated knife and cutting the foil out all at once to protect your hands. BTW use the back end of a spoon to pry the lid off the first few times you open the can.
