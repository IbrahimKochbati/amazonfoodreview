I wanted to try something new and bought this moroccan mint and the orange spice teas by Numi last year. I loved them both but I find this moroccan mint is my ultimate favorite tea! I am so very glad I found this tea! I LOVE it!! If you like a sweet mint flavor this is the tea for you! Delicious!! I have given one to every tea loving person I know and they ALL loved it!          I rarely drink any tea but Numi anymore. It is a bit pricey compared to other name  and teas but so worth every penny in my opinion! Plus, I easily get at least two cups of tea out of one bag. :)
