I got this to use in combination w  Pink Lotus, California Poppy, Mandrake (all same seller) & Belladona (different seller). I have never ordered from this company & was a little nervous ordering over ocean, however my order came very quickly, was very well packaged, and the bottles are of good study quality. Price is also good for the 4oz & I didn't have to pay shipping w  my order.          I have had long term sleep issues and got these to help & they do seem to be helping   these are used in combo w  Passion  Flower & 5HTP, which is a combo that I have created for my specific needs. I do put them all in a glass and add just a smidge of water to help them go down.          I will buy more from this company   I like the variety they offer & the practices advertised.
