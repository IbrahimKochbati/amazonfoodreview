I love Revv Pulse.  I find it very flavorful for when you want something strong.  I don't know if it gives me any more energy than a regular coffee, but it can't hurt, and I actually think the Pulse variety tastes better than the regular Revv flavor.  I'm a huge fan of my Keurig and have tried almost every  and and flavor, and I dig this stuff.
