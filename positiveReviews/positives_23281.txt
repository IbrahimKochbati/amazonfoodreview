My daughter is on the autism spectrum and very picky.  She has also recently been discovered to have sensitivities to wheat, dairy, eggs, soy etc..  This was our last hope for her to be able to have a sandwich.  We ordered the single package first and prepared it with the suggested egg replacement, in our  ead machine on the gluten free setting, which did not mix well, and was not fully cooked in the middle when finished.  So we took a leap of faith and ordered the 6 pack of Pamela's  ead to try again because the taste seemed very good from the small pieces we ripped off the ends.  When I made this the second time I used the regular oven, and used less liquid (as suggested on the package to avoid under cooking)    and tada!!!  It's wonderful, and lighter and softer than any other gluten free mix we've tried (we've tried 4 others) and my daughter ate it!  She can now enjoy a cashew butter and preservative free jelly sandwich on real  ead!  Whew! Thank you Pamela.
