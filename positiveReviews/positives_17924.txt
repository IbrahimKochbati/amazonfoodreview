This Shake 'n Bake was really yummy. It made the chops crispy without adding all of the fat. The flavor was delicious without being overbearing as well. It had caramel color in it, though. I prefer to use products without added coloring. So, I won't get it again. If you aren't funny about added colors, you will love this stuff!
