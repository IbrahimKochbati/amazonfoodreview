If you want to make authentic Italian risotto for a reasonable price, buy this rice! Vialone Nano is   in my opinion   the very best for making risotto. You have to follow the true process, starting with sweated shallots, then parching the rice, then deglazing with white wine, and finally adding hot stock in small amounts while stirring often. If you follow this procedure (and or find a good recipe), you will be rewarded with some of the creamiest, most mouth meltingly tender rice you've ever had. Why pay for it in a restaurant when it's so easy to make at home?
