The Offspring being my favorite band, I had to try this. It has a really good taste, and I can't get over Dexter on the label. XD       PS  on their website, it has a recipe for beer mixed with some Gringo Bandito. For all the minors, just use coke. Not only is it good, but the reaction on people's face when you tell them it's mixed with hot sauce is priceless.       And finally, my personal favorite is a Wahoos' fish taco with a lot of GB on it. THAT is amazing.
