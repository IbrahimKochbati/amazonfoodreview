Some of the jerkey is chewey and hard to eat. I am a big fan of jack links beef jerkey. I wouldnt buy again because so many pieces are hard to eat being chewy or vainy. Ah well have 3 more packs to give a try. The price was good but still I personally couldn't eat 1 out of 3 pieces. Could be just spoiled with others i guess.
