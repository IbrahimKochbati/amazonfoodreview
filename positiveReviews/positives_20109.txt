This molasses is for eating.  It has a nice mellow flavor compared to some blackstaps but is still stronger most store bought molasses.  It still high in nutrients particularly Iron, and makes for a healthier alternaive for sweetening pancakes and waffles.          The last time I purchased it was at a fairly low price even figuring in the shipping.  It is a great value at that price.
