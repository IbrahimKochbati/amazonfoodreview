Not sure if this was AUTHENTIC Cosmic Catnip, as it had a lot more larger bits of stems and coarse material. My cats had loved this stuff when I had gotten a small sample from a local pet store. So, I thought it would be a great idea to get this larger size, but the catnip was not the same. My cats barely like this stuff and it even hurts my fingers when I pinch it to release the aroma. Would not recommend this 3 oz size!
