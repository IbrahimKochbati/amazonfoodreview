Forget Starbucks, Peets or anything else. This is the real deal. Like a good vintage wine, Britt coffee is truly gourmet with no after taste! I am really fussy about coffee, and generally avoid it, but after a trip to Costa Rica fell in love with the beverage again! You have to use a French Press to get the full favor so throw away those other coffee making contraptions, your beans deserve the best, your taste buds deserve the best too. No I don't work for Britt and did not get paid to say this!!!!!  But if you guys at Britt read this send me a sample or two!!
