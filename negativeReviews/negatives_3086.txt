My son loves the Astronaut Ice Cream which is why I searched and found this product.  He definitely enjoyed the packaging (cool little box it came in) and he enjoyed that I found the product he loves to buy at the museums so the gift was not a bust but the quantity was too small to justify the price.  There is more info in the description now about what you get but I was surprised to get so little.  Simply you get 3 of the astro ice cream packs that you would buy in the museum gift shops plus a few small items that were not of much interest to my son.  It would be less than half the cost to buy him 3 packs of the astro food at retail (museum shops).          Check the bulk packs of 10 of the astro ice cream from the same supplier seller.  These are about a 1 3 more expensive right now compared to the sampler but you get more than 3 times the quantity of astro ice cream.  I gave 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 because it is a unique and sort of cool gift for someone who likes this astro ice cream. They would get 5 stars if the quantity was fair   say 5 of the astro ice cream which would be 15bucks at the gift shops then the other stuff and packaging is maybe worth the extra 5bucks.
