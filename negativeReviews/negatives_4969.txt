Was excited about this tough toy, but gave it to our 96 lb puppy who tore the rope apart in less than an hour. He is usually really good with toys that dispense treats but this time since he couldn't figure out the pulling, because it wasn't really working, he just decided to chew the rope. Threw it away because it was also too noisy and scratching up the wood floors.
