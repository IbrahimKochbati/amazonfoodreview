This salt is great! Not meant as a cooking salt, this is to be sprinkled on food as a finishing salt. It gives a wonderful salty taste to nearly anything, even if little or no salt is used in preparation. I use far less salt when cooking but still have the taste. Other sea salts I've tried are too hard and crunchy. This one has very thin pyramid shaped crystals. It adds perfect crunch and flavor to meats, vegetables, and salads.
