These crackers are the best I've tried so far.  If I didn't have celiac's disease, I'd buy a non gluten free cracker, but am very pleased with the consistency (softer than others I've tasted) of this gluten free cracker and it doesn't have that "peppery" taste that most others have.  They're great in soup or with peanut butter or cheese as a snack.
