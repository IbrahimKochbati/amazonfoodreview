SO GOOD.     Just in case anyone was wondering. I know every vegan vegetarian says this, but even my carnivorous  other liked it. He's the crazy outdoors type though  savage all the way, carving things out of wood, building shelters in the woods, survival stuff. So I trust his meat comparison ratings. Most veggie people, when it comes to fake meat, tend to say "it's all about the sauce". While this is true, this also has the texture. It's more of the soft slim jim texture I remember (though we can argue  is that really meat? hah)  moist and moderately chewy. I'm curious if sticking these in a dehydrator will make them more jerky like. Anyway I like the mesquite lime. It's not too sweet, tangy and just delicious. I recommend!
