I have ordered Bonne Maman Preserves for well over a year from Amazon because the prices could not be beaten anywhere in my area.  The third order back arrived with the jars  oken due to poor packing.  Ironically this order was not filled by Amazon but a different vendor.  Nevertheless Amazon promptly refunded my money.  I was a little hesitant about ordering again because of this ( oken jars of preserves can be pretty messy)but when I realized that the order was filled by a vendor I had not used before not Amazon, I decided to order again. That order arrived with no problem and since then I have ordered again several times with no issues at all. Each of the glass jelly jars "arrived alive", carefully packed.  Of course the preserves and jelly are the best I have tasted rivaling "homemade" (which we used to do when we were younger and into canning several fruits and vegetables".  In my opinion I like the Raspberry and Blackberry preserves the best so usually I order the six packs of those specifically  j rather than the assortment.  I have to admit however when my granddaughter stays with us she is a huge fan of her "Poppie's"  special strawberry preserves and peanut butter sandwiches. I would recommend that when you order look closely at the vendor who will fulfill the order and go with Amazon.  Generally I look for the "This order ships free with..." and that offer will usually be fulfilled by Amazon.
