I've been using this food for my cat ever since he had some UT issues and the vet recommended we switch to a wet food. I looked for a food where the primary ingredients were actually meat or fish. All of Merrick's flavors have meat or fish or poultry (depending on flavor) as the primary ingredient. My cat loves them all! I feed him a half can mixed with water at night and in the morning. His coat is amazing; I noticed a huge improvement in his coat and energy level when I started using this over the cheap o dry food.
