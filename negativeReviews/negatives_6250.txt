We got the 6 pack of  own rice and it smell very strange, almost like rancid nuts. I did TONS of research to find out this was normal or if the cereal really was rancid. I opened several cans and they all smell the same. Other people had the same experience, and apparently the smell is normal. My 7 month old daughter seems to like it and her poos have gotten softer, constipation had been an issue before :(     Three stars because it smells and tastes very strong.
