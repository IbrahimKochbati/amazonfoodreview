I have been trying many different  ands and types of maple syrup because my family loves homemade waffles and pancakes and Coombs Organic Grade B is the best so far. The Grade B has a richer flavor than Grade A. It may be a little pricey but keep in mind that it lacks all of the chemicals and additives. It's just pure maple syrup!
