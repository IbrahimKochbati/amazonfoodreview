The taste is decent.  Not good, but not really horrible.  If it didn't kick off my reflux, I could live with it.  But, unfortunately, it does, so I can't, so the taste is irrelevant.  I appreciate them trying!  Maybe a dark french roast isn't the best flavor for a low acid coffee drink though?          I'm rating this three stars because I think someone with less severe reflux might be okay with it.
