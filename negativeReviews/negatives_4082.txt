First, I'll give the manufacturer some credit for making a no additive, sucralose only product. The problem with this product is: it's just too weak, in flavor that is. 1 gram of this "pure sucralose" tastes about as strong as 1 gram of a Splenda packet, for comparison.     If you don't mind spending a lot for a little bit of pure sucralose taste, then maybe this is for you, but cost conscious customers might want to look elsewhere for a no carb, non calorie sweetener.
