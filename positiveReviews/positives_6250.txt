We usually have fresh lemon grass tea at our local Zen center. It is extremely easy to make, put a few blades of lemon grass in a pot to steep and you will get a fantastic tasting tea.          This tea is here is a fine replacement for when you cannot get fresh lemon grass. Lemon grass has many health benefits. It is said to detoxify the liver and can lower uric acid levels, this is important if you have gout.          Because you get such a large quantity here on Amazon it should last you quite a while. Caffeine free and light it makes a very refreshing afternoon tea.          Give it a try!          Thank you for reading my review.
