These are thick, hearty treats that come in squares of two you can  eak apart. They smell like graham crackers!! My dog is very picky and really loves these snacks. He also has very sensitive skin and so far so good with that. No hot spots or anything. His food is an organic duck rice mix with no fillers. The ingredients on these treats are simple as well.  I will be buying these again!
