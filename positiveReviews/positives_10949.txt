These are by far the best GF cracker on the market. They are crispie and hold up nicely when toppings are added. My 10 year old son really likes them and he is a fussy eater! We have not been able to find a decent GF  ead for sandwiches so these crackers and a couple of thick pieces of GF Boar's Head ham and he's a happy camper.
