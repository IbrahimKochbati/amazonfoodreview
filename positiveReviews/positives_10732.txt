I have two chihuahuas who couldn't even get their mouths around these treats.  I would have  oken them into smaller chunks, but they are very hard.  So, for small dogs these treats are a bust, but I took them next door and tried them out on my neighbors golden labs and they were a hit!  I'd guess that any dog over about 30 40 pounds would be able to crack into these treats without a problem, but dogs smaller than that probably won't be able to chew them.
