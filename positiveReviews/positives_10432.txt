I cook this product in soy milk. I add one packet in 1 2 cup of soy milk. It cooks in about 3 minutes. It tastes wonderful. It makes you feel full. It is low in calories. Everytime I feel hungry and I do not want to spoil my diet, I eat a bowl of Glutenfrieda granola. It promotes you being a vegetarian and losing weight. I recommend it highly.
