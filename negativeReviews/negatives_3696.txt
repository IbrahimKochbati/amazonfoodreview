My kids and I love root beer and I  ew my own from time to time. Recently while purchasing some specialty versions from a local store I saw the Jack Blacks Red Dead Root Beer and thought the label was cool so I grabbed a couple. After we sampled it, all I can say is don't waste your time. It has little to no root beer flavor,it finishes a little spicy in fact. It has caffine added which was a bit of a put off as well. I was very disappointed with the flavor of this product. If you want a pick me up and you don't mind it tasting like sugar water mixed with dish soap then this is the drink for you.
