Skyy likes this toy. It took her a while to figure out who to move the spinner toy, but once she got it, there was no stopping her. It's not as exciting for as her Smart Toys IQ Treat Ball, but she still gets excited when she sees me filling it. She runs to the rug where, I usually put it, and she has fun pushing it to get her treasures out. A great entertaining, and stimulating, toy for any dog! Highly recommend!
