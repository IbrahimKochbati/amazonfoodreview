I was a little leary of getting my favorite frozen juice in a can.It is very good and had a good expiration date.I just orcered the 24 pack and will be interested to see the expiration date.It is so nice to have one less thing to haul home from the grocery.The price on the 12 pack is good and the 24 pack is priced even lower.Now if I could only buy groceries on my Kindle.....
