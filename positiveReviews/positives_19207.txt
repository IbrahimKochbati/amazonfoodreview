Our dog loves this game even with just 1 treat (or piece of food) per section   and will "play" over and over again.  We just have to watch she doesn't try to eat the yellow cups but the blue part is durable.  She easily figured out, tho, that she can move it around instead of spinning the disc to get the treats out.  She knows where we store this game and tries to get into the cabinet to get it out!  Great price at Amazon and a good value dog toy.  I would buy this again.
