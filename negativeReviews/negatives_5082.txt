Well this certainly didn't last long with my german shepard mix puppy.  It less than an hour she had shredded the rope, splitting it into two pieces.  Once the knot in the jug dropped to the bottom she was able to empty all the treats quickly.  I used it again with larger treats inside and no rope.  That worked for about 20 minutes until she ripped the nub coating off the neck of the bottle and started crushing the neck portion.  I had to take it away and toss it, getting only 2 uses and less than 2 hours out of it.
