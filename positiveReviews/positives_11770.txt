I am on a quest to replace any and all of the enriched  ead products my family eats with 100% whole grain products....that taste good....without  eaking the bank.  This mix totally fits the bill.  None of us could believe that these pancakes were made from whole grains let alone a mix.  Most of the time I make pancakes from scratch   not anymore   this is just way too easy and hearty.  The price is right and my family is happy.  We will continue to buy these for a long time :)
