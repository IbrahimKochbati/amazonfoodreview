To purchase these, you must buy 6 tubes and pay expensive shipping costs.  I was excited and willing because I love this flavor, but over time, I realized the unopened tubes were leaking on the box and the boxes were sticking to my pantry shelf.  I threw them all away which made it a complete waste.  I would have tried to rescue the paste earlier by putting it in plastic tubs and freezing or SOMETHING.  BTW, the expiration date on the unopened tubes was 16 11 2012. (European labeling)  The tubes appear to be about to explode which leads me to believe there could be possibly be bacterial contaminants?  I don't know, but something made these packages leak on the crimped edges. Obviously, I would not recommend OR buy them again.
