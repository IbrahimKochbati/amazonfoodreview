I have been eating these for years. They are quick to microwave, tasty and not terribly bad for you.     I first found them about 10 years ago on a local grocery store shelf. Soon after, they were gone from the stores for some reason. Found them on Amazon a few of years ago, and have been ordering them ever since. Always good.     Tip: Make sure you store them at a reasonable temperature. I let some get too warm in my luggage, and they sort of spoiled before I could micriwave them.
