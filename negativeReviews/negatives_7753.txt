I was very excited about getting this item, in fact I paid to have it delivered next day. It sounded delicious. Cherries, coconut, and Chamomile   How can you go wrong, right?          Let's just put it this way: I made my first pot of this around 1pm. by 1:15 that pot was down the drain.          I tried it so many ways. No sugar, little sugar, lots of sugar. Each time I took a sip I gagged. The actual product smells very sharp, and the  ewed product had a VOMIT aftertaste. I'm not exaggerating here, it actually reminded me of being sick.          Needless to say, this is the last batch I make of this flavor. It will go into the potted plants for fertilizer.
