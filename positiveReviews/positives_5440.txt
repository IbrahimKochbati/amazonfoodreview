These were just what I was looking for, however, when using in my Cuisinart they leak and back up water which spurts out in different areas of my K Cup area. I don't want to ruin my machine, so I'm trying different things with this disposable cup, i.e., smaller amount of coffee, packing it looser, and smaller amount of water for cup size.  Still leaks some, but it's getting better as before I had about 3 to 4 areas of dripping water coffee, some hitting inside the coffee cup and several outside of coffee cup.
