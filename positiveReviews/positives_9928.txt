I use quite a lot of anise seed in baking    for biscotti especially, but also for cookies, and some meat dishes. The little jars in the grocery store are inordinately expensive,so I checked the internet. Most spice companies had good prices but ridiculous shipping costs. Amazon.com to the rescue! This anise seed from Frontier is of excellent quality, potent and aromatic, packaged perfectly, and at a great price. I will definitely re order.
