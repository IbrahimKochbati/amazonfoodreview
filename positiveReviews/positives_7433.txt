do you like dark chocolate?  wish you could find quality dark chocolate cocoa mix?  this is the real deal!  i have tried a few different "dark" chocolate mixes.  this one stands above others in it's smooth'ness and creamy quality.  nice and dark, add some honey or cinnamon and you'll have a fantastic cuppa cocoa.
