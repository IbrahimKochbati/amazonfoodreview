I like a nice pork chop from time to time, and I like it  eaded. Trouble is, the  eading doesn't always stay put. By the time the chop goes into the oven, those crumbs are everywhere but on the meat. Shake N Bake solved that problem with its innovative shake before baking process, although you could use any  eading as long as you shake rather than roll or dip the chops into the crumbs. But these are the folks who apparently invented the process, so one really should refrain from shaking and baking when using other  ands of  eading. Since a pork chop is pretty tasty with this particular mix, I recommend it. It made my chops nice and crispy, the way I like 'em.
