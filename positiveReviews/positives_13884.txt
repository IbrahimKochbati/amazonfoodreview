This is a great product; tastes great, much healthier than regular commercial peanut butter.  Unfortunately, it is also available everywhere else on the internet for $3.99 while it's nearly $12 on Amazon.  I notified Amazon of this 300% difference in price nearly two months ago and they assured me they would look into it.  No adjustment to the price has been made and I would assume at this point, that it won't be.          Buy the product but buy it anywhere else.
