I have used this dog food for years.  About a year ago they reduced the size of the bag and increased the price.  I continued to buy it.  No one told me there was any change in formula.  My elderly dog started getting hot spots and vomiting yellow stuff. I thought it was just an upset tummy. The vet treated her with antacids and cortizone creams. My poor dog has been through a lousy time.  She was drinking massive amounts of water. I had her kindeys and blood sugar checked.  She was ok there.  Last month, I changed her to California Naturals because it costs less and I can get it at a cheaper store. She has stopped vomiting and doesn't drink as much water.  I didn't even think about it, until I was reading the reviews online and saw the same symptoms in other people's dogs.  I will not go back to Canadae.  Keep away from this crappy dog food.  If your dog is the least bit sensitive, it will create toxic effects for your dog. It is poisonious to those dogs with allergies.
