i had a kerig before and it  oke. the company said it was because i was using expresso in the k cup and it was to fine and cloged the machine. kerig does not make a k cup with  ish coffee so when i found these i was very happy. i have been using these for about a month and i love them and it is so much cheaper. i would highly recommend these.
