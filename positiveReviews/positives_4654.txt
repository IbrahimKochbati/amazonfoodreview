Just kind of yeast shopping one day. You're at the store and thinking, man, I really need to get me some new yeast. This sounded intriguing. An Alt strain, clean and rapid fermentation. Tolerant of cold conditions. In short, it is a hard working and industrious yeast that does its job without much fanfare. And it cleans up after itself. Only the Germans would have such a yeast. It's not like the California yeasts that are kind of fruity, or the British yeasts that just leave a mess. It's very German.          You could easily pass this off as a lager yeast. I did a very simple wheat   pale malt light ale. 1.032 OG. 1.008 FG. Fermented at about 60 62 give or take. Grain to bottle in a week. I wasn't too concerned with flocculation or haze but that's just me. Cracked on the other day just to get a taste. Extremely clean. You can taste every single grain of the malt. I didn't hop it much. Maybe 15 IBU tops with magnum. Very nice lawnmower or pounding beer.          Blow off tube is mandatory. Next project is a 1.062 American wheat. Blew out the airlock. I had 5 gallons in a 6 gallon carboy and it wanted enough space for 10 gallons. Very vigorous.          If you want an absolutely crisp, clean yeast that produces very lager like beers and can tolerate temps down to about 55, this is it. Seems to really accentuate malt. Very nice yeast, but I like a little yeast profile so I don't know if I'm in love with it. Just impressed at how clean it is.
