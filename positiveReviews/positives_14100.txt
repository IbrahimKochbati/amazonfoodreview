It was a pleasant surprise to learn that one can buy loose tea on Amazon, though I admit to a degree of trepidation because I had never heard of Davidson's Tea before. Their catalog of available teas is quite large, and it quickly became a matter of choosing teas for now and saving new teas for later, because their descriptions are both interesting and helpful. Their packaging is good; delivery was timely; but the real test is   how does it taste? I enjoy the full bodied flavor of Assam, and this is an excellent tea. I recommend it highly to other customers, and I will be re ordering when this lot has been happily consumed.
