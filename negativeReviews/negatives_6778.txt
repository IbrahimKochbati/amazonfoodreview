I agree with earlier review. Generally I would say, "buyer beware!" and "read the label, and set a better table."     What it says on the front is "Dry Roasted Peanuts." the other kind is "salted." It wasn't until I got them home and popped the top that I noted they were flavored and saw the MSG listed in the ingredients. I would not have bought them otherwise.          I didn't mind most of the other flavorings, but the MSG is just not a necessary ingredient  Furthermore, there is NO contact information for the company on the label. It was only looking them up on the web that I discovered they are part of the Diamond Nut Company. Will not purchase again.
