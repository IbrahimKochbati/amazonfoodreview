While I think this is 'ok' as far as using as peanut butter (better than all the peanut butter substitutes I've tried, but still a weird peanut butter consistency), what it excels at is sauces and dips. Great for veggie dips. AWESOME added in at the end of a stir fry, to give a great peanut flavor and to thicken your sauce. It is outstanding some fresh udon noodles, a little black bean soy sauce, some stir fried meat and veggies (stir fried in  oth, not oil), then add it at the end to thicken the  oth soy for an excellently flavoured and low fat dinner.
