I love spicy snacks and was looking for something a bit spicier than Flamin Hot Cheetos.  I have several bottles of Blair's hot sauces so I knew that I would definitely not be disappointed with the spice level on these chips.  The first few chips that I put in my mouth, were spicy, but more flavor than I expected.  So I ate a couple more.  Then the heat intensity starts to kick in. Unlike other habanero foods, this one had a bit of a creeper affect rather than hitting you like a freight train from the beginning.  Then my mouth started to burn and the tears started rolling.  God, how I love that feeling.  Sadistic, I know. They really do make you feel alive.  I keep several bags at work so I can have something to get over the afternoon hump around 3 pm.  They do the job well as I get a level of alertness that caffeine just can't deliver.  It also makes me appear like a more sensitive guy since I am crying the whole time.  Eating these chips has also produced a nice side effect for me   I am unbelievably hydrated throughout the day.  My skin has never looked better.  The only warning I would give when eating these chips is that the pepper powder they use is extremely light. So when you pop them in your mouth, you will inevitably get some up your nose via your nasopharynx.  It will make you sniffle like a coke addict from the 80s. A bit annoying but great for clearing up sinuses. Oh yeah, my best advice is that you should really wash your hands thoroughly before using the bathroom   like 2 3 times.  Otherwise a fate that I wouldn't even wish upon my worst enemy will await you. Let's just say I am prone to learning life lessons the hard way. i won't go into details but it involved milk and was something like a scene out of American Pie.
