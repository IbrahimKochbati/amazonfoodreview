Pumpkin seed butter is a bit runnier than regular peanut butter or cashew butter (for comparison).  However, pumpkin seeds are a good source of omega3 fatty acids and the pumpkin seed butter is a nice alternative to eating all those pumpkin seeds.  I've ordered it a couple of times and shared it with my family and co workers.  They didn't seem to care for it, so it's probably a bit of an acquired taste. Knowing it is good for me is enough of an incentive for me to eat it, but not so much for others.  This product will last you a while.  Now, cashew butter on the other hand, will go quickly!  Everyone seems to love that.
