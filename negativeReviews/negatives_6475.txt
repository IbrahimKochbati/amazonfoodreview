If this is white tea I'll  ew my hat and drink it. I was surprised to find green tea in the bag labeled Organic White Peony (100% organic white tea). Whether they made a mistake or this is bait and switch, I've consumed enough white and green tea to know the difference. I won't be buying from Boston Tea again, can't trust them.
