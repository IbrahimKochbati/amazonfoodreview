I have tried several other  ands of dental chews for my 11 year old black lab, Bonnie.  She "inhales" most other dental chews thus defeating their purpose.  I bought the extra lg C.E.T. Hextra and she loves them!  I cut them in half so I get 2 months from the 30 count package.  It takes her about 10 minutes of chewing before finally devouring  and after 2 weeks, there is a noticeable improvement in her teeth and gums.  I do watch her to assure she doesn't try to swallow whole pieces but, so far, it hasn't been a problem.  I will be ordering more from Amazon as this packages dwindles.  I have recommended this product to friends who have old and young large dogs and have received postive feedback from all. Now if I could find something similar for this old human's use.
