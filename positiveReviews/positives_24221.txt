Love this stuff.  On eggrolls or anything asian and suddenly your in you favorite chinese restaurant   or better yet, traveling somewhere near The Great Wall!  I'm so addicted to this stuff.  It's delicious and goes great with Moo Shoo anything!  If you're a chinese food lover, you know this sauce is a MUST.  Settle for nothing less.  Love this stuff.  Sweet, salty and tangy.  Just how it should be!  ~  Yum!  ~  Oh by the way ... a little goes a long long way!
