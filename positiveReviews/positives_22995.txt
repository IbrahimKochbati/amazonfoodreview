Olive oil is not only good for its flavor and its health benefits,it's also an excellent all purpose skin emollient and hair conditioner. I like Bertolli's excellent flavor for salad dressings and tomato based sauces. And I use it as my deep conditioner, alternating it with coconut oil in my lavish curly mane for my weekly hot oil treatment. Hey, what's not to love???
