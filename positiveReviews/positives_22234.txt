I have to eat gluten free and I'm allergic to rice and yeast.  This is really limiting, in terms of  ead products, more so than most celiacs.  I buy a ton of these mixes because they taste good and mix up quickly.  I bake them in my toaster oven and can have a bun to make a sandwich in less than half an hour.  My favorite is the pizza mix, but the All Purpose Mix is the one I use the most.
