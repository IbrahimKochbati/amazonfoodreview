Greenies are an great product   they are very attractive to my dog, who can be picky about treats, and provide a good chew that helps address his tartar problems, and Amazon has among the best price I've found.          As long as you have someplace out of dog nose reach to store the box, Greenies are a great way to help your dogs teeth stay clean and thus avoid the further health issues that result from canine dental problems.
