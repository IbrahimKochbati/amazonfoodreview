This is a great product to use for a treat in the kong toy. I found it a little cheaper at the pet store, but online it goes for the same price at most places when I was doing a price comparison. Also, it's great to not have to go out and buy it when you can just receive it in the mail! My dog will love this for Christmas in her stocking.
