I made this purchase with a bit of caution due to the fact that I'd made a more expensive purchase for Rum Flavored Coffee (different  and, different vendor) a short while back and was highly disappointed:  I'd paid dearly for an extremely poor product that had less taste than Wal mart great value  and.  Anyway, when I received this pumpkin flavored coffee and opened the bag the aroma immediately told me I had a worthy product.  After  ewing a pot the taste told me that indeed I had.  I intend to also try their other flavors.
