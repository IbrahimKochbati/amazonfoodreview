I live in the area where these cookies are made, and I remember buying them from local coffee stands when they first started making them years ago    each one was wrapped in saran wrap and had a handwritten label on them.  The packaging has changed, and there are many different flavors available now, but the original  eakfast cookie still tastes just as good today as those first ones did.          The smaller size is great for a snack, as the large ones are enough for two people!  Full of good stuff, not too sweet...it's a treat that you can feel good about.
