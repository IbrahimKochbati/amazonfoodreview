My big yellow lab was initially unenthusiastic about these treats, I think primarily because they seem different consistency wise than the dog snacks she's used to (bones).  These are sort of like a hard cookie, and they don't smell bad the way that some dog treats do.  After initially leaving the treat alone she came back to finish it and now she'd eat them all day if I let her.  I have a big dog, but it seems like it would be difficult for a smaller dog to eat because it doesn't  eak up that easily (although there is an indentation in the middle that makes it easier to  eak it in half if you want to).
