I bought this product because it was listed as the coffee capsules for the Nespresso coffee maker.  It wasn't!  The capsules were too big.  When I contacted Amazon they told me I couldn't return the product, but gave me a partial refund. (Okay)  When I told them they were advertising for the wrong coffee maker, they said I could contact the manufacturer. These capsules are probably great, for the right coffee maker, but not I'm not happy that I was mislead.
