I bought all the flavors of NurturMe offered on Amazon and we decided to try the peas first.  When I mixed the formula in, I could not believe how  ight green the peas were.  I tasted them and they tasted like the freshest peas I ever ate.  I had only planned to throw these in the diaper bag for a quick feeding on the go with easy portability, but so far these are the only peas my daughter will eat!  Next we tried the apples and they were better than the best applesauce I've ever had.  I make my own baby food, and because many fruits and veggies arent the best right now, these powdered baby foods are better than what I can make homemade!  Every flavor has been as good as the last.  All are  ight, colorful, and taste very, very fresh.
