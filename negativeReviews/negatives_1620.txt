Switch markets itself as an alternative to soda.  It is essentially carbonated fruit juice with no added sweeteners.  I do agree that if you are a person who drinks a lot of soda or have  child who does, switching to his would be the better alternative.     BUT   this drink is not healthy by any means, the amount of fruit juice required for it's tastiness results in a HIGH sugar and calorie content for a fruit juice.  You would not want to drink 5 of these in a day and the better option would be a piece of fruit with less calories and sugar.
