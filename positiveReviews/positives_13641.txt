Since switching to a low carb diet, Erythritol and Xylitol have become my friends.  Each has its own pros and cons, so I mix them.  Erythritol doesn't cause as much gas, but it leaves a cool sensation in the mouth which can be distracting.  Xylitol is good for your teeth, but may make some people feel like the Hindenburg.  Both taste sweet and don't leave an aftertaste.  So I figure the best bet is to buy a bag of each and mix them together.  Note that both these products are small crystals which do not dissolve very easily in liquid.  The best way around this is to pulverize them with a coffee grinder.  Just a few seconds will  eak up the crystals into a powder which will dissolve just fine.
