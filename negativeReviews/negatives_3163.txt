I love the idea of this product but with larger pills the beef pill pockets are much easier to mold around the pill than the chicken. Although my dogs love both flavors my boxer can easily eat the pill pocket and spit out the pill with the chicken flavor but does not do that with the beef flavor again because it is easier to bury the entire pill in the pocket using the beef.  They work great with smaller pills.
