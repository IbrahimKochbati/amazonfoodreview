These are basically the same texture as Milk Bones for large dogs, but rectangular (2.25" x 1.25" x 0.5"). They have a ridge across the top so you can snap the biscuit in two. I cannot always get them to  eak, but I'm an older woman.     Both the Rottweiler and the Cocker Spaniel like them.  The cocker has the same problem I do, the hard texture.  But this is no problem for the larger dog.     My experience with the Newman's Own  ands has always been positive.  And this really is a product from New Zealand.     Here's the ingredients list:     organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic apples, palm oil, organic molasses.          I would consider buying them, but only for larger dogs or ones with strong jaws.
