I was not expecting this coffee to actually be shipped from Jamaica, so I was pleasantly surprised to find a FedEx International package at my door.  One cannot argue that it didn't come from Jamaica! I assumed it would be shipped via a distributor in the US.  I guess that just proves what they say about assuming...          The coffee is real smooth and enjoyable.  Unlike other "Jamaica grown" products I tried during my youth   this one you can proudly admit you really did inhale the sweet aroma!          It comes packed in a burlap bag with the sealed coffee bag inside, just like the picture.  It arrived fresh.          As with any of these boutique coffees, you pay a premium   like the Hawaiian Kona coffees   so it's really a matter of taste and the depth of your pocketbook if you think they are worth the price.
