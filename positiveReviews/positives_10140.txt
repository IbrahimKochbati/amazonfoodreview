I bought 3 pasta shape varieties of these 8 oz. 2 serving bags of noodles in liquid in the refrigerated tofu section of our local grocery store for $1.99 per bag yesterday.  I am puzzled how they can be sold and shipped since the front of the bag states "perishable   keep refrigerated".  I opened the bag and smelled the noodles, and they did have a rather strange, strong odor.  I immediate poured the noodles into a strainer and then rinsed them under cold water.  I put them in a sauce pan with a small amount of Lorivo expeller pressed peanut oil and let them sit for a while, stirring occasionally.  I decided to add Guilin chili sauce, garlic powder, powdered ginger, a small amount rice vinegar, water, 3   4 tsp. coconut sap sugar and 1 2 large can drained bean sprouts.  I warmed this mixture for awhile   maybe 20 or more minutes.  It worked!  I created a palatable side dish with a good  tasting  oth and appealing consistency.          I served this side dish with  oiled tuna, mahi mahi, and a Spring greens salad mix with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.     I wish that these noodles were available in larger sized bags at a lower price per serving, but $1 per person for two modest serving sizes per bag isn't outrageous unless you compare this with the cost of regular pasta.  I added the bean sprouts because the noodles alone didn't look like enough food for 3 people, and I thought that adding bean sprouts would offset any texture issues with the noodles. This recipe has now worked out twice with no real concern about cooking time for the noodles. Maybe the vinegar is the key, but the noodles are just like any other noodles when prepared this way and they make a great noodles with Asian style  oth meal or side dish.  And finally ... a use for those canned bean sprouts!          Update:  I have now mixed these with baked tofu and Asian style sauce. That combo worked out great.  Also I took the wide noodles, rinsed them and then put them in spaghetti sauce to simmer.  They tasted fine. Texture wise, they will always be somewhat slimy and slippery and not al dente like well prepared pasta, but otherwise, they worked out well. Just remember   just 40 calories   in an entire bag! And next to no carbohydrates!
