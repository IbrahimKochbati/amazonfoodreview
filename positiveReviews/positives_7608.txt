This is a good product and very high quality. The majority of people who post on Amazon (and the internet) are not medical providers and are not the least bit inclined in the area of sciences or infant nutrition. There's a large amount of misinformation out there and the misinformation is evident and propagated throughout the reviews for this formula. As for this product specifically (Similac Organic), it is the top echelon of quality with regard to consistency and nutritional value. We've had great success with this product and are very pleased overall as an adjunct to  eastmilk. Abbott labs (product maker) is a very large research reagent laboratory for the medical sciences and they have very rigorous quality controls in place, published research, and they also provide reagents to the scientific research community (exacting standards). That said, I would be less inclined to trust some of the other small makers of formula (ie. other organic products suggested as "better" in these reviews   especially the referenced small name organic powders). All said and done, the components in ALL of the Similac products are the highest quality and monitored with advanced scientific protocols and are well researched in published studies. I'd trust this  and   Similac, over the smaller, no names. Plain and simple. Keep in mind it's what best suits your baby and with nascent developing GI tracts, ALL babies will experience some degree of gas and discomfort regardless of the formula or nutritional source (even  eastmilk). It's sad to see people in these reviews propagating misinformation as they are neither pediatricians physicians. Do your own research and best to avoid those with ulterior motives, as well as the misinformative reviews and internet blogs that are overly slanted or biased.
