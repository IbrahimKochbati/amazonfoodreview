When I bought my coffeemaker, tried out several different  ands and types of coffee but this one has become a stable.  I can count on it for a great cup of coffee   not too strong or too mild, just the way I like it.  Unfortuantely, I now drink more coffee than I probably should because of the taste but that's the only downside.
