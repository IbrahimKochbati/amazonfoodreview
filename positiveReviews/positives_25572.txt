I researched this in 2011 and found that it helps lower blood pressure. Two months ago I bought hibiscus tea at a local discount store that sold the tea bags for $1.99 plus tax for 20 teabags. This tea is absolutely delicious. It tastes like sweet & sour fruit somewhat like tart cherries. I've been drinking at least 1 cup a day for the last 2 months and my blood pressure is down an average of 8 10 points. Needing more, I decided to try this based on one of the reviews. When I got it I took 5 leaves (or petals) and boiled them in hot water. I let it cool down for about 10 minutes and strained it. Then I added a teaspoon of honey and a dash of cinnamon. The result was one of the most delicious tasting teas I ever drank. It was smooth and even better than the tea bags. The way I used it I would estimate that I have enough to make at least 50 100 cups. I also like the fact that the tea comes in a zip lock type of bag. You just press the top and it seals in the freshness. Even if this tea wasn't so healthy I'd order it again just for the delicious smooth sweet & sour fruit flavor. For me this is a solid 5 star which I will definitely order again.
