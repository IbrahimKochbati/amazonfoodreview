I've used La Tourangelle roasted walnut oil during the barbeque season for the past four years or so. It's a great product and I won't fire up the hibachi without it. Along with various vinegars, I'll splash it on mushrooms, peppers and whatever veggies I have from the garden.  (The main dish is usually tofu, but I have a special marinade for that.)  One 500 ml can lasts me about one season while the other two keep well in the refrigerator. From what little shopping around I've done I think the price would be hard to beat.
