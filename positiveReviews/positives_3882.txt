I rarely want to eat much when I first arise in the morning; but I do have coffee.  I've found that these cinnamon graham crackers work great for me as a little something to eat along with my coffee.  They are graham crackers   not anything super duper amazing   but they are nice, cinnamony graham crackers that are organic.
