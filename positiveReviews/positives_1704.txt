The pomegranate molasses arrived on time and in good condition.  I encountered this as an ingredient in a Mollie Katzan cookbook and it did not disappoint.  We thinned it just a little with warm water and used it as a side sauce for roasted asparagus at a barbecue, and got many rave reviews from our guests, vegetarian and non vegetarian alike.  I recommend both the vendor and this item.
