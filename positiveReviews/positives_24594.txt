Like some of the other reviews, my cans were a bit dented in spite of the excellent packaging.  But just a tad, not enough to be concerned about the contents inside.  I've purchased organic pumpkin before from local stores, and it was a little watery, so that's probably one of the differences in regular pumpkin and organic.          My dog and cat both need pumpkin to help express their anal glands, and the pumpkin is much cheaper and easier (especially on the cat) then taking them to the vet every few weeks.          Thanks, Amazon!
