I recently purchased DisposaKups from this seller! Not only did I receive great customer service and fast shipping, but my product came packaged perfectly. I absolutely love the idea of the DisposaKups. However, after using a few, they just don't live up to my expectations. The lid often gets stuck in the keurig when its done  ewing, sometimes the holes don't poke properly, and every time i am left with water spewing out in all directions while it  ews. Definitely not a replacement for MyK or Solofill.
