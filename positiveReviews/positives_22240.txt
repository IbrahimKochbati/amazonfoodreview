These are inexpensive great treats. I bought them at Walmart several times and Walmart is always sold out because they are a great deal. I decided to go to the web to find them. The 18 ounce bag is actually 72 small bones. The picture says 7, but it is 72. My two spoiled dogs love them. I am glad to find them on this web site so I can purchase them. Buying enough bags for free shipping makes it easier than going to Walmart every week to find they are sold out.
