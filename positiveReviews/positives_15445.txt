I was a fan of the original South Beach Cereal Bars as my  eakfast "treat" with my morning coffee during my weight loss journey. When Kraft Foods reinvented and reintroduced them as SnackWell cereal bars I was thrilled.  Nothing starts off my healthy, smart eating better than something that reminds me I don't need to be deprived to lose weight. Try them heated  iefly in the microwave and indulge! ****July 2012**** I found new South Beach Bars in the cereal aisle and thought they would be just like these and the old South Beach ones but cheaper   NOT! They are hard as a rock, smaller and taste different.  I may pay a little more per box (I use Subscribe & Save) but they are worth it!  Don't be fooled.
