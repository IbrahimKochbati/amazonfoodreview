i have ordered mackerel several times on amazon and most pleased with SEASONS  and than any other. seems to me the fish are smaller therefore less mercury.     packed in olive oil is also a bonus. they are not as "fishy" as others that i have tried. i eat them to get a healthy serving of omega 3. my 11 year old boy has taken a liking for them as well as my 14 year old daughter. we put a small chunk on a cracker and top with a ring of hot banana peppers.
