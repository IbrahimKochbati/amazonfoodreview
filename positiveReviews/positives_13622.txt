This juice is one of my baby's favorites. I used to buy the 4oz bottles but this is way cheaper. I like the fact that 4oz gives her a serving of fruits. The max amount of juice that babies should drink in a day is 4oz, so I fill up a bottle with equal parts of water and juice and let her drink it with her meals throughout the day. In between I also give her plenty of plain water.
