You sent the wrong coffee!You did alright with the 3 jars of caffienated,but instead of the 2 jars of decaf you sent me 2 really old bags of Maxwell House freeze dried coffee,which I tried and got sick on.I threw them out.If I sent them back you couldn't have used them anyways.I don't think you sell Maxwell House freeze dried coffee.I'd still like 2 jars of decaf, but if you can't O well.Please reply,my email is markw88885@yahoo.com
