Pamela's Gluten Free Whenever Bars are not bad for a quick bite on the go, but may leave you feeling a little unsatisfied and hollow.          Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut is a good flavor combo  soft, chewy and pretty tasty  but there's more oats than chips or coconut.  Wheat free, gluten free and non dairy, they're good for a whenever snack  just as advertised.  The box indicates there may be traces of soy due to the manufacturing process.          The energy boost is a little light, with 23 g carbs per 40 g bar.  That's not much better than a piece of fruit.          I was a little disappointed in these in that they're a bit on the small side and the product description is misleading: the box only contains five bars, not six.  They're ok, but I'll agree with another reviewer in that I'd still take a Clif bar over these.
