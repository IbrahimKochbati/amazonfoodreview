I have never liked French Roast Coffee because the taste was too strong for me. When I made this coffee, I enjoyed my first cup of french roast in a long time. I sat down with my bagel and my coffee and had an enjoyable morning. My stomach didn't get upset and I didn't need an anacid. Yippee. The cost is high though but what I save on anacids makes it more affordable. For those of us with a touchy stomache, this is a great product.
