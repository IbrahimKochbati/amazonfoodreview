I have had this model for a little over a year and am quite happy with it.  It functions well and like any Keurig product is easy to use.  I purchased the eco ew filters since I prefer to grind my own coffee and it is far less expensive.  Recently however I was getting very little water despite pushing the button for the larger cup.  I had not descaled my machine as I only use water that has come through the Zero Water filter system and the fact that the descale light never came on.  I decided to descale anyway and after I did it is back to its normal performance level.  Lesson learned   DESCALE AS RECOMMENDED EVEN IF THE LIGHT DOES NOT COME ON!
