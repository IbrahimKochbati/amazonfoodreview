I have tried many of Pamela's GF cookies.  These are one of my faves, tied with the organic chocolate choc chip.  Like most GF confections, they aren't quite what grandma made, but they fill the bill when I'm looking for a cookie.  And they are great with dairy free GF ice cream (well frozen creamy stuff!) And if you call Pamela, you get real people on the phone!!
