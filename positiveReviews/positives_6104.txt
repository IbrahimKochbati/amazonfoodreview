Prepared as directed w  8oz of water it is very strong good tasting coffee, not better than fresh Colombian, but very good for emergencies and to have on hand.  For some this might be strong so 10oz of water is more the kind my friends like. A good Colombian coffee on the go but I like my fresh ground and  ewed stuff better. I give them an A for effort, finally someone is getting close to that point where I can't tell it isn't fresh  ewed but not quite there yet. I ordered it 2 days ago and got it fast, the best by date on mine is May 20th of this year 2011, rather quick to expire or this stock is old? Perhaps that is why it tastes instant?
