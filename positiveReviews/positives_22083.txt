Unbeatable! I've been cruising the protein bar isle for years, and this product just took first place in my book! I relapsed on carbs when I had Odwalla's Peanut Crunch Bar (though yummy very high in carbs). Who needs to cheat when there are Kind Bars on hand. I do confess, I like this one so well that I haven't tried the others yet!          I have read on other sites that if the supplier isn't rotating or selling enough to keep fresh stock on hand, you might get a stale batch. That is an unfortunate consequence when the food item is without preservatives, as in this case. I recommend that if you get a stale shipment you notify whom ever you ordered from, and request a replacement. These are not intended to be rock hard or chewy like taffy. Just perfect...
