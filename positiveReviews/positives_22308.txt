As soon as I discovered this soup, it started disappearing from local stores. Finally I decided to try Amazon, and now I'm having it automatically delivered by the case once a month for no more than I had been paying locally (at WalMart). This soup has everying I like: a very light cream of tomato base, chicken and a mix of cheese, vegatables and spices that make it the best tasting soup I've found. Try it, you'll like it!
