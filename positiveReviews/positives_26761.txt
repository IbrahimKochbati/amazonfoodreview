Hickory smoked sea salt "Durango" has a wonderful aromatic scent and flavor.  There is a strong measure of salt due to the coarse sea salt, but if that is what you are looking for then you will enjoy this.  I would like a little more hickory for the ratio of salt, but I still appreciated this product.  My husband and I use it regularly as do three of our children.
