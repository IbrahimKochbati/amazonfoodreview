My buddy turned me on to this stuff during a visit out to Monterey, California. I purchased some there locally and  ought it back from vacation with me...and now I use this seasoning on everything. It has an excellent flavor, without too much heat. I use it on meat, vegetables, pasta...you name it. Highly recommended!
