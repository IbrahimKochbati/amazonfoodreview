I was worried this was going to taste "less" than green coffee, or have some weird after taste or some other sort of nonsense, much like Caffeine Free soda or Diet Soda, etc., would, but this tastes basically like the regular Stash Green Tea, but decaf (We buy it for the pregnant ladies at work) and organic! This is USEFUL information for those who were afraid to jump the gun on decaf green tea   this particular  and is good!
