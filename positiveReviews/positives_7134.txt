I found the taste and strength of this coffee just right for it to gain the honor of one of my "go to" coffees for my Keurig.  Not too strong or bitter, I rather enjoy the flavor.  Sadly with the recent "K cup coup" staged by Green Mountain Coffees, it looks like Amazon isn't carrying the Wolfgang Puck coffees any longer and my Subscribe and Save (and my business) will need to go elsewhere.  Definitely give this coffee a shot if you can.
