This was a serious surprise to us... our cats have always refused wet cat food except for people quality tuna in the can. Soon as we opened these for them ( was a varity pack ) they scarfed one down and everyday wanted more .. it really looks, smells like people food! The package says "people food for cats" and after reading the ingrediants I believe it is!
