I discovered Vita Coco a few months ago.  Of the flavors I have tried, I like the Pineapple best.  It tastes like a mild pina colada without the alcohol.  I love the idea of an all natural hydrating drink that is low in sugar and high in potassium.  Whenever I am hot, thirsty or a little run down, I find that Vita Coco Coconut Water with Pineapple really quenches my thirst, refreshes me, and gives me a little energy boost without added sugar or any artificial ingredients like the ones in Gatorade and other drinks aimed at balancing electrolytes.  An 8 1 2 ounce serving  has only 60 calories and 30 mg of Sodium (less than fat free milk), with 515 mg of Potassium and 180% of the RDA of Vitamin C.  It's a little pricey, but if you can buy it on sale with free shipping, it's a great value.  Although I have previously purchased it on Amazon, I more recently bought it at GNC during Gold Card Week when there was a free shipping offer and a "buy 2, get 1 free" offer.  With a deal like that, it  eaks down to less than 65 cents per 8 1 2 oz serving.
