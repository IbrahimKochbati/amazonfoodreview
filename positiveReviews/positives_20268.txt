Pure Guatemala is my favorite of all LB coffees.  Since trying Larry's Beans fair trade organic coffee beans, only a very desperate moment could get me back into a Starbucks.  Larry's Beans are fresh  after drinking grocery store and sometimes coffee shop coffees I get sneezing fits I'm attributing to mold allergies, I've never sneezed after a cup of any LB coffees.  These coffees are very tasty and never bitter  I drink LB coffees black, but have to add heavy cream to most other coffee  ands.
