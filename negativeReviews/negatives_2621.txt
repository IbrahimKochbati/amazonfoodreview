The folks at Starbucks are not exaggerating when they say their French Roast coffee is "Extra Bold."  In fact, they should probably call it `Extremely Bold'...or maybe even `Ridiculously Bold.'  The directions on the package recommend 2 tablespoons of coffee for every 6 ounces of filtered water.  The result is likely to disintegrate your ceramic mug before you can drink it, but it doesn't taste too bad...that is until the bitter aftertaste kicks in and makes your throat burn.  If you weaken it by adding some hot water, as the package suggests, the bitter taste becomes more pronounced, like coffee that's been left heating in the pot too long.  The only way to drink this coffee is with plenty of cream and sugar.  With enough cream and sugar, French Roast is pretty good; but I wouldn't recommend this particular Starbucks variety if you like your coffee black...unless you wanna stay awake for a week.
