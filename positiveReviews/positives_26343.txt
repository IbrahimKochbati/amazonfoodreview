I have two very fussy doggies. One is a beagle the other a chihuahua. My dogs wont eat just dry food no matter what  and or how expensive. We tried mixing it with wet food,all  ands some of them costly. Alot still remained in their bowls wasted. Tried the Rachael Ray product and WOW empty bowls:) It is flying off the shelves here, so we have auto delivery from Amazon!!
