Cannot beat the price, imho. Less than one dollar per can. 100% fruit juice WITH carbonation. Each can has an estimate of 130 calories AND has 100% FDA of Vitamin C.          What's not to love? My husband and I have been trying to find these sold locally. Until then, we'll get them here, from Amazon.          This is one of the best (and tastiest) items I've ever reviewed. Kiwi Berry is the only flavor we have tried thus far. We look forward to trying most of the others.
