Excellent.  We have enjoyed Yuban coffee for many years.  We recently tried the Dark Roast Coffee and would recommend it if you want a rich tasting coffee.  Smooth; with no bitterness.  Beats the high price of many "Gourmet Coffees" without sacrificing that delicious flavor that coffee lovers look for.
