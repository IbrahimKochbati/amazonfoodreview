I can't even begin to say how delicious this mousse mix is.  We've tried many different ones and this is the best.  It reminds me of the Chocolate Budino from Bertucci's.  The dark chocolate makes it nice and rich without being overly sweet.  It has real chocolate chunks in the mix that melt in the microwave   I think having the real chocolate makes the difference.          So easy to make   just put the mix with some whipping cream in the microwave, stir it, then whip up some whipping cream with a mixer for about a minute, then add the melted chocolate mix.  Let it set in the fridge.  It takes a while to firm up   but when it does, it's very rich!
