Ironically, I am an Amazon seasonal worker.  I discovered these tasty treats while working on the sales floor...I kept thinking, "Wow, I sure ship alot of these things; WHAT are they?"  So I went home and checked them out on line for myself...I am a very active and healthy person.  I am ALWAYS looking for wholesome  eakfast options; I have a hard time eating in the AM...These cookies are so filling and delish!!  I eat one at around 8 am and I am FINE until lunch...Healthy ingredients to fuel your busy day lifestyle...I can't wait to put them in my back pack when I go hiking next!!!!
