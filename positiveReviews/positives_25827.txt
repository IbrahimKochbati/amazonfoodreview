If you enjoy smooth, strong, DELICIOUSNESS, please please please don't waste your time with other Keurig K cups. I've tried a huge variety of them, and many of them taste harsh, acidic, and straight out of 7 11 (I'm looking at you, Green Mountain). This coffee has a rich flavor with a hint of sweetness and none of the bitterness going down. I could not recommend it more. This morning I felt compelled to write a review on these simply because I woke up actually looking forward to drinking Tully's Italian Roast vs sleeping in. Italian Roast got me out of bed, folks, and that's hard to do on a Thursday at 6AM.
