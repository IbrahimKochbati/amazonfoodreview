I am SO disappointed.  Even though I read many reviews complaining of dented cans, I took a chance because of the pumpkin shortage & my family's regular use of pumpkin (a "superfood"!)  But I just received the package, which seemed to be packed sufficiently, yet once I opened it up fully, every single can was dented.  Some severely.  Most in ways I can't imagine happened during shipment.  The only thing I can figure is that the manufacturer is using this a way to get rid of damaged cans, because nobody would pick a can up in the store that looked like the cans I received.          I have contacted Amazon customer service and I'm sure they will come through for me   I have never had a problem dealing with them.  But beware if you are buying this product.  Maybe the dented cans were just a fluke but all 12...???          **update: Amazon customer service was a  eeze to deal with and sent me a new case and again, EVERY can was dented.  Some severely.  I won't try again.  Very disappointed.
