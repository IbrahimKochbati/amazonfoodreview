Have two cocker  iels.     It was a challenge to find the right dog food for     the older one, as he would get very gassy. I tried     at least 5 6 different  ands with no success. Then     another cocker  iel owner recommended me this one.     NO MORE GAS!!     Both of them love it. Their coat is looking so much     shinier and healthier. And they now shed very less.     I would'nt feed my dogs anything else now.     Very highly recommended!     And the price and service from Amazon is unbeatable!!
