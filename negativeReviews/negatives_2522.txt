After trying the Namaste pizza crust I was blown away  Delicous!  Possibly, the best pizza crust I've ever had.  So, I tried their Cheez Pasta thinking it would be great as well.  Big surprise.  It was awful.  I could barely tolerate one bite of it.  I, like one of the other reviewers, will save the pasta but make my own cheese sauce.  The cheese sauce smelled and looked terrible.  Do not waste your money on this product!
