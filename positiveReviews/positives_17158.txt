My husband and I were looking for a good snack and these fit the bill for us. More fiber than your normal pretzel, lots of flavor and has a decent amount of protein too. These are terrific! Its been part of our diet for over a year and we have lost about 60 pounds each. We make our own hummus and eat these with it, or I eat them with a wedge of laughing cow cheese or peanut butter.
