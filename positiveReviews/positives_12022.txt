I know some people have suggested this product is not for training, and I couldn't disagree more. I have en English Bulldog who is solely motivated by these. I was able to teach her voice commands in a very short time with these liver treats as rewards. While the peices could be a bit smaller (I often cut them up a bit) these are very healthy treats. I love them and my bulldog loves them!
