I ordered the chocolate hemp shake hoping that it would be easier to drink (or for that matter, to keep down) than the bulk protein powder, but I was not impressed. The only liquid I seem to be able to get this to mix into without having large lumpy chunks was coffee hot coffee. I'm not sure what the high temperature does to the protein, so this left me a little frustrated. If you want hemp protein I would actually suggest just buying the bulk protein and dealing with the bad taste.
