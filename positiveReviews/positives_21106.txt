My old dog has always had digestion problems.  Now that she is 12 it has become an issue!  After trying many types of food to help her, I tried Dr. Harvey's Canine Health.  She loves it and what's great is that she doesn't have the multitude of problems associated with poor intentinal health like she used to.  No more gurgling stomach and vomiting!  My friend has a little Rottwieler puppy that had bad kidneys.  The vet said she would die soon.  We went into action and discoverd that Dr. Harvey's food is actually easy on her kidneys.  She has gained 12 pounds in less than 2 months which is a miracle.  She is playing again and getting very sassy!  I will keep my girl eating what she loves; Dr. Harvey's. I tried a bite myself and with a little salt and pepper, I could eat it too!
