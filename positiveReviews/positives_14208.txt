OK, we tend to think salt is salt is salt, however, I had the great fortune to go to a wonderful restaurant in Barcelona, called Osmosis (check it out if you are in BCN and reserve a table, you won't regret it); as a starter, we were given Catalan  ead with a local olive oil and three different types of salt   Baltic, Australian and Maldon.  Maldon was the fave of all of three of us   it has an amazing balance and you don't feel you've consumed too much salt, which couldn't be said for the other salts we sampled. I'm buying this 'coz my teenage daughter, who was at the restaurant with me, enjoyed the salt so much (and we are a virtually salt free family) she feels we need to have this as a staple in our home!
