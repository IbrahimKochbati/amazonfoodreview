I'm not that much of a tea drinker, so count this as a non gourmet's review. When I first started drinking tea many years ago, it quickly became clear that loose tea was head and shoulders better than bags. I soon started getting foreign but garden variety loose teas from hole in the wall ethnic food stores. Oh, and Constant Comment loose when I could find it (I know, I know). Last year a friend gave me a can of Rishi Earl Grey for Christmas. Wow. The flavor is everything other commenters have described. Plus, I now know why they call them tea "leaves," not tea dust. : ) It still takes me a long time to go through a can  coffee is my preference  but I'll be ordering the three pack soon from Amazon. One can will go back to the person who got me hooked on it, and a second can to a tea drinker who I know will appreciate it, to spread the word. I'll keep the third can for myself, of course.
