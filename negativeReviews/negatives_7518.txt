I have tried many  ands of coconut water, including some flavored ones, but this one does not merit even one star.  It does not taste at all like coconut water     WAY too much sugar and flavorings added     sickeningly sweet. Very disappointing and truly a waste of my money.  Same was true of the passionfruit flavor. Yuck.
