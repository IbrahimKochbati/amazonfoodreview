I've been eating Quaker oatmeal most of my life, and the maple syrup and  own sugar version of their instant oatmeal  eakfast is one of my favorites. It's simple to make, either add hot water, or microwave it. I tend to microwave it, which tends to give the oats more body. It has the right mix of syrup and sugar taste, and I don't need to add anything at all for taste. Just love this as an anytime snack.
