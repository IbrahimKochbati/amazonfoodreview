The Tug A Jug is a great dog toy,our mini doxie Fritzi needs a 12 step program cause he is on the Jug all the time. It has become his favorite toy and spend hours trying to get every last bit of treat out of it. He is exhasted as its quite the work out and needs a nap after wards. The only problem was the Tug part of it,it lasted about five minutes as he chewed right through that,but really you dont need it as you can put in larger treats mixed in with little ones and it works just fine.
