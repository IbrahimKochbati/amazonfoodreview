I was actually VERY surprised that this tasted like the real deal. It's very sweet, very limey, and the first couple hundred chews you can taste the crust and a smidge of whip cream. After a few minutes, it still has flavor. After an hour: it still has flavor. I love it! You also get the tangy effect of a lime. Not as strong but very pleasurable.
