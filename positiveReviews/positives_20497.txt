I'm a two cat mom and have been a clumping clay litter user for decades. I came a bit late to the natural litter party, because I was afraid natural litters would clump poorly smell bad etc. Swheat Scoop is the second natural litter I've tried, and I had planned to try them all but this stuff is so great that I've decided there's no need to look further.          There is no such thing as a cat litter that never smells bad, has no dust, never tracks at all, and produces clumps so perfect that they neither stick to the side bottom of the box nor crumble apart a bit. That said, Swheat Scoop is the closest to perfect I've ever found, in ALL of these respects.          Smell: Slightly "barnyard" like (it is wheat, after all), but I only notice it when I'm scooping out the box; if you scoop daily, you will not have an ambient smell. (We live in a 1 BR condo and the litter box is in the bathroom, so I would notice if there was a lingering smell.)          Dust: Hands down, the least dusty litter (clay or natural) I've ever tried.          Tracking: Minimal, on par with the lowest tracking clay litters I've used, and superior to the lightweight (pine cedar) natural litters. Swheat Scoop's consistency is quite like Grape Nuts cereal (sorry to gross out anyone who eats Grape Nuts), so because the granules are on the heavier side they tend not to track.          Clumps: Not perfectly tight, but they can be scooped easily enough. With a high volume of urine, the clumps do stick to the bottom sides a bit, but in my experience the tighter clumping clay litters adhere MUCH more to the bottom and sides. (One of our cats pees a ton and the side sticking drove me nuts with clay litter.) And as another reviewer mentioned, keeping the litter level high enough definitely mitigates this problem.          I haven't experienced the bug problem others mentioned, but I'm willing to risk it considering how great this stuff is.
