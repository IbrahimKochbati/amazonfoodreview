I haven't tried the other flavors because they don't sound as appealing as Thai Peanut, which my whole family loves.  I don't know if "jerky" is quite the word, as it obviously throws off some people who only call the hard, dry stuff jerky. But this is a yummy, flavorful snack with a nice, chewy texture and just a touch of that tough to bite off feel.  A great toss in the bag snack for when we go out that satisfies the craving for something savory.
