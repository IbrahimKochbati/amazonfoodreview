I got this as a gift and I love it! It can make any type of coffee (light, dark, flavored) and even tea which is great. I have had no problems with it and Ive had it for 2 months. Heats up quickly. I've noticed if you run it with no K cup in it (just to get some water through it) every once in a while it runs more smoothly and clears out the spouts! Worth it!
