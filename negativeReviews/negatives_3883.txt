The logo says "100% of what you want.  0% of what you don't want".  Well, I guess it is who you are talking too.  Even though the Kiwi Berry drink says 100% juice and 0% added sugar it is way too sweet.  The drink is refreshing but if you are thristy this 8.3oz can won't be enough.  The cost is too way expensive to enjoy this drink on a regular basis.  The cute can and unique drink combination doesn't make up for the sweet tart taste, small skinny can and high price.  Save your money, drink water.
