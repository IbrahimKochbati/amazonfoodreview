Highly recommend this  and of coffee for the beginner and seasoned coffee drinker. I dont know how they do it, but these pre packaged sacks can actually make 2 pots of 8 cup coffee. The flavor is slightly bold, but smooth as ever. I actually dont even like to use cream or sugar with this flavor. You can taste the flavors of butter, rum, coconut right in the cup. Smells incredible as its  ewing. However, I personally use a coffee press and the flavor comes through even stronger!! Again, highly recommended, no cons, you will definitely enjoy this over the $6 tourist coffee. Plus this saves you money. TRY IT TRY IT TRY IT!!!          P.S. I also highly recommend the Almond Amaretto, Caramel Kiss, and Butter Pecan. ENJOY!
