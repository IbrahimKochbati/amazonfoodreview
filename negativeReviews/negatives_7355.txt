I actually feed my cats pumpkin to maintain a healthy digestive system and they love it! Unfortunately there has been a pumpkin shortage in the stores. The only canned pumpkin available was the organic at Amazon. I have never used this before. Although the cats eat it, I was disappointed because it is very "watery". I just wonder if this will impact pumpkin pies at Thanksgiving if we still have a shortage!
