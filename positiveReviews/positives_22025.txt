My family has always loved Black Jewel but it is hard to find in our area for some reason.  We started out using the old fashioned bagged pop corn and using a covered skillet on the stove but we like the microwave type too.  If you try it, don't tell anyone in your family that it is something different and watch their reactions.          This popcorn doesn't produc the huge popped kernals like regular yellow corn but it has a LOT more flavor.
