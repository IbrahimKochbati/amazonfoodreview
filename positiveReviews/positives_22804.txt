This is a delicious blend of grains, Israeli couscous and chick peas that can be cooked quickly and is easy to accomodate many cuisines as a side or main dish.  This is a dish that I am comfortable serving to my family as well as guests.  However, I recommend that you buy it at Trader Joe's because they sell it for $2.69 per package.  If you don't have one near you ask a friend who does to buy a dozen and mail them to you.
