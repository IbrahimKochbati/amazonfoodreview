The number one critic is my dog and she loves these.  They kind of look like thick sugar cookie biscuits and have a slight perforation line so you can  eak one long one into two smaller 'cookies'; which is what I do for my dog.  She seems to enjoy biting down on these since they are pretty firm and dense and she chews up every last bit of them.  I've seen no allergies or problems from her after having them and I'll get some more as a special treat for her in the future.
