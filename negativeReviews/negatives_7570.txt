I bought this juice from Amazon just last month and went around local supermarkets looking for it and Harris Teeter has it for only $5 a bottle and Amazon's charging $8 for one!! That's highway robbery. They should really correct the pricing. The juice itself I find no fault and taste great. Always shop around, not everything on Amazon is a bargain!
