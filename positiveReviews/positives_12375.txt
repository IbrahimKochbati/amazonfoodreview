"Nong Shim Spicy Chicken Noodle Bowl" was another Amazon Vine sample that one of the kids snatched up and ate before I could properly review it.  So you'll have to be happy with this second hand report.  Anyway, my daughter was the one who grabbed this particular product up (as opposed to my son, who nabbed the "Chips Ahoy!" cookies).  Not a girl of many words (at least not with the parents, generally) she said that she microwaved it, and that it was delicious.  I did manage to pry out of her that she had no special difficulty in preparing it ("it was easy!").  So there you have it   if our frequently picky daughter enjoyed this, it must be at least pretty good, right?
