When reviewing cat food, you really can't go with taste since cat food is disgusting, but my cats really seem to like it. When I open a can they run to the bowl. Not that they don't usually run to the bowl but they are very enthusiastic about this stuff.          The main problem I have is that it's in little cans so there's not much. I have three cats. And it's a little too watery. The food and "gravy" quotient is heavy on the "gravy" side. Also it stinks a little. Most cat food stinks but I distinctly smelled this one. So it stinks more than usual.          Beyond that, if you can afford it and you have finicky cats, give it a shot.
