I love International Delight Creamer But was so Disappointed when i received this. The box & the creamers were a mess, i did not expect a mess like i received. Who ever is packing these needs to do something different with the creamers & not just throw them all in a box unprotected like they are shipping them. I will reorder more of the products when & ONLY when the packing is fixed. As far as the product and price it is unbeatable but the packing makes it a total loss, I do not recommend this until the packing of the creamers are changed. Bummer to.
