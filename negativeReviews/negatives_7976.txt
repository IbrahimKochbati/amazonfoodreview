The original title of the Jumbo Sunflower seeds stated 12 per case. I ordered them based on that information, figuring out the cost of each bag I would be paying. When I received them, the case only had 10 bags. I wrote to them TWICE and received NO response. I expected a refund for the two missing bags or for them to send me two additional bags.  But they didn't even have the courtesy to reply.  Since then, I see they have changed the title to "10 bags".  However, the description still says 12.  Be aware you will only get 10 and it's a horrible price to pay for such small bags.
