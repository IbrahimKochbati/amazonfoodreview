I have two dogs and both react very badly to these.  The two times my La ador got one she vomited severely both times.  The other dog reacted by urinating and pooping in the house...VERY unusual for her to do either of these chores in the house.  Both dogs reacted within twenty minutes of ingesting these chews.  I have thrown them out and am writing a review, which is something I seldom do unless it's positive.  My advice:  don't take the chance with these, there are other alternatives.  For any pet owner who gives their dog(s) chews of any sort please google the method for giving your dog the heimlich maneuver in case the dog chokes...there's an easy way to perform this on a dog.
