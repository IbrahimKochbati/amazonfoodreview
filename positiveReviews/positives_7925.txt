I have begun to use this tea after doing three natural gallbladder liver cleanses and watching the stones come out like crazy when the doctors could not figure out why I had so much pain.  The cleanses have helped, but I am now two days in using the tea and have absolutely seen a rise in energy.  I am hoping this continues.  The tea tastes great with added mint leaves!  I am still looking for a tea that also has milk thistle without chicory.
