I bought these for my husband at WF, because he is supposed to stay away from sugary soft drinks and fruit juices.  We've tried a bunch of sugar free beverages, and this one has been the best. My husband is a meat and potatoes guy who is not interested in any diet beverages, so getting him to try and then to regularly drink a 0 calorie beverage is a huge deal.  He likes the Zevia and asked me to get more of them   yipeeee!  He is going to be so much healthier, so I'm happy.
