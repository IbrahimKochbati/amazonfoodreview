I tried this cat food for my 5 month old kitten.  we used this for about two weeks thinking that her stomach would get used to it.  We were wrong.  This cat food made our cat crap like a 300 pound man.  And my gosh did it stink.  This cat food turned our cute little fur ball into a feline ball of gas that you no longer wanted on your lap or for that matter in our house.  I kid you not, after two weeks of this cat food the cat's butthole was actually protruding.  We went back to the cat food we were giving her before and within two weeks she was back to normal.          Never again.
