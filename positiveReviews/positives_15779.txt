... some of the flavors are better than the others.  Raspberry, Vanilla and Hazelnut top the list with chocolate and caramel  inging up the very bottom &lt;   yuck :(     It's a great value for as many bottles that you get, and I love that the bottles are plastic instead of glass like you'd get when ordering any single flavor.     There is some aftertaste, but all in all these are very versatile and great if you're trying to limit your intake of sugar!
