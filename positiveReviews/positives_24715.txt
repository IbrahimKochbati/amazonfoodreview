I was recommended to drink this by a former American medic who had done a tour in Iraq. I'm not sure if I can even discern the level of effectiveness, but I seem to feel like I have flushed out some toxins, based on the lessening of some ill feeling I was experiencing before taking the month long experiment of using it three times a day. All my study on the ingredients leads me to believe that I chose the best of the versions of a detoxifying drink. The price was right, too.
