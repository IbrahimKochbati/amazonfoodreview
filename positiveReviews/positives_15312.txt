I have used this level of Keurig at home and in the office for years. The one at home has never missed a beat. The ones at work I've had to descale several times because of the constant heavy use but they are running fine otherwise. I just bought this one for an organization that I belong to and have ordered this model in the past for family and friends. You won't go wrong with this product from a quality standpoint. Best part is you get a fresh cup of coffee each time.
