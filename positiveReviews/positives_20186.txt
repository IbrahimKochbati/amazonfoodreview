I'm a sugar lover ... I know as I get older, I can't keep eating so much sugar.  They say this stuff is better for you, so I figured I'd give it a try.  Like other folks say, it's a bit less sweet than regular or even raw sugar ... I just add more to taste (hopefully that's not defeating the purpose!)  It does tend to have some dark specs in it, but I know it's part of the refining process.  I got a great deal on Amazon and I'm very happy with this purchase.  I use it in my coffee every day!  Now, I just need to find a 'healthier' substitute for creamer.
