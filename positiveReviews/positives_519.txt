I used to buy the Wholesome Sweetners agave and like it a little better, but switched because it became too expensive. So this is the cheeper option. The taste is the same, but it seems a little less sweet because I find I have to use more of it to get the right sweetness in my coffee. I don't like the container. It doesn't pour well, so I have to pour it into a better squeeze bottle, so that I don't have a sticky mess on my counter every day. It's fine for the price. I continue to have it shipped to me every other month.
