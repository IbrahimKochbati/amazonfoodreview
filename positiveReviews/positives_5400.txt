I really like the idea of the K cup coffee maker. You make it the strength that you want and no wasting a half a pot of coffee. I DID NOT like the horrible price for the "pre made" K cups. This is a great compromise. The only thing that could be a bit of a problem for some is that they will leak if you don't puncture them fully. This is easily corrected by lifting the open close lever once and closing a second time. Now, if they would make them out of biodegradable cardboard or something else I could compost, the rest of the planet would love them too.
