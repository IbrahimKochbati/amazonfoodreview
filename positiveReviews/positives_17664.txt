There is no question that there are some people who can't have a heavy tasting coffee, largely from the caffeine or the roasting of the beans. Especially, those who have ailments like acid reflux disease, or antacid. Fortunately, there are coffees that are really good and safe to taste. For Puroast, they have made some specialty coffees for all that is safe and secure to drink, like their low acid French Roast. The taste is absolutely very strong, and holds up well with more popular  ands like Maxwell House and Chock Full O' Nuts. I really liked the the taste of it, and if you are looking for a safe and secure coffee to drink, give Puroast Low Acid Coffee a try.          Price: C+          Taste: B          Overall: B 1 2
