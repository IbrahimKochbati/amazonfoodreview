I didn't want caffeine, don't want the high calories & went through MANY types of energy chews   gels   drinks online to see what would be the best option for myself.          I LOVE the honey stingers!  No caffeine, calories can be controlled depending on how many pieces you take, and most importantly, it lasted me through my marathon trainings :)          Fruit smoothy is delicious.  Haven't tried the other flavors.
