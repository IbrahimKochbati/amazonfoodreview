I used to be a huge fan of this.. wild salmon, 4g of protein, other great ingredients.. just ordered another 16 pack and discovered they have reformulated it to be completely different. It is really liquid y.. impossible for an unskilled careless self feeder to have much left on the spoon by the time it gets to her mouth (may be okay for younger babies who aren't self feeding yet though). Also it only has 1g of protein now   not sure why   if there is less salmon in it? Anyway, it's off the menu here, and I am disappointed to have lost a healthful, convenient option.
