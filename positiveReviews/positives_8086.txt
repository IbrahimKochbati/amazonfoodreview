I read a lot of the [mixed] reviews here, and I ordered the product.  I actually tried a small bag at the local Co op.  I absolutely love them.  They are very tasty and have a not too sweet nutty flavor.  Yes, there are some color variations in the bag, but it doesn't change the texture or flavor.  I eat them in salads, smoothies, with oatmeal, made chocolate candy with them, and eat them straight out of the bag!  I have not found a negative thing about them.  You should try them, you might like them as much as I do!  And, they are organic which is important to me.
