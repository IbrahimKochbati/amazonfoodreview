I cannot locate this product anywhere locally.  Tried the local coffee houses.  The product they use for cappaccino has a lot of sugar in it.          The product I purchased from Amazon which I have been using for a number of years has minimal sugar in it and a strong vanilla flavor which I like.  So glad you can provide it for me.          Thank you.
