The adoption worker at our local humane society recommended this product because it is grain free and high in meat content.  Our dog loves this food.  We have a relatively small dog who is still in his puppy stage, and the kibbles are the right size.  It is a bit pricier than the supermarket  ands of dog foods, but we think our dog's health is worth the extra minor investment.
