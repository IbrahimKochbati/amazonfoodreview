Heard about these and simply had to check them out. Ordered a package and invited a few friends over after a huge shopping trip for an evening of "flavor tripping." That is exactly what it was, the tablets themself have an odd taste (not the best) but for two hours afterward everything we ate was completely different from anything I've had before. Lemons, kiwi, strawberries, cheese, mustard, cranberry juice, OJ, and a lot more. IT all was completely different and was like experiencing these foods for the first time. Everything was sweet and tasted (with few exclusions) much better. I ended up eating whole lemons by the end because they were my favorite.          These really are amazing and I would recommend them to anyone who likes food.
