I like the puffed nature of this chip that makes it more unique in the chip market.  I ordered the Salt and Vinegar and absolutely love that flavor, hands down my favorite chip ever.  I have tried the cheddar and regular flavors as well.  The cheddar is about a 4 5 and the regular is about a 3 5 because I prefer strong flavors and obviously that would not be the case for the regular.  The Salt and Vinegar is kind of weak compared to some regular S&V chips, but is quite flavorful and makes you wanting to come back for more.
