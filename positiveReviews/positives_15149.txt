We have a 4yo miniature Schnauzer and 6mo giant Schnauzer. We only wanted to buy one type of food for both, so this worked out perfectly. It's very gentle and they seemed to digest it better(much less poop). Too, it's better quality than the best big box store stock. We'll definitely purchase this again!
