My 8 year old Maltese loved these treats.  I didn't know about the FDA warnings until after he died from a "mystery" illness that started out as vomiting followed by lethargy.  He had been very healthy before.  The vet did a necropsy and said my dog's liver was severely enlarged and his kidneys were also affected.  Please don't feed your beloved pets ANYTHING made in China.  If I had known about the dangers, I would never have given these to my dog.
