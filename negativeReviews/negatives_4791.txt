So when you purchase beans of a reputable  and you would expect to get fresh beans. They tasted old from the opening of the bag and so even if the date was well in advance of it's expiration I can only surmise that quality control was an issue in the storage or shipping of the beans. But I won't be ordering any more espresso beans from this company unless they can correct this.
