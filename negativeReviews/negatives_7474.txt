FDA just issued yet another warning for dog chicken jerky treats made in CHINA..... dog lovers, you NEED TO PAY ATTENTION!!!! We just threw our stuff in the trash......Yet another health article appeared on CNN online re: dog chicken jerky treats. I re read the reviews on Amazon. I contacted Dogswell customer service and got a lengthy, very informative reply that said, " A large number of our products are sourced and manufactured in the United States and only a small number of our treats, are made in China." (My package clearly states made in CHINA     so, did I buy that "small number" of bags??). I carefully weighed all the information and still do not feel comfortable. I believe the manufacturer cares a lot about dogs but how about keeping the business right here in the USA?          We just made the decision to stop ordering this product. Yes, my dogs like the treats but I cannot, in my heart, say I can serve them to my pups. I am unconvinced that this is the best option for my dogs.
