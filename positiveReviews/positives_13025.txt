I bought these despite a review saying they were factory seconds because all the cans had dents in them  I hate dented cans, but the price was too good to pass up.  None of the cans in my shipment had any dents at all, so maybe he just got a bad batch.  Anyway, it's 12 cans of pasta, almost a pound each, for 12 bucks and change.  It's relatively low in fat (even if you eat the whole can which is supposed to be two servings), low in cholesterol, and a can is 18 grams of protein with 10 grams of fiber.  Only the sodium is high, though lower than most canned soups.  It's hearty and satisfying, and the filling is spicier than most canned pastas.          Folks, you can't beat an entree like that at a buck a can.  Order two cases and it's eligible for free shipping.  They have many other varieties too.  I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.   "
