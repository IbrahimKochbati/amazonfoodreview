You have a very small 1 8 1 4 cup stomach so you can't waste your space on snacks that can't benefit you with vitamins, proteins or some nutrient of value. Also, you can't eat sugar., but you can eat sugar substitutes. So KAY'S NATURALS PRODUCTS ARE GREAT! They have tons of protein and they taste great! These cinnamon toast pretzel sticks are great...the sweetener is low enough in the ingredient list to be able to tolerate it  because there isn't much of it.
