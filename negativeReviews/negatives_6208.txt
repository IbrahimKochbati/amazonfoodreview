Let me start by saying this is not really bad jerky.  I took issue to two of the descriptions on the bag.  The first is that this in my opinion is not "HOT".  One would thing that Habanero jerky would at least elicit some type of heat in the mouth, tears, etc.  I did not find that to be the case & was quite disapointed.  I also do not believe this jerky to be very "tender".  The first two pieces I ate almost have the consistency of shoe leather & were very tough to chew through.  I have had purchased more tender jerky at Dollar General.  I will not be buying this again.
