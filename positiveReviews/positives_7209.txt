My wife has one of the one cup coffee makers.  I used to make fun of her for the one cup thing but you know; sometimes I only want one cup too! The Senseo pods have good flavor.  I'd rate them a 5 star but if you use only one pod the coffee is a little bit weak for my taste. In the stores I have to pay over $5 when I can find the French Vanilla.  Buying them on Amazon in the pack of 6 was much cheaper, especially with the automatic re order discount.
