This candy was purchased for a wedding for display and consuming.          We had to hold onto it for 4 weeks before the event and I'll just say... no one in the house ate just one.          Tasty, good consistency and a fair price. What more can you ask for?          Now, I know that grapefruit isn't a well known flavor but WOW, I liked it better than the watermelon gummie rings that we bought on amazon also.          These were a bit softer too, which is a personal preference, but I like softer gummies.          Generally, I'm a health nut, but it was a wedding so I indulged with a few of these. You might have to as well ;)
