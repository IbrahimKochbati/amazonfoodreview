I ordered this because I really like this  and and I have never had any issue with them.  My son usually like all the flavors.  I ordered this and the pears were sour spoiled.  The other flavors my son refused to eat. I am sure there was something wrong with it.  So I am not sure what happened but I will NOT be buying these online anymore.
