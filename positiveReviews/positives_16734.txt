Im addicted to this stuff since I switched from using sugar to agave.  For those not in the know, its sweeter than sugar and has a "real" sweet taste   not like sweetners or artificial sweetners that have strange aftertastes. (sorry, I tried stevia and just couldnt adapt.)  I order a few of the the 46 ounce bottles at once so I always have it on hand and dont run out.  Its easy enough to transfer the agave into smaller containers, like an old honey bear container or syrup container and that way I have some at work and some at home.  This tastes delicious, is certified organic, dissolves in hot and cold drinks (use it in your coffee   its delish!) and the company sends it very very quickly.  Im a happy customer.
