I buy these wonderful little bits of heaven by the case!  I have Crohn's disease, so my whole GI tract is often very unhappy with me.  These help settle my stomach and often make it possible for me to eat when I'm nauseated.          I found these a couple of years ago, and now I don't go anywhere without them.  I have bags in my nightstand, in the car, my husband's car, my purse, and the kitchen.  They aren't too sweet and pack enough of a ginger punch to settle my stomach and quash any bad  eath issues.  I like the ginger chews also, but they tend to hurt my teeth more than these hard candies.          These are a great buy!
