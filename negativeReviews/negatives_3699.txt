Got the Spicy Chicken from the grocery store. It was sitting right there, buried by Top Ramen and Maruchan. I wanted the Shin Noodle but was not there. The positive notes about this noodle bowl; Not too salty and the  oth is worth drinking at the end. Cons; The noodles aren't that different from those other  ands. For more then 3x the price, i was expecting better noodles. Also it's really not that spicy. Extremely mild, good spice level for kids.
