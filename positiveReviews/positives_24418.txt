I got this so that my girls could have some variety in their meals. The nutritional value is great and they really scarf it up! They "helped" me open up the Amazon box when I  ought it in the door. Since this is such a hit with them, it will be on their menu quite often.It is the first time I tried this  and. I usually feed them Iams, but wanted to try a little variety for a change.
