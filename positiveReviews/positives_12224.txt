For a long time I thought I just didn't like coffee.  Turns out that I just don't like the stuff that my mom bought.  I don't know what she used to buy for the old coffee maker, but now she likes the Donut Shop K Cups.  I can't stand that stuff without drowning it with vanilla creamer.  It's just too bitter.  The Nantucket Blend is a lot smoother.  Although the Dark Magic blend by Green Mountain is. . . interesting, of the coffees I've sampled, I prefer the Nantucket Blend.
