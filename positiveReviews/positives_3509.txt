First, let's talk about the packaging.  I hate when coffee come packaged in bags like this.  They're quite cumbersome and in my opinion, do not keep the coffee fresh enough.          As for the coffee itself, this was one of the better tasting decaf's I have had.  It has a very rich flavor that you do not normally find with decaffeinated coffee.  It has a wonderful aroma as well.  Very pleased with this product.
