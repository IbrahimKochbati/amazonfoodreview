Pro Treat Freeze Dried Liver Dog Treats   B000255OIG          This is the sort of product that makes me wish I could give more than 5 stars... My puppy absolutely adores these liver treats   our dog trainer calls them "puppy heroin". With these treats, training becomes an absolute snap, since the puppy is willing to do anything for his smelly liver treat   and you will have his undivided attention during the entire training session.          These liver treats come in cubes and slices about a half inch on each side. I slice them thinly three or four time lengthwise, and then again two or three time crosswise. The liver treats fracture easily, and the taste is so addicting that only the tiniest slivers are necessary to reinforce good puppy behavior. These treats are also low fat and low preservatives, so they are very healthy for your puppy and that makes them even more perfect for training. Really, once you try this treat, you will never need another!          As always, purchase and shipping from Amazon was easy and painless, and the liver treats were packed carefully enough that there was no extra treat  eakage   which is remarkable for dried treats.          ~ Ana Mardoll
