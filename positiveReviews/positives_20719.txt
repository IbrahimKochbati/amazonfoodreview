I was very disappointed when my milk arrived, soaking wet because the pkg was not securely packed and one of the boxes of milk  oke open and was all over the other boxes and packing box also. I have ordered this before and it came in perfect condition, because it was packed solid in a double box. So I was short one box of milk because it spilled everywhere inside. Thanks, Lynnette
