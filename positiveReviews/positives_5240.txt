So far I've only tried the Orange Tangerine flavor and it's pretty good overall.  It does have a tangerine taste to it, though it's accompanied by other flavors.  It's clearly much more natural than regular soda or those 10% juice drinks since it's just fruit juice concentrates and carbonated water vs. the typical high fructose corn syrup plus artificial flavors, colors and preservatives in something like Sunkist.  I think the juice blend is appropriate for this type of beverage.  It does contain more apple and grape than tangerine or orange, but those first two juices complement the carbonation well viz a viz sparkling cider.  I think straight carbonated orange tangerine juice would probably be a bit much.  The Switch reminds me of Appletiser, which is one of my favorites and has been around for many years, but is still pretty hard to find in the US.     That having been said, I had to dock one star for a couple of reasons.  First, the cans just seem too small.  If they're sticking with aluminum cans, I'd like to see the standard 12oz size offered.  It seems like that would also have the advantage of making it easier to offer in regular beverage vending machines.  Alternately, 16 or 20oz bottles would also work.  The second issue is the price.  While I understand there's a huge difference between the cost of real juice and artificially flavored corn syrup, the current price still seems high, even in comparison to other juice drinks.  That might be partly because it's from a relatively small company that doesn't yet have the giant economies of scale that the likes of Coke and Pepsi can take advantage of, but it still seems like the price could come down a bit (or at least serving size could increase without a price increase) and it could perhaps still be made back up in increased sales volume.     I pick up Appletiser when I can find it, and I'll likely do the same with The Switch, at least from time to time.
