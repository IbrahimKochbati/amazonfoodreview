I really like this sencha. Probably the best I've tasted (still checking out others, but so far after 3 4  ands this is still the best). It is a bit grassy, but not strongly so and does not bother me.          Only flaw is its small leaves which make it hard to drink when using my too permissive ceramic strainer. And it's also hard to clean the strainer since the leaves get stuck in it. Other than that, I'd give it 5 stars.
