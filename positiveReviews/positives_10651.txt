Ive always been a big Jack Links jerky fan.  I usually buy a couple bags a month, but last month I was in Vegas and they were out of A1 flavor...my personal favorite!          I looked around the store and found these!  I opened the bag and had a few on my way to the pool, they were awesome.  Anybody that loves chicken wings should give these a taste.  The chicken is tender and quite generous in size.  I was pretty surprised they even  ought a bead of sweat to my forehead, usually store bought "buffalo" flavors don't accomplish that.          As another reviewer said these are great if you love chicken wings but don't wanna down 200 calories a piece for that spicy burn.  I do have to say these are impossible to find in WI though, so luckily amazon has them, and at a good price for a pack of 8 bags!
