After my diagnosis of celiac diseas, I pretty much just gave up on  ead; I'd tasted the storebought, premade rice  eads that my sister in law tried, and decided if it didn't taste or feel like real  ead, I'd just do without.  And because I am intolerant to legumes, all mixes and  eads with bean flour or soy flour are out.  I also need to avoid dairy.          Enter Pamela's Amazing Bread Mix. While I've made this in the oven, and it's not hard, this mix does amazingly in my 10 year old, primited Breadman  ead machine. I simply follow the instructions on the bag, set my machine to medium 2 pound loaf, and in two hours I have the best gluten free  ead ever.  It is soft, light, and springy.  It has a slightly sweet taste, probably due to the sorghum flour.          If you try this, I highly recommend using the  ead machine. I've had a lot of successes baking it in the oven, but I've had a few loaves explode over the sides of the pan, making for a not so aesthetic appearing loaf.  In the  ead machine there is plenty of room, the loaf rises nicely and doesn't under  or over bake.          Thank you, Pamela!
