I've been using this tea for for about 6 months and drink it as iced tea daily.          I microwave my water on high in a pyrex 2 cup glass container for 2 minutes on high and then pop the little white mesh bags in for about 5   15 minutes. I use about 3   4 bags for a rich taste and since I'm going to be pouring it over ice. I put my ice cubes in a large glass and pour my hot tea over the ice, grab a straw and it's ready to drink.          It also tastes good when I steep 2 bags of the Revolution White Pomegranate Tea with 2 bags of the Arizona Pomegranate. This is my favorite on ice. The Arizona is a green tea. Anyhow, this is my usual lunchtime pick me upper. I want to note that I gave up drinking diet soda in March and has made this concoction my replacement. It was a little difficult at first, but now that awful stuff is out of my system.          I have not tried this tea hot, as I am not a fan of hot tea, but I'm sure it's just as delicious. I subscribe to this and the Arizona Pomegranate Green Tea.
