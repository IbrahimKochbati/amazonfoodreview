These crackers are horrible. They taste burnt and have a terrible texture. There are quite a few other GF crackers out there, try them instead. I have tried many of Glutino's products (Macaroni and Cheese, pizza, pretzels, crackers, bagels, and their  eads) and the only product worth buying again is the pretzels. There are getting to be more and more GF products available, try those (Udi's, Rudi's, some of Amy's products) instead.
