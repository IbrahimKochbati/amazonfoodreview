This mberry product really worked for my friends and I. Unfortunately, it only worked for about 15 to 20 minutes at most. It still made for a really fun experience!     The food items that were the most awesome included cream cheese (tasted like cheesecake), grapefruit (tasted sweet without added sugar), lemons (tasted like they had grown from a "lemonade tree"), and various assortments of beer (just a different taste all together).     Definitely worth the $15 bucks if you are a foodie and want to experience this food trend.
