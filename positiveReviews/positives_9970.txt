My Family used to Lived in South of Greece (Attika)     Few of my friends used to share home made Olive oil.     it is common that regular House hold in Greece produce own olive oil     at home. its all good and so wonderful!     So rich in Good taste. very hard to fine in any finest     market,(even in Greece)     Olive oil it self is enchance flavor of any dish or dessert.     Now this one comes in large portion of 3 Litre!     This seller is so honest always gives you a honest     exchange rate refrect on the purchase.     Now My family enjoy this from Breakfast to Dinner.     Replaces all Butter should use.     makes great Gerato too!     You can too!
