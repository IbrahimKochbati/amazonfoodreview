Very nice, smooth cup of coffee.  Caribou Coffee has been a favorite of mine since the first time I visited Minnesota and had the opportunity to go to a store and have coffee.  I have since done mail order for their coffee and after purchasing a Keurig coffee machine was happy to see it was available in K cups.  I also enjoy the Caribou Blend but I have to say this blend has a little more "kick" to it but still a smooth coffee with no after taste.
