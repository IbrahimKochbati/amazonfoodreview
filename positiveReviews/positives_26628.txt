We switched to the Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Venison formula after our vet recommended we try it due to possible food allergies in one of our dogs. After switching we noticed a very definite difference in allergies (mostly ear infections) and our dogs have been on this for years. They're both 75lbs and 11 years and going very strong (hopefully for a long time still!) and I credit a lot of that to their quality food, plus regular exercise and fish oil supplement. I would recommend this food all day long.          Yes, it costs more than the cheap food (when does good food not cost more?) but the dogs love it, eat less of it than their previous food and it has helped keep them going well into their senior years.
