In spite of this product being named "Cajun Style," please don't worry about it being too "hot."  It has just the right amount of flavor; not too overpowering and not too bland.  I fried some whiting with it and a family friend said it was the best fish he ever tasted.          A suggestion for those who like really crispy fish is to combine the product with corn meal before frying.  I use a 50 50 ratio.          Buying it this way from Amazon is a money saver because of the free shipping and Amazon's great price.  I saved about $1.25 a box (compared to buying it from the supermarket).  Also, having it shipped to me is much more convenient.          I fully recommend Golden Dipt Cajun Fish Fry Mix.  I believe you'll be pleased buying it from Amazon.
