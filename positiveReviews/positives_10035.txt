This is a "non offensive" middle of the road coffee.  Most coffee drinkers will probably like it, but it's not exactly memorable either.  Better than the grocery store variety, not as good as the high end stuff.  Another reviewer commented that it reminds them of McDonald's coffee, I would agree with that.  McDonald's new coffee isn't bad at all so it's not a complaint.
