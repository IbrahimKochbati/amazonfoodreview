Like several other reviewers, my order just arrived and every can is dented.  None of them seem to be compromised so I will use them.  Just disappointing to receive something like this from Amazon.  I know it probably isn't their fault but they are still shipping it from their warehouse.  Would hate to receive other products in this condition. Farmer's Market should be ashamed of themselves. Having said that, I am pleased to receive them and so is my cat!  I have a feeling that people will be grabbing as much as they can of the 2010 pumpkin crop.
