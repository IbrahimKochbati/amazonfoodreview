The Melitta Cafe Collection "Classique Supreme" coffee is good   make no mistake about that   it's good coffee.  It's a VERY FINE grind, so it comes out strong and exceptionally flavorful.  I use about 10% less of this than I do of other  ands with a normal grind.          It's a good price for a premium coffee, and the fine grind makes it even more economical   while still tasting like an excellent, premium coffee!
