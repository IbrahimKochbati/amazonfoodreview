I purchased this item mostly out of curiosity.  I have been hearing about it and people that are on a strict diet trying to lose weight often rave about it.  To me I will never use it as just straight peanut butter on a cracker or  ead.  I do believe it is good to put in smoothies, if you want peanut butter in your smoothie.  You can vary the consistency depending on  how much water you use.  For smoothie, you can just add the powder right into your blender.  The taste to me is rather bland.  Sure obviously it is missing the FAT  but it is lacking in something else as well...just can't put my finger on it...
