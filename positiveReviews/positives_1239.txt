I have a nearly 1 year old golden retriever standard poodle mix, and a 6 year old german shepherd. The doodle gets the chicken and   own rice (just switched her a few weeks ago from Nutro Max) and the shepherd gets the healthy weight. I have tried several different foods for the doodle, and many of them caused problems like diarrhea and stinky, stinky farts. With this, while switching from the Nutro Max, she had none of those problems. In fact, I only took 5 days to switch her instead of 2 or so weeks, and she didn't have any digestive problems. Both dogs seem to like it and it is definitely cost effective... several dollars cheaper at my local Wegman's and there are always coupons in the paper. This is a very high quality food for the price, and I like that it's available at the grocery store as I live in a small town. I highly recommend this food and hope to feed it exclusively for as long as my doggies shall live!
