I must admit the yellowish color was a little weird at first, but after all it is Butterfinger.  But, the flavor is excellent and it became an instant hit at our house (just put a lid on the cup or you'll have flashbacks of changing baby diapers.)  We buy these machine mixes and add them to hot water dispensed from our Keurig machine.  Much cheaper than going to the mini marts and buying drinks and we often keep a variety of half a dozen or so at all times.  So far though, this is one of my favorites (right behind the Reeses Peanut Butter Cups which is very hard to find at the moment.)
