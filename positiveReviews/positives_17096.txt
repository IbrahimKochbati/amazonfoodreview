I have a 6 month old lab puppy who is way too smart for her own good.  She is into everything and I swear suffers from ADD.  I got this so I could have a few moments peace and it worked!  Now she has to work for her dinner and it gives me 1 2 hour at a time not to have to worry about her getting into other stuff.
