I should probably have realized that Maple AND Brown Sugar would make for a sweet product... but I figured maybe they used both in moderation. I was wrong.          But adding a little milk cuts down the sweetness without watering down the oatmeal. This is still a much better bowl of oatmeal than my local supermarket store  and (and there's more oatmeal per packet), and I actually like it better than McCann's, which I have always found to be a little slimy.
