As with most cats I've read about here, both of mine gulp these down without even the slightest tooth mark in them.  This can make them vomit so my trick is to snap them in two so then they have to chew them because of the ragged edges.  I"m used to the snapping since I have Persians (they have smaller mouths than a regular Tom does) and these aren't hard to snap at all.  They love the taste of these although I'm not all that sure they really help with the furballs.  Does anything really help though?! :)  I do recommend these because of the great taste, but try snapping them in two if your cat has trouble vomiting after gulping his her food.
