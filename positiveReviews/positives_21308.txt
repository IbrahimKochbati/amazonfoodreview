My puppy is a very picky eater and when I found out Cesar had puppy food I had to try it cause I always said if I got a small dog I would want him to b a Cesar dog. This came and I love the fact that it comes in the little trays so it made it easy and neat to store. My puppy took one bite and has not looked back. I have tried to sneak him some of his old food and it is a no go. He just looks at me like don't even try it. My only mistake aw I didn't get the subscription of this, so I don't have to keep placing the order.  It is fresh and saves u a trip to the store. By it being delivered to the house this is one less thing for me to worry about. I work 10 hr days and dont go shopping to often and this is very convent to have my babies food delivered to my door. This is a great buy.
