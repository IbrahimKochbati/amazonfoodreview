I purchased these at a big box petstore locally and I was rather miffed to discover that these are not what they appear. I expected bull pizzles, but it seems all of the "Red Barn"  and Chew A Bulls are reconstituted and not real pizzles. They have gone to great lengths to make the product look like a real bull pizzle, but they are not the real thing and do not last like the real thing. I knew something was wrong when my dog had devoured it within minutes. Close inspection revealed flashing from the mold used to form them and the ends were smooth and uniform, unlike a real pizzle.     Bull pizzles aren't particularly cheap, and neither are the cheap imitations like these.     I truly felt like I had been deliberately deceived, enough so to warn others.
