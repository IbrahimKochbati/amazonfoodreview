My sister lives in NJ and raves about this product.  She has it as a  eakfast sandwich all the time.  I knew absolutely nothing about it and found out it's a local product in NJ from a NJ manufacturer.  The company that sells it online(LIL BIGSHOTS) gets my rave review.  It was hot hot hot out, and they managed to put enough ice packs and dry ice in to keep the shipment frozen for the delivery time.  I've had companies which had much better packaging, but Lil Bigshots got the pork roll to my house in nearly 100ยบ weather and that's all that matters.  As a Southerner, I'm not sure what the fuss was about as far as the pork roll goes.  My friends had various comments about it as a step up or down from baloney depending on how funny they were trying to be.  BUT!  The person who loves it, my sister, got her pork roll sandwiches and she loved every bite.  And I love Lil Bigshots for getting the product to me in time, frozen, and ready to go!
