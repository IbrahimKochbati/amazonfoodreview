I bought a case of this stuff (Dark Chocolate) based on the positive reviews. Big mistake. This is half a step above Swiss Miss. It is definitely not up to the level of Archer (Target  and), Twinings (some grocery stores), or Cadbury (overseas or very few grocery stores).          Cocoa is the 4th ingredient. No chocolate as an ingredient. Bunch of fats and fillers. Archer has cocoa as the second ingredient and chocolate as the 4th and 5th ingredient. That's more like it.          Stephen's chocolate has bad very light color, little aroma, thin, doesn't dissolve. A very disappointing purchase.
