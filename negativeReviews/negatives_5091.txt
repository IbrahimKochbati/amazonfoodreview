I got the large size for my siberian husky. He sniffed around the treat filled bottle and turned away. I tried to show him how to get the treats out by pulling the rope, rolling the bottle, etc, he watched me doing it, and still not interested in trying for himself. He didn't even try to bite the bottle. He played with normal water bottles for hours but he just don't think this tug a jug is worth any attention. Personally I think it's a great idea how they designed the toy, but I just can't get my dog to play with it. Later I introduced this toy to my coworker, who has a little puggle, and he immediately got one. He puggle chewed up the spiked ball on the bottle neck within 5 minutes...so I guess it's not that durable then.
