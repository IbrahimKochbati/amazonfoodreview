I love white chocolate.  This one didn't taste anything like white chocolate usually tastes.  It had a flowery mixed with off milk taste that I found offensive and had difficulty getting out of my mouth.  It was expensive so I managed to get it edible by melting the block and mixing it with a substantial potion of pure cocoa butter and pure vanilla.  I can not recommend this product at all.  I was shocked considering that Callebaut does make good chocolate, but not this one.
