This afternoon I had a Nongshim Bowl Noodle Soup of the Spicy Chicken variety. It's a quick lunch (four minutes) and quite tasty. My only gripes would be that it's too high in sodium, a complaint shared by almost all noodle bowls, and that it doesn't have enough protein for a good meal. I can easily add the latter. I also had a big Delicious Apple to supply something fresh and something with a lot of fiber. Altogether, the combination made a good lunch, and it was quick and easy.          Gary Peterson
