While these cookies are very tasty, I would have liked that all the cookies in the package were whole. we have opened 4 out of the 5 packs each pack had almost half the cookies crumbled or  oken. I found out about these cookies while on a Delta flight. The two pack in which I was given were not damaged I was given 4 packs in all and all of them were fine. The ship box could have been a little larger and better padded.
