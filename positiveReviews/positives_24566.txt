I'd like to first make a note, after reading other reviews, I hesitated to buy this pumpkin because of issues with dented cans. When I received my order, every can was in perfect condition, and well packaged.     As far as the product goes, I love this pumpkin for baking purposes. I make excellent pumpkin muffins with this and when I ran out and used conventional pumpkin, I was disappointed. So, we are hooked on this pumpkin, it's a must have for my muffins.     I did read in other reviews that some folks that feed pumpkin to their dogs didn't like this product, and I will say that my dog who has digestive issues does better on the conventional pumpkin (I believe it has more fiber than the organic), and she doesn't like this kind much. But I'm not basing my 5 star review on my dog. She can eat conventional and we will eat the organic.
