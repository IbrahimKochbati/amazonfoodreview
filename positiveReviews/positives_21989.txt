I've tried all the Alo  and flavors and this one, in my personal opinion, is by FAR the best. It has a perfect taste of Mango and Mangosteen (which I had never heard of before), but it is quite personally addicting (just the right amount of sweetness. The pulp in the drink is also very soft and goes down smooth. You could literally open the cap and down the whole bottle in 2 or 3 gulps, it's that good!          Not sure what the cost is on here since the item is currently out of stock, but out here in Hawaii where I live you can usually find this for about $1.59 a bottle. I wouldn't pay more than that unless you have no other options.          5 stars for being so addicting!
