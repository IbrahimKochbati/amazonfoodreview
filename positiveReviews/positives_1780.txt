I have read a couple of the studies on the anti inflammatory potential of tart cherry juice, and became convinced that it's worth a try (as a 57 YO athlete).  I like this product b c the label tells exactly how many cherries a tablespoon is equivalent to, so I can make an informed choices as to how much I use, based on the number of cherry equivalents in the studies I've read.  I can't vouch for the accuracy of the label, but I've no reason to doubt it.  I've grown to like the flavor, especially mixed with lime seltzer!
