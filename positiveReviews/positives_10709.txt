Confession time. I haven't personally tasted Newman's Own Organics new dog treats but they smell way yummier than most dog treats. (My dog Sheila has tasted them and she quickly started groveling for more. It was pathetic.) Seriously, I don't have to taste these to know that they are good. The Newman's Own Corp. and its spin off Newman's Own Organics have been making quality food for pets and people for almost 30 years. Their organic products are independently certified as organic by Oregon Tilth, a third party certifying agency for organic farmers. Among other things, their certification means that the products used by Newman's Own Organics are grown on farms that do not use artificial pesticides or synthetic chemicals of any kind during the production of their products. In the case of their Lamb & Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats, that includes organic, lamb, barley, carrots, apples and molasses.          I'm not seriously into organic products myself but there is precious little regulation when it comes to what goes into pet products. I am glad to see that some people take my dog's health seriously.          As consumers, we should also remember that Paul Newman and his companies has given over $200 million to charity over the years. Who better to give your money to?
