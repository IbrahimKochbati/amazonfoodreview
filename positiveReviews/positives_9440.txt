I prefer handcooked (read fried) peanuts to dry roasted and these are very good. however, they are not as fresh and  ight tasting as Whitley's peanuts which are not sold on Amazon at the moment, but can be found at gourmet shops. You would think they would be the same, both being from Williamsburg and all.
