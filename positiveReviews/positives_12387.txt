Sure, it's unhealthy, but if you are expecting to eat Ramen you won't be disappointed.          I rarely eat these noodle bowls, but when I ate this one I was pleasantly surprised by the spiciness of the  oth.  You usually never get that   you know, where they say 'spicy' but it really is just spicy to middle America, not those used to eating Thai or Indian food.          In this case, it is just spicy enough.  You start to sweat a tiny bit, but it doesn't burn your mouth.          Would I buy this regularly? Probably not, it isn't healthy enough, but would I buy one or two of these to stick in my office cabinet in case I have to work late and haven't made alternate dinner plans? Sure I would.          Tasty enough, no Msg, lower sodium (probably because it has the added spiciness to counteract) and a good enough taste.
