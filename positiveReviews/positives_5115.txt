When I opened the package, I only found 11 packets of the Honey Stingers. There should have been 12. I counted and re counted 4 times to be sure. The packets were in a thin cardboard display box, wrapped in a sealed plastic bag, and shipped in a sturdy cardboard box. I don't really want to go through the hassle of returning the item, so I guess I'm out a pack.  It'd be nice if amazon shipped me one more packet! ; )
