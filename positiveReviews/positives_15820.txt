Found out about this stuff on TheWorldAccordingToEggface and everything she uses this stuff in really tastes better.  I use it in protein shakes and protein sugar free low fat homemade ice cream.  It just adds a touch of flavor with no calories, sugar or fat. My favorite shake is using coffee, protein powder, dash of Any Torani Syrup, fat free milk and ice.  Yummo!!!  Thank you Torani, Thank you Eggface!!
