I've been addicted to these bars for some years, buying them at a local supermarket, and  eaking off a square now and then through the day as a treat.  The orange flavoring complements the creamy medium cacao (54%) chocolate wonderfully. If you are an orange chocolate fan, melt a square in your mouth and enjoy.  I find the orange flavoring superior to that of other organic chocolate bars with orange flavor or bits of orange zest.  If you want a truly dark chocolate taste, you'll have to look elsewhere though.          (I came across these bars after my favorite treat was no longer distributed in the US   a much darker organic chocolate covering bitter orange orange zest jellies.  They were killer good.  While this doesn't compare, it mostly satisfies my orange chocolate cravings.)
