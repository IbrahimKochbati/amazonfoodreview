I'm never sure if manufacturers cater to Americans who have a sweet tooth, or if Americans have a sweet tooth because they become acclimated to the  food they buy being sweet.  Each of these bars has 8 grams of sugar.  I realize this isn't too bad when compared to other products in this category, but my personal preference is for less sugar.          Other than that, this is a great product...especially for someone who loves coconut and chocolate together.  I am not sensitive to gluten, but I do opt for gluten free products when I can, so that's another plus for Pamela's Whenever Bars.  Good news for a small bar (1.41 oz)   there are 9 grams of whole grains and 180 mg of Omega 3 Fatty Acids.  And these bars taste great!  No one would suspect they are healthier than a cookie or a lot of their competitors.          For the environmentalists, the box is made of recycled materials, and utilizes soy ink.
