Who doesn't love Oreo cookies?  Many of us well remember after school snacks of Oreo cookies and milk.  However, also for many of us those school days when we could eat all we wished and not gain an ounce are in the past.  So, it's a special treat that  ings back all kinds of good memories to find Oreo Thin Crisps.           No, I was not one who pulled the cookie apart to lap the frosting, I just loved the chocolatey taste and that is all in these cookies less the unwanted cals. They're crispy, crunchy, chocolate wafers   a wonderful comfort snack.           A high five for Oreo Thin Crisps!              Gail Cooke
