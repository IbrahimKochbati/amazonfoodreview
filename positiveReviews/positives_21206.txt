Yogurt made with this starter and organic whole milk is simply the best I have ever tasted. It does not have the thin, sour taste that most of the single culture starters produce. The taste is instead smooth and full bodied. It is also thicker than most when a little dry milk is added. The process takes a bit longer, since the milk must be heated to 180 degrees, then cooled to 75. The cooling requires an ice water bath, or the temperature would never get that low in our kitchen. After 12 hours in the Yogourmet Multi, which starts at room temperature and very gradually increases to 112 degrees, the yogurt is perfect every time. It is so good that it makes a good dessert all by itself, and is even better mixed with fruit. Combined with mayonnaise, it makes a fine potato or carrot raisin salad. Smoothies are really smooth. Give it a try in your favorite recipe. You will love it!
