My dogs LOVE these treats.  The chicken ones DO NOT have as much meat on them and when I complained the customer service was not a good experience, so if you do have problems or are unhappy with the product don't expect the company to do anything.  I will continue to buy the duck wrapped ones as long as they stay the same.
