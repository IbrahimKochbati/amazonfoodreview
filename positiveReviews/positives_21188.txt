I use 2 cans of this chili as a starter and add:     1 onion, chopped     1 or 2 cans rinsed pinto beans     28 oz can diced or crushed tomatoes     1 pkg. frozen soy crumbles     1 2 cup salsa (mild, med, or hot!)     1 can or 1 and 1 2 cups frozen corn     cumin, chili powder, ground red pepper (if desired)          Heat and Serve over hot rice topped with cheddar cheese.  This makes a bit pot of chili and is hearty and delicious.
