I had the regular size one and recently purchased the x small. I am so happy they came out with the x small one. It is holding up really well. I'm surprised some people say it doesn't hold up. The first one I got wouldn't die. My dog never was destructive with it. I think it is an awesome toy and I highly recomend it.
