We have 7 dogs. 6 of them wouldn't eat this, the 7th acted like it was the best thing ever.          the treats themselves look nice enough, small squares, sort of like cookies. bite sized for most dogs and didn't have any colors in them to run on the carpet or anything like that. So its really all about whether or not your dog likes lamb and barley. Hope that helps you
