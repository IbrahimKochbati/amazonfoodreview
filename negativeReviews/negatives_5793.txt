I've tried 3 different recipes with Carbquik.  I used it to  ead chicken  just barely ok.  The biscuits I tried were terrible.  The dumplings for chicken and dumplings were a mess.  They didn't hold together when I put them in the boiling chicken  oth to cook.  I had to pitch the doughy mess and order dinner out.  The mix its self has a peculiar odor that is unappetizing.  I wouldn't recommend buying this product.
