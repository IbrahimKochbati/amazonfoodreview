I've really enjoyed every Starbucks Via variety I've tried    the Italian and Colombian roasts, caramel and iced coffees especially. However, I've been hoping for a more mild blend since Starbucks can be a little too strong at times. So I was really excited to try this Breakfast Blend via, which is labeled as "mild." Sadly, it's anything but. It's not only still strong, but also bitter, and leaves an awful sour aftertaste. I can't  ing myself to drink another cup, even if it means a waste of money. Horrible.
