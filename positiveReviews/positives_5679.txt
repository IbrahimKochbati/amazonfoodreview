I have recently purchased the Vue by Kurig and I must say my initial impressions are very positive. The new design provides a better cup of coffee. Having used Green Mountain Nantucket Breakfast Blend before, I was presented with a very good cup of coffee. It is actually stronger and better flavored than the original. The  ewing system must contribute to the difference. If you like medium roast coffee as your morning "wake me up" than you should give this a try assuming you are going to use it in the new Vue machine.
