Coconut palm sugar and date palm sugar are used in cooking in Southeast Asia. The sweetness is rather like a mild  own sugar or a raw sugar and coconut sugar is not highly processed, whereas cane and beet sugar are highly processed.          Coconut sugar consists primarily of sucrose which is chemically the same as cane or beet sugar, but it has a small amount of glucose and fructose. Attention, diabetics, it should be dealt with carefully, though it is said to be lower glycemic, with a glycemic index of 35. It is said to be diabetic friendly, but I'd be sure to test it out and measure blood sugar levels, to make sure how your system reacts to this sweetener. (I am not diabetic, but I am always chary of any new sweetener that claims to be low glycemic or better for diabetics as each person can have quite different reactions.)          In any case, this has more minerals, less processing and tastes great. It's a really great substitute for raw sugar or evaporated cane juice and excellent especially for Asian cooking. I like jaggery sugar (date palm sugar) but as it comes in an unwieldy lump that needs grating, this granulated coconut sugar is a good substitute when making certain chutneys and other curries.
