I bought these on super sale because I needed them for a pie crust and they were cheap.  I got the 3 pack and was at first dismayed to find that they were not packed like other graham crackers are usually packed, they were loose in a bag, not stacked in  icks to fill the box     this meant there were many less per box than I had anticipated.  But when I tried one I was immediately impressed, they taste fantastic!          These taste nothing like the kind of graham crackers we were fed in kindergarden, they have actual flavor and are much more than just an ingredient or child's fare.  What these lack in volume they make up for in quality.          I immediately ordered three more 3 packs while they were so cheap, I have a toddler at home and am happy to supply us all with these wonderful graham crackers.  They do not have any scary fillers or ingredients; they are made with butter and not trans fat, and you can snack on nine of them with your coffee for only 130 calories    not bad!          They also make a pie crust that is noticeably better than what I used to make dessert crusts with.          I was so impressed at what Stonewall Kitchen could do to a graham cracker that I am going to check out other products they make.
