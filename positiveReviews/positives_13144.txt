I was interested in this product for health reasons and was surprised at what a great flavor addition it was to my menu. This is a top shelf producer with a great history in Italy. Top quality product, my only wish was for instructions as to water to grain ratio and timing until done. I was able to get instructions from search engine so not a big deal just another step to cooking process. I can't say enough about the quality and flavor of this product and the reputation of this producer.
