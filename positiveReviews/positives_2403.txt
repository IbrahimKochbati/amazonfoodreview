I recently purchased a  ead machine and I tried  this potato  ead mix.  I have made it three times now and it has come out amazing each and every time.  The other great thing about this particular mix is that I have experimented with altering the amount of Butter ( in the last batch I actually doubled the butter amount but then added less water) and it came out buttery and yuuuummmmmmyyyy!!          I encourage everyone who has a  ead machine to try this particular mix.
