We discovered a cafe that had excellent Mexican mochas about three years ago. They were expensive but we didn't visit that often. Then we discovered this was the powder used to make the mochas. It is all natural and tastes great. It is really rich and has nice spicy undertones. This is the cheapest way to purchase it in bulk.          Now we make our mochas at home with an espresso machine and steamed milk. This also is loved by our children for hot chocolate.
