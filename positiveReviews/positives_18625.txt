My husband had purchased this product, as a single bottle, at our local supermarket for $5.99. I love pepper on my foods. The flavor of the three different peppercorns in one grinder adds a nice and tasty "ping" to your foods, meats, poultry, seafood, salads. Buying it here was so much more economical.
