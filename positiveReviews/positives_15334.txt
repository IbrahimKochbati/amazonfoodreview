I purchased the B40 model and after using it for about 3 days, I must say I am loving this machine. I was a bit weary with the two cup settings and the strength of the coffee, but honestly, there's been no real issue. Some k cups will  ew lighter than others and should not be used with the 10 oz setting. However, I have found that the extra bold flavors work well with the 10 oz setting, which is nice because I like my coffee strong.
