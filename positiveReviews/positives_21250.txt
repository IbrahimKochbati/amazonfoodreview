Ready Brek was a treat when I was growing up in England in the 60's and 70's, and I occasionally buy it still. It is very finely ground oatmeal, and when mixed with water or milk tends to have the consistency of wallpaper paste (for those of us old enough to remember when you still had to slop paste on wallpaper), and the bland taste is probably similar too. Funny thing is, I like it! If you grew up on this, then try it for old time's sake; if you've never tasted it before, I can pretty much guarantee you'll find it to be gross!!
