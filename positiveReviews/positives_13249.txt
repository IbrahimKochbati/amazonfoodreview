We switched to this dog food after our 12 yr old mixed  eed dog started losing weight and developed severe dermatitis, itching, scratching and shedding! For 12 yrs, we had been giving her a name  and dry product we purchased at local pet stores.  She is a completely different dog these days!  She has gained back all her weight, is happy, and does not itch,scratch or shed.  I HIGHLY recommend this dog food!  It is made of natural, good ingredients.
