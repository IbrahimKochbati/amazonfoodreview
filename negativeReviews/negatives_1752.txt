Bobs Red Mill Pumkin Seeds came to me in a great box..and inside the box well packaged and extremly secure shelled seeds.          I cannot say enough about the quality of the packaging  a really nice thing for me  because it takes some time for me to finish them all  and they stay fresh and secure because of the special care taken in the packaging.          The quality of the seeds themselves is very good. They are uniform in appearance...well shaped...appetizing..and healty looking.          The price here is totally right for those of us that need more closer to a bulk level of foods. These came in a multipack carton.          These are not only items by Bob Red Mills   there are many  and if grains and nuts and seeds are in your diet..your childrens diet or even your pets diet.....then I cannot recommend this line enough to you  for fresh ....healthy eating !          Try them !
