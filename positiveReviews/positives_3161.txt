This thing works instantly. You plug in your mic and plug the usb into your computer. It will light up, then you adjust the sound to what is audible. It can get pretty loud. I was intimidated at first when contemplating the purchase because of the low price; but it has done everything I needed it for. The other preamp models I was looking at were near $200.          The only "downside" to this is that it looks plastic. I don't consider it a con because the look doesnt really matter.
