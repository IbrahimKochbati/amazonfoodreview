I have been so happy with this product!  My baby girl has always had a sensitive tummy, up late hours w  pains and crying with nothing to sooth her.  I finally found this product, our natropath suggested it.  My daughter loves it and it really helped her tummy!  Now, I wont giver her any other formula.  It organic and difficult to find at local stores in my area.  I found amazon to have the best price and its easy to have it delivered to the door.  Id suggest this formula to anyone!
