hi every one I just wanted to share some of my experience with you about this product. First off all it taste pretty good but its kinda sugary and salty. Its an ok drink but when you think about it and you compare it to others this drink is not as healthy as others. Its more like a juice drink than a healthy one. Compared to Vitacoco it has more calories, twice the sodium, half the potassium and almost half the vitamin C. This drink also has less magnesium, phosphorous, and 4 times less calcium. The only this the drink does have over Vitacoco is the 1 less gram of sugar. Overall pay the extra price and get a better drink for your body and if you dont believe me go to the websites and check the facts below or check it out on their web site.          O.N.E.
