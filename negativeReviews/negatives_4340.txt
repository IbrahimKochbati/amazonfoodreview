It took a while for them to arrive and when it did. I simply seasoned my rice with a dash of this while boiling the rice to completion. After using this, the next day I became nauseous and have constant bubbling in my lower left side of stomach area. I am perfectly healthy but this did start something.  Again, I only used a dash. It was either this or the normal tea I had at Starbucks. I lean towards the granules but maybe I have some type of over reactive thyroid gland.
