Pros: Easy to use. Plug it in, set your levels and go! Works well with Condenser Mics. Has 48v Phantom Power. Runs solely off USB (No need for a wall wart).          Cons: Very plastic. Feels like it could snap with the slightest bit of rough handling! I wouldn't try to plug it directly into a mic. Use an XLR cable. No headphone monitoring jack and quite a bit of latency when monitoring with a separate interface. I would not recommend it for Dynamic mics. I tried it with my Rode Procaster Dynamic Mic and could not get high enough levels without practically yelling into the mic. I also tried it with an old V Tech handheld stage mic and levels were a little better, so dynamics with a higher line output might work better with it.          Overall, it does what it's supposed to, but it could be a lot better. For about $30 40 more, you can get better interfaces with 2 mic inputs, but this one is nice for situations where running off of USB power is a must.
