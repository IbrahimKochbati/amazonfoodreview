I was a skeptic about this product until I tried it with skim milk. This cereal is delicious and retains its crunch even after 5 minutes of being soaked in milk. I enjoy its texture and caramelly flavor. I think it could definitely be less sweet and lower carb, but so far, I find this cereal to have the highest fiber content. The other vitamins and minerals a single serving contains is also comparable to similar products by other companies. This is perfect for  eakfast or a snack any time of the day!
