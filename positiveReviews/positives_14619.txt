This is not your typical honey. Granted its organic and cream colored although it is not creamed honey. It is "pure" honey in the truest definition. The texture is solid, dense, somewhat waxy and velvety smooth with a pleasant floral taste. It describes itself as a gel, but I think it is much denser and although one gets a 1# jar, it is a small weighty jar. It softens easily on a piece of warm toast which is heavenly (no butter needed) or simply enjoy eating a spoonful by letting it melt in your mouth for a sensual treat. Due to its cost, which I think it is worth every cent, I won't be using it in tea. I'll continue using Rain Forest organic honey also sold on Amazon for that purpose. I think of this American Canadian made honey as a true health food as it has numerous benefits. If you ever purchased the creamed South of France honey in the pail that Amazon used to carry, this honey's flavor and texture(when softened)will remind you of that incredible French honey. This is now my favorite honey. I encourage you to visit YS Organic Bee Farms website for additional information as they are a remarkable company. Also to comment on Swanson, the company that sold it, they were quick to fulfill and ship the order, both jars were well packed, they thanked me for my order a couple of times and sent a coupon for $5 off a future order which can be used in a direct order w  them or on Amazon. So you know I'll be reordering this delightful honey and a few lucky friends may also receive a jar.
