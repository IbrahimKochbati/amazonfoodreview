This peanut butter is delicious. You get the taste of chocolate, with the benefits of peanut butter. One serving of this has no more calories than one serving of regular peanut butter. I especially like to put it in a whole wheat pita half and then put the whole thing in the toaster. This is the stuff dreams are made of. :)
