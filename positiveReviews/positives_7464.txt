I love really good coffee and, in fact, go to great lengths to  ew the best i.e. freshly ground beans, purest water, immaculate coffee maker, etc. I have been extremely happy with virtually all of Jeremiah's coffees; and, I have a number of different beans on hand at all times. The Breakfast Blend is stand out. Also, try this and their Fogbuster. You will not be disappointed. AAAA++++
