I am insistent that if I drink decaf, it has to be SWISS WATER PROCESSED.  All other decaf is just absolutely bad for you.  If you are going to buy organic and fair trade, buy swiss water processed also!          I tried a few others and couldn't stand them.  I tried Jeremiah's Pick  and and couldn't stand it.  But it tasted like maybe they had exhaust fumes on them so maybe I got a bad shipment  I also tried Newman's Owns and a few others.  I was really hesitant to buy two pounds of this only to end up giving it away.          I am happy to say I like it.  I only wish it was a medium roast as I prefer light and medium over dark. I'll look at their other stuff.
