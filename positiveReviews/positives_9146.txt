I was so excited to try these.  I am trying to find economical GOOD for you food.  I ate one of these and a cup of Joe and I was full. Delicious!  Heated it 20 seconds. That of course is unfrozen.  I immediately froze the rest to keep them fresh as no preservatives in them. I think you have to heat it about 40 seconds when frozen.  My son had one (He is 21) and he had to have two to fill him.  He likes them a lot. My Mom had one and she was full.  She could not quit talking about how good they are. Another reason  I also wanted to try these is because my Mom has Alzheimers and cannot cook on stove safely anymore. She likes to snack and get things herself so these are perfect.  She can still use the microwave. I feel these are healthy eating and that makes me feel good. We all have medical disabilities so the easier the better. The really cool part is that they are just a little over a 1.00 each for  eakfast! We love the Morning Glory and am fixing to order more with Amazon Prime. By the way for those of you who don't know about Prime, it is wonderful and we have saved so much on shipping this year. Also, it is quick 2 day free shipping and 3,95 for overnight.  I try to only buy products that have Prime on them. Our cookies came today (a Saturday) with Prime 2 day by Fed Ex. That is another thing I love is shipping is free with Prime on these. If you shop  a lot on Amazon (which I am doing more and more) the 70.00 is a great value for a years membership. Gotta order more cookies now! Blessings!          UPDATE 11 7 10:  I HAVE READ COMMENTS THAT SOME PEOPLE HAD THESE GET MOULD ON THEM. PLEASE REMEMBER TO FREEZE THESE AS THEY HAVE NO PRESERVATIVES.  THERE IS A NOTE  ON WHITE PAPER FROM ERIN BAKER IN EACH PACKAGE WHICH SUGGESTS  YOU DO THIS AND WHY.  JUST HATE TO SEE ERIN GET BASHED FOR THIS WHEN IT IS NOT HER FAULT. MINE GO IN THE FREEZER AS SOON AS THEY ARRIVE. THAT WAY THEY ARE ALWAYS FRESH. STILL LOVE THESE COOKIES!           I AM NOW ON MONTHLY AUTOMATIC MAILING SO WE HAVE THEM EVEN IF I FORGET TO ORDER ON TIME. THAT WAY IT IS EVEN LESS EXPENSIVE. HOW CAN YOU GO WRONG? GREAT BARGAIN FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE TO WATCH OUR PENNIES.          MY MOM (who has alzheimers) LOVES THEM SO MUCH I HATE TO THINK WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF I QUIT ORDERING THEM. SHE TALKS ABOUT THEM ALL THE TIME . SHE WAS FEELING SO DOWN AS SHE CANNOT COOK MUCH AT ALL ANYMORE AND  SINCE THESE THEY ARE EASY FOR HER TO HEAT IN THE MICROWAVE, IT MAKES HER FEEL BETTER ABOUT HERSELF. THANK YOU ERIN!
