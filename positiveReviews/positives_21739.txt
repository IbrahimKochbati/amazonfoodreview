These are great, long lasting chews for small dogs.  Our Yorkie will spend a happy hour or two with a new chew, and then return to it later for more gnawing.  The chewing puts Samson (small dogs need big names) in a tranquil, my  ain is in neutral state, and my wife and I feel good because we're not poisoning him with made in China junk.  Besides all that, the chews don't stink, as did some lower quality  ands we tried.
