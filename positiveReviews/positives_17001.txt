My  other turned me onto these toys, and I'll be forever grateful. I have a Chihuahua shaped vacuum cleaner of a dog who is utterly obsessive about food, and a neurotic Shep Lab mix who will turn her nose up at food in a bowl, yet gobble up "found" food. These toys are the ideal solution for both dogs. The Chih works harder to get the food out (we have the med large size jugs, so they're pretty big for him to manipulate), which means he's burning off calories. He tends to be a bit of a chub, so this is a good thing. The Shep Lab mix has an easier time of it, but the toy keeps her occupied and she seems to enjoy it. I've just adopted another dog from the shelter, and gave her her own Tug a Jug. It's great for her b c she has to stay crated a lot right now (healing from her spay surgery, plus the vet put her on very restricted activity while she recovers from an upper respiratory infection). I make sure to put the jugs away when I leave the house (don't want anyone fighting over food), but they're wonderful for when I'm working from home and need to keep the dogs busy while I'm on the phone with clients. (Murphy's Law of Dog Ownership #1: Your dog will bark like a freaking maniac   but for no discernible reason   the moment you get on the phone with the client you've been trying to reach for a week.)          Our experiences with these toys have been great, so I heartily recommend them. My Chih has been determinedly trying to manipulate his jug into spitting out more food for the past 30 minutes, and his tail has been wagging the whole time.
