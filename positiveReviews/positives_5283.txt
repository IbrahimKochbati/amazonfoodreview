This was pretty tasty, but orange has never been my favorite. I recommend it if you like oranged flavored drinks. I absolutely love the strawberry kiwi. These drinks are not too sweet, natural and refreshing I will continue to try them. My beverage of choice is water and milk (and wine ;0) )...but for an ocassional treat drinks like these are great.     Try them.
