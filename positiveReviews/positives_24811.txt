My wife orders these for the Kiddos when they are on sale and it's a good deal.     As you may know, these little cans hold that disgustingly awesome Ravioli.  I usually take these on backpacking trips since they are pretty good, easy to eat and awesome for 'OUT OF THE CAN and INTO THE MAN' (as I always say).
