These POPCHIPS are fantastic!!! I tried them at Target, on Sunday and I was hooked. I bought one bag. I came back on Monday evening, and they were sold out!!! I had to go to another store. The barbeque is my favorite!!! My kids enjoy them.  I have everyone at my job eating them also. They are a little pricey at the grocery store, but I have to have them on a daily basis!!
