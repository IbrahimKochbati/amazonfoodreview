I've had good experience with pod teas in the past, so I was hoping that now that I have a Keurig  ewer I'd be able to find some good tea blends.  This Madarin Orange Spice Herbal Tea is really good.  It has a pleasant orange spice flavor that is strong enough when  ewed at the maximum 12 oz setting of my Cuisinart Keuring  ewer.  Add a little sweetener of your choosing and it makes a refreshing beverage hot or over ice.  I will definitely buy again when I use up these portions.
