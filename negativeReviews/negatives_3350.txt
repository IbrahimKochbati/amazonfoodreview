Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats, 10 Ounce (Pack of 6) were not enthusiastically welcomed by our two dogs a terrier mutt and a German shepherd.  Both dogs were kind of suspicious when I handed them their Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Style Dog treats in their 10 ounce pack of 6.  Maybe the treats were too dry.  Later the dogs munched on them politely I think to not hurt my feelings.  I tried them (Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Style Dog treats) and found them to be delightful with a shot of  andy.
