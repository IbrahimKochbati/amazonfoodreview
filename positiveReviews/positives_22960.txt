It really is very simple. These things are SO freaking good!!! A great snack to take to school, work, or in the car, whenever! They are slightly salty but also a little sweet so it's a great mixture of flavors. I'm not even a huge nut person, but lordy, these are amazing! I'm eating some right now and I am having trouble keeping my hand out of the bag long enough to write this review! XD Enjoy!
