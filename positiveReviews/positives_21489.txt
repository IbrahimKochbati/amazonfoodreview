A pair of these giant bags of your basic peanut M&M's sort of shrinkwrapped together, for the same price others are selling just one bag.  I took these as a gift for a friend in Italy who hadn't been able to find them there.  I had to pull one out of my suitcase to get it back under the weight requirements and put it in my carryon, no problems with either.  My friend was delighted when they arrived and began snacking happily away immediately.
