i cannot believe that i found these on amazon!!!!  i became addicted to the little, choclate covered, macadamia delights in tokyo and thought that i would be doomed to a life without them back in the states.  BE WARNED CONSUMER!  HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!!!  HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!!!  recently, i mourned the devouration of my last box... but i've found them again!!!!  I CAN LIVE! I CAN LIVE!!!!!!!
