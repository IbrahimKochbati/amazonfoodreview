These were some of the worst bags of candy that I have ever purchased.  Over half of each package (pack of 4) the candy bars were melted and disformed in addition to them having the "OLD" chocolote white fuzzy look and funny smell.  Got them to give to my grandkids and had to throw over half of them away.  Pretty bad when kids refuse to eat candy.  This will be the last time I order candy from Amazon.  If I want candy for the kids, I will have to go to the stores and get it fresh.
