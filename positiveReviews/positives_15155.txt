We have tried several other  ands of compariable ingredients and this one by far is the best. Our dogs coats are very shiny with no allergy issues and our 13 yr. old lab has had issues since she was a couple of years old but with Canidae she has had no issues and she has been on it for over a year now.She had issues with TSC's new  and and Chicken Soup.Would have given 5 stars but is kinda expensive but you get what you pay for!
