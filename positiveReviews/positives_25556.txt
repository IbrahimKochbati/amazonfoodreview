a great tea, much better than the whole flower hibiscus you find in mexico or  ish markets, because it's ground finer so you need to use less. one bag will last a long, long time, the tea is delicious, and new studies say hibiscus lowers blood pressure. we drink it constantly (add a cinnamon stick, a little sugar, and you're good to go)
