Being new at Korean cooking several recipes I intend to cook calls for dried seaweed.  The seaweed that I saw on Korean cooking TV shows was thin in texture.  I was so lucky that the Welpac Dashi Kombu Dried Seaweed I purchased on Amazon was the right kind of seaweed.          It is great, so I recommend this  and of seaweed whenever your recipe calls for seaweed.
