Unless you've got a clam roller somewhere on your property, I doubt seriously that you could whip up a better bowl of chowder! The clams were tender, fresh, plentiful, and remarkably non gritty. The 'taters' were tasty and not overly done. I would recommend that they cut back a bit on the tapioca starch and add some medium cream, instead.  I like to add some diced Vidalya onion or red bell pepper. Stir in some milk, butter, and black pepper, and you're on your way to a delightful meal.
