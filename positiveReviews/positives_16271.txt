My pekingese loves these!She is known to be quite a picky eater,so I ordered the sample size( called a 'mini treat pak' of the Greenies first to see if she'd like them.( I believe the sample size  22 of the 'Teenie' size). She ended up loving them,so I kept the small zip lock pouch the sample size came in. I just take about 20 of the Greenies at a time from the large 96 chews container and refill the zip lock pouch.*It also is a great way to  ing some Greenies along with you when you are traveling with your dog!
