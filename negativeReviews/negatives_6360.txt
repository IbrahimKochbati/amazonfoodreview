The primary ingredient is potato flakes. I guess it'll fill up your dog, if nothing else. And there is really nothing else.     The second primary ingredient is chicken meal. That's the only source of protein and it's not even real chicken.     Just because it's organic doesn't mean it's good for your dog. Organic low quality ingredients is still low quality.
