So I'm not going to taste these myself so I'll just have to rely on the enthusiastic reception by my wheaten terrier. Obviously the big draw here is the quality ingredients and assurance of the  and. I probably am more willing to spend on quality  and food for my dog than I am for me. I try to avoid Chinese food products since they have regulatory issues. No need to rehash the whole pet food scandal. That said it's easy to but junk American pet food too so I try to shop carefully. This seems to be a quality dog snack that the dog enjoys...
