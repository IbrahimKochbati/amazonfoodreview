With peanut butter prices going through the roof, I've been looking for a more economical way way of buying it in bulk.  We have four kids, and I eat a low carb diet, so we eat a lot of peanut butter.  When I saw this 35 pound bucket offered with free SuperSaver shipping, I leaped!          The product itself is very good   just like Fisher's other nuts and products, it has a great flavor, and it's creamy and not too salty.  The lid on the bucket fits well, so I can reseal it after transferring some of it to smaller jars for the kitchen.  It's a little messy having to dip it out that way, but well worth it when I save $1 2 per pound over buying store  and peanut butter at the grocery.  I spray a one cup measuring cup with cooking spray, to keep it from sticking too much, and use a rubber scraper to get it all in the jar without any waste.          I notice the price has risen from $60 to $90 since I bought my bucket.  I probably wouldn't have purchased this bucket at $90, but I'll be watching the price and will buy it again when it's a great bargain like when I purchased it.
