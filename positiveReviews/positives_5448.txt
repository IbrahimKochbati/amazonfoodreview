The candy is ordinary milk chocolate, but I was very glad to have an organic option to hand out for Halloween. I love the idea of including a little nature education with it, but I was a little disappointed in the text on the insect card I saw, which was not well written and had almost nothing to do with the moth that was pictured. But it's more than you get with most candy.
