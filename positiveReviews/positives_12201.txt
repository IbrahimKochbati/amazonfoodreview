Over the last year and a half we have been trying all different coffee for our Keurig and making our friends and family do a taste test whenever they drop in.     This coffee far and away won everyone over except uncle Pete who likes his coffee to look like chocolate syrup and make your eyes pop.     Mild but not weak. Great tasting.  The only coffee we will be serving at our house from now on. I have just put it on auto delivery. Love it !
