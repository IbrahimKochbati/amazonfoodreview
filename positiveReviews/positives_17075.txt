3 dogs, 1 loves it and uses it as intended.  The only complaint there is that he's become far too good at it and learned how to push the rope in and out very quickly.  He 48 lbs, gets his regular meals in it and finishes in about 15 minutes.  I wish it took him longer but it sure is awesome watching him be so good at it!  Worked great for the second dog for a few weeks, he wasn't as good at it, so it took him a bit longer to empty it so we thought it might be perfect for him.  We were wrong, he chewed the rope in half one day.  : (  Third dog is just kind of dumb and just smells it and looks at it.  The plastic is really rugged though, they're able to toss it around on stained concrete floors without  eaking it!          Overall, I LOVE this company's toys.  One of my dogs chewed a Kong but hasn't been able to destroy Premier's Squirrel toy.  Dumb dog likes the Twist 'n' Treat, it doesn't take very much  ain power...
