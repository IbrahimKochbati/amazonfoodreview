Living in a very isolated area gives me few options as to where I purchase items such as these peppercorns.  Of the several I have tried, the quality and freshness of these are by far the best.  I use white pepper in many of the dishes I make and having good quality peppercorns is a must.  I was extremely satisfied with these.  As to the cost, I have found that you pretty much get what you pay for.  Yes, the shipping is outrageous but it is outrageous for everything these days.  You can by a used .01 cent paper back book, and still end up paying almost four dollars.  The cost here is well worth the price.
