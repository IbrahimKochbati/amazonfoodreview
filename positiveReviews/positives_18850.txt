I have tried all types of raw dog food for my yorkie. He used to like the Paw Naturaw Grassfed Bison meals, but the last two bags i received had to be mixed with fresh raw meat in order for him to eat it. I tried Stella & Chewy's Freeze Dried Raw meals and ended up having to do the same with that food. This morning i put out a small portion of "ZiwiPeak Real Meat Grain Free Air Dried Raw Dog Food, Venison & Fish" from a 2.2 lb bag and my yorkie gobbled it up. Shipping was quick too. I order on Monday and received it on Tuesday. I am very pleased with the product and the shipment.          I am sold on this product and will definitely order this again.
