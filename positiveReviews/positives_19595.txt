Every year I buy a container of Cosmic Catnip to make a few "tube sock" type toys with for my cats (currently 8 and 9 years  Female and male respectively) for Christmas. Even with the toy downstairs and wrapped in some thick wrapping paper, the cats go directly to their toy and try to claw off the paper to start playing with it. The toy entices them for about a week, which afterwards the smell of the catnip starts to vanish. If I accidently leave the lid of the container off, I'll find the jar tipped over and two kitties eating up the leaves and rolling their faces in it.          The only down side of this nip, being sold in such bulk and so pure, is it has "stem like" pieces in the container, which can poke through fa ic when making toys for the cats. I try to pull out all the stems before filling the toys up with the nip or letting the cats nibble on the product raw. The cats don't seem to mind, however, and there have never been any incidents where the stem gets stuck in their mouth (you know, like when we eat popcorn and the kernel always gets jammed in our mouths).          Bottom line: Some powerful nip, the most potent of any nip I've ever bought and will continue to buy it every year.
