I wanted to purchase Libby's products because they state a product of the USA. Sounds like an American thing to do.  As with another reviewer of Libby vegetables, I have found significantly dented cans all secured and packaged upon delivery. It does not appear to be damage sustained in Amazon's packing or shipping. (I finally got around to cleaning my pantry to unpack and store my veges when I saw large side dents in four of the 12 cans.) These cans must have been packed dented at Libby's because the dented cans were not even noticeable until they were removed from their original cases. As a result of this damage, I no longer am subscribing to these canned goods on line. I don't save anything when there is a possibility of being poisoned. Sorry Amazon, you need to be aware that you are selling Libby's damaged products. I have to buy locally so I can be sure the cans are not dented and the food inside safe to consume.  It's nice that some customers did not get dented cans, but, I did get them in several cases.
