My husband and I love Coach's Oats.  We first tried them on recommendation by a friend.  They are kind of nutty and rich in flavor.  The oat is not rolled, not quite cracked, but somewhere in between. They have a great texture.  They take about 5 minutes to cook.  We first bought them at Costco, now they don't carry them anymore and we can't find them anywhere.  We would like to order them online, but don't want to dish out shipping charges.  Hoping that Amazon starts carrying them soon.
