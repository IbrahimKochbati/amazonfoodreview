I have been on a diet plan, and use this syrup to give my vanilla shakes some variety. It works really well. I also use it in coffee and tea. My kids (16 to 20 years old) use it, too. All flavors are great! The chocolate (which reviews said was too strong) was particularly tasty and was the first one to be gone, and the others are also disappearing. I am doing a subscription plan, which cuts the cost and ensures there is enough for everyone. I'd love to see a 'pick your own flavors' six pack, so I could try more kinds.
