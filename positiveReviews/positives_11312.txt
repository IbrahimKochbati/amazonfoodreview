I love Black Silk to the degree that I'm always seeking it & become disappointed when I can't find it.  It has a pleasant bold coffee taste, not bitter or acidic.  This coffee should be a part of your everyday wake up; it's so aromatic and smooth.  It is our regular weekday coffee.  We  ew the more exotic blends on the weekend :)  Although we've enjoyed a couple of Irish Coffee's with Black Silk.  You won't be disappointed if you like a strong, but smooth cup of coffee.
