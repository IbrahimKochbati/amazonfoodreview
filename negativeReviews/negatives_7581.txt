Read the description of product and thought it sounded good.  Have always eaten cashews, almonds and pistachios with no reaction.  Liked the fact that it had no added oils.  However, after first eating a small handful I began to itch and itch and itch.  So I waited a day and tried 5 and again I itched and itched.  I find it hard to believe that with the ingredients of nuts and sea salt that I would find myself reacting so much.  There has to be somethng more to this product than nuts and salt since I have never reacted to these ingredients before.  Be warned.
