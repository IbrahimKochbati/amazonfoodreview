I purchased this product from Amazon on a regular basis. My husband and yes, my dog love them as do i. THis past case i ordered however came with an expiration date of a month out. This is my only complaint with this product..if you order a case it should have a longer expiration date than one month out. They are usually very fresh and come delivered in good condition and the price is good as well.
