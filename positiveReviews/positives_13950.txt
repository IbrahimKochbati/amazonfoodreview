I am so addicted to peanut butter. I eat it every day as my  eakfast with an apple to dip into it. This peanut butter is so good and easy to make. All you do is add some water into it and basically you choose the consistency. It tastes amazing and I couldn't be happier with it. I'm so glad i ran across this product!
