In the summer my doctor suspected I had a gluten sensitivity. She wanted me to start making changes from packaged food and think about cutting out gluten. After a bad few months I did some research and found this bisquick. I have only made one thing so far, garlic cheese biscuits. They were very tasty and had no strange texture or flavor. They had a more spongey texture than a crumbly biscuits but I was halving the recipe so maybe that was why. I nibbled on a biscuit hours out of the oven and it was still as soft and tasty. I can't wait to try pancakes and coffee cake. The only draw back is how small the box is for the price! I will limit the use to once a week or so for a treat!
