Anyone in the US who has ever read C.S. Lewis's "Chronicles of Narnia" has probably wondered what Turkish Delight could be, as it is not something you can find easily here~     at least, not for me in Rhode Island.          I first tried some in England as a 17 year old, and was smitten by it's rose smelling flavor.     Since then, I have found it intermittently in specialty stores, and online.          Hazer Baba Turkish Delight is the freshest, most delicious Turkish Delight I've ever had, the price was great and my husband and I have polished off two of the four boxes, already.     It is addictive, even without being enchanted by the White Witch!     Highly recommended!
