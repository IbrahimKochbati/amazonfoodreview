For anybody who has food allergies or intolerances (gluten, soy, corn, dairy, etc.), Chebe products are an excellent alternative. You may have to play around with the recipe (or create your own) to get the result you want. With this all purpose mix I make hard rolls using water instead of milk and scone like biscuits adding light  own sugar and a teaspoon of baking powder. I highly recommend Chebe products!
