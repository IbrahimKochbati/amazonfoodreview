This is one of the best mixed nut blends I have ever had!     Everything tastes extremely fresh and natural. The flavor combination is amazing   perfect mix of nuts and dried fruits. I really like that this blend doesn't include peanuts   I'm tired of nut blends always including peanuts... enough already! This was a refreshing change and a great snack.     I also feel the price is reasonable   considering there are no peanuts, everything is natural, and it tastes great!
