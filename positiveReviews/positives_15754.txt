Well, it's difficult to review something like this coz after all, I didn't eat any of it.  But I have three judges at home and as it stands, it's two to one on this food.  One cat likes it and the other wants nothing to do with it.  The dog loves it though!     It comes in those little tin cans like Fancy Feast, and you get an decent enough amount I suppose.  It seems a tad pricey, but that's for you to decide.     So there you have it Approved by one dog and one cat.  But bear in mind the third cat is a VERY picky eater.
