I bought this flavor along with two others and was surprised at how different the texture was compared to Chick Chick and Super Salmon. It is so thick that my daughter grabs it out of her mouth after putting a bite in, which usually leads to a big mess. I now have to modify the texture by adding water to it, which does not make it a convenient food item when on the go. Since the pouches don't reseal this is even harder when traveling.          Overall, the flavor seems good, just too thick. I still love the pouch design for the most part, since I can sometimes  eak the glass jars of other  ands. I will just need to remember to pack some sandwich baggies in case it not working out when trying to eat it on the go.
