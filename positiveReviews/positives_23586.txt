These WOW Gluten Free Brownies are exquisitely delicious. They are at least as good as  ownies made from wheat products, if not better. They are moist and chocolaty. There is no sour or flat taste that is common with many gluten free baked goods. Because there is no gluten there is a lack of chewiness that is common to some fudge  ownies, but the moist mouthwatering taste is unsurpassed.          I have given these gluten free  ownies to people who are not gluten intolerant and they wanted more. WOW knows how to bake!          The one caveat, if you are lactose intolerant, is that WOW uses butter as an ingredient. If a dozen are ordered, I would also recommend putting some in the freezer. It helps dissuade from eating all of them at once and keeps them around longer. These are absolutely "finger lickin' good"!
