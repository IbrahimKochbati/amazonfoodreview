This is excellent quality mole poblana sauce. Mexican mothers don't make it from scratch, they buy these little jars that incidentally are designed to be used as juice glasses  they aren't threaded. You can use a bottle opener to  eak the seal, otherwise it can be a little difficult to remove the lid.          I don't add extra sugar or salt as suggested, only chicken  oth, although I do add dried chipotle to make it a little spicier. Makes about four cups of thick sauce.          It's great on chicken but also wonderful as a sauce for anything in a corn or flour tortilla, any kind of meat, on rice as you would use gravy, as a sandwich spread, or even to eat with tortilla chips or corn ead.
