I was using Organix for a while, and was happy with the ingredients, and my dog seemed to enjoy it. Then I saw all the great reviews for Newman's Own Organic Dog Food, along with the great price, and decided to give it a try.          They say that it takes a dog a while to get used to a new food, but I have to tell you: from the first day I gave him the Newman's Own, he REFUSED to eat the Organix anymore, he loved the Newman's Own so much   even though he'd eaten the Organix for years! I even tried mixing the bit of Organix I had left in with the Newman's Own. But he would just pick out the pieces and leave them on the floor next to his bowl.          So, I don't know what it is, but my dog sure seems to love this food! He's eating more now and he's very healthy.          Again, I had no complaints about the Organix. I think it's probably a good dog food. But my dog sure prefers the Newman's Own!!
