I've tasted many varieties of Earl Grey tea, and I would have to say this one is the best. When they mention that this product has a "bergamot citrus" aroma, they surely don't mess around. It indeed packs a nice, powerful punch. Upon opening it, I almost had to catch my  eath. My grandmother could even smell it across the room. Very delightful and very strong in its flavor and fragrance. This tea is powerful enough in strength to where it eliminates the need to use a lot of leaves. I feel that it will last me for quite some time. When you add the fact that it's kosher, fair trade, and USDA certified organic, I feel all the more better about it.
