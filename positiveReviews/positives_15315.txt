This is the first coffee machine that I've owned and wasn't dragged over by a family member.  I do enjoy it and have been using it since I got it without any of the issues that I've seen in the reviews here like the scaling problem.  I do pretty much only use water run through a filter in it, I felt the need to say that.  The unit works like a charm, my only complaint is that I wish this model gave you more control over the size of the cup, instead of the strength.  It makes about 3 4 a cup or just under, and it's always a crapshoot if I'm filling a travel mug.  Other than that, I love it and would recommend this as an entry level coffee maker.
