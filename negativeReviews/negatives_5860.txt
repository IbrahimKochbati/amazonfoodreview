I have been drinking this Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Coffee for quite a while and recommending it to all my friends.  I LOVED it!  My first conscious thought every morning would be of that great tasting cup of coffee.  YUM!  So what happened to it?  The last few boxes have been absolutely tastless :(  There is no wonderful aroma either.  I might as well be drinking hot water.  This is SUCH a disappointment.  That wonderful flavor is now only a memory.  Sadly, I am giving up on Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and will purchase another flavor from now on.
