The product that I received was not the product that was pictured and described on the item's page.  The worst part of it all was that when I attempted to return the case of "Soy Crisps", I was unable to do so.  Amazon said that this was a non refundable item.  So I wasted $30.00 and I am stuck with a case of "Soy Crisps" that I will not eat.
