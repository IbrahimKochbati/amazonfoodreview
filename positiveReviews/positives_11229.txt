If these  ownies are gluten free, than I shall forever eat gluten free!  They are better than  ownies containing gluten.  I have made them for parties and everyone always raves over them.  I even have had some family members act concerned that I would let my kids eat these  ownies since they are suppose to eat only gf foods...little did they know the  ownies are gf!  My skeptical friends and relatives who love to make fun of my different recipes (they don't really get it) cannot believe these  ownies are gluten free.  THE best   the simplest terms in which to describe them!
