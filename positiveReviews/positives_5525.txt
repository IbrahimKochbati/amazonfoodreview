I was sick of Microwave popcorn so I ordered this, hoping it would take me back to the popcorn I loved in years past. That it did. Almost every kernel pops and with butter, I'm happy!     I get my  oil hot first and pop about a third of a cup of corn each time; it pops quickly.  Just be there to get it into a bowl as soon as the popping stops or it will burn.
