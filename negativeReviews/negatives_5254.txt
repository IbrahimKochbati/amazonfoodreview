I knew it was a pipe dream to think this product would be 'good' pho, but as an avid pho lover, I had to try it. The verdict? It doesn't really taste like Pho, but it's pretty good WITH some work.          Eating this stuff right out of the box is a sure letdown for any person who desires something that actually tastes like Pho. I adore two things about Annie Chun noodle bowls, and that's the dehydrated vegetables and noodles. The veges rehydrate and look taste like somewhat fresh veges, which is a feat on its own. The noodles are thick and chewy, which I enjoy. However... they just don't belong in pho. The noodles are totally uncharacteristic of real pho, and the veges are missing some important flavors (namely cilantro). On top of all that, the sauce to make the  oth really tastes nothing like pho  oth. I searched and searched for that cinnamon and star anise that you generally taste in real pho, and it's just not there.          On the plus side, it's pretty easy to soup this up (pun fully intended). To get this to taste like a halfway decent bowl of pho like I'm used to, I add a few things. First and foremost, a hefty amount of sriracha sauce (I like my pho's  oth to be a rich red, very spicy, but delicious). I also take some steak and slice it very thinly, layer it on the bottom of the bowl, and pour the boiling water over it and allow it to sit for 3 4 mins to get a nice med rare cut of meat in there. While that's sitting, I dice up a good amount of cilantro and toss that in, along with a good handful of bean sprouts. Once that's all in, I put in a pinch of sugar (the sauce has a sour aftertaste if you don't), and then I eat. Sounds like a lot of work, but it takes me about 15 minutes to make a very filling bowl of "pho". It still isn't quite there as the  oth is missing some complex flavors, but it's actually not bad. I would give it 4 4.5 stars after said additions are done.
