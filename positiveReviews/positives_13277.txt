I LOVE  ownies and was not sure how gluten free ones would stand up against some of the wheat mixes we used to eat in our house, but I was VERY happy when I took my first bite of Gluten Free Pantry's  ownies!!!! YUM,YUM,YUMMY!!! My 2 year old and 5 year old also LOVE them!!! I highly recommend this mix, and all of the other prodects from GLP. Their flour is fantastic in general!!!
