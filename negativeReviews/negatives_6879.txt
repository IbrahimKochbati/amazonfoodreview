I was surprised to find wasabi peanuts for such a low price, but after receiving them I now know why.  These will certainly clear your sinuses, but quality is poor.  These would best be described as one part tiny, stale peanut and four parts crunchy wasabi coating dumped into 2 one pound bags.  Learn from my mistake: pay a little more and get less for higher quality in a tin.          On a positive note, the vendor was prompt with the shipping.  Their other products are probably good, but this one is not.
