My husband and I eat this cereal almost every day (probably five out of seven) and have it delivered via subscription.  For me personally, it is a tad on the sweet side, so I often add about one part "generic" Rice Krispies to about four parts granola and mix them in a large Tupperware container ... that maintains the nice light but crispy texture.
