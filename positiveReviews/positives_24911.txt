I have 3 very active McNab...working cow dogs.  The oldest two have shown a vast improvement in their flexibility and agility.  Kessler and Hootie are "just like new", and they are 13 and 14 years old!  Rita, our 4 year old loves Happy Hips too.  I think it's good to start them on these while they are young. These "treats" are so pure and nutritious.  I don't ever give my guys rawhide, but like rawhide, the Happy Hips are a little tough to chew and that helps clean their teeth.  Our guys like the duck as well as the chicken.  I'd like to recommend that you subscribe to these so you don't ever run out!  I get a monthly shipment of each flavor and we're good to go!  Thank you Happy Hips for helping my guys live a happy, flexible life!          Deb Phelan     San Luis Obispo, California
