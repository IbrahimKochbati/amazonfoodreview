These things are awesome. Period. I started replacing one of my floss filters with this medium per one of the girls at my local pet store, trying to remove tannins from my driftwood. This does so much more, and is super efficient. For tank critters with super clean water requirements, these are a must. Only wish they weren't so expensive.
