Actually until the recall I was very impressed w this dog food, & I have used it for a long time.     So I ordered this dog food and I also ordered professional cat food, and just my luck as it usually is with these dog food recalls, I happen to have a bad bag. Actually, I'm not sure why but I guess I assumed that Amazon might have dropped me a line to let me know that there was a recall & that i may have received a bag (or two) of the bad pet food.     Now my question is, what do I do with it & how can I get reimbursed for it? Or can I?
