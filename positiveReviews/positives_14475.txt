If you are looking for a product that is going to help you lose weight, then perhaps look elsewhere. This drink has a lot of good ingredients in it, but like nearly everything out there on the market, it chiefly relies on thermogenics, with the main active of caffeine. Caffeine's effectiveness is affected by the fact that your body builds a tolerance to it, so as a weightloss "program," the effectiveness of this product decreases over time (and you're only talking maybe 2 weeks here, depending on how often you take it).          If, however, you are looking for an energy drink, I'd HIGHLY recommend Celsius. I started drinking this stuff a few years back before its distribution was up, and I've not been disappointed. It will definitely ramp you up, and because its very low sugar, you don't have the associated crash you get with drinks like Monster and Rockstar. Plus, the Ginger is a nice touch. I typically have big energy dips after meals, but it I drink one of these before or during a meal (like lunch), I don't experience the dip. My educated guess is that the ginger (which aids in digestion) is a big part of this, and it's an ingredient you don't find in other drinks.          Tastes, vary from person to person, but I find Celsius's flavor strangely addictive. I drink the Wild Berry and the Sparkling Orange.          Overall, this product gets my highest praises, and the shipping on it is lightning fast (like, 2 days to get to my door on regular shipping). Just know what you are putting into your body, and realize there is a fairly heavy dose of caffeine in this stuff (200 mg).
