As part of the line of Switch products, Switch Kiwi Berry offers a (slightly) healthier alternative to carbonated soda.  The product is 100% juice, though the majority of the contents are neither kiwi fruit or "berry":          Ingredients: 100% Juice (Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, Apple, Grape, Kiwi, Acerola, Raspberry and Strawberry Juice Concentrates), Natural Flavors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C).          Unfortunately, the mix of kiwi and berry flavors in this concoction just does not work for me.  The added kiwi flavor, in particular, imparts a odd sour aftertaste that I just could not get used to.  My children each tried a sip, and for them as well the opinion was mixed.          I was pleasantly surprised by the Switch Black Cherry (even though the cherry flavor was a bit weak), but I can't be very enthusiastic about this flavor.
