My dog, a Great Pyrenees, has a few food allergies (rice, chicken, eggs, soy, nuts) and is picky about the food he eats. I was feeding him Orijen 6 Fish and, after a few months, he decided to stop eating it.  After trying a few different foods I heard about Pinnacle Trout and Sweet Potato.  He loves it and it agrees with his digestive system.  I order it from Amazon because the price is lower than the local pet stores in my area. With Amazon Prime, it arrives in 2 days.          Four stars because I do need to mix the last quarter of the food with the next bag (treating it like a new dog food   I didn't need to do that with Orijen 6 Fish).  Highly recommended.
