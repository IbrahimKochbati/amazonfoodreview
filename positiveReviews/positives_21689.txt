I have been buying these at a local convenience store for a while, not knowing that I could buy them myself online. I love these things. The local store was charging seventy nine cents a piece, now I'm buying them at Amazon for less than half. Can't beat this bargain. I subscribed to have them shipped to me on a regular schedule and saved even more. A great tasting snack, name  and, and a pretty nice price. It was always kind of a hassle to get more than one at a time out of the vending box on the store counter. It made people have to wait behind you. Now I can enjoy them anytime, hassle free! It doesn't bother me that these are not individually wrapped. They seem to last a while, I open one pack at a time, and place the unused ones in a snap tight container. Works great for me.
