This was a great treat. I got it as a gift for family with two young labs and it was so interesting for all of us to see how interested they were. The more 'biddable' bitch was attracted, but the more 'rambunctious' male stayed nosing and chewing at different angles until he discovered how to lift the cups and get to the treats inside. He quickly became an expert and was easily lifting and dropping the cups, while his friend stayed close and occasionally sneaked a treat out before her could get to it. Don't leave the dogs to play with the cups, or they'll chew them out of shape and they won't lift out as easily. Great fun and gave us a better understanding of the dogs.
