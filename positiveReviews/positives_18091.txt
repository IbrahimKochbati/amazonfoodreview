I keep coming back to this espresso as one of the smoothest, medium bodied but full flavored coffees I've tried. I make it in a 4 cup drip coffeemaker, not an espresso machine, and the results are still great.          I have tried the dark roast version but find that one is too much for me (at least  ewed this way). I just wish it were cheaper or came in a larger quantity; it's not the kind of price that you're comfortable making extra cups worth and not drinking them.          Definitely one you should try if you have not.
