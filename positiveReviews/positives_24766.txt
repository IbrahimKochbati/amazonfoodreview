This popcorn is great. Used an air popper came out awesome really good popcorn. Problem is 8 bucks shipping? WTF? more then 2x the price of the product. It's not fragile or easily  oken. Why so much? Everything by them shipping is majorly overblown and it's really sad because their products are awesome.
