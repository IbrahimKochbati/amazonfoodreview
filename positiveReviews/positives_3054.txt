I use this product every time I shower and it is great. I usually get horribly dry skin in the winter but this along with Dove lotion keeps my skin soft and smooth! the smell is good, not overwhelming and you get ALOT of product, the bottle is HUGE. Very comparable to department store body washes (I have Kiehls, chanel, and Shiseido) except a lot more affordable.
