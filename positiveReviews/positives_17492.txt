Please be aware that these are 6 32 oz (1 quart) packages and not half gallons as you may believe. The good thing about this is the shelf life of the packages. A normal half gallon is good for about as long as a regular milk product. These are good for months until you open them and then they are good for 10 to 14 days.  I use them to make a protein shake with fresh bananas that I have frozen. I use a non dairy protein powder and it all tastes great.  Once I open the carton, I date it with the opening date so I can track it. That aside, it is a good product with a good taste, but not so good with cereal that gets soggy, like Raisin Bran.  It is not bad, just not the same as with 2% milk. I did not think I would like it, but, for health reasons I made the change and it is a good one.
