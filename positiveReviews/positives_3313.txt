When I first found out that my 4 year old I had to go Gluten free I was a little worried about how she would handle it. GF Bisquick has made it a lot easier. I have been able to make her favorite foods such as chicken fingers, corn dogs, pizza and chinese (sweet and sour chicken)with this mix. Pancakes are also a big hit in our house. They have quick and easy recipes on the box. For the chinese  I take their chicken finger recipe and cute the pieces of chicken into bite size pieces, and bake according to the recipe. Cook up some rice and just use a GF sweet and sour sauce a quick simple easy meal that tastes wonderful!
