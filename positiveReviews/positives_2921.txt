this black licorice has great flavor and texture. Some are too soft and too sweet for me. Personal preference I'm sure, but I like this because it's slightly firm (not hard but not soft) and the sweetness is just right. Love that it's only 4 ingredients: molasses, wheat flour, licorice extract and aniseed oil. Price is good too. Compares to Tire Tread Licorice which is my first choice but I can't find it.
