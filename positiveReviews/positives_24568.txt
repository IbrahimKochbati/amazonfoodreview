I was so happy to see all twelve cans in pristine condition and with "use by" dates two years off stamped on the tops.  Another highly pleasant surprise came when I had my first taste.  This pumpkin is without a doubt better tasting than Libby's.  With the Subscribe and Save discount, this superior product actually costs a tad less than what I pay for Libby's at my local store.  And with the added convenience of home delivery!  I use a couple cans each week because it is loaded with nutrients and fiber and being a thick puree it is very useful in creating good things to eat.  I have put about a tablespoon on a dish for my cat twice and she ate it up both times which rather amazed me.
