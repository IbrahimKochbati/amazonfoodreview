Living in Ne aska, we can purchase real maple syrup in the store, but I really like supporting family farms directly.  This way, I'm pretty sure that the products I purchase are top quality.  If not, I can go to the producer.  I'm no conniseuer of maple syrup like some people on Amazon are, but I can say this has a great maple flavor, the consistency is a little thinner than store bought, imitation maple syrup, but that stuff has artificial thickeners in it.  Remember, this is tree sap, boiled down to reduce the water and increase the sugar content.  Nothing more nothing less.  This syrup makes you want to lick the plate when you're done with the pancakes.  One note, they need to do something to better protect the black plastic cap on the top of the jug because mine was  oken when it came.  The jug is sealed well, so nothing spilled.  Not a big deal, but someone picky might pitch a fit about something trivial. Buy real maple syrup whether from this company or another, you owe it to yourself.
