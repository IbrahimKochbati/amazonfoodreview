1.  I love  Amazon's grocery makeup cleaning products subscription service.  It is only beta now, but I truly hope they will continue it.          2.  This cookie is amazingly delicious.  I like sweets that aren't too sweet, with just the right hint of sugar.  These are cookies just like that.  Like Creme Brulee    barely sweetened, but if it is done right, the sweetness makes it the best food in the world.  I'm not saying these cookies are Creme Brulee, but maybe they approach the creme  ulee of cookies.
