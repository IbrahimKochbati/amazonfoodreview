I first discovered "Gluten Free Biscuit" in the supermarket.  I bought it and loved it.  I then tried to find it again in all the local supermarkets, but could not find it.  I called the manufacturer and they informed me that I could purchase it at Amazon.  I was thrilled. Amazon is one of my favorite web sites.
