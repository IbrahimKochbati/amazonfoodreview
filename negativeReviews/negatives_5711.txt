If you are here   you probably already know if you want this product or not, so here is a basic review for your reading pleasure.  Shake `n Bake is an old school classic.  It is crunchy and tasty, but not full of pizzazz   it is a bit bland, but sticks around in the same nostalgic way that Twinkies, Hamburger Helper, Ketchup, and Jell o do ... these products will never die, but I highly doubt they will ever again enjoy the glory days they once had.  The very best part about shake `n bake is that it serves as Ricky Bobby's (ever fun to say) slogan ... SHAKE `N BAKE!!!!  That's right!  That JUST happened!!!!
