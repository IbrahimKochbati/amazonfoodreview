When we got my dog, she barely ate. She didn't even like treats. We finally got her to eat, but the regular (more affordable)  ands didn't sit well with her system. My vet recommended this or to cook her food on our own. Obviously, cooking food for a dog gets a bit time consuming, but this Pinnacle food really was great for my dog. She finally started to gain weight. (She was so skinny when we got her from the shelter.)          My dog doesn't seem to have the farting problem the other reviewer said.          I guess every dog's system is different and you just have to find the one that's right for your dog. this one works great for ours :)
