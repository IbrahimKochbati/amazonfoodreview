My sister has been gluten free for a while now, and while she was able to find an acceptable pasta (try the Tinyaka or one made from a blend of grains), she gave up on  ead because all of the store bought loaves were completely inedible and very expensive.  I wound up making  eadcrumbs from all the loaves that would have gone to waste.  When my mother told us that a friend of hers loved this  ead mix, my sister went out and bought a  ead machine and ordered the Pamela's wheat free gluten free  ead mix.  She wanted to try one and fully expected to give the rest to mom's friend.  Much to her surprise, this  ead was better than good.  It was very good!  I am not gluten free, but I would definitely eat this  ead.  It has the taste and texture of a dense whole grain  ead.  Be sure to follow the directions exactly!  I don't think you'll be disappointed.  The only downside is the price.  Next time we'll order the bulk mix.
