This cat food has great, healthy ingredients.  Cats shouldn't eat grain because it is not a part of their traditional diet.  (Think: Mice, Rodents, Moles, Grasses, Rabbits, Bird, etc)  I switched my cat from Iam's canned food to this one, thinking that I would have to mix them together at first to get her to eat it.  However, she ate it immediately! I was so happy!  As another reviewer said, there are whole peas in this stuff.  It looks a little gross, but my cat eats it. However, I must admit that she will eat just about anything.  Her favorite treats are sproated oat grass, spinach and  occoli stalks.  She's a good eater!          Before I switched to Felidae Grain free, my cat was vomiting frequently.  I think it was due to food allergies (either to grain or food coloring maybe)  Since switching she has only thrown up one time! You can only imagine how happy I am to not have to clean up vomit every other day!          Also, since switching my cat's fur is much more smooth and soft!
