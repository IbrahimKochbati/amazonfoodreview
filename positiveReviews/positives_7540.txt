I just started eating these recently after hearing about all of their positive qualities and the Omega 3 bit.  I was expecting to take a spoonful and swallow it like medication.  Instead I decided to mix it into my strawberry kefir.  I LOVE the way the little seeds swell up and give the kefir a little bit of a chewy texture.  it reminds me of those Asian drink places that add the Tapioca or lychee pieces to fruit smoothies.  They are great.  Be aware though after you eat these that they are little black seeds and they seem to love to stick between your teeth.  I look like some kind of nasty old redneck with chewing tobacco all over my mouth if I don't floss after eating them.          This bag is a nice size and I think it will last a while.  Worth the price.
