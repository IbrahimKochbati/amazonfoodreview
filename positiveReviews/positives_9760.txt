This GIANT can of anchovies is an incredible value, but please be aware that they are WHOLE, SALT PACKED anchovies.  They arrived super fast, and they are huge and delicious, but you WILL need to fillet them yourself!!  Half the can is salt    they are VERY salty!!  Also, the can is marked "MUST BE REFRIGERATED" but was shipped via standard UPS. I can only hope that it means "Must be refrigerated AFTER OPENING" [emphasis mine]!!  : )
