I wasn't sure how my cats would like Petite Cuisine, because they are Friskies cats.  Man, do they love their friskies: seafood, chicken, or maybe a little turkey (but they don't like beef)...as long as the friskies aren't in that big glop they call "classic pate."          No 9Lives, no science diet, no canned tuna, no non friskies  ands, thank you very much!  They're cats.  They're picky about what they eat!          So I tried this Petite Cuisine, assuming that   just like everything else   they would reject it.  BOY was I wrong!!!!  They literally lapped up the entire plate of the stuff within the first hour after I first put it out.  And it seems to be easy on their digestive system: they don't seem to be barfing it up like they sometimes do when new food comes into the picture.          Since it looks like real fish that you or I would eat from a can, I am worried that   just like canned tuna   it's going to cause horribly smelly you know whats.          I want to check with my vet to see if he thinks it's healthy.  But from the taste point of view, my cats have rated this five meows!
