I haven't tried it, nor will I.  There are so many corn and soy byproducts in the ingredients list that it's an automatic no for me.  90% of the soy and corn crops are genetically modified (RoundUp Ready  gee they come with their very own pesticide grown in!) and unless it says organic or non GMO, it's guaranteed to be GM.  I won't eat GM products, and I don't feed them to my livestock or my pets.
