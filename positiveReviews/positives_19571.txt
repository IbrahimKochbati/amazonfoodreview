Our kids love this Mott's Natural Apple Sauce.  We've used these little containers over the years for picnics, school lunch, and for letting young children open their own instead of using the big jars.  Great flavor, and nice to also have on hand when a teen with  aces can only eat a few things  this and pudding and mashed potatoes go a long way to tide them over until they can eat solids again.
