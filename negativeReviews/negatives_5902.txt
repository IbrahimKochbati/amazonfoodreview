My morkie loves interactive games. Make sure you take notice of the dimensions, it is larger than I expected. As one of the other reviews stated, my small  eed cannot get his mouth around the yellow pieces, but is able to get them off with abundant effort via scratching and using his nose. As smart as my lil guy is, he gets the yellow piece off and thinks his reward is being able to play with it. But it was his first attempt and we're working with him, showing him the treats are underneath. He was continuously excited and determined to figure out the game. I expect over time he'll get better with it and the learning process in itself is fun.
