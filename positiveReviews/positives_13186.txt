My store stopped stocking this rice for some reason.  It is a far superior blend than anything else I've tried and so I Googled it and was surprised to find it here.  Great texture and flavor (I cook it in chicken stock).  The best thing about this rice is that it is ready to cook, no rinsing required.  With other rice blends it takes so long to rinse that sometimes it's not even worth the effort for little reward.  This rice has it all...flavor, texture and no rinsing.  A lazy cooks dream.
