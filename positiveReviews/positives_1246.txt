In my opinion, this is the best food for dogs.  My boyfriend is an avid researcher, and he concluded this is the bet food for dogs on all accounts   taste (the dogs love it), health wise (it has healthy fats, and the first and main ingredient is meat as opposed to ingredients such as corn) and digestion wise (the dogs get diarrhea when they eat human food or any other dog food).  We have two dogs we adopted from a shelter, and while at first, one of our dogs would not eat the food (he had worms though, so who knows what junk he was eating before), he soon began to understand that is what we were going to feed him and very soon, he came to love it.  Now they jump when it's dinner time!  Our dogs are happy, very healthy, have shiny coats, and a large part of this is due to this fantastic dog food.  We get it on Subscribe and Save and we usually go through 1 bag p  month   for reference, we have one 15lb Bichon and one Alaskan husky.
