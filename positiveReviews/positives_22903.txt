I use the Plantation Mint to make sun tea.  It is so refreshing to have it iced after working in the yard in the hot sun.  I love that their teas are individually in foil packets so it stays fresh.  This is a great price, too.  I didn't realize I could buy it here, and definitely will next time.  Enjoy!!
