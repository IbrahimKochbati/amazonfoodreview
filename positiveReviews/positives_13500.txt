OK, first  I don't write reviews unless a product REALLY stands out to me!  I'm a Queen of Amazon.com Prime and receive requests all the time to write reviews on the millions of products I order (how many people know all their delivery guys by their first names?) SO, with that said  Yogi Calming Tea is the BEST calming tea for me because of the FLAVOR. There are a lot of Chamomile teas in the world and all of them give me the calming effect; but, the flavor  EH? This is the one and only one I actually like  maybe it's the addition of lavender?  Do your own taste test and see if you like the difference. I couldn't find Yogi's Calming Tea for a while in my markets so today when it popped up on Amazon.com, I was thrilled!  I subscribed to the auto ship and save program so I will never be out of it again HOORAY!
