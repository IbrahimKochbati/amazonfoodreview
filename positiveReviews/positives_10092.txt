Out of all the No Calorie Sweeteners I have tried, I must say that this is the best!  To me, it tastes as close to real sugar as you can get.  I don't drink diet soda or anything artificially sweetened because of the taste. I did not experience gas or bloating from this product as I did with some other sweeteners.  For some reason they have taken this off the supermarket shelves in my state of NJ.  Did find in another state under the store name.  So glad that I can purchase this on Amazon!
