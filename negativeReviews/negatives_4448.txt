I have a new Akita puppy, and bought the Canidae ALS for him since I couldn't get the  eeders type of food in my area. After transitioning him to the Canidae, his stools were loose and yellow. I looked on line, and saw that Canidae switched their formula, and my puppy's symptoms were mild compared to some I read about. I immediately switched my puppy to Wellness Puppy, and everything has been coming out fine since.
