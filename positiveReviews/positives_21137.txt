I have used this sprouter for going on ten years.  It makes great sprouts always, and you can store the sprouts right in the sprouter.  Be sure to clean it periodically, otherwise sprout quality will suffer.  It probably works well for bigger seeds to sprout as well, but I uses it exclusively for leafy small seed types, like alfalfa, clover, radish, and other similar blends.
