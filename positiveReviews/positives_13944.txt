I appreciate those science geeks out there who spent the time to create a process to take 85% of the fat and calories out of peanut butter!  Who knew that was even possible?  PB2 makes it very easy to add protein to my oatmeal, protein shakes, etc., and saves me some of the fat and calories I used to get using regular peanut butter.  It certainly doesn't take the place of peanut butter in every situation, but I am thankful for this tasty option as I'm working on getting healthier.
