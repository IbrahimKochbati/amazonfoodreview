My dog loved the original Purina One Adult Chicken with Rice Dog Food.  However, since Purina developed the smart blend, she won't eat it unless I add some turkey.  The tan color pieces are awful   kind of rubbery.  I went back to buying the regular Purina Chicken and Rice Mix where all the morsels are pretty much the same in size and color.  My dog really likes the older version much better.  I won't be buying the blend mixture again. Sometimes, change isn't better.
