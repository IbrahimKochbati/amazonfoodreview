We had to find a  ead mix that is wheat, gluten, and dairy free.  After trying other mixes, we finally had the GOOD fortune to try Pamela's.          It is easy to make in our  ead machine and is the BEST we have tried when considering both taste and texture.          Try it, you're sure to like it !!!!
