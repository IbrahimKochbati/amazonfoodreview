This is the second flavor of Switch I've had and it was... not terribly pleasant. First off, it seemed rather syrupy, but then I realized that's just because the sweetness factor is, apparently, set to eleven. It wasn't actually a struggle to finish it, but it was so cloyingly sweet it makes the average episode of "Full House" look like sour, cynical crap. It made me want to reach for insulin, though I don't take any.          I suppose this might be a good drink for young children who don't have well developed palettes, but if you're past the age of, say, nine, this probably isn't the drink for you.
