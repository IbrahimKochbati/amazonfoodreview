I am a blue buffalo fanatic.  I have a 16 year old teacup poodle and a 1 year old mini weiner and I have both of them on Blue food and treats.          I like the health bars because I do not feel guilty to give them multiple every day.  I have bacon egg and cheese, apples and yogurt, and chicken liver.  The poodle prefers the chicken liver, while the Daschund goes crazy over all 3.          I use Blue dry food for 2 meals a day, and canned food for 1.  I feel like this has played a part in Deek living to be 16, and I will never feed either of my dogs anything else.          These are pretty big treats for both of my dogs, they eat what they want and then hide the rest for later normally.          If you are thinking about this, you might also want to look into Blue Bites, and Blue Bones.
