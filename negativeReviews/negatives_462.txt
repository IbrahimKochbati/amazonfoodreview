This is NOT A SUMMER SAMPLER          The majority of this Sampler was hot, including: Hot Eggnog, Hot Apple Cider, Hot Ginger ead Coffee, Hot Caramel Apple, and Golden French Toast Coffee          Sound like "the Perfect Brewed Over Ice K Cup" to you?  This was the totality of iced drinks: Vanilla Iced Coffee, Peach Iced Tea, and unsweetened black iced tea.          Additionally, there were only 8 varieties rather than the 9 listed on the description.          I literally thought they might have mixed my Summer drinks for Holiday drinks, but it was clearly labeled Summer Sampler.          Even worse, this item does not generally qualify for a refund.  Beware!
