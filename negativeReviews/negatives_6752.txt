I've been using Chebe mix for years, always a huge fan. It seems however, that along the new packaging (the cardboard boxes as opposed to the older version packed in bags) the recipe was changed as well   for the worse! Now it has this weird, medicine like chemical smell to it! Awful, just awful. At first I thought that it was just a single lemon among the 2 8 packs I bought, but every other one was just as bad. I gave up after using using a few packages and threw out the rest.     I recently tried buying from another source (vitacost), and here we go again   same thing!     I don't know if it's the recipe or maybe they changed the source of their ingredients, and I really hope they go back to the original version, cause this one is just bad (to put it mildly).
