My dog is allergic to almost all major ingredients in almost all dog food. I feed him RAW food but it's getting kind of expensive. He doesn't like eating chicken. Which is the cheapest of all RAW food. He is highly allergic to beef, turkey, duck, egg, wheat, soy, barley, sweet potato, and his list goes on  ( So its very hard to find a dog food that has nothing he is allergic too. Have tried so many  ands it's unbelievable. Because even if one item is on the very bottom of the list he would  eak out everywhere for days. his nose turn pink etc. I feed him raw food which he loves and has no problem at all but we travel & sometimes its very hard to have raw meat with you. So it's just a bit easier if he ate kibbles. His poop is solid hard with Avoderm Salmon Grain Free. His coat is shiner & soft. The only thing I don't like about this is that Peas is the 1st ingredients on the list. Also tomato pomace is a controversial ingredient most people say its a by product remaining after processing tomatoes into juice, soup and ketchup.     But so far my dog is very happy eating this and he can't wait until it's time for him to eat.          But I will keep looking for something better which is really hard unless I make my own dog food which I don't have time for  (
