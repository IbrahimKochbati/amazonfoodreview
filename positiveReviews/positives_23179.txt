We've eaten already prepared gluten free  ead for years. But with the cut backs in our budget, I decided to start making my own GF  ead. This mix has a very nice texture and good flavor. I did add about 1 4 cup of honey, however, because I like my  ead to have a little bit of sweetness to it. I poured the honey into a measuring cup, added the amount of water called for in the recipe and stirred it up good. I then added it to the mix when it called for the water. I also tried the cinnamon  ead recipe that they have on the back as a variation and my kids thought it was the best GF  ead they had ever had. I used zante currants which are like little tiny raisins. Homemade GF  ead is much better than the pre made stuff. I make about a loaf a week, slice it up, and put it in a ziploc bag in the fridge. We then toast the slices before we use them.
