I bought the popchips variety pack to try the different flavors and I kept an open mind but I just don't like this flavor.  Their other flavors like BBQ & salt and vinegar are great, but these are REALLY peppery.  I can't even taste the salt on them because the pepper is so overwhelming.  Might be your bag of tea if you like a lot of pepper on food, but my husband puts pepper on everything and even he said there was too much pepper here.
