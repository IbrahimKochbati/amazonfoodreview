These taste better than Fig Newtons!  Our child is allergic to dairy, peanuts, and eggs, so finding a prepackaged snack can be hard.  He loves these!  And since we're always trying to keep weight on him, 3 of these at 120 calories helps put some calories in his diet at snack time.  (not so good for MY waistline, but oh well!)
