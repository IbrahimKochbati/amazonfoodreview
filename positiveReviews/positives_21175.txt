I am too wimpy for spicy foods, so often rely on this chili. It's not bland, though, don't get me wrong.          I can serve this to non vegetarian friends (though I'm honest with them about its soy meat substitute content) and they love it! A couple friends will add some Tabasco but otherwise nobody tinkers with it.          I've used this as chili with sour cream, on tostadas, as part of a Sloppy Joe, and even as a dip for crackers.          The sodium content is a bit high but I'll take the tradeoff. It makes a wonderfully comforting hot meal on a cold fall or winter evening.          Kids like this chili too!          I generally serve two to three people with each can.          It's also good with corn ead.
