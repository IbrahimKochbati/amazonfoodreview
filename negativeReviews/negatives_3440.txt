Just purchased a 50 count box. Previous reviews had indicated that there were probblems with the cups and that they "leaked" grounds into the coffee cup. Sadly, this is still the case. About 1 in 5 cups is defective.Taste is fine as long as you don't mind chunky coffee. Will NOT be buying this again!!!
