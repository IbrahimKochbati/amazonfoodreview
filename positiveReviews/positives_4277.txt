These are really awesome   the flavor is unexpected, but perfect; gives a boost to "plain old" pork rinds   lots more crunch with way less the calories of salt vinegar chips!!!  In addition, the company is quite pleasant to deal with, and all the other products I've tried are delicious and a good bargain, too.
