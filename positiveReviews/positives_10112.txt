One of the best k cups we've had.  If you miss the way starbucks tasted on the Tassimo, this is the closest thing you will find in the k cup world.  Coffee was great and the price was very good too.  Super saver shipping took FOREVER.  They sat on the order for a week before even shipping it and then it was another 4 days to get to us.  I actually had to go out and buy a box before this arrived which was what I was trying to avoid by ordering it online.  Used to order all my coffee online from Amazon before they dumbed down the free shipping.  Now, not so much.
