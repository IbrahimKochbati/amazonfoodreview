Taste: The taste was very appealing. It was very flavorful and sweet and had the texture of a vanilla milkshake. In terms of performance protein drinks, this ranks very highly compared to the rest of the competition.          Packaging: The packaging was a little lacking. The overall design on the can was pretty appealing, however, instead of printing on the can, the printing was on a plastic sheet wrapped around the can. This caused it to interfere with the mouth of the can and plastic was able to work its way inside my mouth.          Size: The size was 11 fluid ounces, which seemed a little bit small for a post workout shake, depending on how rigorous your routine is. In general, it is a pretty good compliment to a high protein meal post workout.          Nutrition: This product has a very high calorie content compared to what it offers in protein. It has almost 400 calories against only about 20 grams of protein. If you are just starting out and are looking to put on weight quickly, this would probably be a very good place to start. However, I would not recommend this product to those trying to build lean muscle.          Overall: I would say this product would do well for those trying to put on weight quickly. It's high calorie content against a decent amount of protein makes it a pretty good weight gainer. However, if you are either trying to lose fat or put on lean muscle, I would not recommend use of this product.
