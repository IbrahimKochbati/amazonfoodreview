Years ago, on one of the shopping networks on TV (quality, value and convenience), the company was doing bus tours where they 'discovered'  entrepreneurs with new and innovative products to sell and they helped them to establish themselves and their products in the marketplace.  A great service I wish this company would do again...     Anyway, there was one lady entrepreneur, whose product happened to be a healthy  eakfast cookie such as this....     I think perhaps it could have been Erin Baker, I could not verify this.     I know at the time, I purchased several quantities of this lady's cookies (do not remember the variety) and was VERY pleased with them :)     Then, the product was no longer available :(  I was able to get them for awhile at retail store about 25 miles from me and they were costlier than on TV, so stopped purchasing them.     Time went by, and my husband requested an item like this to pack in his lunch box for work as well as my teenage son requesting the same for before school in the mornings.     After Googling  eakfast cookie with thought of making them myself from a recipe, I found Erin Baker on AMAZON and it was like finding an old friend :)     Still have not made at home my own cookies, but I will when time allows.     For the time being, as long as I can get them on AMAZON for a decent $price$, I will continue to do so. It is nice to have several varieties, when available.     Though, I see some of the reviews do not rave about this item as much as I have here, personally, for what they are, I do not hesitate to recommend them and our family enjoys them in moderation.
