We love this seasoning. Easy, fast and great on chicken, fish, pork, etc. Just melt a stick of butter and stir in this seasoning until it becomes a loose paste. Brush on protein, and sear on a hot pan. Cast iron is best. Always skin side down. when dark, place in a 400 oven until cooked to correct temp. Enjoy!
