Somehow I missed the word spice. I wanted Peach tea, but this is black tea with clove and orange peel flavoring.  I wanted to get off of black tea as it  can cause low hemoglobin which is not good for folks who want to donate blood regularly.  Unfortunately, although this is advertised as peach, it is just black tea.
