I have purchased this product once before from Amazon.  It was delivered promptly and in tact.  This is the only food our dog will eat and we used to purchase it at PetSmart in New York but in Arizona, it is no where to be found.  This food is holistic and has no unnatural products at all.  We try to give our dog good quality dog food and this was it.  So now we go through Amazon and our dog is quite happy.  Bought a double amount to receive free shipping.  It was a very good deal.
