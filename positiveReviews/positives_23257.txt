My son with AUTISM has been on the GFCF diet for 9 yrs now (he's 11).  He loves this  ead and pretty much won't eat others!  It's easy to make and bake (by hand   I do not have a  ead machine). I use Soy milk.  It bakes perfect every time :)  Just follow the directions. Slice when it's cool and freeze. It makes great sandwich  ead and toast.  The Sweet Bread recipe on the package is good, too.  I haven't yet tried the other recipes but am sure of their success and great taste and texture as well.  What's even better is Amazon's great price on the case of six!  You simply can't beat it.
