My favorite PopChips flavor is the Parmesan Garlic flavor, but this is definitely my new second favorite.  It does have a lot of lime flavor, with the chili flavor being a little less present.  That said, it is there and it is tasty and not spicy.  I was really pleased with this purchase and will definitely buy them again.
