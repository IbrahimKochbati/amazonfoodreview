I was very unhappy when this package arrived at my workplace. The bags were not wrapped for shiping and was damage in route.  When I opened the box the baking soda was spiling all over the place.  I could not identify where the many holes were and did not have acess to a container to put them in so I threw it away.  I made a mess all over the place  What a waste.  I will not be ordering from this company again.
