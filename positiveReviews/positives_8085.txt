These are yummy! I eat them right out of the bag. I throw them into baked goods, cereals etc. I mix them into my kid's PB sandwiches too to add an even extra boost of nutrition to their lunch. (My children need extra calories & nutrition). I have not found there to be too many hulls, either. I will order these again!
