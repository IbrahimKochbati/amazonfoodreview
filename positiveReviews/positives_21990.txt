I've tried other aloe drinks before but they were all too sweet.  I came across this today in a health food store and decided to try it out because it's all natural.  You can definitely taste the difference with this drink.  It's natural, had great flavor and is just sweet enough.  I liked it so much I came straight to Amazon to buy it in bulk!
