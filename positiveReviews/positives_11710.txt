After finishing off a box of these over Labor Day weekend on the road, my husband and I agree that these are tasty snacks.  I will buy these again.          I'd categorize these as soft and crumbly after the first bite.  It's predominantly an oatmeal chocolate coconut taste although I will admit I thought the chocolate felt more like raisins the first time.  These are not so heavily sweet, either as many standard granola bars are. Best of all, there's no chalky aftertaste.          Each bar has 180 calories, a nice pick me up after my morning cappuccino.
