My baby has been eating this  and since he was 6 months. I like the convenience of high quality yet not overly pricey jar food like this. It is easy on his stomach. Never had any health issues with it. The "dinners" are a bit more filling than the usual watery vegetable puree but it still does need a little cereal to thicken up. Summer vegetable is his least favorite. The zucchini (like cucumber) smells pretty strong. He would eat it now but when we first started, he hated it. My son loves the other 3 flavors and that's why I continued with my subscription since it's more expensive to buy them separately.
