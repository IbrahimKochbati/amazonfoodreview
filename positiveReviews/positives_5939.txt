After recently having a chance to try out all the flavors of these  and new David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans, I have to say the Pomegranate is by far my favorite. The flavor is just perfect. Sweet, but not too sweet. Not tart or overpowering in flavor. It's mild and the taste is just right. The beans appearance is even beautiful! With their rich red color and shine, they look like little glistening rubies that catch the light. You can even taste the difference in how these are made using natural ingredients and coloring. They actually have a fresh taste to them. Not hard, artificial and stale tasting like so many other  ands. These are a truly gourmet jelly beans.
