I bought 3 doggy products at the same time (all treat dispensing chew toys). This is my recommendation of the best product of the 3.          I bought the Premier Twist and Treat Dog Toy along with a KONG classic and Premier Tug a Jug for my 3 month old, 4lb Morkie. My dog doesn't play with the latter 2, but LOVES the twist and treat! It's easy to twist the top off and insert the treats and to twist it down to the size you want to get it to dispense. Smoothie quickly learned how to dispense the treats, so we have it on its tightest setting (puppy chow is pretty small, so easy to get out). He chases and bats this all over the living room.          He played with the classic Kong once, but because it dispenses the treats so quickly, he soon lost interest and went back to the twist and treat.          He tries to play with the Tug a Jug, but he can never get anything out and quickly tires of it and goes back to the twist and treat.          Of the 3, the twist and treat gets the most use, its the easiest to clean, is hardy, has the best movement for him to chase around, & is the perfect size for a toy dog.          So, if you're looking to keep your dog entertained, don't waste money buying a bunch of products, just get the twist and treat. Both you and your pup will be pleased with it.          21 March 2012 Update          I have since removed the back end of the jug and my dog will now play with it, in fact he expects for me to put all his food in it so he can chase it around and dig them out with his paws and nose. That said, this is the only way for him to use the jug, so still not fulfilling its intended purpose or use. Cleaning if course is a pain.
