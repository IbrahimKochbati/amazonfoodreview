I decided to give this a try because their fiber bars were so good.  Well, I was not disappointed.  I've been eating this regularly since I bought it.  Everyone including my 3 year old loves it.  The best part, we are meeting our daily requirement for fiber.  I know because we're pretty regular now.  It's great to eat something that's good for you, and good too.
