I certainly hope that Switch will be selling this product in larger packages   I was very disappointed when my Tangerine soda was gone   it was very good!  Actually tasted like tangerines, which was a surprise as most of the sodas on the market don't have much distinctive flavor at all.  Switch sodas are pleasantly carbonated, sweet without being overwhelming so, and very satisfying, particularly when drunk very cold!
