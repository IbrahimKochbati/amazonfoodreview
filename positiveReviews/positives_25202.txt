There are generally 3 grades of maple syrup. Grade A is the first run   Mild in taste, sweet and with fewer minerals than the other grades. It is more expensive and less desirable (health and taste wise). Grade B is the second run with more minerals plus more maple taste. Grade C is the third run with even more minerals and an even stronger taste of maple and it's slightly less pleasant for most people.          Maple syrup has a large variety of minerals and vitamins and Grade B Organic is my favorite, considering it's stronger flavor and higher nutrition content. Of course, Organic is the only way to eat food now, but that's another story.          Coombs Family Farm provides a very satisfactory grade B organic Maple Syrup! I've used a lot!
