I forgot to write a review after our last shipment of this product, but having gotten another shipment which is EVEN BETTER when it comes to protective packaging, I realized it was important to provide this info for others.          If there were problems in the past, clearly the shipper has learned how to do it better.  The biscuits were packed in a just right to be tight box, and then in a larger box with plenty of the recyclable blow up air pillows for cushioning.  No problems with  eakage, at all.
