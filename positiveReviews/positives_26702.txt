My terrier has many food allergies (beef, fish, dairy, corn, soy, chicken are among those we KNOW).  I had been making her food from scratch using venison,  own rice and peas.  We tried several kibbles including anti allergy perscription types(venison can get very hard to find   expensive out of hunting season) and all of them caused reactions.  This is a little expensive, but it's SO much cheaper and easier than making her food from scratch.  She LOVES the taste (picks it out of the venison meat when mixed together) and all of my dogs now get this kibble as treats so we have less chance of her getting something she is allergic to by accident.  I am so very thankful to have found this food.
