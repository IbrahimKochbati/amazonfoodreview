I actually use this mix to make vegetable biryani and it works well for this purpose,  with some slight adjustments to the recipe.          I do have one caveat about the product, but it's about the recipe given, not the spice mix. I think the amount of ghee it is suggested you use (200 grams) is too much, and you can easily use 100 grams instead. Also, I think it's easier to mix the spices and yogurts first and cover the chicken (or vegetables) with the mix to marinate than to mix it in the pan while frying.          To make vegan biryani you can substitute vegetables for chicken, coconut milk for yogurt, and safflower or peanut oil for ghee.          Overall this spice mix makes the tastiest biryani I've had outside of a restaurant, and even rivals some of them. And the price makes this an incredible deal  there are 2 bags per package and there are 6 packages, so this makes 12 large batches for ~$13 with free shipping. I will definitely order more when I run out.
