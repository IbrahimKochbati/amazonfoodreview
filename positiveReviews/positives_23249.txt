My son is allergic to wheat and eggs and this mix makes by far the best  ead one can hope without these two ingredients. I use this mix in our  ead machine with an egg replacer and it makes a nice loaf with a good texture and great taste, especially if you toast it. Pamela's Products other wheat free mixes are also great if you want to make cookies or  ownies that taste as good as any "normal" ones.
