Behind the 12 packets of Via instant coffee, Starbucks placed a  ief message, "Never be without." That's a better marketing strategy than, say, "You could do worse." Instant coffee is still instant coffee and no one who starts his or her day with a cup of Joe is about to trade fresh  ew or French press for instant.          In a pinch, Via is a portable and affordable option.          However, I don't recommend Via as a strategy to save money on your coffee bill. A quality coffee press and a thermos will do much better. The 12 packet order currently sells for $8.95 on Amazon, without special offers or subscribe and save discounts. That works out to $0.75 per cup, which is about what you'd expect to pay in a standard vending machine. Hands down, Starbucks Via tastes better than anything pouring out of a vending machine. However, each Via stick produces an 8 ounce cup of coffee so, depending which size you normally order, you might spend $1.50 (for 16 ounces) or $2.25 (for 24 ounces).          At $0.75 per 8 ounce cup, Starbucks' Via sticks are the same price as SoloBrew's    "
