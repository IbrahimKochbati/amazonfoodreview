One of my favorite salad recipes I make often calls for walnut oil.  I bought a small bottle from a local major grocery store and it was over $10 for about 6 ounces.  Steep!  I love walnuts so naturally I loved this oil from my very first taste.  But the price was not right so I searched on the Internet and found this.  I was a little reluctant to buy 3 cans as I thought they go rancid before I can finish but I am now on my last can.  I use it in place of EVOO to make other vinaigrettes too.  Or just splash this walnut oil and my favorite raspberry vinegar and B&S (or seasons salt like Krazy Salt) over spring mix, it is an easy but great green salad! I do this a lot when I need a quick side. Anyway, this oil goes well with anything and it does not taste too nutty.  Just a touch of nice walnut flavor (of course, I love walnuts so even if it tastes very "walnutty," I would still like it!)          Anyway, it is a great product and I will buy the same pack again!
