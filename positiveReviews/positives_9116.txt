The product came in a small vile and I honestly thought that there wouldn't be enough to dust all of the cookies with it. To my surprise, I ended up making more cookies than originally planned, dusted them with the pearl dust, and had so much of it left over! I was so amazed at how far this stuff goes! It gave the cookies such a beautiful finish!
