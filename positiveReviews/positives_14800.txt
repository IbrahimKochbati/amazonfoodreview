Rishi lives up to their name with their Earl Grey tea:  The leaves are full, dark, long, & curled up on themselves.  No crappy pieces of tea leaves that some companies like to call loose leaf tea!     The killer tin is packed to the top with these sweet smelling leaves!  I hardly needed any tea to  ew a sweet tasting & pleasantly aromatic cup!  I have a tendency to over ew my tea & I probably let this  ew for about 15 to 20 min. & it wasn't the least bit bitter! Very enjoyable!  Great with honey, better with honey and cream!  YUM! I have a feeling this tin is going to last me a long while!     I have one slight problem, it says it contains "natural essential bergamont oil".  Why isn't it organic????     Fortunately the tea itself is 100% Organic Fair Trade certified. Fair Trade means workers get paid a fair wage for their work product instead of getting mere pennies a day.     Love your body & go organic whenever you can.  If you don't buy organic tea, you are ingesting A LOT of pesticides & chemicals in concentrated forms    ewing the chemicals right into your cup!  Yuck!
