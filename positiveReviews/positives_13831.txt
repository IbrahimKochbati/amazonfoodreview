I absolutely love this stuff. I mix it with water to make peanut butter, add it to cold noodles to make Chinese cold peanut noodles, sprinkle it on ice cream and mix it in my protein drinks.  BUT I never would pay almost $8.00 for hit. My health food store sells it for $3.00.  Check out Linda's Diet Delight
