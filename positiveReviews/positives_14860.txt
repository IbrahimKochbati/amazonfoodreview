I always thought that Captain Picard was a bit of a wimp for preferring Earl Grey tea but when made according to the detailed instructions  this version is a rather "Manly" tea. Very strong with a bit of an edge, quite suitable for Star ship Captains, gentleman adventurers and  with a little extra water the rest of us too. I like it better sweetened than unsweetened and think it needs sugar and or milk to smooth it out. The Bergamont flavoring is a bit strong in my opinion but if you like an intense Earl Grey version, this might be just your cup of tea ( I had to say that).     There is quite a bit of caffeine in it so it might not be the best bedtime beverage. This tea Goes well with classic tea accompaniments such as cookies, cakes, cucumber and ham finger sandwiches etc. and would also be good to accompany a meal.  Not really the tea you would choose to serve with sushi except for that style of California Roll  that is made with chopped crab (or Kreb surimi) and Mayonnaise, Which was really enhanced when served with this tea.
