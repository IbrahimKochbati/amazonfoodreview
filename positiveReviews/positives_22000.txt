I got this for a friend who has recovered from a long illness.  She loves to garden, but was not able to while she was sick.  This basket really cheered her up!  It was packaged so nicely, and she loved the items included.  She now has two sets of tools, so she can keep one set for the front yard and one for the backyard. And the basket is perfect for picking flowers or vegetables!
