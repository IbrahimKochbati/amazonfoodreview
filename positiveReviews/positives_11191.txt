Was hesitant at first to buy this coffee but I couldn't pass up the deal.  My husband and I drink med bold coffee and are pretty snobbish when it comes to coffee.  I have had better coffee than Emeril's but it's up there in the "good" coffee category.  I would definitely buy again for the cost that it was.
