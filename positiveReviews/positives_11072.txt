I've been drinking Yogi teas for a couple of years now.  Just happened upon it at a health food store and wanted to try it.  The medicinal Yogi Tea line is fantastic.  It does exactly what the box says it will do... which is strange because I have tried many medicinal teas that have not given me any type of immediate or noticable results.  I can have a tummy ache, drink a 6 8 oz cup of Yogi Stomach ease and half way through the cup my stomach ache is gone.  The same goes for their bedtime tea:  once I drink a cup I can lay down, close my eyes and I'm out cold and in a deep restful sleep.  This stuff is way better than the supermarket celestial seasonings line.  Twinnings or Traditional Medicinals don't compare either.  One important thing to be aware of regarding the Yogi line:  these teas are spicy and heavy.  Many of them have spices like cardimom, cinnamon, black licorice root, stevia leaf... some even have black pepper listed as an ingredient... they're loaded, but oh so good!!
