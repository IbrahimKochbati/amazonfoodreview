I remember the old Shake N Bake commercial from when I was a kid ("It's Shake N Bake, and I helped!") and was curious to try it again.  My sample pouch had enough to coat 6 boneless pork chops, each almost a half inch thick.  Each pouch is designed for 4 6 half inch thick bone in or boneless chops.          It was quick and easy to coat the chops in a zip lock bag after moistening the meat with water.  No messy clean up.  And the pork chops baked up tasty and moist in just a couple minutes more than the recommended 15 minutes.  I used a thermometer to check for the recommended 160 degrees.  The flavor of the coating enhanced and did not dominate the flavor of the pork and it was not too salty.          For a quick weeknight meal, I will buy this.
