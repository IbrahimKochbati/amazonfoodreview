I also purchased Belgian Pearl Sugar to make Belgian waffles.  My goal was to imitate the Belgian waffles by Julian's Recipe.  I experimented with different recipes and ingredients but nothing was quite right until I tried this pearl sugar.  It's the key ingredient not just for taste for for texture.  It caramelizes during the cooking process, resulting in crunchy nuggets of sweetness in my waffles.  Five pounds sounds like a lot of sugar, but if you calculate the price per pound, it's a more economical option compared to the smaller amounts.  At this price, it's best reserved for special recipes.  I'm sure I'll use it up making waffles or other baked treats, however I wouldn't use it for basic purposes, such was sweetening coffee. I could not find pearl sugar in any store, no matter how specialized it was so I decided to purchase here on Amazon.  The sugar came double bagged in plastic.  Also included was a tin of Penguin Mints.  Nice surprise! Overall, I very happy with my purchase.
