whenever Amazon sells Jerky under $1 per ounce, I always like to sample it.  I recall seeing this  and at my local Target over $1.50 per ounce (BTW   Target's $1 oz house  and Pepper Jerky is great).  I tried Wild Ride's Peppered and Hickory, since sweeter flavored Jerky are rarely done right.  Peppered is always a safe flavor to try since few makers can screw that up, and this one did not disappoint   very nice balance of pepper and smoke without downing it in salt.  the Hickory tasted like pickled meat with a strong dill and parsley aftertaste, while being way too salty and moist.  both had about the same gristle percentage than that cheap import Amazon sells from World Kitchens Jerky.  If you like your Jerky drier, just leave it in the fridge in an open bag for a few days.  I'd call the Pepper a 3 star jerky, and the Hickory 2 star jerky, that both earn a bonus star as long as it's available under $1 oz.  One annoying thing about the package   the ingredients list is microscopic   sort of makes you wonder what they are hiding...
