I actually purchased a pack of NongShim Spicy Chicken bowls (pk of 12) from a local warehouse in my area.  Ever since college I've been a fan of these "cup of noodles" style meals during late Autumn and Winter.  Makes for quick alternative meal that warms you up.  How does Nongshim's spicy chicken version stand up against other  ands I've had?          Pretty good actually!  Each bowl contains a fairly large amount of noodles, compared to the cup variety.  The noodles are your typical standard dried Ramen noodle.  I am not a big fan of microwaving these products so I make mine by boiling water.  Just put some water up to boil, open the package and add the "flavor pouch" or Soup Base, add boiling water to the fill line and wait 3 minutes.  Instant hot soup with noodles.  While the noodles are standard , the  oth is really good.  It has a lot of flavor to it and a good spicy kick to it.  Put the two of them together and you get a very satisfying meal that will fill you up, and wake you up.          Despite having a good spicy  oth and making for a  filling meal... This product does have some CONS I am wary of.  For one the product contains almost 1800mg of sodium for a single bowl.  This is insane!  Most of these cup bowl of noodles are overloaded with sodium to begin with, but it still needs to be pointed out.  The fat content is a bit high also, at 14g for an entire bowl.  Another problem I have is that most of the products I've tried usually come in a sturdy container for your product.  Nongshim's Spicy Chicken Bowls come in a flimsy plastic bowl.  It works fine but once prepared I would definitely suggest carrying with two hands, as it has a very cheap feel to the bowl.  The price per bowl is also a bit expensive.  At the warehouse I purchased this, I paid $9 for 12 bowls.  I could of paid $6.50 for 24 cup of noodle varieties.  Compared to the cup variety, you are paying a premium for these; And while the bowl produced better quality  oth, I don't see it being worth the price increase. (12 bowls   24 servings.. $9 for 24 servings.  the cups were $6.50 for 24 servings.. so basically $2.50 more for bowls vs cups)          OVERALL I would give this product 4 stars.  Despite having a flimsy bowl, and incredibly high amount of sodium the product makes up for it in the overall quality of its taste and sheer volume of noodles.  You get a big meal here that will both fill you, and warm you up.  It has a really nice spicy kick to the  oth that lingers without becoming annoying(see NOTE).  I've always enjoyed spicy foods so having a few of these laying around the house helps if I just want a quick meal.  I would not recommend eating these everyday, in fact maybe I tend to aim for one a week.  Products like this are not exactly the healthiest alternative meal for you, but if you need a quick emergency meal these are a good alternative.          NOTE: The product contains chicken but I really wouldn't call it chicken.  You might find a few tiny little bits of re hydrated chicken     NOTE: I do not use the entire flavor soup base packet.  The amount of sodium it contains is ridiculous!  I use no more than 3 4 of the packet.  I tried using the entire packet once and it made the  oth start to taste far too salty, as well as making the spice in the  oth overpower rather than compliment.  Don't be afraid to use less of the packet...
