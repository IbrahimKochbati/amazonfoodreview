My kids have eaten oatmeal everyday since the weather turned cold. It puts warmth and filling  eakfast into their tummies. These flavors were great, they loved them! I wish there had been more apple and less banana.          The subscription meant we always had oatmeal, and it meant a lower price too! So convenient. Now that winter is ending, I just cancelled the subscription and done!
