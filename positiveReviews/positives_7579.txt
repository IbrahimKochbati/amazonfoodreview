I absolutely love these Navitas Naturals Chia Seeds. I have been using them in and on various meals for over a year now, and I now rely on them so much that I finally decided to subscribe to ordering them through amazon. I cook for myself and one other person, use these on at least one meal per day (helps digestion and provides key nutrients for my vegetarian diet!) and I usually need a new bag every other month. These are just like poppy seeds in texture and size, and I find them perfect for sprinkling on salads, soups and pasta dishes. But honestly, they're excellent in anything for added texture and nutrients!
