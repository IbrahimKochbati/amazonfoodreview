I ordered these despite my concerns after reading other reviews re: small diameter size.  Absolutely true, and I regret making the purchase. For the same price, I  iefly ordered from a different Amazon vendor the same # and length bully sticks for the same price.  Difference?  Original vendor bully sticks were on average 3 4" thick.  This vendor bully sticks are at MOST 1 2" thick, with most closer to 1 4".          What difference does it make?          Our dog, a slender 44 lb. mixed boxer chow, would take 3 5 days to get through a 3 4" bully stick, and would get hours and hours of good gnawing time in on each one.  These new thin ones she completely consumes in less than 30 mins.  That makes a huge difference in how fast we go through the bag!          Will not order again from this supplier.
