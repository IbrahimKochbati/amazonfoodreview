I have not been a fan of kettle style chips in the past, but for these I'll make an exception.  2 3 chips in and you've got a burn going on.  I have looked for a truly hot chip for some time, and most fall seriously short.  For those not "appreciative" of the heat level of these chips, they are overwhelmed with the hot, and say it covers up the taste.  Not for me!  Actually, I could use them somewhat hotter, but they are not a disappointment.  Good heat, great with beer.
