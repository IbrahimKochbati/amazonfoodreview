These muffins were very good made according to the recipe on the box, but when I changed the recipe a little, by substituting almond milk for the 2% milk, and extra virgin olive oil for the butter, they were great!  Next time, I am going to try adding some grated carrots and not adding the sugar.  Thank you Hodgson Mill for a wonderful gluten free product.
