I tried the Switch Kiwi Berry drink along with the Switch Black Cherry drink.  I'll review them together because there isn't that much to write about.          First, I'll admit a little bias.  I'm not a fan of sugar based drinks.  I drink diet pop, Crystal Light drinks, and I use saccharin, aspartame, and sucralose.  I find sugar based drinks generally "gummy", although carbonated drinks are somewhat preferable to non carbonated drinks.  While there is "no sugar added" to these drinks, the fruit juice itself is quite full of sugar.          The Switch  and drinks are lightly carbonated, which helps them in my opinion   others may disagree.  The gumminess is still there, though.  The fruit flavor is not strong enough to overcome this and I found that I needed this drink to be extremely cold (as in near frozen) to enjoy it.  I did not like the aluminum can for this product either.  I find that fruit flavored drinks seem to latch onto the aluminum flavor more than other drinks.          My personal preference was for the Black Cherry, but others may like the Kiwi Berry.  I can't recommend this as a net positive, but my preferences might adversely reflect here   I'll rate it as neutral.  If you feel your tastes are similar to mine, you should probably forgo this one.
