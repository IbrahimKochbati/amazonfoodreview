Funny thing   I bought some of these K cups several weeks ago based on the strength of the reviews at that time.  I just got them last week and have had a few cups since then.  I'm using 8 ounces of water to prepare the cocoa.  I thought they tasted pretty good   reasonably chocolaty and smooth.          They were sweet, but not overly so, and the richness made me check the calorie count on the box.  60 calories   hey, not too bad!  It wasn't until now that I came back to place a review and I read the most recent reviews from others did I realize they use artificial sweetener.  Honestly, if I hadn't read it I would have never known   I didn't detect anything that gave me the hint when I drank it.          I think if you like a quick cocoa on the run you'll be happy enough with these K cups.  Are they as good as a Swiss Miss packet from Costco?  Maybe not, but in my office I don't want to deal with getting powder on the counters and needing a spoon to get things mixed.  You'll sacrifice a little for the convenience, but to me it's well worth it.
