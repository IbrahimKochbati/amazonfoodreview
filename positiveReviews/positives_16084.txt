This is the original wing sauce from Buffalo and it does not get any better.  The best part is that you can avoid deep frying(even though instructions say to do this)...just put 2 lbs. of wings on a cookie sheet sprayed with PAM bake for 20 minutes at 425 turn over and finish for 15 more.  Toss with 1 2 cup sauce and you're done!!!!
