The packages are MUCH smaller than normal store packets, and the instructions are way off. If you make muffins, the instructions advise that you will get 6 8. Not on this planet. It takes 2 packages to get that. Not such a great $$ deal after all. In addition, it calls for 2 3 cup water or milk. That makes soup. You need maybe half that to get a proper batter consistency. Two stars off for all that.          As far as flavor goes...it's exactly as expected. A fair amount of corn ness, not sweet. I added an egg (there's no obvious binder in the ingredient list) and about a tablespoon of sugar to two packages, and cut back on the milk by roughly half. They rose and  owned nicely, and had great texture.          While these were fine from a flavor and convenience perspective, I would not buy again, unless the price was drastically lower. Too much money for a too small bag of cornmeal and baking powder.
