Have a miniature poodle and he is a very picky eater.  When we eat rib eye, leg of lamb etc that is what he wants too.  Well we love our dog but we were looking for a compromise that would not cost an arm and a leg. He just would not eat other dry dog foods and we were told feeding him canned food should be the exception and not the rule.          This seems to be it. He likes this one the best.  But we are going to have to rotate it with other varieties. Because he just wont eat the same thing for any length of time.          Definitely, he likes this one a whole lot. And we can feel good about the quality.  Also this supposedly keeps the amount of poo down to.
