This coffee reminds me of Dunkin Donuts coffee, which is all the rage now.  I like both DD and Yuban about equally, but I opt for Yuban because of the price.  This is really great coffee at a reasonable price.  It's a light roast.  If you've never tried Yuban, maybe try one can before committing to the 12 pack.  If you've tried it and like it, then you know this is a good deal.
