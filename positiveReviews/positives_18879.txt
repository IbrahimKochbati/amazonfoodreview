All three of my very picky eaters LOVED it! Being a vegetarian, I got tired of dealing with raw meat and mixing a bunch of stuff in it to make their meals balanced. With Ziwipeak, all the work has been done. Just scoop it out of the bag and into the dish and voila! A perfect and healthy meal. Happy dogs and happy me : ) I only wish it wasn't so expensive.
