Our dog pepper loves these! Ever since we got a huge plastic tub of these direct from the company a few years ago, this is the only treat he runs to and really eats up. He doesn't like hard bones, and his tummy causes other treats to sometimes reappear.  Other treats are always a hit miss with him, but these are always gone. They are softer than other treats and  eak apart easily, making it easy for him to chow down.
