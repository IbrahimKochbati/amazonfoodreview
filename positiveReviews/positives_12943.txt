NO sugar added, No preservatives, 100% juice carbonated. This is what is written on the can of this "soda juice." The taste was good and you are basically getting what it says. take some juice add some carbonation and thats what you have here. both my kids took a few sips and they enjoyed it. the cans are great for little hands to hold. my 18 month old was able to grasp it just fine since it is slim. overall a good drink.
