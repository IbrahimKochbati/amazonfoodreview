I love the taste of this soda. It's sweet with no bitter aftertaste that can be found in some orange sodas. I'd never guess this was a natural drink from the taste alone.          My only complaint would be the serving size. It's correct for a serving size but not what I'm used to in a soda can. (12 oz.)
