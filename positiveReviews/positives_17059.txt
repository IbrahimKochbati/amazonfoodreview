This is great thing to try to distract dogs with, but I do have two caveats.  One, I would never use it in a house with hardwood floors, especially if you are noise sensitive! The bottle is quite hard and it does create a lot of noise if your dog becomes on who picks it up and slams it on the floor, as one of mine does.  The other spins it around and as a result is a bit quieter.  There is also no way of regulating how fast treats come out of the jug.  Once the dogs learn the concept of the toy, most learn not to touch the tug, otherwise you restrict toys from coming out.  In terms of safety, I have not had my dogs try to eat the rubber tug handle or the ball at the top of the bottle.  The biggest problem I have with them is that of massive hair accumulation from the dogs dragging it all over the carpet.
