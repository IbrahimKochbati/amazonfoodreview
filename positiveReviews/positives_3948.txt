My family and I are relatively new to gluten free and we have been in search of a baking mix to replace our weekend  eakfasts.  We have tried several others and they all taste "gluten free", if you know what I mean.  Pamela's however, is so good and you can't tell its gluten free. Try it, you won't regret it!
