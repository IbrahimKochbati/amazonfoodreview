Like all of Annie's soup bowls it is a wonderful product.  Great taste, great environmentally, incredibly easy to use, a winner on all counts but... the bowl, which surely does not look like a two person serving contains two servings.  Huh?  Really?  Surprising that such a great company does this 'tricky' nutrition labeling.  I wrote to Annie's expressing disappointment, but alas, no repsonse.  Great product, but apparently you are eating for two.
