I really, really dislike Sucralose.  I don't like the taste, the aftertaste, or the after effects.  I bought this based on it NOT saying it was "diet" or "low calorie".  The first ingredient is Sugar so it's only partially sweetened with Sucralose.  Sucralose is buried way down in the ingredients list but the taste is noticeable.          Sure wish Amazon contained the full nutrition and ingredients labels from all food products.
