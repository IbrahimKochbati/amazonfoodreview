This Yuban DARK ROAST is outstanding.  It is smooth with a chocolaty taste.  I find it as good as any far more expensive coffees.  I would also recommend purchasing the 11 ounce cannisters because the coffee is freshest when you can pop open a new can and use it up without refrigerating or freezing it.          I do not like many dark roasted coffees because I don't like the burnt taste.  Yuban DARK ROAST has NO burnt or bitter taste.  Definitely shun the regular roast for this one.          Also, keep in mind that this review is written by someone who thinks Starbucks is far, far overrated (bitter, burnt).
