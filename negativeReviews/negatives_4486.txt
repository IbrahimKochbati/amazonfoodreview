I have tried many different flavors from many different  ands and by far, this particular flavor from Happy Baby is the worst texture and taste that I ever bought for my baby.  My baby just doesn't like it.  I let her try it three times and she just hates the texture and the taste.  I don't why they made the food so dry to begin with.  Turkey itself gives a little dried texture compared to chicken and they should have taken that into consideration.  And the food is so lumpy and it's not even in good chunky blend either.  In the end it was a total waste of money to buy this product.
