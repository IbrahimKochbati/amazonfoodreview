If you enjoy pork rinds you are going to love this product. Hot and fresh pork rinds beat the socks off any of that bagged stuff from the grocery store that taste like steyrofoam packing peanuts. These little gems cook up light and crispy right from the microwave. They have a mildly spicy flavor that builds up as you make way through the serving but the heat never gets too powerful. The key to getting the best yield is to shake the bag before cooking. That will distribute the pellets evenly. Then you have to find the "sweet spot" for cooking time. Mine is 2 min 30 sec which leaves me with no burnt or uncooked pieces. I only have two minor criticisms: 1) The serving size is a little small and 2)the spice mixture is a tad bit too salty for me. Otherwise, these things are tops !
