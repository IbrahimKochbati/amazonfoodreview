I have arthritis and have searched for a decent coffee replacement for years.  The Maya Chocolate hits the spot. The chicory gives it the bitter note needed, the toasted almonds add depth, while the chocolate tempers the chicory and adds fullness to the flavor. Whoa. Sounds like I am reviewing a great coffee...LOL! Good Stuff Manard, give it a go!
