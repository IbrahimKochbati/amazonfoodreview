This is amazingly tasty! The whole family was excited to find these in their Christmas stocking. It is a creamy, rich treat unlike anything I have tried before. We originally bought one package at the mall, (It cost $8.00 for one!) but it was so good we wanted more! I was very excited to find it on Amazon!
