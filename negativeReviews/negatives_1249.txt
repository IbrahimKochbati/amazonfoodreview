Beware of what you are being charged .... it says that it's $9.99 but 911Drugstore is charing you $39.99 plus $14 in shipping. (I've found this to be true for several other items on this site.)     I'm not sure if this is a misprint .... Amazon doesn't seem to think it's an issue since the seller can charge whatever they want for the item.  I disagree, and think it's Amazon's responisbility to get to the bottom of this.
