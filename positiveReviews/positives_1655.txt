My two boys love the Happy Munchies Cheddar Cheese Carrot. They request them as their snack as they watch their "show" on t.v. I love that they are low in sodium, includes 25mg of choline per serving (which is great for their eyes)and tastes great. Also, they are Kosher certified which is a plus as well. I love to put these in baggies and keep them in my purse for emergency snacks on the go. Healthy, crunchy and a must buy.
