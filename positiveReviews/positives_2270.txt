I found Wild Thymes many years ago and have continued to use their products   the Lemon Salad Refresher is my favorite salad dressing, it is light, now cal, and very tasty. Excellent on any green or pasta salad and especially good on fresh Heirloom tomatoes with fresh avocado slices. Yum! Their Customer Service is excellent and helpful, and the site shares some great recipes as well. I'm a fan.
