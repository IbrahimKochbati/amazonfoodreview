This coffee is very tasty, smooth and not acidic. The taste is not strong in the pumpkin flavor, but I still like it a lot. I added pumpkin spice creamer to mine until I ran out. My husband and I enjoy the smell of the coffee  ewing pleasing aroma of nuts and vanilla with a hint of spice.     The shipping was free with the Amazon Super Saver Shipping. Some of the other companies charge almost the same price of the coffee to ship it to you, doubling the price of the coffee!     I'm not sure I will go out of my way to buy this again if I am looking for a pumpkin coffee.
