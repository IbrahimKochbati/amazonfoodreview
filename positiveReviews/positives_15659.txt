My three cats took a vote this morning, and they give this three paws up!  It kind of reminds me of Fancy Feast, but it's healthier    no wheat gluten, dyes, or preservatives.  I have one cat with a delicate stomach, and Fancy Feast sometimes makes her throw up, but she can eat this with no problems at all.
