I have two children who are allergic to milk and this is as good as if it had milk in it. We use earth balence butter substitute and follow the receipe and the package but only using 1 2 the pkg and not the whole. They are as far as I am concerned,  better than the ones we made before. Coming a home cooking for 5 men  they are great. Thank you bakers.
