We had gotten the biscuit dispensing Kong, but as far as activity, our yellow lab puppy got the biscuits out within minutes (even if they were well wedged).  He has been working on this Tug A Jug (filled with kibble) for the last 2 1 2 hours.  Amazing.  We plan to give him at least one of his three daily meals in this to keep him occupied.  He is 4 months, and in that teething stage, so this toy is a real life saver. We'll get him another one when he chews his way through the rope on this one. This was money well spent.
