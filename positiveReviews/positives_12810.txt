I was intrigued by this product.  Once it arrived, my son was as well.  So, I shared it and anothere flavor with him.  My assessment was that it has a pleasant taste but  unless I had read the can  I am not sure I would be able to identify it as Kiwi Berry.  It also has a slight aftertaste  not unpleasaant, but just there.  Also, I am not too sure I need the carbonation with fruit juice.  My 8 year old son on the other hand loved it.  He raved about the taste and the bubbles, claiming it tastes like Sprite only much better.  He seemed to like this and the other flavors about the same.  I would suggest this as something to try, but hesitate on buying more since the price is realtively high compared to other beverage options.
