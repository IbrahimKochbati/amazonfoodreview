I REALLY like this coffee! so nice, bold, and full body.  The coffee is great for making expresso, it smeels so good and there is no aftertaste! I enjoyed the first cup in the morning, so robust.  I can only say that the price is a bit high for what I would like to pay.  It was great to enjoy a good cup of coffee without heartburn.  I would love to buy more if the price goes down a bit.  Overall, really good.
