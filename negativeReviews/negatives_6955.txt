If you have been deprived of sandwiches for a long time because of a gluten sensitivity , this  ead mix may seem like a treat. On the other hand, if you have found Whole Foods gluten free loaves, such as the Prairie  ead with pumpkin and sunflower seeds, then I think you'll be disappointed as I was. I tried the manual mixing method, and took special care to allow the  ead to rise as I would a non GF  ead. The instructions say only to let it rise 1 hr. which I believe is inadequate. Perhaps the yeast in the supplied packet was not as active as it should have been    in any event the resulting  ead did not rise properly in several attempts. Flavor is not that great, but I did make some "everything" bagels which were fairly tasty if not very light.
