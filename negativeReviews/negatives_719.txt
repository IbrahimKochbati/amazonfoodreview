I like the dried peas from Just tomatoes and I also like their Just Corn.  They are way too expensive though.  They are really handy because I don't use frozen or canned foods because I follow an Ayurvedic diet which prohibits them.  When I can not find fresh peas I have to use these.  I will probably have to do without as I can't afford these, too bad.
