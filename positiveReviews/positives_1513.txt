I was amazed at how good this is for canned fruit (which I normally won't touch).  In particular I adore papayas and mangos.  The fruit juice instead of syrup is also very nice.  The easy pull top on the can makes this a great item to stash in my desk drawer at work, so that I can have a fruit snack easily even if I was too busy or forgot to  ing lunch.  So far I haven't gotten a can that had any problems.  The watermelon isn't crunchy   of course not!   but it's good, and certainly not "slimy".
