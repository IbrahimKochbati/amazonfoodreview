If not for the low acid, I would never recommend this coffee. The taste was uneven and flat, not a French Roast by any stretch of the imagination.          I like my coffee strong and smooth, and I figured that low acid would be reflected in a smoother taste, but it was not. To be fair, I have not had a lot of low acid coffees for comparison.  I suppose that if acid is a real concern, someone could drink this. I don't take milk and sugar, so maybe the addition of those would disguise...er, improve the taste.
