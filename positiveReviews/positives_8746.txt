Being a hard core "all things from Vermont are the best" kind of guy,I was a bit apprehensive about buying maple syrup from Wisconsin.But the low price and a visit to their fantastic user friendly website sold me and boy was I glad.I purchased Andersons Grade B,(my favorite grade),through Amazon annd found it to be by far the best tasting grade B I have ever tasted.Uniqley hardy yet not too molasses like,this syrup hits all the right notes.I will continue to buy this syrup to satisy my grade B obession and highly reccomend it to all.
