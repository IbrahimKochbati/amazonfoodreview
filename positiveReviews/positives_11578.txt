The Highland Sugarworks Organic Maple syrup is by far the best maple syrup my daughter and I have tasted.  We have tried many  ands including maple syrup produced by individuals, and this syrup is the best!  I had an opportunity to purchase it a few months ago at Amazon.com for about $13; unfortunately, the price has gone up like everything else grocery related.  It is so good that I hesitate to try other  ands because I do not want to be disappointed.  I will be buying more in the near future.
