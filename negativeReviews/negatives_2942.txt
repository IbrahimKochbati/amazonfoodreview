I purchased this red quinoa on a special deal here on Amazon, partly because I have a Vegetarian sister and a friend with gluten allergies, and so I'm always looking for new dishes that we can all eat and enjoy.  I'd never cooked quinoa before, though I'd recently sampled the white variety in a couscous dish at someone else's home.          So far, the prewashed red quinoa seems to require longer cooking than most of the online recipes suggest, and I haven't been thrilled with the taste of the quinoa alone or with a few spices.  I read online that this red variety has an earthier flavor, and I'm not sure that it appeals to me.          On the other hand, this is such a good source of nutrition that I've continued to experiment with using it in combination with other ingredients, where the quinoa flavor can be mixed with other tastes I enjoy more.  I don't regret buying this, but I'm not yet ready to replace rice or pasta or oatmeal in my diet with cooked quinoa only.
