I at 1st thought I ordered the wrong size but I guess the small size is pretty big. My dog Dingo, who is from a rescue in Taiwan, took to this pretty well. He really doesn't know what toys are but knows how to get food out. This toy is a bit trickier then the others but I heard (won't let me watch) him playing with this and I believe he has been able to get a few kibble bits out.          I will update once I'm actually able to watch him. Until then I give this 3 stars.
