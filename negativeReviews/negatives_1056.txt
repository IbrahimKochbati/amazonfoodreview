I usually enjoy a cup of coffee a few days a week, more as an indulgence than as a necessity.  It's a sipping beverage for me, and flavor matters a lot.  That said, I add milk and sugar, so I'm not excessively picky (or I think so, at least).  So I'm always glad to find new "gourmet" blends to add to my list of favorites.          This blend seemed promising, with a very nice aroma and a perfect, even grind.  I usually grind my own beans, but found that this grind worked nicely in my espresso machine as is.  It even produced a rich, smooth crema.  Unfortunately, my first sip   without sugar or milk   was very bitter.  I ended up adding about a half teaspoon more sugar than I usually use just to compensate.  Even then, the coffee flavor, itself, was thin and weak.  With just a little milk added, it tasted more like, well, flavored milk.          This coffee reminded me of the inoffensive bland coffee my parents used to get for our drip coffee maker a couple of decades ago.  Fine for that application, but not really what I'm looking for in rich, smooth flavor with low bitterness.
