I didn't expect this to be this fizzy. Sure it's not like a Pepsi, but if you want some carbonation from a beverage in a healthier manner, this is a great alternative. However, you might be disappointed if you intend on replacing your favorite soda because you'd definitely miss the extra sugary flavor, thus leaving it to taste like a fizzy fruity tea.          Still, I don't normally drink soda, and there are times that I definitely crave it. So these would be a good enough substitute, especially if you're not used to extremely sugared beverages. I'd also feel very safe about giving this to children.
