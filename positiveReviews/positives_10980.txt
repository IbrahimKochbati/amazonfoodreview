I LOVE Glutino's crackers.  I am gluten intolerant, so I cannot have gluten or wheat.  I never really missed crackers, but after I tasted these at my natural health food store during a tasting they were having   WOW!!!  They are AMAZING and I was hooked.  I also love their vegetable flavor.  I have never tried the cheddar as I cannot have dairy, but I'm sure they are good too.          The only problems I have with the crackers are the high saturated fat content and the price.  Of course, with any gluten free item, they are a bit pricey, but that's to be expected, unfortunately.  But they really don't give you a lot in the box for the price.          I saw the 'saltine' or 'table' cracker version of Glutino's the other day at my health food store and I was going to get them because I've been wanting 'saltine' type crackers for my soup, but the saturated fat content was really high!!!  Three grams of saturated fat for just THREE crackers.  Ridiculous!!!  Of course, some people don't care about the nutritional health facts pertaining to the food they eat, but I do... and I would NOT get these because of that.  But the other crackers are really GOOD and the saturated fat content isn't too high.  Still not the greatest, but because they are so delicious, I've made an exception for them.
