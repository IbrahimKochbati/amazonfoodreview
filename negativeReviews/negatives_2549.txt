I originally tried this as a part of a variety pack. I'm glad I didn't buy the whole package. If you like richer hot chocolates, then you will not like this. I tried making this hot chocolate on all three settings (smaller, medium, larger cups on the three option Keurig machines). All of the options tasted too watery for me. I would often add creamer to try to substitute for the lack of flavor to them.  If this is a machine you have in your office and are looking for something different than coffee, it is, like the stars rating claims, okay. It tastes like what it is   a mediocre hot chocolate they added to a coffee line to simply offer variety.          Personally, I prefer to just use Swiss Miss packets and use the Keurig to heat the water. You get better taste (by a company known for hot chocolate) and the convenience of the Keurig machine. Plus, you save a lot of money.
