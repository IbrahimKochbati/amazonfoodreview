I used to be a super coffee snob   buying green coffee beans and roasting them at home.  It was tedious, but with a good espresso blend it would make one heck of a cup of joe.  Then due to the economy I needed to scale back, so I tried Folgers Black Silk after seeing an ad (this is when it was first launched).  I became immediately hooked and it is now the only coffee I drink when I  ew at home.  If you use a French Press, you're in for a treat.  Black Silk excretes a delightful nutty oil when allowed to steep that those using filtered  ewers will miss out on.  This coffee is strong, deep, dark, smooth, and delicious.
