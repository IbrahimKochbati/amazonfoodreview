I enjoyed these k cups when I used them. They tasted pretty good. However, I quickly noticed that my Keurig  ewer began to have problems after I started using these and other Grove Square k cups. Even when I would  ew other cups, I would get half  ewed cups of coffee, smaller cups, and other issues. I cleaned the  ewer, following all the instructions and tips in the manual. The issues came up again as soon as I used these k cups. What I discovered is that the Grove Square k cups were gunking up my  ewer badly. I had to clean out every part of the  ewer completely, including the  ewer basket area, the water reservoir, and the internal mechanism. After completing the entire cleaning process two more times my  ewer got back to normal. I won't order any Grove Square products again.
