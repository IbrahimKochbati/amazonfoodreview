Our vegan household is always pleased to find pup treats with fruits and veggies. I picked up a sample of these at the pet store and my two beautiful, healthy vegetarian Chi's devoured them. They are slightly chewy and full of all healthy ingredients. I give them these fruitable chewies in the morning with their apple barley oat biscuits.
