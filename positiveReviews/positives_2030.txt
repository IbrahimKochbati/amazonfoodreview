This tea is more ginger than lemon, so if you like the taste of soothing ginger, you'd like this product. I mix two packages per 16 oz BPA free Camelbak bottle, filled with 8 oz of water and the rest ice, and a packet of stevia. Shake well, take sip, ahhh   no calorie sweet tea, green tea antioxidant, and great for summer. I called the Stash company to find out how much caffeine was in a packet, and the rep said "negligible."          I also buy the Stash powdered mint green tea, and I prefer the hint of mint better. Again, if you are a ginger fan, you'd really enjoy this product.
