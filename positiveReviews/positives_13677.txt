I always used to stick a ton of these in my bag whenever I'd go to the candy shop in the mall. They are amazing, and the Haribo version is as good as any. They combing having an interesting taste, with an interesting texture as well. The flavour is fruity, tropical in a way. They are pretty chewy, and not too soft (like alot of cheaper gummies), and combing a smooth, chewy texture on top, with a slightly softer, marshmallowy bottom. I will always like these.
