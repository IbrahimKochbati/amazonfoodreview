I used to enjoy coffee from my local Caribou cafe. When I moved to a location that didnt have one I tried the Caribou blend K cups.  Caribou blend was never my favorite, but it was all the store had at the time, so I gave it a try. The flavor is incredibly flat, one dimensional, with a bitter aftertaste, and generally unpleasant aroma (sour).  It was so off that I checked the expiration date, but found out it was still months away.  I wont buy this flavor again.
