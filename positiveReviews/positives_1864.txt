my wife and I are avid Keurig coffee fans (with three  ewers between the two of us). We started out ordering all the flavored pods and soon learned than are likes were back to the basics ..... we each have a couple of "full" strength and then go to the "de caf" for that last cup.          Mahogany is my choice for the full blend.  It's smooth ....has an excellent taste and aroma.          We are totally satisfied with this order .....
