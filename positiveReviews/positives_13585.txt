Finally! The perfect snack for my little one! My two year old absolutely LOVES these! He's constantly asking for "bueberries!" I used to give him concentrated gummy fruit snacks for a treat, but now he only wants Little Ducks snacks. This of course thrills me! The snacks are 100% certified organic, healthy fruit   just freeze dried. I'm happy to give him as many fruit servings as he wants. You definitely will love this product! The other flavors are great too...
