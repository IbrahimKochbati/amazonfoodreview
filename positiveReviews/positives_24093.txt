We use these for everyone in the house, because they are so simple to make. These are designed for a kid's palate, and thus are a little bland "as is". To enhance the flavor, I will add flavor extracts (vanilla, almond, etc.), and other amendments. These adapt well to chocolate chip pancakes, blueberry pancakes, etc.          There is a bit of an art to getting the consistency right, and getting a good consistency is key to getting them cooked all the way through. I find it helps if the pan isn't over hot, but hot enough.          We've been known to take this mix along with us on family outings to restaurants. Because they're so simple to make, most restaurants are understanding about using our mix, since they often don't have egg free, dairy free, wheat free options.
