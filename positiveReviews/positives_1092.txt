I discovered this product a couple of years ago and really liked the taste in coffee , tea and on fruit and oatmeal.  It was a lot less expensive in the packets then, but I've switched to the large 12 oz. container and the price is very good. I don't use sugar and this helps me have the "sweet" and not the increased blood sugar YEAH!!
