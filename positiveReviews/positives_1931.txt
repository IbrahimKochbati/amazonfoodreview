It seems most of the organic shade grown fair trade coffee is medium or dark roasted, so I've been having a hard time finding something that I like.  While this doesn't wow me like some other coffees, it's priced cheaper than those coffees and it's a good  ew for when I'm not really paying attention to what I'm drinking (like when I'm working).          I'm definitely going to keep this one around, and just switch to the expensive (better) coffees that I've found when I can really enjoy them.          Compared to other coffee that's not organic shade grown fair trade, this is an average light roast.  Good, but nothing to get excited over.  It's worth purchasing over those coffees because of the growing practices.
