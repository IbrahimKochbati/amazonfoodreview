I found these little awesomely delicious fruit snacks at a gluten free show in Wisconsin.The guy that was there offered me a package and I fell in love!They are organic, which makes them all the more cool, and they are very, Very tasty!I looked on the ingredients and was surprised to find no high fructose corn syrup!They're a little chewy at first, but I can not find anything else wrong with them. They are a wonderful fruit snack that I don't feel guilty about eating afterwards!
