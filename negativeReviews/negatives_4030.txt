This mat is just fine... by me. My cat, on the other hand, avoids it like the plague. It must feel funny to her little toes. I don't think she has stepped on it a single time. Her entire room will be littered with litter (sorry, couldn't resist), but this mat will remain perfectly clean, because she avoids it so religiously. I find myself wondering why I keep using it. I really should just throw it out.          I'm sure there are cats out there who might not mind. But, for my cat, this was a no go.
