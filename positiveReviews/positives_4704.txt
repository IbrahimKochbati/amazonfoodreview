I've been a fan of Ghirardelli Triple Chocolate  ownie mix for a long time. And I also like Ghirardelli chocolate candy. So when I came across this chocolate mocha hot cocoa mix I wanted to give it a try cause I love cocoa and coffee. I'm glad I bought it because this stuff is delicious. I love the combination of chocolate and coffee. The coffee in it is very subtle and definitely not overpowering. It's rich, very flavorful, and bold. And as others have pointed out this is the best mix you can buy. I'm very impressed.
