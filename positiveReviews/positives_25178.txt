We really like maple syrup. We try to get grade B for the darker color and stronger flavor, but grade A is also pretty darn good. This is a big jug (32 oz) and will last you a while. We transfer it to smaller containers that we can heat up for use at the table. This probably isn't a better deal than you can get at the grocery (with shipping) but it is a good value if you live far away from a larger town and can combine your maple fix with other orders to defray or avoid shipping charges.
