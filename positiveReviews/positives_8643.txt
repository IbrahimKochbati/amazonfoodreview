Weavers Coffee is what some refer to as the best coffee on earth. Once I had my first sip I was hooked for life. This great coffee has a great taste and is far superior to Pete's coffee. Experiencing the magical taste of Weavers Coffee is unforgettable and will be the best decision you've ever made.
