Imagine you took a raspberry, drizzled chocolate syrup on it, and then put it on a frying pan.  You turned on the frying pan and let it sizzle for about 3 or 4 hours.  Put that in a coffee filter and  ew it.  Sound good?  I didn't think so.  Thats what this coffee tastes like to me.  I bought a double pack, and I don't like it.  I tried to like it, and even gave it a second shot.  I wish I knew what to do with the rest of it, but I wouldn't subject my friends to this, so I can't give it to them.
