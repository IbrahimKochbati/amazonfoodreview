I was a little hesitant to order due to the packaging concerns of others, but I did anyway.  They arrived today undamaged.  I had ordered some other items which were shipped together in a larger box, so that probably helped.  In other words the box the creamers were in was itself in a larger box.  I can see how a few might burst if they were roughly handled.  They are shipped loose in a box.  For the price though, I figured if a few burst I was still way ahead on price.  I give it 5 stars because you should already know about the product before you order (yummy!) and they were undamaged on this shipment.
