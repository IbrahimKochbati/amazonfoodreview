I have eaten alot of bars lately, and these are the best. They were a little hard to find locally at first, but ahhhaahhh Publix has them for 2 for $3.00, not bad huh? Also from now til 12 31 10 thinkthin has a coupon you can use (print alot of copies ;)) for 50 cents off a single purchase. AND NO SUGAR!!!! I feel like I'm eating a chocolate cnady bar but I dont feel as guilty afterwards. These chocolate  ownie one is good too, but nothing like these white chocolate bars. Thanks think thin!!!!
