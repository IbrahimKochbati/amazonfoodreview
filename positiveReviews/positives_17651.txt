I got this coffee for my husband who loves coffee but is unable to drink it everyday due to the heartburn it gives him.  I separated the packet into 2 half pots for 2 days.  He loved the taste of it, it was bold and flavorful and did what it claimed to do...not give him heartburn.  That is a win win in our book.  We recommend this coffee if you are looking for a bold flavor and want to avoid the heartburn.
