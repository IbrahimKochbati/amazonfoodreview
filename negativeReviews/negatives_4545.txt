This should be called Sad Baby  it's awful. My baby absolutely hates it! I tasted a tiny bit     and it was bland to the point of gagging. Besides I assumed (wrongly obviously) that Stage 3     food  for babies 7+ months  would have some chunks of real food. Unfortunately, it's just glop,     and unfortunately, incredibly tasteless glop. I tried other flavors from this  and and they     were just as disgusting, my baby wont eat any of the flavors at all.
