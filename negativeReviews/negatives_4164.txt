The product gets 5 stars.... Great taste, less fat, easy to throw into smoothies, turn into peanut dressing, for thai food or satay like dishes.          Amazon pricing gets 1 star. This is available in grocery stores for less than $3.00, so why Amazon charges this pricing is obscene to say the least!          Pick this up from your local grocery store, or get cheaper price from plantationbell.com or netrition.com
