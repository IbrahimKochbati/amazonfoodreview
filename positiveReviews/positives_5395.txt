I had been looking for something to use with my own coffee. I know the Keurig has its own My K cup but I wasn't satisfied with the results. There were also suggestions on making personal k cups by saving the used k cups and rinsing them out and refilling them with coffee and then covering them with foil or plastic wrap. What a pain that was.          After looking at several different disposable k cups for the keurig I came across this one and felt it did what I wanted. Much less mess involved and works great.
