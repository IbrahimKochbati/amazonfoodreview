I really liked this flavor!  As someone with many food sensitivities who also avoids sugar, this is the perfect treat for me when I crave chocolate or baked goods.  The raw nuts are crisp and fresh tasting.  However, the price was very high for the quantity of product.  With less than 20  azil nuts in the package, I felt a little gipped.  In future, I'll try making my own chocolate nut mix from bulk raw nuts, berries, and coco powder rather than spend $9 per package!  For that price, I'd like a lot more product.
