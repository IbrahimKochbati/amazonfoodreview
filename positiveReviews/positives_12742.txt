I LOVE this stuff. Imagine my joy to find it in a gallon sized container!! buying as many 5oz bottles is $64...I'm going to buy this and keep the small bottles and fill them up again. Oh happy day!! Put it on eggs, hot wings, in soups and stews, beans, on tacos, in potato salad, let your imagination run wild...it's fantastic!! Wings   for the sauce butter, Crystal Hot Sauce (oh yes, it's the best, too!) Chipotle Tabasco, a squeeze or two of lime and some garlic powder or  fresh garlic minced...toss your wings in this and you'll be HAPPY! if you heat up the sauce first and then stir in the cold butter, it will thicken up and cling to the wings even better. Enjoy!
