I am absolutely amazed with the taste of this product. I'm not too much of a fan of the Caramel Dip, but the syrup is equally as delicious as its Pancake counterpart. I highly recommend it, but ask your local grocers to see if they're willing to carry it. This is far too expensive than what I paid going to my grocery store.
