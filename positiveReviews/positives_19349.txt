How in the world do you review a gummy worm?  Well, I think it's all about expectations.          Was it huge?  Yes.  About 3 feet.     Was it bigger than I thought it would be?  Without a doubt.     Was it big and heavy enough that it was slightly comical?  Absolutely.          Consistency: Consistency is on par with other gummy candy.  In fact, I the texture is slightly tougher than the average American gummy.  It reminded me of gummy candy that I got in Germany.          Taste: While not as concentratedly sour as candy much smaller, the sour green flavor is definitely detectable.  And pleasant as well!          This product is exactly what you'd expect.  It is an eye opening jaw dropper that looks cool, weighs more than you'd think (4 lbs), tastes good, and will probably last a month of consistent eating.
