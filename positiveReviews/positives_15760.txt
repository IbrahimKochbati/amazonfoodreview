They aren't kidding! The albacore smells better than people food! My cats LOVE this cat food, and it is gluten free, so there is no worries about our cats getting poisoned! Great stuff! I'll likely be buying this cat food instead of their regular  and, especially for treats. If your cat likes a lot of sauce, there is plenty of it here, and it's not just water. If you want to give your cats a healthy canned food, this is the best one by far that I've fed them... Better than even the high end fancy foods. The cans are small, but the nutrition is better than most cat foods. They even use yellow fin tuna for the albacore! 1st rate cat food!
