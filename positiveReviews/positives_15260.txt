I really do like the Healthy Baby Baby foods.  I buy them with the Amazon Prime free shipping.  I also "subscribe and save".  I get 16 at a time.  The baby doesn't mine eating the same flavor each day for 16 days, but at the end of 16 days, he smells like cat food.  Most cats will run at the sound of a can opener, mine have learned to listened for the tearing of the pouch.  If you get this flavor and your baby hates it  you can always use it as cat food.  The texture of this particular product is pretty good for my now 10 month old.  I got a Sprout product with lentils in it and he spit the lentils out.  It is kind of hit and miss with the textures of these foods because their rating has no consistency.  That's my one  and constant  complaint.
