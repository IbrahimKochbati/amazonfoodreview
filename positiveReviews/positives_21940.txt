I have NEVER been disappointed with Tinkyada gluten free pastas.  WE have tried several varieties and I have loved the performance of all of them.  (The lasagna noodles are the most difficult but that is not what this review is about.)          I live at about 5000 feet above sea level and I cook the noodles in boiling water for the amount of time listed on the package.  I always set a timer and do not rely on "trying it" like I used to with semolina pastas.  When the timer goes off test the pasta and set timer for another minute if needed.  I never have to cook longer than the time listed on the bag.  The pasta holds shape perfectly and is an awesome addition to our gluten free pantry.  I love the gluten free variety offered by Tinkyada and the amazing prices offered on amazon.com!
