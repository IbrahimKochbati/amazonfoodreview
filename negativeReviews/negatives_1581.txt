The SWITCH ORANGE TANGERINE SODA doesn't taste too bad and it is carbonated, but the taste reminded me of orange juice that went sour. You know, when the O.J. has gone way past the expiration date and you gulp some and it has that bitter acidic taste.          Anyway, the soda is made from a combination of apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola juice, and doesn't add sugar, corn syrup, preservatives or artificial colors. It's also gluten free so that's good news for those who are trying to watch what they eat and drink.          The 8.3 ounce can is smaller than the standard 12 ounce can of soda and maybe it just takes a couple of tries to get used to the flavor.          Like I said, not bad but I'll stick with regular diet soda. But for a healthier alternative for soda lovers, I suggest trying one of the "SWITCH SODAS" OR any naturally flavored sparkling water.
