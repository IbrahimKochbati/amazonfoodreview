I love sugarless Bubble Yum because it has a nice strong texture, pieces are big enough that only one is needed, even for blowing bubbles, and the flavor lasts for a very long time.  In fact, I don't think I have ever needed a new piece because of loss of flavor.  Also, the flavor is very bubble gummy.
