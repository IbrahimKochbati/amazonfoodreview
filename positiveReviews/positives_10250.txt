This tray makes a perfect monkey platter for a toddler! Before purchasing this I was putting items directly onto my son's booster tray or using several small dishes, but this is a way better solution. There are seven deep wells, perfectly toddler sized. I can put a few heaping spoonfuls of yogurt in one, some  own rice in another, diced squash, some chopped apple, steamed spinach.. a bit of this and a bit of that. The monkey platter approach is a great way to encourage small children to try a wide variety of foods without overwhelming them and this tray is PERFECT. It's also cute and easy to clean.
