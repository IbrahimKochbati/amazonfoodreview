I'm biased.  My morning oatmeal is usually mixed in with coffee or near expresso strength coffee.  That way my moring meal can get a nice little jolt.  I didn't think this stuff was bad.  Then again my tastes are like a coyote & I'll munch on near anything.  But Quaker used to make the standard for instant oatmeal.  This stuff is O.K.  I like nearly any instant oatmeal.  So, this stuff is a fair value, it tastes good, and it's not a bad price considering.  I'll buy it again & don't think it's a bad product.
