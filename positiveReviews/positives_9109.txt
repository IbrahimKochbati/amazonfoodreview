Such a great little item to have in your cake cookie decorating collection. Adds great accents. Silver is probably my most used color because it can be added to so many colors.          Highly recommend you check your local Michaels or Joann's. Amazon usually has competitive prices but these are $3 4 at your local craft store   $8 is WAYY overprice on amazon.com.
