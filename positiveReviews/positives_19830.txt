Grapefruit gummies I've purchased before have all been really hard and chewy   the Haribo are soft and exactly like a gummy candy.  Each piece is small enough to eat in one bite, if you like, but big enough to take two or three; they have a tart taste which is mitigated by a dusting of sugar on the outside.  I think the sugar coating makes them just a little too sweet for me, but for texture and general flavor, these are the best grapefruit gummies I've had!
