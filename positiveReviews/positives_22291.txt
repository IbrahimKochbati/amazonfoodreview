Good Product.... Quick delivery.  I hate that I have to type at least 20 words for my review to count.          This product has super powers, on eating this my 6 year old grew forearms like popeye, and beat up the school bully.  My 2 year old passed gas and the diaper exploded in the car.  It blocked my view, and I ran off the road and I was ejected from and then pinned under the car.  My wife who had also sampled this super food was able to rescue me from the car.          The moral is eat this food, so you can save yourself from all your daily mishaps, and perhaps when we see the person responsible for making the comments require at least 20 words when 4 would have done, you can pull their underwear up over their head, and punch them silly.
