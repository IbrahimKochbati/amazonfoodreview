Acid is, oddly, the most benign of flavor amplifiers.  Think about it.  Sugar? Salt? Alcohol? Fat?  I do not mean in any way to be a food fear monger. I merely point out that first glance, acid seems more menacing than any of those.  For kitchen magic, acid rules mine.  A splash of lime, coffee in my red eye gravy, all those wonderful vinegars are lining my shelf.          Now the resurgence of an ancient and feisty acid, verjuice.  It has largely been neglected outside of wine country.  Most of mine comes from odd places in Bordeaux.  But you can get this fine find from Fallot, a most reliable maker from Burgundy.  You may know their fine mustards.  This is one verjuice which you may confidently measure others against.  Why?          Verjuice had not had modern marketing to spread its unique quality and flavor.  Sour grapes, you say? Exactly.  What do you do when the weather is so crumby that the grapes are not sweet enough for wine?  A good excuse to press verjuice.          Now for the bad news.  Verjuice is in resurgence.  As with all things rediscovered, many are busy "helping" its image with a facelift.  Culinary botox.  From California to Australia, everybody is getting into the act; thin or flabby faux verjuice is hitting the shelves.  All cute and flouncy, it has not the backbone and courage to do the heavy lifting in the kitchen.  You might as well pour lemonade over your grilled salmon.          But here is the acidic glory.  Taste it alone.  Now you can compare anything you might run across.  Some vineyards make the veritable verjuice.  Next, try poaching gently some fresh and really ripe fruit.  It loves to be swirled into your beurre blanc.  Whip some into your best cream.  Deglaze the roasting pan for some old time gravy.  Nutmeg and a nice five pepper blend (don't forget the allspice) are all you need for your steamed vegetables.  "What did you do?"  And you can tell the truth.
