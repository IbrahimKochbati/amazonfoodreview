Well I bought these to have a "Food Tripping Party" with my wife. I had a spread before us of lemons, limes, strawberries, blackberries, oranges, and grapefruit. We both started with half a pill each as per the reviews here. I then took a bite of a lemon. I guess is was sweeter but not by much, though I was able to eat it. It was like a sweet + tart food which I guess is because of the acid in the fruit. I then ate another half of pill because the instructions that came with the pills stated to take a full one. I tried again. It made the lemons bearable but not super sweet. You would not be able to eat an entire be happy. I went onto the other fruits and the same thing. You could still taste the tart with a sweet aftertaste. My wife said this, "Well it makes it so you can eat lemons, but who wants to sit around eating lemons all day?" I'm disappointed BUT the price was cheap enough and it was a fun thing to do with my wife. I'll pawn these off on friends and see what they say. To all the people who threw parties and raved and raved about how everyone loved them, my guess is that they didn't want you to feel bad.
