These organic cookies are my 2 dogs' MOST FAVORITE. The cookies are baked crunchy and flavorful. Because they are small sized and easy to  eak with your finger tips, I use those to train my new puppy, too. They are USDA certified organic. My 18 month Lab Hound mix has been crazy about these cookies, and now my 3 month Lab Pit mix puppy has found there's more yummy stuff than the dog food he's fed everyday.          I always  ing handful of those cookies when we go out for walk. When we visit a dog run, without fail, I become the instant star owner in the park, as all other dogs run toward me, asking for something in my pocket. These cookies must smell so o o good to all the dogs, I bet!
