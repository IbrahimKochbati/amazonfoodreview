I don't eat beef jerky, and I wanted to buy some for a Christmas gift.  I read all of the reviews at Amazon.com and decided that Jack Links would be the best purchase.  It came nicely packaged, but there is liquid in the packaging   a lot of it.  If you turn the packaging upside down, the movement of the liquid is obvious.  So now I have to pay to return soupy beef jerky and buy a different type.          Three days since my original review.  Amazon cannot accept returns of food items, so it kindly replaced the beef jerky.  The replacement also has liquid in it.  It's not fat, but a liquid as described above.  This time, I'm asking for a refund.
