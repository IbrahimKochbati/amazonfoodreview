We had high expectations for this product but the chowder was only average.  Warming instructions are vague as to the amount of milk and or butter to blend in with the soup mix. We found the flavor to be bland and one dimensional, even with as little as 1 2 cup of added whole milk.          The package of six cans contained three dented cans.  Two of them were severely dinged on the seamlines and had to be tossed.  For this reason, we will no longer purchase can goods through the mail.
