When I try to describe the taste and sensation to friends, the best I can come up with is that it tastes like lime and molasses. Wonderful flavoring agent for  oths, and I also use it quite a bit with sweet potatoes, tomato dishes and anything with chicken. I use it in much higher concentrations than what they suggest. There are some instant soup mixes using tamarind, and if you are new to the condiment, you may want to try them to experiment with how best to use it. I also looked to Madhur Jaffrey's excellent "World of the East Vegetarian Cooking" for inspiration.
