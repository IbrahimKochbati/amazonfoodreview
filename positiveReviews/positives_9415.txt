Harissa is a very spicy North African red pepper paste condiment, typically made at home or bought in jars. This is an item to use sparingly,  ushed on grilled meat or vegetables, or mixed into sauces and marinades.          I had bought a tube of this  and at a specialty store in Berkeley, but was not able to find it again. The other  and I could find was adequate, but the texture was too pasty and the flavor not so fresh. I was delighted to find Le Cabanon offered for sale here. The shipping price for one tube was in my opinion prohibitive, but the product stays fresh indefinitely in the sealed tubes, so I had no qualms about buying six at a time. This  ought the price per tube to about a dollar less than I'd paid in the store!
