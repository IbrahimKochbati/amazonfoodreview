I am a long time veg occasional vegan.  I have been looking for a vegan jerky product for a while.  I forgot that I ordered the seitan not soy jerky.  Service was excellent   my order arrived within three days of ordering   and I live in AZ! I was a bit taken aback by the texture    but after trying one I really liked it.  good taste very digestible and satisfying.Flavor is not as strong as you might expect for teryiaki but it is pleasing.  I will definitely try other flavors.
