I was surprised at the ingredient list and "100% natural" stamped on the side, because this drink tasted just like a compeletely artifical energy drink. This is going to be a short review for me, because I don't really have much else to say. I could barely tell it was orange, because as with energy drinks it just tastes like an amalgamation of fruits. My wife was especially confused  she gets sick at the smell of drinks like Monster, and she had the exact same reaction here.          I know this isn't an energy drink, but for the life of me, I just can't reconcile the taste with the ingredients. If you're the sort of person who drinks some fresh fruit juice and thinks "I really wish this tasted more like a completely artifical enegry drink instead of natural fruit juice", then this is the product you've been dreaming of.
