I use this for my grandmother who is 88, dementia, swallowing problems. It has a fair amount of protein in it. I mix it in with other things that have a stronger flavor, like cheddar cheese soup and you really can't taste it. It does make the texture of the food a little different, a bit grainy I guess.
