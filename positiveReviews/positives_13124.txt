I have 4 cats and was spending an amazing amount of money shopping for them at Petsmarts and Petcos locally. I wish I would have discovered this food earlier. This 40lb bag lasts us nearly 2 months! If you order it new from Amazon you don't even have to worry about the shipping, it's free (and for something that weighs 40lbs that's a good thing!)          The ingredients aren't that great but at least it's not Corn or grains as the first ingredient..so it's passable. I mix the dry food with higher quality canned food to give them that extra boost of protein and flavor since my cats tend to get bored of the same food over and over. I find if I mix it with different flavors of canned food they NEVER get tired of it (it can even be a small can, nothing fancy if you can't afford the high quality stuff).          The kibble is large in size but I actually prefer it that way..when the cats come in from a long day outside they are ravenous and the large size of the kibble helps them slow down and actually  eak it apart..I have never seen them throw up a hairball from this food like they used to from other dry foods and that is saying A LOT! I got so used to wet messes on the floor and now there are none! Add in the the wet food from time and time (not daily) and the kibble becomes easier to eat for them. It keeps their teeth very clean in it's pure form though.          All in all I have ordered this bag 3 times now this year since I discovered it and it's saved me a lot of money and a lot of time and my cats are not overweight or lacking in any way. No allergies, shiny coats and full of energy..I simply can't find a reason to complain.
