I feed prowl because it is a high quality healthy food that does not  eak my budget.  It is much cheaper than other premium wet foods (Wellness, Weruva, etc), and my cat seems to like it.  The only downside to prowl is that, since it is dehydrated, you must mix it with water and wait 10 minutes before serving.  My kitten meows at me the entire time.     I started my cat on Prowl because my vet offered a free sample. She ate it right away with no problems.  However, she'd only ever had "healthy" food, so I was not transitioning from an unhealthy grain filled (but addictively tasty) food.     It is very easy to digest and may be a solution for cats with digestion problems.  I recommend (like another reviewer) that you order a free sample and give it a try.
