My two dogs both love pigs ears but I rarely buy them because they can be expensive and (I'm not sure if it is true or not) I've heard that some pigs ears are preserved with formaldehyde.  I decided to try to find a nice alternative to pigs ears and I came across Better Than Ears. The price was fantastic and I ordered a package of them right away.          One thing I thought was great about the Better Than Ears was that it is a very clean and mess free treat, it also has a nice aroma that my younger dog went wild for.  My older dog is a bit more picky about treats and she wasn't too impressed by the Better Than Ear that I gave her.  She just guarded it for a long while before she ultimately decided to eat it.          The one thing that I am docking a star for on this product is that it doesn't last nearly as long as a real pig's ear.  The material is very soft and easily eaten and I was hoping for a treat that takes a little while longer for my dogs to eat, in the way that natural pigs ears do.  I've been freezing my Better Than Ears, which makes them a little tougher and last a little longer, but not by much.
