I actually thought I was buying the Van Houtte vanilla coffee k cups that I usually purchase and I overlooked the description of "light." It certainly is. You can barely taste the vanilla. It's good coffee, but if you're looking for a real vanilla flavor, go with the Van Houtte k cups that are in a darker yellow package.
