When I recently started using K cups, wasn't sure that the quality or the intensity would be up to par.  I wound up trying many of the standard k cups which for the most part were ok but not great.  The Barista Prima French Roast is well worth trying.  Very intense and flavorful. No more concerns about throwing away my old coffee pot.
