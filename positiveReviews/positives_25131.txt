Buying pet food can and is a tricky proposition.  This review is about dog food, Purina One, Smartblend, to be specific.  You can spend hours; no, days actually, researching various dog foods on line and via various publications.  Name a  and and you will find many who will defend it right down to the matt.  On the other hand, the same  and will have its distracters; folks who absolutely hate the stuff.  If you care about your dog (and you really should not have a dog if you don't care about it or them), then you need to do your research and do what you feel is best for your animal.  Now let me make one statement before I write the review...it is a rather important statement:          If you dog gets sick on any given dog food, then for goodness sakes throw the stuff out, stop feeding your dog that food, and try something different!          We have, at this time, four dogs.  They range from 9 pounds to 35 pounds and from two years old to 14 years old.  My wife and I have had dogs all of our lives; cats too, but we are primarily dog people.  We have been using Purina products for years and have been quite happy with the results.  We have healthy dogs and we go to great lengths to keep them that way.          At present, and for the past four or five years, we have been using Purina ONE, Smartblend   Lamb & Rice Formula.  We have had great results with it.  There has been no weigh loss nor any weight gains   as long as we keep them on this stuff.  The only problems we do have is that our dogs absolutely LOVE people food and they are garbage guts when it comes to finding delicious "things" in the yard and in the woods.  People food and "things" usually  ing on a case of diarrhea or in some cases, vomiting.  We take care that this does not happen but quite often we find the dogs are much smarter than we are and they are all four most certainly skilled beggars.          Purina, as far as I can find, is manufactured here in the U.S.  Yes, they are owned by the Swiss company Nestle, but it would seem that the food is made here in the U.S.  Someone correct me if I am wrong please.          If you compare the stuff in this food with that of other  ands, it stacks up quite well.  All of our dogs prefer this food over other  ands we have tried from time to time (more about that later), of course it must be remembered that all four are quite happy with four day old road killed possum   if they can get it.  The lamb seems to have a more soothing effect on them and they do not seem to have the problems digesting it as they do other meat additives.  Now don't get me wrong, they would prefer that we served them baked chicken (their absolute most favored food on earth) each day, but that ain't a going to happen!          It should be noted that any time you change dog food  ands or dog food mixes, you are going to have some digestive problems with your dogs.  It will almost always cause diarrhea or loose stools.  If you must change  ands or contents, do it slowly, mixing the new  and with the old gradually over several days.  This is a pain, but it is worth it.          We buy this stuff in the 18 pound bags here locally and the price is a bit higher, per pound, than we find here on Amazon...although that varies from month to month. If you have Amazon Prime then the shipping is not a factor to fret about.          Overall, we are happy with this food and will be unless we learn differently or if our dogs start doing poorly. There are other dog foods of equal quality out there and the challenge is to find one that suits your particular dog's needs. This stuff does the job for us.          Don Blankenship     The Ozarks
