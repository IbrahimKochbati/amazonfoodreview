This drink is a nice change of pace from soda.  It is an all NATURAL beverage with NO JUNK IN IT.  It is made only of juice and carbonation and that is it.  We couldn't believe it when we tried it!  It tastes really great and if I were looking for a drink without caffeine I would choose this.  The Switch is really tasty and satisfying.  I also liked that the carbonation is not quite as heavy as some sodas.  My family of four tried it and we all decided that we would buy this  and again.
