Loved the distinct flavor of Stash Organic Chai Black and Green Tea and, when I could not find it, finally purchased the Earl Grey Black and Green.  Found it okay, but nothing unusual or extremely tasty.  Will not repurchase and will continue to locally watch for the Organic Chai Black and Green Tea.
