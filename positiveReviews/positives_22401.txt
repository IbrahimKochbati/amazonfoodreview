I have used about 5 or 6 boxes (24 count) of this  and and have really liked the flavor and the the freshness in every order that I received. I have only tried one other  and and thought it was stale and did not like the flavor. For me it is not to salty in fact I add a little salt before I pop it. I use one or two a day and always have a bowl of popped corn out for my grand kids. When ever they come over they always head to the snack shack (a little stand alone cupboard)for a treat. We try to have healthy treats but I think the pop corn is probably more healthy than the granola bars,crackers,cookies or dried fruit snacks and they seem to like the pop corn best. The only problem or maybe a benefit is that I have to floss a lot more.
