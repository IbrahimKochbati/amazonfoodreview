With the temps this Summer being in the 90's and 100's, it's been 1 2 a year since I turned on the oven and baked anything. I love to have a small sweetie to snack on in the afternoons to provide a pick me up and this does the job nicely. I enjoy it coming in an individually wrapped package so I didn't have to have an entire box of cookies go stale in the humidity. Much healthier than I normally like my snacks, it was still very sweet and tasty and actually stayed with me much longer than a regular high fat cookie. I plan on keeping more of these around so I can toss one into my work bag in the morning and munch on it when I feel the need for "sweet".
