I ordered this ghee after reading Ramiel Nagel's "Cure Tooth Decay". He claims regular use of high vitamin butter oil from grass fed cows feeding on fast growing summer grass not only adds much needed vitamin A to the diet, but also adds something he calls the "Activator X Factor" or something like that, which is supposed to cause your body to remineralize your teeth. Nagel recommends a $40 jar of the oil, but this ghee seems just as good. It's organic, high in fat soluble vitamin A, and delicious. It's also from cows fed on that fast growing grass, and it has the warm yellow coloring to prove its vitamin content. It feels good to eat. Unlike regular butter, this stuff reminds my tummy of a kind of nutrition it has wanted for years but didn't know how to ask for. This is the kind of nutrition the healthy rural Swiss praised the lord for. 20 points from me! And it is way less than $40.
