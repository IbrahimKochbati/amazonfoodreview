Are you looking for a relatively healthy option for soda?  well, look no further!  This product delivers that slightly fizzy drink you remember from the soda fountain days and a lot of flavor.  It also goes back to a serving size that used to be considered normal!          Here is a quick summary of the things I like, and the things that I did not like as much:          First, the positive:          The flavor is very much forward and does taste exactly like what is described on the label. In this particular flavor, that means Kiwi and Berry.  Both flavors are definately distinguishable, which is very nice!          The carbonation is such that it will not cause you to burp as you drink it.  It seems that many of the sodas out today have taken carbonation to the extreme.          The serving size is finally such that you can enjoy it without feeling that you need to drink more than you really wanted.  I do not know about you, but I had it beat into my head at an early age not to waste food and I find that I will unconcsiouly drink all of anything that I open.  Not really a good thing when the smallest drink size is 12 ounces and most are much larger than that!  Yes, I know you can always pour out what is more than want, but how often does that happen?          The can size makes it very easy to pack in a lunch,  ief case, computer case, etc.  It is also easy to carry when you go for a hike (just remember to pack out the empty).  Speaking of packing out the empty, the aluminum that the can is made from is easily recyclable.          Now for the downside:          The pricing on this product is very high.  Crystal Geyser has essentially the same product and is priced much lower.  We have been buying Crystal Geyser since 2005 and it runs about 85 cents for a 12 oz bottle.  That is just the right size to split between two people.          The number of calories contained in this drink is also quite high at 135 calories for 8.3 fluid ounces.  As a comparison, Crystal Geyser is 130 calories for 12 fluid ounces.  That is about 50% more calories in this drink!  This can be a real issue especially if you find that you need two cans of this beverage instead of the single serving size.  As an additional comparson, a serving size of Coca cola Classic is 97 calories for 8 ounces.  So, do not think that drinking this instead of Coke will help you with a diet!!          I have a bit of trouble with the label stating that the product is 100% fuit juice since they add carbonated water to it.  I think the way they get away with their statement is that they used concentrated juice blends (water removed from fruit juice) and then add back carbonated water to reconstitute it.  That is a fine line, but I think they would be better served by using the same statement that Crystal Geyser uses, 70% fruit juice.  That 70% is fruit juice concetrate.  The remaining 30% is carbonated water.          Having to buy a case of 24 is also a real pain if you do not have a lot of storage.  Most other products come in packages of 4 or 6 (if not as singles) which can make it much easier to store.          Ok, so overall, this is a good product that has good flavor and comes in a reasonable size container.  It makes a nice addition when you are looking for something to drink, just do not think there are fewer calories in this drink than in soda!          The reason I gave this product a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the calorie count, the price, the volume you need to order, and their labeling (stating that a product is 100% juice means just that, no additives and that is not correct since they add carbonated water.  I will give them the vitamin additives).
