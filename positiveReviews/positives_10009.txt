Many coffee containers, whether they're bags or cans, tell you what you'll be getting inside.  Although there is ample advertising and promotional information printed on the bag, I was left clueless as to where the arabica beans were grown.  That's why I called this "mystery coffee."  My usual  ew is made from freshly ground, all Colombian grown 100% arabica beans from a top rated coffee supplier.          Since I'm a serious coffee drinker, I would not usually buy such small bags of it.  An 11 ounce bag will make about three full 10 cup pots of coffee for me at the strength that I usually  ew (1 level tablespoon full of ground coffee per cup  ewed which is half again more than Melitta recommends).  Melitta used such a strong adhesive to seal the bag, I had to nearly destroy the top of the bag to get into it.  Once opened, the bag yielded a hearty, pleasant fragrance of freshly ground coffee.  I expected that it would  ew good tasting coffee with a bold taste and I was not disappointed.          Melitta recommends using their  and of filters because they've ground the coffee finely to extract the maximum flavor, but my usual store  and filters worked just fine.  If your coffee preference is for bold but not bitter over mild you'll probably find this coffee to be satisfying; more like Starbucks than Dunkin' Donuts coffee.          Ultimately choosing a favorite  and of coffee, for most people, is a matter of taste and cost.  This collection is certainly worth considering if you like your  ew to be potent and to actually taste like coffee instead of like something else or wish to share this tasty coffee experience by giving one of these small bags as a gift.  I enjoyed this coffee but wouldn't buy such small bags of it regularly for my own consumption.  My top rated bean coffee comes in more convenient packaging and costs me less.
