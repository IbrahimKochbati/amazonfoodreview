This coffee is absolutely fantastic.  Yes   it's true that it's not the whole beans waiting to be ground, and I usually grind my own, but the flavor is truly amazing.     It has notes of chocolate and spice.  It is rich and so so tasty. I'm quite honestly a coffee snob and a bit of a foodie.     Of course if you like folgers, this isn't going to work for you... move along lol.          I've been running it in my espresso   cappuccino machine.     Just make sure to pack it extra hard so that it flows properly.     Add some raw sugar and a little half and half cream.     You then have an incredible tasting coffee.          I liked this so much after my first box, that I ordered 3 more boxes.     Each box comes with 2 mini bags in it that have co2 reducers.
