Funny thing is I dont like beans...or rather the texture of beans. I tried this yummy soup over 2 years ago and     it is so good I have a 8oz cup daily. The soup is puree'd with no bean texture. The black bean and mild to medium hot spice's and flavors ...with a hint of cilatro is a very satisfying soup. Think would make a great layer to the traditional 7 layer taco dip as well. Only suggestion is to slightly lower the sea salt content   although it is not nearly as high as most soups out there. Best soup ever!!
