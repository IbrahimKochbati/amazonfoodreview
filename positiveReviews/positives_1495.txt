I bought these to try them out and for the most part it was a success. There are 6 different flavors of chips. 5 of them were really good. The last one though was not. The salt and vinegar ones were very vinegary and it was too bitter for our tastes. Maybe some people like it but not us. All in all though, they were mostly very good in both taste and caloric content.     I would definitely buy a box with the flavors that I wanted.
