I don't eat eggs, so oatmeal is my warm comfort food of choice for  eakfast.  Maple Brown Sugar is one of my "go to" flavors   it disappears from the variety pack first and it's the one I seek out at the store (along with apple).  I'm also big on cutting costs at the grocery store, so I avoid name  ands that aren't truly worth the extra money.  So, the important thing for me is how this oatmeal compares to the cheap stuff.          There really is no comparison.  The store  ands are a real disappointment.  The oats don't absorb the water properly.  The flavoring doesn't dissolve.  The texture is like someone threw confetti in hot water that was used to boil okra.  The taste is the cloying side.  On the other hand, Quaker absorbs the water, the flavoring dissolves, the texture is nicely bumpy and three dimensional, and the  own sugar is just enough.          Don't go cheap on oatmeal or you'll be sorry.  If you want to save a buck on your oatmeal, buy the real stuff in bulk on Amazon.
