I usually pan sear chicken and then throw it in the oven.  Adding spices before I put the chicken on the pan and during the process allows for a good amount of opportunity to make the chicken to my liking.  With this product, you place a clean, washed piece of chicken in a zip lock bag, and shake it with the ingredients found in this Shake n Bake pouch.  Problem here is it's hard to get a full, even coating around the chicken and just putting it into the oven means you're missing out on some of what you'll get if you are used to a different preparation.  Now, overall this isn't a bad product just a limited one that you can use if you're running low on time in terms of preparation.  Seasoning wise, it's at times hit or miss, you'll get some taste in there but it again depends on how you like to prepare your chicken and with what flavors.
