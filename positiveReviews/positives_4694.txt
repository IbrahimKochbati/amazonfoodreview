Found this product discounted at a good price at slickdeals.net for about $10.          First time drinking this stuff since I bought it.  I was blown away at how awesome it taste.  This was my first time trying something other than the Nestle  and cocoa (other than the few times I ordered cocoa at a cafe).          Has a nice blend of mocoa cocoa and doesn't taste too sweet like what I'm used to with Nestle.          Definitely giving this a thumbs up.
