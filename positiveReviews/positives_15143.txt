Pretty scary reading some of these reviews. I learned about the switch to new formulas from Canidae quite a while back but stuck with it. I have a German Shepard and a cat and both went through the switch just fine. What baffles me is how there can be so many great experiences listed here and then see those bad ones. I wonder if some of these innocent little dogs didn't have something else going on instead of getting bad food. Maybe it just doesn't work the same for everyone's dog. Anyway, my kids are very active for their age and doing great on Canidae and Felidae. It seems to be the best combination of high quality ingredients and reasonable price out there. I'm a big fan and receommend both to anyone. In fact, my cat loves the new formula even more than the old. She's getting a little fat.  : )
