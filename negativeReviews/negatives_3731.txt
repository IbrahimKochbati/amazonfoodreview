Long time Keurig user and lifetime coffee drinker.  Breakfast Blend is for the most part a plain cup of coffee.  Light and smooth, but with a slight bitterness at the end.  I still prefer Donut Shop as a light everyday go to coffee choice, but wanted to try a box of Green Mountain BB.  Probably won't purchase again.  No one in the house has stopped me and said, "thats a great cup of coffee".  It's just plain and blah.  I'll probably struggle to finish the box honestly.
