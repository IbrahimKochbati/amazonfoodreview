The drink tasted  pretty good (a bit like liquid white chocolate), but at 370 calories a serving can you want to be doing some pretty serious exercise as that represents about 20% of a typical calorie intake. it also contains 1.5 grams (8% RDA) of saturated fat and 1.5 mg (5% RDA) of cholesterol, so you might need to consider this if you are watching your intake of these. the main ingredients  are water, sugar  (28g) and protein (20g).          If you are doing some serious training this is a compact source of energy to keep you going.          I dropped a star because of the saturated fat, cholesterol and high calorie content.
