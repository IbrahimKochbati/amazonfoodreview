When I got this product for my 4 year old Chihuahua, he immediately loved it! It's a stimulating toy that challenges him unlike his usual squeaky toys. I really love the fact that this item is washable and the material doesn't rip easily like his furry toys! Very durable even for my destructive Chihuahua!
