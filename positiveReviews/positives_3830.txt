Out of all the  ands of bully sticks, True Chews has to be one of me and my dog's favorites.  My favorite because they are not messy, they dont  eak apart as easy as some of the cheaper  ands, and they do not smell!  My pup loves it because it doesn't make him sick, doesn't give him gas, and gives him hours days of fun.  Their whole lineup is great and highly recommended if you have a puppy dog with a sensitive tummy.  FYI My pup is currently 5 months old and is a 8lb Shihpoo.  I gave it one less mark only because they are one of the more expensive  ands and that they are a tad hard to find locally.
