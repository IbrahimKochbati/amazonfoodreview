You wouldn't know from looking at it that this is a low acid coffee; the grounds are the same black shade as any other dark roast and just as fragrant. It  ews up just as dark with the distinctive French roast aroma of normal coffees. I normally can't drink French roasts because they are too harsh on my stomach, but although this one tasted like a dark roast it went down as smoothly and agreeably as a light roast!          If you're a Panera Bread fan, this reminds me strongly of their dark roast   except that I can drink this!          I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys rich coffee but could do without the acid. It arrived very promptly, and I found the package size shape to be ideal for both travel and gift baskets.
