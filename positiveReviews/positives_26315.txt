I received a free sample of Science Diet for our Papillon as  part of a Bzz Agent.  I was a little hesitant to try it because I had heard some stories from others who used it and were too happy. We tried it out and our dog is very happy. With her old dog food we would feed her in the morning and she wouldn't never want to eat until later in the day. Now since we have  switched she is real excited when we are getting the food out, she eats it right away.
