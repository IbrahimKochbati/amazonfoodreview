Rest assured, this tea has a natural tasting pear flavor.  Although this tea does included real pear pieces, they also use a pear flavoring to amplify the taste (apparently  ewing pear pieces doesn't kick it up quite enough.) It's been my experience that some pear flavor is pretty awful (ala absolut pears,) this stuff is really good, and quite flavorful.
