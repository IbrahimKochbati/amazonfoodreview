This is the first time I have used land mined salt.  I usually use salt from various sea sources.  After reading several reviews here on Amazon I decided to try this salt.  I was very pleasantly surprised the first time I tasted the salt. The flavor was fresh and subtle.  Not like the salt you usually buy in the grocery stores. Plus it has a lot of trace minerals your body needs.  I highly recommend this salt.
