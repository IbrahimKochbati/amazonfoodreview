I've been enjoying this particular blend of chai for quite a while.  I actually don't even want to add milk or sweeteners.  I think it is mellow all on its own but could understand the appeal for some to use milk.  I'm not a fan of sweet teas so I wouldn't want the sugar or honey traditionally served with chai.  I've even used one tea bag with a bunch of regular tea bags to make some iced tea that's quite nice in the summer.  Folks who have tried it who often want sweetener in their tea tell me it's not necessary with this combination.  Hot, it makes a great mug to hug.  Yumm!
