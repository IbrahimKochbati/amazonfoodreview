This is definitely a "Girl's Alcoholic Slushy."  There are 6 different flavors, and you can use any wine you choose. The package directions are for an entire blender of slush. I have found that using a Tablespoon or two at a time makes just enough for one person.  Good stuff.  Have not found anyone who does not like this product.
