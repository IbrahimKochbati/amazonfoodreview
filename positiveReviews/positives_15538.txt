I was a little worried about buying a bonsai tree, sight unseen, especially since it was to be a Christmas gift for a very good friend. Needless worry! The bonsai tree was perfect; its  anches were a deep green, it was planted in a black ceramic bonsai dish and included a rock. It had been packaged very well so that the soil was still damp and no  anches injured during transport. The company included a sheet of very helpful instructions and a free bottle of liquid fertilizer. It's always nice to do business with a company that cares about its products, and this company certainly does.
