Some of the other reviewers noted that they still had reactions to this product.  Look at the ingredients   any sort of hydrolyzed vegetable protein contains MSG.  This is a trick used by most companies in the food industry.  There are like 25 different names for MSG  or free glutamate containing substances, and they just hide it under a different name  (Google "Other Names for MSG" and you will be appalled).  Unfortunately the FDA does not require any real disclosure on labels   MSG can also be labeled simply as "spices" or "natural flavors."  It's safe to go ahead and assume that any flavor base seasoning such as that used here will have some type of MSG in it.  If another processed product such as flavor base is used in creating a new product, the ingredients in the component product (e.g., flavor base)are not required to be disclosed on the label. At least this manufacturer had the decency to list what was in the flavor base.
