Twelve six ounce packages equals 72 ounces, or 4.5 lbs. At $99, that's about $22 per pound.          I love pork roll as much as the next guy, but I wouldn't pay $22 a pound for a Wagyu standing rib roast, let alone pork scraps and spices.          For comparison, I can get a 6 lb roll at my local butcher shop for 17.99. Maybe I should start selling it online, lol.
