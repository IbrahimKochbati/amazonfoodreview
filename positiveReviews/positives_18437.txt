After reading the positive reviews about the variety packs, I picked up a bag at my local pharmacy.     At 100 calories per bag, this is a great snack that has a great taste and texture.          Like their bag states, they are not fried (bad for you),  they are not baked (no taste),  but "popped",  which gives them a slightly thicker but lighter and crispy taste.          They really are good.  Try a bag when you get a chance...if you haven't fully kicked all your junk food habits, you'll be glad you did!!
