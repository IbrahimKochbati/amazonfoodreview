Be sure the weather is cooler than 90 degrees when ordering.  I recieved mine right off of the UPS truck after they had been riding around at least half of a day and I recieved 6 bags of  hard melted dark chocolate.  I tried to contact Amazon but was unable to so ended up getting them from "Family Fun Shoppe".     Several days later I finally reached someone at Amazon and they took the time to straighten things out and refunded my money.  The gentleman I talked to was VERY nice, and the Pieces were are very tasty !          The problem was in the packaging...the second shipment had a small bag of dry ice in it.
