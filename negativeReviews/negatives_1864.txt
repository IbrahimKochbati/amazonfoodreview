Well I have tried many protein shakes and the taste is never been a problem for me but this was just horrible. It's GOOD for YOU but I just couldn't do it. It might be a good protein shake but it's extremely salty, i tried to drink it with other liquids to help the taste but every time it tasted worse and worse  ( too bad because I was looking forwards to see some results!!
