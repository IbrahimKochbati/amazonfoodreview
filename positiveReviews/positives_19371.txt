Okay, first off...if you can't stand regular Kraft Mac n Cheese don't bother with this product.  It's a LOT like regular Kraft MnC. It's been made with pasta with 50% whole grain.  Okay, nice compromise there; the 100% whole wheat pastas can be a bit grainy tasting but we know we all need less white flour in our diets.          Now, you're discerning 5 year old will probably be able to tell the difference between this and regular Kraft MnC and if he or she is uber picky about change, demands a certain  and, etc, well, then, this won't fool him.  But my kids ate it up fine.  The 9 year old barely noticed anything different (but she likes WW pastas), the 7 yo who normally doesn't like WW MnC ate it, although could tell it was WW.  The 2.5 year old just kept shoveling it in with his bare hands; I guess that means he liked it.          So in a nutshell, this is a worthwhile product to try if you're kids like Kraft MnC.  Same flavor as far as the sauce goes at least.  Same shape of noodles.  The fiber content for a serving of this is a respectable 5g, up from 1g for the tradtional stuff.  Not bad.          Of note is the fact that this product has only 6oz in a box as opposed to the 7.25oz in the traditional MnC.          For comparison's sake, I usually buy the Hogson Mill 100% WW Mac n Cheese.  I found this a bit milder tasting as far as wheaty ness goes; makes sense as Kraft uses a blend and HM is 100% whole wheat.  My picky eater will eat the Kraft but not the HM.  Hope that helps those of you with similar customers to feed.  I found the Kraft  and in my stores for a little less money than what it's being sold on Amazon for, but it might be hard to find in the stores for many people.
