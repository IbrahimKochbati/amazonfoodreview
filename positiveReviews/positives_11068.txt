Since many of these kaia snacks are hit and miss in flavor we bought a bag of about 5 different types of sunflower seeds and kale.. and only found 1 or 2 edible.  This was a better flavor and all was eaten.  We like that it's healthier and sprouted and the spice and cocoa really did a good job of creating a tasty snack.
