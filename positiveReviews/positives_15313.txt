This is a great coffee and tea maker. For convenience, it can't be beat. The quality of the  ew is fantastic. The variety of coffees and teas available for these are amazing. The water reservoir is easy to remove and fill.  The only down side to this particular model is that it only has a small cup (5.25oz) and small mug (7.25oz) settings.
