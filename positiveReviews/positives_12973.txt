Switch promises "A perfect balance between juice and carbonation" and it does live up to that as it delivers a fresh burst of stawberry and kiwi (the kiwi could have been a little stronger) and less carbonation then your regular sodas.  And it is a bonus that it is 100% Juice with no sugar added and no preservatives          My main drawback is the can as the tall thin can is a little too small and regular soda cans that are shorter and thicker and stream out better than the taller, thinner ones like Switch.
