My puppy didn't like going to his crate in the mornings and he would scream until he finally wore himself out.  Enter the kong stuff'n.  Ever since I started filling his kong up with this stuff in the mornings, he can't wait to get into the crate.  It's not like I use it to trick him in there either...he goes in on his own and sits until I give him the kong.  It's amazing!  Highly recommended!
