My 4 month old aussie loves these! Whenever he's fixated on something (like another dog while we're on a walk), I quickly wave it near his head to redirect his attention. It's one of the only treats that can  ing his focus back onto me. The other thing that works is hot dogs, but those aren't as easy to carry around as these freeze dried pieces. Because of the power it has over my dog, I mainly only use these treats for special training sessions when I need a high value reward (e.g., for recall training). They aren't especially smelly, but some dogs can smell them yards away. I've been followed many times at the dog park by doggies that smell the leftover powder in my jacket pocket!          The downside is that when I cut it into too small of a piece, it can crumble apart. Regardless, I think that these should definitely be diced down to a smaller size if one wants to use these treats as a training tool. The tub says that only a few should be fed per day, and it is to my understanding that too much liver isn't good for the dog. I've uploaded a picture of the feeding guidelines that are printed on the side of my 21oz tub and I'll also provide them here:                                         Weight........................3 Times Daily                                         10 30lbs....................1 to 2     30 60lbs....................2 to 4     over 60lbs..................4 to 6                                              So, for example, for a 60lb dog, about 4 pieces can be fed up to three times each day. Some people commented that only a couple can be fed to a large dog each day, but that information appears to be inconsistent with what is suggested on the tub. From my interpretation of the above table, the recommended daily amount is actually closer to a dozen than just a couple of pieces. I hope I'm not missing something here?          I've also uploaded a photo of the front of the 21oz tub showing that it is made in the USA. It has a May 2, 2014 expiration date printed on the underside of the container.          Hope this helps someone!
