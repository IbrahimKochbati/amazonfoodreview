I have been buying saffron from them since the past three years and they have never failed me. Have ordered like 8 of these 1 ounce tins for family and they keep asking for more.     The quality of the saffron is fantastic. You can tell by the smell. It is a little pricey, but it is how it is. Saffron is one of the most expensive spices out there and you get what you pay for. But the upside is, only a little is enough. We have even divided these into 5 portions and put them in a decorative case to give them as gifts after our daughter was born. People actually call to ask where we get our saffron from.          I am really happy with the product and will not try anything else.
