I had high hopes for this tea, but I have to agree with the reviewers who called it bland. I normally drink Twinings Ceylon OP, English Breakfast, or PG Tips, and those are all much more flavorful. Even using twice the tea I don't get as strong or dark a cup with three minutes of steeping. The tea itself looks fine and seems appropriately packaged. Davidson's seems like a great company (check out their website) and has lots of organic and Fair Trade teas, so I'll give them another shot with a different variety.
