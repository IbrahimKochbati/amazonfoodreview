WHEN WE TASTED THIS HONEY WE WERE QUITE DISAPPOINTED.          IT IS HONEY BUT WITH    NO    FLAVOR OF CLOVER.          TASTES LIKE MIXED WILD FLOWERS   OK BUT NOT CLOVER.          I  HAVE BEEN EATING CLOVER HONEY FOR 50 YEARS AND THIS IS NOT IT.          SAD THAT THE SELLER IS CHEATING FOLKS WITH THIS  " CLOVER "  HONEY.          LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR REAL CLOVER HONEY   DON'T TRUST ANNA'S HONEY.
