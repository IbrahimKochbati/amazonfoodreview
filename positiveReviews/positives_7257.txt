For the last year, our Tassimo machine has made only tea, as all the coffees are greatly lacking. Instead we buy imported German coffees which are the best in the world.          We use 3 Teas: #1, the Best is Twinings Earl Grey       #2, next best is Twinings Green Tea       #3, next best is Tazmo Awake Black Tea.          These teas are all great & if you can get some good natural North Dakota honey to put in them, you will like them even more.
