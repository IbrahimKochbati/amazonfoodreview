Ive bought these on a couple other occasions   and I swear they downsized the packages..They are good but a pack used to fill me now im not.I guess thats the trend  in ice cream and hormel chili the sizes have been trimmed so you wouldnt notice.  well looks like the Chinese are up to our tricks.  But they are still good just not the deal they used to be.
