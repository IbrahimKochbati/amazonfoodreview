mix 1 vanilla is really great and versatile stuff.  For starters, I love that the protein source is whey and not soy.  They also use real ingredients and are locally made in Boulder, CO.  mix 1 is great as a meal replacement, meal supplement, snack, recovery drink.  Since they don't require refridgeration, I keep on in my ski bag as a apres ski drink (I get hungry on the drive back into town and mix 1 works great).  I also do triathlons and find that mix 1 is great as a pre race meal and doesn't upset my stomach later on while I'm racing.  Finally, mix 1 is a perfect recovery drink after a long workout.
