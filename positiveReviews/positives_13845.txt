Based in part on the helpful reviews I found here, I tried a jar. I mixed it with jelly and came up with the perfect filling for pb&j sandwiches. Next up, Pad Thai with shirataki fettucini noodles. I find the flavor is good, and the powder a little gritty until mixed with something wet. When I travel on long road trips, I often carry pb&j makings and fruit for a quick, inexpensive and easy lunch. This will be a nice, lightweight addition to my travel food stores.
