I have been consuming these coconut bars for several months now after having purchased a small box at HomeGoods. These bars are delicious! They taste like the inside of a Mounds Bar. Only 2 ingredients: shredded coconut & rice syrup. I have purchased the 20 pack box through Amazon a few times. One of the latest boxes contained bars that tasted odd. They were darker in color and did not have the fresh coconut taste I was used to. Perhaps they were in a delivery truck that was hot and the oil in the coconut started to go rancid? Anyway, I contacted the company (Oskri) and their quality department was great. They provided a return shipping label for the unconsumed bars and shipped out a  and new box of 20 bars plus some additional samples to try. I have read some other reviewers that said they didn't like the taste of the bars. It's too bad they didn't try to contact the company because I'm sure they would have sent out a replacement product. I did notice though that the nutrition information has changed even though the weight & contents of the bar are the same. The calories, fat & sugar have all increased (180 cals vs. 246 cals, 11 grams vs. 14 grams, 14 grams vs. 29 grams). That is unfortunate, and I will have to cut down on my consumption. However, these bars really do taste yummy! They are soft, chewy, sweet & fresh. My husband and I love them, and I have gotten a few friends hooked on them too!
