The Jeremiah's 5lb bag of Ethiopian coffee is often sold out, so I've been looking for a good roast with similar value. I'm OK with a more medium roast, but this coffee seems more mild then I would have expected. Still a good deal, but I wish it had more flavor. In general, I've had good luck with Jeremiah's  and, although sometimes the bags are not as well sealed as they should be.
