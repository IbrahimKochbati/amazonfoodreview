I really expected to be disappointed, as I had never found a wheat free  ead in the health food store that wasn't dense or gummy.  This  ead was easy to make, and baked up light and fluffy in the oven, almost like white flour  ead would, only a little more moist. I added some hemp nuts, 2 tsp pizza spices and some onion powder.  The flavor was heavenly! The package has directions for all the uses it advertises and suggests ways to make specialty  eads, e.g. herb  ead, cinnamon  ead, etc.  I'm very pleased with the product!
