Compared to Pacific Gold beef jerky, this beef jerky is way too salty! You have to drink a glass of water for every piece of jerky you eat.  It's also a littler drier and less tender than other beef jerky.  I would recommend trying other  ands of beef jerky and staying away from this unless you want to develop early high blood pressure.
