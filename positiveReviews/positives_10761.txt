First I must admit that I am not normally an only the very best will do for our pets kind of a person. I tend more towards middle of the road products for our pets, not the cheapest stuff, but I also don't seek out the most expensive. Thanks to Amazon's Vine program I received a bag of these to test out for free in return for writing a review. Judging from the product page, I'm not the only one :).          When I read the ingredients list I was tempted to put a few in a pot of water and make stew for the family dinner. Organic barley, lamb and other goodies. Sounds good to me! But, I controlled myself and didn't try a taste.  When I gave one to the dog she absolutely loved it!  But, she loves to eat just about anything.          As a matter of personal choice, these premium treats are just a bit of a step to far for me when it comes to pet food. I realize that saying so will probably earn me some "not helpful" votes. I can live with that.          If you want only the very best products for your dog and your dog likes these, then by all means go for it! Just try not to think about how much bunker fuel is being burned to ship dog treats from New Zealand to North America.
