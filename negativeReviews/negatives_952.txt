I have been using a standard XLR to USB cable with my Shure 58 dynamic mic, which works okay, except for an annoying hissing noise that accompanies the majority of my vocal recordings.  I bought the Icicle in hopes of eliminating those noise issues.          When I received the Icicle, I couldn't wait to plug it in and take it for a "test" drive. Unfortunately, right off, I got an error   unable to load drivers.  This is a plug and play device, so there are no drivers to download, and I knew something wasn't right. After 3 restarts and uninstalling the USB Hubs and ports numerous times, as suggested by Icicle's troubleshooting website, it was still a no go.  I went to Icicle's website and logged a ticket, explaining the issues in detail and that I was running Windows 7.  The next day, I received an email instructing me to send the Icicle back, as it has a defective driver.  Amazon was GREAT about sending a replacement while the return was on its way.          So, I received the replacement Icicle today, pulled it out of its packaging and with bated  eath, plugged it in, hoping for success. No such luck   the same error message came up about the drivers. I decided to Google my issue:  "Icicle compatibility with Windows 7", and Bam!, it took me to a Guitar Center review of the Icicle that CLEARLY shows in the product specifications that it is NOT compatible with Windows 7.          Amazon needs to get on the ball and add this to their information.  It is nowhere in Amazon's description and the Icicle "techs" themselves didn't have a clue about it either. I found this inadequacy with the blue mic technical team to be unacceptable.  They probably have non technical CSRs pretending to be techs for all their troubleshooting. That's one way to save a dime, but please people   if you're going to give us "technical support", then say so.  If it isn't really technical support, then say it is Customer Service.          I am terribly disappointed that this device has not been upgraded to accommodate the newer technologies.  Windows 7 has been out for some time now.  There is no indication in the little mini booklet that comes in the Icicle package that says Windows 7 is incompatible  it only gives set up info for Mac and Windows (does not show which OS).  I am sending my Icicle back to Amazon for a refund and will need to look for something that WILL work with Windows 7.          If you have a PC that was purchased in 2011 or later, save yourself the hassle and don't bother with this product, as your OS will more than likely be Windows 7.
