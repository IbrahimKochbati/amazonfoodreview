I'm a big fan of Sumatra beans and Starbucks compares favorably with the locally available Peet's. The problem with all the Starbucks ground coffee I've seen is that there's no indicator on the package or in the product description as to the fineness of the grind. In fact, it's a medium grind like the generic canned supermarket  ands, suitable for drip and percolator type coffee makers. In my local supermarket, Starbucks is available and some varieties are whole beans, but not Sumatra.          I use an espresso machine and had to re grind the Starbucks to make a decent  ew. I won't be purchasing ground Starbucks again.
