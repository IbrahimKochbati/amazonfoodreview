This stuff is great if you're looking for a non alcoholic vanilla extract...yes this is really a vanilla extract not just a flavor like the essence stuff. I read somewhere on the net that the only reason they can't call it an extract is because it wasn't extracted by alcohol so legally they have to call it a flavor.     The smell and color are gorgeous plus its fair trade certified, the texture is a little bit like honey, I think it's the glycerin.          Going to buy again for sure.
