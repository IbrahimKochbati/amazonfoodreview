I bought these when they were on a Gold Box deal...thinking that it would be a nice inexpensive toss in for a month of lunches...and then I'd never buy them again.          Not so...          They're actually really tasty!  Exceptionally crunchy!  And the flavor is similar to kettle cooked chips.  Definitely going on subscribe and save for a while.          I don't think they're any more salty than standard potato chips...but they're by no means "low salt."
