I purchased this for my paramount 6 oz popcorn maker figuring it would be easy and quick and no mess, which it was. However, only about half of the kernals popped so thats why I gave it a lower review. The flavor was on the mark for movie theater taste. Perfect salt and butter flavor in my opinion! I just wish more kernals popped!
