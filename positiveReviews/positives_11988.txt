My dog is a very picky eater.  She has a very sensitive stomach and has special food.  This is the only treat I've found that doesn't make her throw up.  She loves it so much she won't eat her regular dog food unless I mix the treats with it.  They're a little pricey, but they're lowfat and natural.
