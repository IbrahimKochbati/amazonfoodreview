I ordered this product thinking it was the Le Gout Chicken Base I love so much. When I got it, the first thing I noticed was the color was a  ight mustard yellow instead of the darker colored one I was used to. Comparing the labels on the bottles, I then realized this was a "chicken flavor base" instead of "chicken base". Comparing the ingredients, you can see that chicken is not even listed as an ingredient, only chicken fat. Since this is a grocery item it cannot be returned. My mistake, just don't want anyone else to make the same one I did.
