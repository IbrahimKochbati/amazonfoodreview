These are a healthier version of Craisins, and to my mind much better tasting.  They are super moist and slightly less sweet. Eden adds no refined sugar;  instead, these cranberries are sweetened with organic apple juice concentrate.  (Don't allow yourself to think that they are "sugar free," however. The juice concentrate is still a strong source of natural sugars, which for a 1 3 cup serving of cranberries total 25 grams.) All that being said, if you are looking for a healthier, moist, good tasting dried cranberry (and organic, to boot,) this is it.
