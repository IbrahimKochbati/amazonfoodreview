This past Christmas, I stumbled upon a can of David Rio Organic Masala Chai in Marshall's. It was only $5 so I figured I would try it. When I did, wow, it was amazing! The best chai I've ever had. I looked all over for other cans but couldn't find any. I eventually it at William and Sonoma but it was $10 more and tasted slightly different; less sweet. Anyway, I decided to order the Tiger Spice thinking it would be just as good. I WAS WRONG! It was horrible! It tasted like it had an artificial sweetener in it (my opinion). The texture of the powder was also different from previous David Rio teas I had purchased. Unlike previous teas that had a sugary crystal like texture, this one was very powdery; a fine powder.          I will try my luck with some of the other David Rio products but definitely not the Tiger Spice Chai. I know a lot of people rave about it but it just didn't agree with me :(
