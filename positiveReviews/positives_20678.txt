This tuna is quite tasty, and the packaging is more convenient than any other  and I've seen. The cans have pull tabs    very easy to open. Also they are 4.5 oz, which is just about the right size for one generous serving, small enough that I don't feel the need to discard the olive oil in order to cut the calories. By the way, olive oil pack is the way to go    it makes a nice combination with the relatively dry tuna. At the price, an excellent value. I'm very pleased and intend to buy this again.
