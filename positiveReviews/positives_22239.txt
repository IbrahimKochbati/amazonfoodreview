The Aroy D curries in the can are surprisingly delicious and make super easy meals.  I eat them several times a week.  I make my own curry from time to time, but this is just so tasty and easy that I can hardly resist just opening a can, tossing in some meat and vegetables and having delicious Thai curry in a few minutes.  I even serve this to guests who are always impressed.  It is a bit on the spicy side, so when I know that my diners won't like that, that's when I have to make my own. Also, I keep several cans at work for lunches; I can just  ing in some leftover meat and veggies to toss in and heat and eat! Yum!
