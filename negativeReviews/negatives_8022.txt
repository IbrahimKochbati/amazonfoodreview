I was excited to try this jerkey and ripped the box open as soon as it arrived. Sadly, the flavor is just so so. More critically, the meat is extremely tough. Not tough the way jerky should be, but tough the way a hamburger that gets left on the BBQ for a couple hours is.     Very disappointed I couldn't return this because of Amazon policy. I hardly ever return anything, but this wasn't even worth the free shipping
