I normally like white teas, and this is no exception. It's very fruity, and I especially enjoy it served hot. I found this one required longer steeping than the directions stated, and it's also a bit weak, so you'll want to use no more than six ounces of water per bag.          Nantucket Nectars used to make a very delicious blueberry tea, which they've since discontinued, so I was excited to try another blueberry tea. This unfortunately is not nearly as good as Nantucket Nectars Blueberry Tea and just didn't taste right served cold, in my opinion, but as a hot tea, I do recommend this one.          My only other complaint is that I don't understand why Lipton is using plastic tea bags now. Isn't plastic bad for the earth? Doesn't it take hundreds of years to biodegrade? I've read reports that plastic bottles are a health hazard. I don't know if this is the same kind of plastic, but it just doesn't feel right making hot tea with a plastic tea bag, so I just cut the plastic bag open and use it with my tea infuser.
