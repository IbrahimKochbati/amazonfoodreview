I hate to admit I miss the lard. I was the one in your 4th grade class who unscrewed the Oreo, ate all the white middle, licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers. That's the image I have of this cookie. Even Bar a Streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of "A Star Is Born" the Oreos because she had two back up singers who were black. That's why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.          It is a single, nickel sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81 ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are "100 Calorie Packs", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight. It's just that I don't feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack.
