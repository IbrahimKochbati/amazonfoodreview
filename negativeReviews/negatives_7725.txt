Good quality canned albacore tuna has very little fishy taste or smell.  Sadly, Chicken of the Sea is not a good quality albacore tuna.          These days, I buy albacore because "regular" canned tuna smells so strong,it makes me want to gag. (Think cheap cat food.)  It tastes too fishy, and is filled with less than desirable pieces. (Skin, etc.) Albacore contains "cleaner" meat chunks and I rarely ever see any bad bits in the can. It's paler in color and has a much more desirable flavor.          Growing up, my Mom always bought "regular" tuna, (as opposed to albacore) and I never remember it smelling as strong as "regular" tuna does now. I've tried many different  ands, and I've finally realized that I have to move to the pricier albacore for a better "tuna" experience.          This Chicken of the Sea Albacore is very watery, (more to drain off) and the consistency in the can is "loose." (As opposed to "chunky") It seems more processed than other  ands. It has a stronger odor and taste than I prefer, and this will keep me from buying it again.
