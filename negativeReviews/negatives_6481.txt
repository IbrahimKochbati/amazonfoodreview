I agree with the others' comments about buying from Amazon.          We've ordered these chocolates before directly from Lindt and they've arrived in perfect condition   crisp shiny shells that SNAP when you bite into them, and fillings that literally melted in your mouth. So when Amazon offered them at a special price and sent directly from Amazon with free shipping, even better, right?          Wrong. I don't know how these were stored but they arrived in mid April when temps in Chicago the entire week before had ranged from the low 30s to the mid 50s, but they'd obviously been subjected to much warmer conditions. The shells were soft and kind of sticky and with none of the usual Lindt gloss, and the fillings were almost the same texture. The taste was barely adequate but the texture was not even close to what it should be even if you'd bought them off a grocer's shelf and a number of them even had dents in the shells although so far none seem to have been completely melted.          If you can buy them directly from Lindt in the middle of December, you'll probably be ok. Otherwise think twice before ordering unless you can be pretty sure they've been properly stored.
