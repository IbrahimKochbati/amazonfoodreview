I was a little worried about the other reviews that said their wrappers were  oken.  I wonder if they were pushing the wrappers they suggested (both suggested the same wrappers.... hmmm) However, the wrappers arrived intact.  In fact we took two packages camping and the left overs made it home without damage.  I detected no difference from the rice wrappers we buy locally at an Asian market.  Buying in bulk saved lots of $$.  There were a couple of wrappers   out of dozens  that had a few tiny air bubble holes in them.  It didn't affect the taste or function.  That is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  We weren't wrapping anything that was really drippy so it wasn't a problem.  We will definitely order again.  Shipping was rapid.  A great buying experience.
