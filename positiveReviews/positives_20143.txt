Nothing is as comforting and as fun as the orangina bottle. The photo does not do it justice at all. It is almost spherical and fairly stubby. Although it says "citrus" it is sooo orangee that well, you don't taste much else. The other citrus flavors are only in the form of subtle hints. Drinking orangina is almost like having aromatherapy. It is an adult and child pleaser, too. This is the beverage that allowed our children to "have a soda" without having a soda. We are a no pop household. It is also wonderful poured into a more sophisticated goblet, the flavor is alluring and can almost be called pretentious when properly served in place of a dessert liquor or wine spritzer. A lot of us adult Earth pod dwellers don't drink alcohol but want the joy of sipping and savoring. Great beverage. A treat like Polinarious. Enjoy. oh, and the pulp, hardly!
