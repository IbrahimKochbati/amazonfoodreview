If your toddler is a good eater, these are a very good deal price wise. I paid $3.29 for one at my local store.          That said, my granddaughter will not eat the chicken bits. I tasted them and ...not so hot! She eats the veggies and mashed potatoes and that is it. She is somewhat a picky eater but I am not sure it is her problem. I didn't like the chicken either.
