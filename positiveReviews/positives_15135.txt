My dogs have been eating Canidae for years.  They have always done well on the food.  Currently, I have three dogs and they have had no issues with the new formulations.  I have to say that my black lab mix has an even  ighter coat than before.  I love that they came out with a 44# bag.  With three dogs I go through a lot of dog food.  I definitely recommend this food.
