the taste shocked me.....i instantly tasted it comparing it to the 2% i have been drinking all my life...and when you have those expectations it will let you down..when i got over it i noticed it just taste like liquid almonds and i love almonds so its very nice to me...and if you like almonds i don't see why you wouldn't like the taste
