Cat Grass is not only a treat that cats love to eat, it is also good for them and will help deter them away from eating houseplants!  My cat often nibbles on houseplants then throws up and I'm always afraid that it will do damage to her digestive system.  When there is cat grass around, though, she only eats that   she really chows it down, and it makes her happy, too!  Cat grass is also good for cats   it contains vitamins that may or may not be present in cat food, and it aids their digestive system and helps to eliminate fur balls.          Even if you do not have a green thumb, cat grass is so easy to grow, that anyone can do it and it's also a great "project" for kids, too.  The seeds sprout very quickly (if you keep them moist) and will grow quickly to 4 6inches in a window sill.          If you have cats, cat grass is a must!
