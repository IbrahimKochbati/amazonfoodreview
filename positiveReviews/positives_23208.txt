This  ead is TRULY AMAZING!  Pamela's  ead tastes THE most like regular  ead and all of the recipes on the bag are wonderful.  It never crumbles and doesn't have that strong starchy flavor that other gluten free  eads have.  We can have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches again!  I always have Pamela's  ead on hand!
