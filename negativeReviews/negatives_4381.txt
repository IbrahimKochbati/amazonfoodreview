Dolce Gusto's Caffee Lungo is their version of plain Ol' Coffee. It is pretty weak flavor, so I didn't really like it  No where near bold enough, lacks flavor. My dad, loved it. So when I need instant coffee, I will be reaching for the espresso pods instead and just pulling 6 ounces (Americano ish).          So while Dolce Gusto will likely replace most of the useage of my espresso machine, I doubt it will make much of a dent in my drip coffee pot's usage, as Caffe Lungo just doesn't measure up.
