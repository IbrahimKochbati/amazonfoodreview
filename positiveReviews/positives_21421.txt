First we tried Tinkyada rice pasta and we could eat it but it was mushy and soft. This  and tastes better too and holds up just like wheat pasta if you don't evercook it.  It is good reheated and can be eaten in cold dishes.  My son loves it.  The animal shapes are fun. I also like that it is organic and whole grain.
