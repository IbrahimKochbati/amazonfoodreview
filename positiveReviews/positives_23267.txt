I am new to a gluten free diet and have to say that I have not been all that thrilled with GF  eads.  They either smell bad, taste terrible or don't cook completely in my Bread Machine leaving them doughy in the middle.  This product however made me go WOW in every way!  I love it!!  It cooks though, it is soft and moist, has a nice texture and does not smell strange as other gf recipes have.  If you try it and like it you can also save on the cost by purchasing the 4 pound bag.  To make  ead from bulk per a phone call with Pamela's   it is 2 1 4t yeast and 3 1 2c  ead mix then follow the instructions on the individual bag: in a 2 cup liquid measuring cup, measure 1 4c oil, 2 eggs, fill with warm water to 2 cups liquid, plus add 2T additional water (I omit the last 2T of water personally).  I get a 4 1 2   5 inch tall loaf.  Perfect. Thank You Pamela's!
