Tried Stubb's Pork Marinade for the first time today expecting great flavors with possibly a little kick on my center cut boneless chops. Even went as far as marinating 6 hours prior and basting while cooking but found my pork chops basically flavorless. There was a slight and I mean slight vinegary taste but other than that, it tasted like a plain old pork chop with no seasoning at all. I've tried so many other marinades on the market which are a lot more successful than this one.
