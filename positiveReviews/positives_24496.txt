My puppy (Shia) and 5yr old (Miss Peaches)loves this food. Once I purchased my new lovely new baby I wanted a puppy food that would be good for her. This  and has no by products in it, but has all the natural ingredients for the well being of your pets, it's the real deal for a healthy growning puppy and the adult dog food my Chihuahua, and Pom loves. I'm sold and I won't change a thing.
