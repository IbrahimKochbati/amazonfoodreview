BB Lamb and Rice keeps my two greyhounds in top shape.  My male is a very picky eater, and even turns up his nose at homemade chicken and rice, but he bolts this kibble down.  I add a couple of tablespoons of BB canned food with warm water to make a gravy on my greyhounds' kibbles, and they love it.  Greyhounds require very high protein feed in measured amounts or they don't thrive.  I've found this product to be excellent for them.
