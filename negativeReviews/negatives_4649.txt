This tea is stale.  I have had this  and and kind of tea many times, so I know how it should taste.  It's dated Jan. 2013, but it must have been stored improperly.  It has no fragrance and no taste.  Even the teabag paper looks yellowed.  It is worse than supermarket tea.  I cherish my  eakfast tea, so am very disappointed, especially having bought six boxes of this useless stuff.  I tried to give it no stars, but that's not allowed, so I gave one for prompt shipping.
