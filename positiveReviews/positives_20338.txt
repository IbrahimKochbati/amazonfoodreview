I have been feeding this to my son every night since he was 6 months old, and he is now 19 months and still eats it.  We stir in some kids fish oil for extra DHA, he eats it right up.  This product has unbelievable health benefits, tons of iron, and is organic.  What more can you ask for?  Multi grain cereal will not be to every babies taste, but my son sure loves it!
