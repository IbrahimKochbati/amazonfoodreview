I love the popcorn, but the shipping costs are INSANE!! A total rip off. Wabash Valley Farms or Amazon or whoever is charging the shipping is out of their mind. 5 Stars for the popcorn. Minus 4 stars for the terrible cost associated with shipping. Argh...Yes, the popcorn is tender and luscious, and it melts in your mouth like you're eating cooked grasshoppers, but come on!!! Can't you ship this product for less?          Shipping the 6 pound bag is even worse. *sigh* Too bad really.
