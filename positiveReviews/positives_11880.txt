We cut these up into small pieces for our Corgi pup (so each treat actually becomes 8 10 mini treats) to prevent throwing off his diet.  This allows us to give him multiple treats for going potty outside (like 3 5 mini treats each time).  We also use these whenever our puppy meets a stranger    we make sure all four paws are on the ground before we give it to him and he has already learned to inhibit his desire to jump up on people!  These are amazing and I appreciate that they are made in the USA    no weird chemicals to worry about    and our pup loves to work for them!
