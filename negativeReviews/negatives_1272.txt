Oh my gosh.  I bought this tea and drank my first cup in the late afternoon.  By evening I was having the worst stomach cramps and diarrhea.  I belatedly looked at the ingredients and the first one is senna leaves.  During internet research I discovered that some individuals may experience discomfort or cramping after using senna products.  Also the following admonition   don't take senna for more than a week or so or your body could end up relying on it to contract your bowels.          Side effects can include:     *diarrhea     *intestinal cramps or gripping pains     *rash     *severe weight loss          Senna should not be used by persons with Crone's disease, Diverticular disease and other similar diseases.          Senna is not a daily or causal supplement and excessive use can cause liver damage.          I wanted to die my insides hurt so bad.  Any weight loss you may accomplish with this tea may not be worth the pain.  Be aware before you use.  I threw my remaining 29 tea bags away!
