I discovered Maldon salt about 10 years ago, ever since it is a must in my kitchen. As a man who cooks a homemade meal every single day, this salt is outstanding when used with meats or fish. It will exponentially improve the flavor while adding a few notes of its own. Absolutely recommendable, especially at the affordable price Amazon is offering. Don't use this salt in salads and similar dishes, since once it dissolves you will not notice much of a difference with other salts (there will be, it will just not be as pronounced). Just cook your meats or fish and then I suggest adding a spoon of extra virgin olive oil, then sprinkle a little bit of Maldon salt. You will not regret it.
