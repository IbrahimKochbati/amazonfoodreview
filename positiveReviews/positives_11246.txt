I love this gluten free  ead. Very easy to make....     a quick tip. After mixing and putting in  ead pan, leave it     in a 200 degree oven for an hour and then bake it for another hour at 350. It gets a crispy crust but stays soft and firm on the inside. Try sprinkling a little raw sugar on the top before putting in oven. The only problem with this  ead is that I overeat it.
