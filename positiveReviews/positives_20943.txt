I absolutely love the Crystal Light On the Go mixes, especially the Iced Tea flavor. Apart from tasting great, the mixes also help you drink much more throughout the day.          The only downside of these are that they contain a lot of caffeine, so if you're sensitive to caffeine you might have want to choose a different flavor (some of the other flavors are caffeine free), as this one can lead to headaches and nausea.          Pros:       Tastes great       Price       Helps you drink more          Cons:       Contains a lot of caffeine
