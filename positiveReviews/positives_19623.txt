I have ordered other Walden Farms zero calorie products but the consistancy is just wrong.  But, this salad dressing is just perfect.  I use the ranch and the thousand island.  It's definitely worth it.  I'm Diabetic and having a salad is hard because salad dressing has so many calories.  But this product cuts that down completely!  Very tasty   a bit of a kick.
