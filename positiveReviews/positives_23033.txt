This was my first order using Amazon's subscriber service, and I couldn't be more pleased. This saves me going on a 50 mile round trip to the nearest "big" store (I live in a rural area). And with today's gas prices, what could be more convenient?          The shipping was free, and the package arrived at my door within days. I will (and already have) be using this service more and more.          Thanks Amazon!
