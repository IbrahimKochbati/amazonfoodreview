Great for a asions.  Kept a slow healing nonhealing venus ulcer on my father's leg infection free and actually healed it.  He had it for years and all the stuff the doctor's prescribed from the specialized wound care center hadn't been able to heal it.  Lots of stuff now on the market which may not be as good.  Read carefully about Manuka Honey and the various stuff that is being sold.  Seems like many companies have jumped on it and I'm not sure all are as pure or really from New Zealand Manuka "bee farms".
