I actually have to  eak these in half and mold them around the pill for my dog to even eat these. I found that when he ate the whole thing (or swallowed it), he would end up vomiting it up in the end. He is 75lbs with a huge mouth so I don't know how smaller dogs would do with these. As for taste, he seemed to like this flavor the best in the beginning. Unfortunately he stopped eating them after I bought too many bags!
