I find that even with the gain on maximum, the volume is not very loud.  I use it with a Shure SM57 mic and my Macbook (using Audacity).  One must be very close to the mike and speak somewhat loudly.  When I use the Shure mics with a mixer (the "analog" way), there are no volume problems.          It is simple to set up, being almost "plug and play".  You have to choose the input source.
