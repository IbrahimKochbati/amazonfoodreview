Great value, love the large size 19.5 oz plastic container, love my pepper mills and use lots of whole peppercorns. This large size saves time buy not having to replenish my peppercorn supply so frequently. With the Holiday's fast approaching an ample supply of whole peppercorns is a must have kitchen item. The peppercorns have a fresh  ight taste without being overpowering and are great in any season.
