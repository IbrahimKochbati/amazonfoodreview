I use this tea for menstral cramps.  I drink a lot of it and it works fantasticly on cramps and mood.  Here is the catch   you can't expect to drink one cup and feel better.  I make big containers of ice tea   and I start drinking it all the time about two days before my period even starts.  Also, once my period starts, I try to make sure I have a cup every two hours  sometimes I have even more.  So again, it works but drink alot.
