The only flavor we could stand was the barbecue (which was the reason we purchased them in the first place)!  I had to give the others away!!!  I won't be buying this again for lunches although the size packaging was great.  I just wish the other flavors tasted better (plain, salt, pepper, etc., weren't really kid friendly).
