My twin boys have loved this product   they gobbled it up.  And as a mom, I loved it because it was very tasty and unique.  But also because it used a lot of veggies that my boys don't often get in their diet, like peppers and eggplant.  Since I last bought this product on Amazon the entire recipe has changed and there is no indication of such in the Amazon description.  It now is almost all carrots (something that my boys eat constantly) and quinoa.  No eggplant.  Only red peppers as one of the last ingredients.  And amaranth, for which it is named, went from ingredient number two, to the end of the ingredient list just above the spices.  It is not nearly as tasty in my opinion, either.  It looks and tastes a lot more like the Super Salmon.To be honest, this is just an entirely different product.  My boys still eat it, but I was disappointed and might not buy it again.
