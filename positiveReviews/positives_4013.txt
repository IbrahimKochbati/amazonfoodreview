Living in Baton Rouge my wife and I drank the popular regional coffee   Community Coffee, we now guess out of loyalty. When we became full time RV'ers in Fe uary 2007, we packed 5 lbs of that coffee but ran out in Missouri, so we tried other dark roast, including Maxwell House Gourmet Dark Roast and then the Yuban Dark Roast. OMG   what a difference!          We'll never buy anything except Yuban Dark Road   smooth and silky without that burnt or bitter taste.          Difficult to find in South Louisiana, but easier nationwide. Then there's always Amazon with delivery within 5 days!          Ya gotta try it!
