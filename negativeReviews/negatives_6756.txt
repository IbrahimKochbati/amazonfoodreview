If you don't pour the liquid in slowly like the directions say (and I mean a trickle of liquid) then the texture comes out gooey.  It took me three tries (three different boxes) to get it right.  But even then, I could not get past the bitter taste.  Contrary to what the Chebe folks say, manioc (tapioca) flour has a slightly bitter taste to it.     I now have five boxes of Chebe mix to throw away.     I have Celiac disease and cannot have gluten, so I am back to trying out different  own rice flour recipes until I find one that works.
