Shake N Bake in the original pork flavor has been a guilty pleasure of mine since I was a little girl. When I was a kid, it was often what I would request for my birthday dinner and I still crave Shake N Bake pork chops every now and then.          When I selected the Shake N Bake Pork Pouch, I really wasn't sure what it was. I thought maybe it was a pouch that you put the pork chop in and cooked it in the pouch. I was completely wrong.          The pouch is just a packet of the Shake N Bake mix. That's it. There is no little plastic bag to shake the chops in, so you have to provide your own bag. Not only that, but the pouch is only 2.25 ounces, as opposed to the 3 ounce packets you get in the standard Shake N Bake box, so it coats fewer pork chops. To be fair, it does state on the back of the pouch that this packet makes 4 6 pork chops instead of the 6 8 chops the 3 ounce packet makes.

I often use 1 Â½   2 packets for 6 8 pork chops. The Shake N Bake pouch would be handy to use along with one of the 3 ounce packets to accommodate my desire for extra Shake N Bake.          As for the flavor, it is the same Shake N Bake Original Pork flavor I know and love. There are no changes to the flavor, just the packaging.

I just don't see a need for these pouches and will stick to the normal box of    "
