Just signed up for the Subscribe and Save option.  Saved a few bucks per bag versus the local store, and now it will show up every month.  Hopefully the rhythm will match the consumption rate of my two dogs! (the shortest shipping interval is 1 month, but you can trigger an immediate delivery if needed)
