There are a number of different Switch juice flavors.  I tried Kiwi Berry, and I did like it.  There's a whole lot more than Kiwi in this can though, and while they are all natural products (meaning, not man made, I guess) I counted 5 other things besides Kiwi in there, which some of the other reviewers also pointed out.  It is carbonated   which  ings out the flavor a bit more, in my opinion. It was sweet, yet they say no sugars are "added" (however, the natural products in the concoction already have 33g of sugar in them, in the 8.3 fluid ounce aluminum pop top can).  There is 135 calories and 34g of carbs in that can too.          So, while the flavor is good and I liked the sensation as I drank it, the marketing of the can (tall and narrow, a pretty pink, labeled as 100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't), the can makes me feel like this product is calling out to me saying, "buy me because I'm a "premium" product."  Well, I'm sorry, that's not why I buy a juice product.  I think the term for this would be "preppy" but still, I did taste good.
