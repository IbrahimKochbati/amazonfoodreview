I received my first bag via a coupon from BzzAgent, for free... since price was not a factor I was more than open to seeing positive changes. I really wanted to give this a high rating because our little mutt really seemed to like eating it and it is the perfect size but I did not notice any positive changes in her. By the same token, I did not notice any major negative changes either. However, the first few days she had diarrhea and after that it went back to almost normal consistency but she was pooping about twice as often. She was also thirsty all the time while eating this.          I would say this food is average in quality, the pooch liked the taste but did not experience any of the claimed improvements so I do not think the price is justified. Others may have better luck with it but it just did not work better than our old food.
