Our small Pomeranian Poodle mix is addicted to these things.  She will actually sit and stare at the cabinet where we keep them, and try to get us to follow her to the cabinet in order to beg for them.  They are chewy, but easily digestible and will keep your dog occupied for a few minutes.  We haven't had any problems in terms of her keeping them down, she just wants more and more of them.  The 36 count pack is a good value compared to other retailers selling smaller bags.
