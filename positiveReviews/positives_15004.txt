I found this while stationed in Italy, and really missed them when I moved back to the states.  I was discussing them the other night and decided to order some from Amazon.  They are still fantastic!  I eat them as a treat or as a pick me up when coffee is not available.  It is a shame they are not more widely available in stores.  The small amount of coffee filled with ground beans is a wonderful treat.
