This carbonated juice drink quenched my thirst.  The small size means you don't have to commit to a huge serving and is a fantastic size for kids who never, ever seem to finish a can of anything.          It is 100% juice and makes a very tasty refreshing way to get a serving of fruit for the day.     It also has 100% of the recommended daily allowance of Vitamin C and only 1% sodium.     I would absolutely offer this in place of soda for my children.
