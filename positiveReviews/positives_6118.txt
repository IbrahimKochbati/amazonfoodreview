I am a very picky coffee drinker...I was so surprised at the flavor of the Italian roast...8oz to 10oz of water is all you need. I run the water through the one cup coffer maker. It's important to put the coffee in first and stir while hot water is coming through. I guess you could just micro the water and pour it over the coffee in another mug...great for home or travel..we all know hotel coffee is terrilbe.     LLHB  ENJOY!
