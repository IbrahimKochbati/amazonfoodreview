No leftovers going to waste, no measuring and no trouble.  Just add the water milk and microwave.  One pouch means one meal and there's nothing to reseal.  This is probably the best plain instant potatoes  and I've tried.  They really taste "real" and they taste great!  We stock these in the pantry for everyday eating, camping, and for those emergencies like power outages, blizzards, and zombie attacks etc.
