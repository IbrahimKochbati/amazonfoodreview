These thinkThin "Brownie Crunch Bars" are very filling and are good tasting (for diet bars), but those expecting a "Little Debbie"  ownie will be greatly disappointed. Being a Type 2 diabetic, I am glad that these products are available since they only have about 11 NET Carbs.          I find that they make a good  eakfast or mid afternoon snack, keeping me from eating something much worse.          These do contain Maltitol and can cause "gastric distress" in some people, so it is a good idea to make sure you know how it effects you before heading out to the weekly Book Club meeting.
