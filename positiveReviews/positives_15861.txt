I rescued a Pitbull from deplorable conditions when she was 5 months old and she was a mess!  She had allergies and mange and her immume system was very compromised.  I put her on this food and it cleared her skin up in less than a month!  I've researched a lot of food online and at the Pet stores and this I believe is the best!  It is a tad pricey but if you love your dog like I do then it's worth it.  I hope Amazon will continue to carry this for a very long time.
