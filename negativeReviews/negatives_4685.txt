The crab meat layer on top is about a 1 4" (I'm being generous in my measurement)w  the rest being tuna and a substantial share of  oth. Of course my cats loved it and each devoured a whole can. I felt it was quite overpriced for tuna and will not purchase again. I think it's much more cost effective to buy a can of Phillip's crab meat from the grocery store so my cats and I can both enjoy it.
