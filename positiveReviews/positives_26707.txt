I like honey mustard but the little bit you get in the store is too expensive. The recipe for making my own chewed up the little can of dry mustard in one use. The price for the little can again means honey mustard is too expensive. With these sized cans I will be making lots of mustard variatons without  eaking the bank. My first batch matures in one week. Just in time for basball and hot dogs.
