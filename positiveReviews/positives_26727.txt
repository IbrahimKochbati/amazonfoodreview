I use Colman's mustard in several sauces that I cook with, and it is the best powdered mustard I have found. It gives a full bodied, slightly hot zing to the dish, without being too overpowering. Although it is quicker and easier to slather on grey poupon, that product is getting prohibitively expensive. These 16 ounce cans will last me quite a while, and the powder keeps very well on my shelf, while the other mustards take up space in my refrigerator. I bought this in the interests of economy, but there has been no sacrifice by my taste buds.
