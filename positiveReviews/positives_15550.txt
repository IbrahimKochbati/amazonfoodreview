I love this chai, I've tried all the powdered ones, big train, etc and tiger spice is by far the best. As opposed to the other review posted here, I find that the fine crystalline form of the powder is easily dissolvable and indicated high quality. It doesn't taste at all artificial. I do not add sugar to my regular food items, so I am sensitive to it. It is not overpowering. It's a wonderful, slightly sweet, creamy cup of chai latte if you ask me. I use a mixture of half almond milk and half water with one heaping Tbsp...perfect.
