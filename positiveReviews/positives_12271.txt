The Previous reviews sums up the quality taste of this product.I found this product almost 20 years ago at a diner in Pismo Beach.At the time the Pepper Plant was a local (Atascadero) mom & pop operation and couldn't be found south of Santa Barbara or north of San Luis Obispo.I was living an hour north of San Francisco and was fortunate enough to purchase the sauce at the diner,I purchased 4 bottles and hit that diner about every 6 months for years.The company was purchased by a larger gourmet foods manufacturer in Gilroy and didn't change a thing.If anything it was a benefit for the product as it is now in the heart of where the ingredients are grown.I was able to get my local Whole Foods to carry Pepper Plant and another store across town.I have noticed that people are discovering the fantastic flavor of a California original and hope more people discover the best pepper sauce in the west.The bar b que sauce is excellent too. Cheers!
