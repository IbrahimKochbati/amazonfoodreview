While I prefer homemade mashed potatoes, I am a busy Mom so I have to use instant quite often. I was hoping for a new taste with these, instead I have a case and a half of something we will not eat again. My husband s a Marine, and will eat almost anything except mushrooms, cauliflower and now these potatoes. Even my kids hate them and they will eat anything in the pantry and fridge! The only thing I like is the size of the package which is perfect for a family with 2 younger kids.
