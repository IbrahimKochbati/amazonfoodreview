I have been feeding my 3 male cats Natural Balance dry and canned food for a few years.  I like that this dry food has chicken products as the first two ingredients, and that higher quality carbs are used (no corn or wheat).  My cats' coats seem softer and healthier, and they are as frisky and happy as ever at ages 7 8.
