I was pleasantly surprised by this tea... I'm in good health generally and I don't take any medications.  I ordered this because the other reviews intrigued me, and I knew I wanted to gently support my liver & kidneys.  I'm not an expert on elimination or anything, but I feel like this makes those processes more effective.  Since last summer I've been on a mission to lose about 25 pounds, so I changed my diet and exercise habits, and lost 20 lbs by November; that seemed to be my limit and I was OK with it.  I started drinking this tea right after Christmas and after 2 weeks, I lost 3 lbs!  I know I probably shouldn't attribute this to the tea but it's the only change that I made to my routine... I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as a weight loss product but I mention it because it was an unexpected side benefit to me.  I think it does just make it so my body can get rid of waste more completely, on a consistent basis.          It tastes good to me, earthy and mild... I like that it doesn't have as strong a licorice flavor like a lot of the Yogi Teas seem to, though it does contain licorice root.  I drink it plain, hot and strong, usually 2 teabags in a 20 oz mug or 1 bag in a smaller mug.  I like to drink it in the morning, and again in the late afternoon when I'm at work.  Since it doesn't contain tea, I like steeping it for even longer than 5 minutes to get the most out of it.  I usually take green tea in the morning, so I've been combining that with the Detox Tea but am going to try the Skin Detox Tea instead, to make it easier.  Also I feel the green tea detracts from the flavor of the Detox Tea somewhat although I still find it perfectly palatable.  Hope this helps!
