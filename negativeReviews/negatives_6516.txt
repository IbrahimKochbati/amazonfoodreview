They didn't honor price listed and when I called and sent several emails to complain they stated it was a computer "glitch" and proceeded to refund my money. A WEEK before Valentines Day. I was sending over six orders and they ROYALLY screwed me and did not have enough customer service experience to honor the price it sold for. I will NEVER order from this company EVER again!
