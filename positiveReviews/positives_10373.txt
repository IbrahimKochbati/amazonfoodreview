I like this. I have had more expensive truffle oils before, but I am perfectly happy with this. Just because it's not from france doesn't mean its not good! A good sparkeling wine (champange) from california, is still better than a bad one from champange france. The tase is waht I expected. Mine were packaged in shrink wrapped plastic and padding stuff, and arrived ok. Truffles, I understand, grow in many places in the world. I haven't tasted the finest quality (cannot find it, much less afford it), but this tastes similar to the other black truffle oils I have tasted (that were more expensive). I have no reservations recommending it, as long as you understand its not as subtile as white truffle, i.e its a bit stronger of a taste. It all what you like and can afford. Its great stuff!          The other reviewer should have asked for a replacement, not a refund. You shouldn't derogate the product for something that is the fault of the shipping carrier, and possibly the packer.
