I was actually very surprised when I took my first swig. I didn't pay attention to the ingredients, so I was expecting your typical, dull 10% fruit juice taste. To my surprise  a good thing  I was very pleased.     One can really taste the fruitiness of this 100% fruit beverage, and I've tasted many in my day.     The carbonation isn't too forcefull, either, allowing you to drink Switch very smoothly. Finally, a great alternative to your energy drinks that claim to have a fruit flavor. Say goodbye to man made energy, and say hello to nature's source of pure health and revival.
