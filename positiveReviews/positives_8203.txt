I have two Australian Cattle Dogs VERY high energy  eeds, I have tried all foods from solid gold to Canidae and have had mixed results with both of those foods,I have tried the regular Royal Canin medium  eed and both of my medium sized dogs (50 lbs) seem to like the puppy food. There waste deposits seem to have gone down and there coats and behaviors have never been better (both on royal canin for 2 years), no vet bills, beautiful coats and best of all the dogs attitudes have never been better.
