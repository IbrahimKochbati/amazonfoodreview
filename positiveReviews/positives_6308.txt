One day my husband and I were at Costco.  They had the Oak Hill Farms Vidalia Onion Vinaigrette on the shelf.  I said "wow" this really looks good but I put it back on the shelf.  When we got to the check out stand, there it was in the basket.  My husbands says, it did look good.  Now I need to tell you that my husband is "not" a salad person. But he decided to try this salad dressing.  By the end of the month we had 16 bottles of the salad dressing. Costco did not have it anymore so I would check on line every day until it was available and I ordered 6 bottles.  Don't want my husband to run out of that dressing again.  That's my story and it is the truth
