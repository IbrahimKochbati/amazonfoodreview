This drink flavor is so much better than the watermelon strawberry flavored drink. This kiwi berry drink is less sweet, and has less calories than the other Switch drink.  This drink contains 135 calories, with 33g surgar, 34g carbs. This is a carbonated juice drink with no added sugar or preservatives. I liked this drink better than the first drink I tried because it didn't taste as sweet as the watermelon strawberry flavored drink. I am glad I took the opportunity to try a different flavor, this drink was refreshing, and thirst quenching. Thanks for the sample!
