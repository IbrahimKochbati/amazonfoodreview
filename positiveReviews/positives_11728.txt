Some of these "healthy" snack products taste like the box they come in.  "SoyJoy" comes to mind.  Ick.          However, Pamela's gluten free oat chocolate chip coconut "bars" are quite tasty and satisfying.  The cover of the box lists it as wheat free, gluten free, non dairy, with 180 mg of Omega 3 fatty acids, 9 grams of whole grains, and no trans fat.  In small print on the side we also find that this company donates to celiac sprue and autism organizations.          And it is indeed, as the box also claims, "moist and chewy."  The major downer about the product is merely its consistency, as it comes out of its packet as some kind of misshapen, ill defined lump rather than a literal "bar," and as such it doesn't hold together very well, but that's nitpicking.  Just eat it while it's still in the wrapper and there's no mess.          Ingredients include gluten free oats, rice flour, organic chocolate chunks, coconut sugar, organic eggs, & almonds.  Well worth a try if this description appeals to you.  Enjoy!
