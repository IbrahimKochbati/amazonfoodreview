The last shipment I received, when preparing the milk there were black specks or particles in it. It was in two out of the three containers. I don't even know if it was in the first can i used. This was the first time it's happened and I've been using goats milk for my daughter since December 2011 and she loves it. Plus it didn't constipated her like whole cow's milk. Now I'm leary about buying another batch as it may contain this stuff again.
