I love quinoa for its delicious taste, texture, and nutritional benefits. This NOW  and as sold on Amazon is a great bargain. I do a lot of research before I purchase items and feel satisfied that this is a good deal. There is no need to soak this quinoa. The bag tells you to rinse it before using, but I never have and we love the taste. Quinoa can be used in a variety of ways, but one of our favorites is to make Quinoa Pilaf, the same way you would make rice pilaf. (Simply chop onions, carrots, and celery and saute in olive oil. Then add the quinoa and substitute chicken  oth for the water and cook as per directions.) Quinoa is a great substitute for rice in general. This  and provides consistent results, always cooking evenly.          TIP: When I open a bag and use a bit, I store the rest in a glass mason jar to keep it fresh. That way it's easy to scoop out what you need and stores beautifully in the pantry cabinet.
