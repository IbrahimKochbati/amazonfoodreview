I acquired this coffee through the Vine program.  I found the coffee to be just ok, with nothing to either recommend it or to take away from it. The package lists the grind as extra fine, but it is really just barely a fine grind with several larger pieces in it than you would not normally find in a fine grind.  This is not really an issue unless you really needed a fine grind.  It works just fine in a drip coffee maker with a paper filter.          As for flavor, the coffee is not bitter, but does not have much of a personality.  I would compare it to MJB or any other mass marketed coffee on the store shelves.  This would probably be a fine coffee to use if you were going to add your own flavorings as there is nothing to get in the way of the flavorings that you would be adding.
