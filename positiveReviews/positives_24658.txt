When I ordered this organic pumpkin product, there was a problem with customers receiving dented cans. Amazon Farmer's Market Foods was assessing the situation to resolve this problem, and the pumpkin was not being sold. When, I assumed, they had finally resolved the dented cans situation, I was able to order.          I received the case of pumpkin puree and the box seemed really well packaged, so I was surprised to find all but 2 of the 12 cans DENTED. I'm almost certain the problem is occurring at the manufacturing plant, because the cans in the middle of the case were all dented. Be informed the problem is not resolved, yet.          I went ahead and used the pumpkin from a dented can as there was no indication the product was tainted (Push on the top and bottom of the can. If the top or bottom of the can moves in any way or makes a popping sound, the can's seal has been  oken and air has made its way inside). The pumpkin tasted fresh and had a very succulent, moist consistency and it is organic. I would definitely recommend this  and of pumpkin IF they resolve their dented can problem, especially since you can't find pumpkin in the grocery stores at this time (due to the destroyed pumpkin crop in the Fall of 2009).
