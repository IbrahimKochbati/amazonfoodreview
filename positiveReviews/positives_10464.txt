I am double posting this review for both the thick cut and filet versions of this product. So you may see it twice    YES, I did order BOTH products.          1) This product comes COLD packed in a wine  ine with onions (as was expected)   read this next part carefully:          This is a cold product   IT MUST BE SHIPPED and KEPT REFRIGERATED, because it has no preservatives.          Make certain you have ROOM in your fridge for the jar(s) which are slightly different than the one pictured (thinner diameter straight wide mouth jar and taller, which makes then easier to fit in the fridge).          2) If you don't normally consume this product in this form (packed in wine sauce) then don't buy it. It would probably be considered to be an "acquired taste" by most. Buy a small jar in a local grocery first to try. If you like it then order this larger jar.          3) This  and does appear to have a stronger fish taste (up against the  ine), than other  ands I have tried. The fish taste is stronger on the thick cut product, which may be preferred, depending on your tastes. My guess is that would diminish over time while marinating in the "wine" and onion based  ine.          4) I suggest that you might try just one jar at a time. Remember IT MUST BE KEPT REFRIGERATED    it can NOT be stored without being refrigerated in a pantry.          5)This  and is pricey with shipping costs. You may be able to purchase locally if you don't require Canadian packed herring.          6) Eating fish may be good for you, and if you like this type of product, it might be an easy way to consume larger amounts of Omega fats other than downing supplements. You could live longer, but you will need to  ush your teeth or chew gum more, or you may become an old person with fish  eath. ;)          Finally I should note that this was the second shipment sent, but I never saw the first box which I was told was damaged during delivery.  The product was cold packed with freezer packs in a polystyrene lined box. Parthenon Foods sent an email about the damaged shipment and offered refund or re delivery    no hassles. So they are very easy to work with and have good communication. I would order other products from them again. (I HAVE ENOUGH HERRING IN MY FRIDGE TO LAST A WHILE! ;)
