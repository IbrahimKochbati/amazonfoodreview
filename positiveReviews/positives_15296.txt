My husband bought this for us for an early Christmas. We have been using it for about a month and we love it. It makes a strong, hot cup every time, which is a huge improvement over our standard pot of coffee maker. I was a little worried about the cost of each cup, but if you shop around and check the price per cup you can save a lot of money. Costco seems to be the best deal, but you need to buy 80 cups at a time. This is not an issue for us because we drink a lot of coffee. We bought a sampler box at Sears and that gave us an idea of what we like. I also bought 2 EkoBrew reusable k cups (the reviews on the Keurig reusable cups were not good) so that we have the option of using up our bulk coffee. The water is easy to refill, no spills. I empty the leftover coffee from each k cup into a container and then use that as fertilizer in my plants. We also just discovered k cups at Costco from the SF Bay company which don't have the plastic bottom, just  the filter which reduces the plastic going into landfill. Plus they were only $25.99 for 80 cups (.37 per cup!). Great company, tasty coffee. Highly recommend this coffee maker!
