I love Earl Grey. I love Zhena's Earl Green. I do not love Zhena's Earl "Greater" Grey: it is not greater. There's very little bergamot flavor, at least in the batch I got. In fact if I didn't know it's supposed to be Earl Grey I'd say it's only a fairly good black tea with no bergamot at all. Even just opening the tin, I got no whiff of bergamot, and certainly there's none in the finished tea, even using double tea bags. Maybe I just got a bad batch, but although it's passable tea, it's very bad Earl Grey.          For real Earl Grey, I strongly recommend The Republic of Tea's "Earl Greyer." It is by far the most delicious Earl Grey I have tried. Unfortunately Amazon doesn't (yet?) carry the tea bags, but it is worth the trouble of a loose tea, to have actual Earl Grey (bergamot) flavor in your Earl Grey tea.
