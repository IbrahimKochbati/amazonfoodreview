I love these Barbecue flavored Pop Chips. They're crunchy, loaded with spicy Barbecue flavor, and highly addicting. Beware... you're going to want more! After trying these you'll find it hard to believe they're pretty healthy. Go to their website and see for yourself (not every product page lists ingredients, it's worth checking it out). I'll definitely be buying more of these.          4 stars instead of 5 because although they're absolutely delicious, they're also inconsistent. One bag has different textured chips (and coating variances, mainly color difference) from another. That's fine with me but it's just a a little off putting.
