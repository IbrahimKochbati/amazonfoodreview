My title says it all.  I appreciate the fact that these are built with nutrition in mind, but since my dog ONLY eats healthy dog food I'm not entirely concerned about a small, fun snack for him from time to time.          At the sound of me saying "treat!" my dog almost looses his mind.  When I first gave him this he took it in his mouth, ran over to his treat eating spot, and then dropped it and looked at it, not sure what to make of it.  After a while he bit into it (CRUUUUCH!) and ate the entire thing.          I offered him another one the next day and he took it with a lot less enthusiasm than he usually does when taking treats.  It was almost as if he was saying, "Well, if that is all I get I'll take it, but next time you say 'treat' it better be something I can get excited about."  He ate it as well, but without the usual glee he puts into his treat eating.          So, he'll eat them but there are a host of other treats    most of them also built with health in mind    that he would prefer to eat first.  I'll still give him all of these square little biscuits from time to time but only because I don't want them to go to waste.  I won't be getting another bag.
