Our dogs have only been chewing these for about a week and a half and they are great for freshening their  eath!!! Their  eath was so bad that you couldn't stand having them  eathe anywhere by you, now their  eath is alot better. I think that it is only gonna continue to get better :) Plus they love them and these don't upset their sensitive tummies!!!! I would recommend these to anyone :)
