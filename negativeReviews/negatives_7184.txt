This has to be one of the most disgusting products I have tasted. If you are on the Atkins or low carb diet it is NOT truly low carb. The nutrition information was deceptive and when I tried to return the product (unopened) the return policy does not allow for returns. I threw away the entire order (since I could not return I opened one package and made pancakes...they were so bad I tried to feed them to my dog but she would not eat them either). Avoid this product at all costs! You can buy a much better product by ordering the REAL Atkins pancake and baking mix, which I will do next time! Do not be fooled by this company.
