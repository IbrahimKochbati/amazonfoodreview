If you're big coffee drinkers like my family, ordering in bulk like this is great and it never goes stale.  With coffee costing anywhere from $6.50 and up for a 12 oz package in the grocery stores, this is the only way to buy coffee.  I tried different  ands, but came back to Eight O Clock for value price.  I order Hazelnut and French Vanilla and mix them.  Ordering with Subscribe and Save lowers the price a little more, but you do have to watch that.  Found a huge price jump just before the French Vanilla was set to ship, so cancelled that one and ordered Coffeemasters (also a VERY good  and) instead.
