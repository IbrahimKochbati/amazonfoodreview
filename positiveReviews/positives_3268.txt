I am so happy that Bisquick came out with a gluten free version!  We've tried so many other  ands of pancake and waffle mix, and hands down, Bisquick is the BEST!  We just made waffles this morning, and both my husband and I were floored at how good they were!  The outside was crisp and the inside was soft.  With that said, it's not that great for pancakes or coffeecake.
