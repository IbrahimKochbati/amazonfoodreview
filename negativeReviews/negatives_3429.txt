First  taste:  Bold ish. I didn't get that full body taste that I expect from a bold  ew. Bold does not equal strong. I will say say that it is very dark if that is what you are after. Starbucks 'Espresso Roast' is a better example of a good, smooth, bold  ew.          Second  the packs:  I don't know if I got a bad lot of packs but I end up with sludge in my cup about half of the time. I've shaken the packs, closed the top in slow motion, pushed the packs manually onto the bottom needle and all the other things you may have heard to fix pack problems. This particular box does not show the top of the pack to be 'proofed out' with nitrogen.  I've used about 12 of a 50 pack box. I've had to clean my machine twice.          Planning to complain and return for a different product.
