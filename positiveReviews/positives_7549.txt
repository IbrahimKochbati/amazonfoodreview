There are so many miracle health products out there it's hard to know what's for real.  But enough people have said good things about these seeds that I decided to jump on the chia seed bandwagon and order up a bag.          ***Health Benefits***       extremely high concentration of omega 3 acids (more than salmon)       complete protein!  What does that mean?  I had to look it up too. :)  It means chia seeds contain all the essential amino acids your body needs.  So you could just eat nothing but chia seeds and survive.  Most veggies don't have that, meaning you need to mix and match various plant sources to get everything all the things your body can't synthesize on its own. 1 serving (10g   1 tbsp)   2g protein    higher than most other grains and seeds.  Other plant sources with complete protein   quinoa, soybean, buckwheat & hempseed       good source of fi e & potassium & calcium       3x the iron than spinach       low in cholesterol & sodium       doesn't have drawbacks like flaxseed does with being a laxative and doesn't have estrogen like effects          ***Uses & Taste***     Chia seeds taste pretty good!  Rather, there's no strong taste the way sesame does, so you just have more of a crunchy texture if you eat them dry, or a thicker jelly like texture if you soak them in water for a little bit.          Ideas for use: In a salad, added to smoothies, in a  eakfast granola or yogurt, in oatmeal, used as an egg replacement in baked goods, on sushi, to make iskiate (chia fresca)    a Tarahumara energy drink, or just straight up have a spoonful.  I recently made pancakes and threw in a few tablespoons and it worked out great.          One thing to note is these seeds can stick in your teeth, so be sure to do a quick mirror check after eating them. :)          ***This  and***     I haven't bought any other  and of chia seeds, but this one works so why switch?  Seeds tasted fresh when I opened the package and stayed fresh during the 2 months it took me to go through my bag.  Bag is resealable, price on Amazon was better than in stores   a good buy.          Overall I'm feeling pretty good about eating chia seeds instead of cupcakes although that has me thinking...next kitchen experiment   lemon chia cupcakes!  Bye bye poppy seeds!
