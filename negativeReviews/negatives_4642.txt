PROS  Product was well packaged bonsai tree appeared to be healthy  packaged instructions on how to take care of plant  seller contact information encouraging buyer to contact them with questions.          CONS  as is to be expected with any plant purchase, the one I received varied significantly from picture in description different bowl shape and color  my tree appears to be less established  tree bends drastically on the ground, not straight like photo  also growing instructions left out trimming advice although I would imagine that can be obtained online.          Overall  good service, just expect to get something that differs from the photo could be as good, or it could be worse.
