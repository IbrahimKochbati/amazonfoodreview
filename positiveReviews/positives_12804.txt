My family and I love Switch! It's delicious and healthy   all juice and not all the added sugar that comes with other carbonated drinks. Switch used to come in bottles, but the cans are much more convenient and easy to recycle. The Kiwi Berry flavor is my favorite flavor, but all of the flavors are very tasty.
