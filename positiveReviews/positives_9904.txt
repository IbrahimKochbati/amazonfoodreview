I recently got more cravings for sardines and I didn't want to pay $2 3 for a can of sardines. I saw these and thought hmm... maybe I'll give it a try. Definitely worth the money. So I think in my opinion it tastes really good. The smoke flavor is there and it enhances the flavor of sardines. It's a pretty decent portion and easy pull tab. I haven't tried any of the fancier sardines like from Spain or something, so I don't know the difference. These are great by themselves or on crackers :) Overall, I would buy again.
