I'd been devastated when, recently, my previous favorite fenugreek seeds (which i use only for sprouts) began having 15% "HARD" (i.e., wouldn't soften even with 24 hours of soaking) seeds.  These have had 0% hard seeds and sprouted to 1 2 inch sprouts after soaking 24 and then growing 24 hours.  Very gratifying.  Have them every day!
