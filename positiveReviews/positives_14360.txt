My 10 lbs chihuahua doxie mix is a picky eater.  He isn't motivated by food at all, and it's always a trial and error when it comes to trying out a new treat.  His treats of choice are freeze dried tripe, freeze dried liver, freeze dried chicken   you get the idea.  The boy has expensive taste   lol.          That said, since he's now nearing the 9 year old mark, I wanted to begin giving him Glucosamine and Chondroitin for his hips and joints.  I started to notice that he has become a little reluctant to jump up on the bed, preferring to be helped up.  I think this is happening due to getting older. My usage of these treats is to help with prevention   better to start early before it's too late, you know?          Feeding him pills is a hassle, and I'm already giving him globs of peanut butter a day to hide his    "
