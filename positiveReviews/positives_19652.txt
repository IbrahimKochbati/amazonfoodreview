Upon receiving these, I was very surprised regarding such good packaging of the product, but upon eating it was amazed. This vegetarian product is one of the nicest I have had the pleasure to enjoy for quite a while. I cannot compare this to the real thing, since I have never tried the real thing, but if this is not acceptable to vegetarians, vegans and non vegetarians, I would be most surprised.
