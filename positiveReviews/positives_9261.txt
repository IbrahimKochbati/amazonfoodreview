I have been buying these chicken jerky treats every month via Amazon's subscription for the past six months and the bags aren't enough for the three dogs and one cat who love these treats.  All I have to do is shake one of these bags and all four come running into the kitchen.  Even the well behaved old girl walks in hoping for her treat.          These are the only treats I feed my dogs.  They don't get junk dog biscuits or fake sausages that smell like turpentine.  All they get are these treats, two a day per dog.  When I take them out hiking, they get extra treats for extra energy.          The cat always insist on his own slivver, too.          These treats are easy to pack, don't spoil easily, don't smell and are a lightweight and healthy treat for any four legged pet. Sure, the treats are a bit pricy but my pets are worth it.          UPDATE 24 Feb 2012:  My subscription over the past year kept going up, from a very reasonable USD 19 to a shocking USD 28.  That last price hike was just too much so I cancelled my S&S and am now buying a competitor's product that is much more affordable.  I took a star away because this product is now longer affordable.
