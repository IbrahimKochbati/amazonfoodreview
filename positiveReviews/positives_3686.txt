Our dog has always been a little on the lazy side, and his coat has been fairly unhealthy looking relative to other dogs we've had in the past. When he began to start smelling on top of it, we decided to change his dog food to see if perhaps his stomach was becoming upset by his current food.          After about a week on the new food, he had noticeably more energy and his coat started to become much healthier. On top of that, the odor that he emitted started to subside until it was no longer there.          We really didn't expect it to be so drastic. We're very happy with Newman's Own dog food.
