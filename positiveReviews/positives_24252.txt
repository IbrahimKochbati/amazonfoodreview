My local coffee shop has me addicted to their 20 oz vanilla chai lattes. At $3.90 a pop I was spending a lot of money.  I asked what  and they used, need nutritional information, of course!  They told me it was Big Train Chai Vanilla.     It's important to follow the directions on the can.  I made mine with just milk with a yucky result.  Use the water with a little milk as there is milk powder in the mix.          WARNING:It's addicting!!!
