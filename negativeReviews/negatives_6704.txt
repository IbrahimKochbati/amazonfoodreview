Our dog has not figured out how to use this toy.  He loves food and eats it quickly if we put it in his bowl but is not particularly curious and tends to leave things he does not see as his alone.  For instance, he will not bother an open bag of dog food if it is in the pantry and easily accessible to him.  Our dog's  other has a similar toy and figured it out with few demonstrations.  Construction seems somewhat sturdy but it has not had much use in our household to really be tested.  Filling it is a bit of a pain as you have to unscrew the screw at the top.  It's easiest done with a screwdriver.  I don't think you should have to need a screwdriver to fill food but the way this is constructed, if you don't use one, the lid remains loose. You will need a small scoop or a funnel to not make a mess filling it.
