i've spent many years eating asian food and using asian ingredients in my cooking. I always used same shoyu, thinking there was not so big differences between these sauces. Such a surprised when i first taste Takesan Kishibori sauce, it opened a new world for me.     Since i tasted it, I found there are so many types of shoyu, depending what you need. Absolutely this one is not for cooking, better used directly as sauce, as for sashimi. Kishibori's color shows already a higher quality and the taste is deep, for supporting the taste of other dishes Usukuchi type can work better.          Bad (and good): once you open you cannot keep long, but this is because of natural ingredients with no additives. That's the price of quality...
