Krusteaz has been my favorite pancake mix for years.  My husband likes fluffy pancakes though and seeing that other reviewers said these were fluffy and delicious, I decided to give it a try. The mix looks like buckwheat pancake mix as you would expect from whole grain and it did come out nice and fluffy.  Husband and kids absolutely loved it. For once there were no bits of pancake left on their plates.  The only thing I didnt like about it was that, to me, it tastes like oatmeal in pancake form. Since my opinion is outnumbered in this house I will probably be buying this again for my guys.
