Ziwipeaks is a great, freeze dried diet for my dog. Though it runs a bit expensive and rare, it's a great all natural, product. I use the venison because I'm trying to stick with my mini dachshund's ancestral diet. My mini is 2 years old and has been using this food for about 16 months now. She has a beautiful, soft, shiny coat and is healthy and energetic. The food comes in these small bits which are softer and more manageable for little, 13# dogs. Ziwipeaks is an excellent  and if you want no grain or sugar additives and you want to give your dog one of the best quality foods available.          S. Joseph
