My 3 year old lab loves all treats, but not these.  When he loves a treat, he will eat it right away.  With these, he buries them in the backyard, lets them rot for a month or two, then hides them in my couch and I find them quite some time later (ew).  I really have seen him eat everything (whether he should or shouldn't), but he would not eat these if his life depended on it.
