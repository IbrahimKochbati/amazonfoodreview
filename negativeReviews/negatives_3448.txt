Very good but not great. Did not have the richness and depth of flavor desired.  We ordered this and the Green Mountain Double Black Diamond and between the two the Green Mountain was better.  We had no issues with the Emeril's as far as grounds in the coffee, etc.  The flavor is good but for a French Roast, it has not overcome that K cup issue of 'weakening' the richness of bold coffees.
