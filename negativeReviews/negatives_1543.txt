I just tried the Orange tangerine version of The Switched carbonated drink and overall I like it.  It tastes very similar to mandarin orange Slice but it uses natural juices and no HFCS.  If you are very concerned about artificial flavors and HCFS, but still want a carbonated drink, then Switched may be a good alternative.  I read the ingrediants list and it mainly included reconstituted juces and then aboiut another line of preservatives and additives, I would assume similar to those in commercial fruit juices.          Personally, I am more concerned about overall sugar and calories in my soft drinks so this little 8 oz can has 140 calories and 34 grams of sugar.  If memory serves me that is in line with the calories of most softdrinks and more sugar then most soft drinks.          Ultimately, i think this is a good tasing product, but the touted benefits doesn't outweigh the increased price and availability conpared to regualar soda.  I guess the key is still moderation.
