Bought this REALLY hoping to like it, as Stonewall's Jerquee is so expensive, but this stuff is repulsive.  For one thing, isn't jerky, by definition, supposed to be dry?  This stuff comes covered in a greasy, slimy coating.  After trying hard to get passed that, on to the actual jerky...it's not chewy, like jerky is supposed to be, it is too easy to bite off a piece.  And the flavor is beyond description, in a bad way.  I've tried almost all of the flavors now, and would never buy ANY of them again.  They have a weird perfumey taste.  So, they're slimy and taste awful.  That about sums it up.
