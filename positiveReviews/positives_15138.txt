My Dog is 10 Month now I wanna change her food to adult food.     We've been feeding her science diet big  eed puppy food. but there is a problem is She doesn't wanna eat her food everytime!     so we've been feeding her food with her favoraite treat and my dog want me and my hudsband to stand right around her.     It was very hard to feed her everyday.     Today I got Canidae Food!     We fed her like canidae and science diet together.     My dog jumped on her food bowl that I held. As soon as i put down her food, she ate like vaccum!     I was really surprised how fast she ate her food without treat.     and I searched onine reliable site.     I recommend!
