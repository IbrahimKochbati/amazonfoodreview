I purchased 3 containers of this cereal all having expiration dates in 2012.  The first container I opened seemed fine (at least I hope it is! I fed it to my 5 month old!) The cereal color was a pale whitish tan and there was relatively no odor to it.  Baby likes it so I am happy.  The second container I opened (again, same packaging, and good expiration date) had a totally different color   this time it was  ownish green. However, the worst part was the rancid smell.  It smells like rancid oil.  I opened the third container   same  ownish green color and and same rancid smell.  Very unhappy with this product.  I have contacted the company, but have had no reply yet.  I would not recommend feeding this to your baby.
