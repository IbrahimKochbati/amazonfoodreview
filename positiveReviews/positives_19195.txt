I generally do not drink the flavored coffee but our recent acquisition of the Keurig coffee maker I have been sampling many flavors.  Of all the 15   20 flavored coffees I have tried over the past 3 months the Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Coffee is BY FAR the BEST.  Fantastic blend of flavors and it actually has flavor...most others I tried seemed to have aroma but fell short in the flavor category.  I highly recommend trying this flavored coffee!
