I love Rosarita Refried Beans.  I grew up in Mesa Az where these beans were manufactured (at least a long time ago) and I have always thought they were the best on the market.  I can't always find them on the east coast so when I saw them available through Amazon I was thrilled.  They have a smooth texture and subtle taste so they can be used in any recipe.
