I've been using this product for almost a week now. Though I haven't a true Lucid Dream with it (yet!), I have noticed how much more vivid my dreams have become. I use about 2 droppers full in my cup of tea before bed (1 2 hour to 45 minutes prior to lying down), have no problems getting to sleep within 10 15 minutes, and wake up fully rested with no side effects whatsoever. I have been trying to compile my own dream dictionary for the past couple of years, but tend to have a hard time remembering most of the details from my dreams. Not a problem, since I've started using this product. If you're trying to get more out of your dreams, DEFINITELY give this product a try.
