These croutons transcend the simple name for stale  ead added to your soups and salads as filler. These tiny little croutons are so delicious, packed with garlicky, seasoned yumminess that has everyone who tries them shouting (with a mouth full), "Oh My God! What are these things?! They are delicious!" I ordered these accidentally a year ago while looking for a different kind of crouton, and it was one of the most fortuitous accidents in a while. My husband and I eat a lot of soup, and like adding croutons to our soups for crunch. When these are added to any food, they simply enhance the flavor, making your meal a total delight! When I opened the box of 12 packages and realized I had ordered the wrong thing, I passed some packages around to my sister, mother, and mother in law, because I had so many and it wasn't really what I was trying to order. As soon as I tried them, though, I was mad at myself for passing them around because they were delicious! Now everyone wants them and stalks my pantry for the box I keep hidden. These things are amazing!          They have a strong garlic flavor, but aren't too salty. They are very small and clump together a little because of the olive oil used to treat the croutons. Give these a shot and you won't be sorry. And don't let your family try them because you will have to hide them when they come to visit. I know I do!
