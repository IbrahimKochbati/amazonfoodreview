Looking for a good tasting jumbo sunflower seed that is not too salty and has an outstanding flavor?  Then these are for you!          They have an awesome flavor are jumbo size and the price won't hurt your pocketbook.  I would recommend them to anyone.  Unfortunately they are hard to find and when you do find some they fly off the shelf, so they must be good!
