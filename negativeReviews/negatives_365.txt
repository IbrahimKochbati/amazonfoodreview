I order these chips on a regular basis.  If you are doing Weight Watchers, these chips are 2 points a bag.  When this particular shipment arrived at my house, it was poorly packaged.  I received a case of crumbs instead of a case of chips.  This is the 1st time in the four times that I've ordered these, hopefully it won't happen again.
