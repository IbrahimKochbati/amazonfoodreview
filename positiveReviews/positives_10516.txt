I have been trying to maintain my weight for the last six months, and found that substituting my meals with 2 protein shakes helps me do just that. I enjoy drinking hot drinks because it allows me to savor them longer. I was very skeptical that this would taste awful, but I couldn't have been more wrong. I can't imagine drinking regular hot cocoa again now that I've found one that is actually good for me!
