I have a Golden Retreiver, and 2 labs.  All big dogs.  They love the chews BUT I caution you to PLEASE keep an eye on your dogs while they are chewing them.  The chews tend to soften as the dogs chew and chews often stick in the back of the dogs throat and I have to stick my fingers down to remove the last piece of chew.  I would never leave my dogs alone while eating any type of rawhide chew.
