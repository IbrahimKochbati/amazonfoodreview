I remember going with my mother to Payless drug store, which has turned into CVS Pharmacy here on the West Coast.  Payless used to sell these in the 80s and while the packaging is different now, the candy is still the same.  Boy are these good.  My mom got me hooked on them, and on the Milk and Honey ones too, and I just love them now just as much as when I was 10!  I am so glad to find these, the honey inside is very good, and the outside tastes like lovely solid honey.  I love ordering this larger pack since I can just grab a bar and tuck it into my purse and and eat these as a light snack or to freshen my  eath.  If you love putting honey on toast, or just eating it out of the jar, you will probably like these.  The honey inside is a light honey, not dark just in case that matters to you.
