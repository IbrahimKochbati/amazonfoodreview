Well, I had high hopes for these treats, which are small, and smell terrible. They are semi moist treats. Other than the smell, they seem like a fine product, just not for my boy Wesley. He was totally uninterested. He sniffed it once, and that was it. He wouldn't even chase it when it rolled across the room. (A clear poor sign.) So, although the resealable packaging is great, and the cat depicted on the bag is cute, this won't be a winner in our household. Perhaps a different flavor would be better.          One thing to note, Wesley has not had semi moist treats before, so that could be it as well. Hopefully your cat will have happier results!
