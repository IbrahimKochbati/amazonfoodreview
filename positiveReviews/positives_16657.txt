These treats occupy my dogs (quietly!) while they clean their teeth at the same time. The first time I tried them, I bought the large ones to cut in half so I'd get more for my money, but believe me, it was definitely NOT worth the hassle. They are very hard and hard to cut. The "Regular" size is perfect for my 50 65 lb. dogs.
