I love this product, and I wish it was easier to find in the stores.  For some reason, I can never find it. Our local stores will order it, but they won't call and let you know it came in.  By the time I get there, it's already all been sold.          This is a great side dish with a piece of chicken or a green salad.  I love it with vine ripened tomatoes, but my favorite way is to substitute Del Monte  and Italian Style Stewed Tomatoes. It amps up the spicy factor by quite a lot, but it's not hot spicy, just very flavorful.  Try it this way during the winter months when decent tomatoes cannot be found.
