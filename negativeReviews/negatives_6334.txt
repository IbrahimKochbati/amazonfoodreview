I am generally a fan of NOH products, in fact I ordered a 12 pack of the Fried Rice seasoning to get free shipping when I ordered a 12 pack of Char Siu which is why I was ordering in the first place.          The package says you can season up to four cups of rice, I did about that, and it was basically bland, and tasteless.  I used pork Char Siu in with it, and that was fine, as I said, I am a big fan of NOHs Char Siu, but this stuff was about useless.          I added extra Teriyaki sauce, just to give the rice some flavor, and it actually got better tasting the 2nd day.  I am going to try this again with about 2 cups of rice, just to see if its better in a smaller batch. I mean I got 11 more pouches of this stuff, I gotta find some use for it.
