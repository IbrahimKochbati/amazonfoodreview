I toyed with the idea of getting a Keurig for a long time.  I couldn't justify the cost for a while, but after receiving a couple of Amazon gift cards for my birthday, I decided to go for it.  Best decision ever!  I love this thing.  This particular model JUST fits under my cabinets in my kitchen.  It's so convenient and quick.  I don't like being so wasteful with the k cups, so I bought an Eco Cup that works well.  My only complaint is that even the large size doesn't fill an entire coffee mug, and I sometimes wish it dispensed more coffee.  That being said, it really is so easy to use, and I don't regret buying this for a second.
