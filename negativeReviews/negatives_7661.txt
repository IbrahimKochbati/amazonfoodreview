Is there such thing as a too soft cookie? Yes, yes there is. I am amazed these cookies managed to get shipped to my place without falling apart in the wrapper. They crumble pretty badly when you take them out. In terms of texture, there is something just off about them. They are soft cookies but do not mistake that description as chewy. In fairness, quaker doesn't really call them chewy anyway, but I think some people will expect that they are. Sweetness is... okay, but it feels lacking in a cookie. Yes, I realize these are supposed to be wholesome, but the problem is there are better tasting soft cookies out there that are natural, organic and wholesome. Kashi has better line of cookies that I love. I am not saying that because I am on a health food kick or need to throw out  ands that claim to be green and "whole". I still like a Grandma cookie now and then, and Sandies and Grasshoppers. These cookies are... just not satisfying.  If you don't like chewy, Kashi or other name  and cookies, maybe these would be for you because texturally and taste wise they are different.           Just a warning, if you hand these to children, expect to pick up crumbs wherever they go.
