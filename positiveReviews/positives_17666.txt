Puroast is mean to be a low acid alternative to regular coffees. The Low Acid French Roast packet made a nice strong pot of coffee. The flavor is above average for a ground coffee. Most noticeable is a smooth finish with minimal aftertaste. This would especially make a nice evening cup of coffee, or go well when served with or after meals that are more likely to bother your stomach. It is certainly a product I will consider using again. A good idea, and if you're one who is bothered by the acidity of coffee, this innovation will certainly be welcome. And though I don't have the means or motivation to test their low acid claims, Forbes.com published an article backing up their claims both to low acid content and significantly reduced symptoms for those normally effected by coffee. So I'd say this is a product with good flavor that warrants checking out.
