I agree with San Diego.  I return to Newman's Own time after time after trying several others (and there are some other good ones out there, Deidrich's being one). As for Sam's Club, yes, Newman's is less expensive there, but we now live two three hours to the nearest store, so Amazon is a good second choice as I would spend the difference in gas alone.
