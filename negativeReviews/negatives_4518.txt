I was hoping that the new recipe would include more protein fat than the original, since in my opinion, the protein essential fatty acids that are abundant in salmon are the best reasons to feed it to a baby.  Well, I should have taken the time to research the nutritional info before purchasing, because this item actually contains less of both. If you can manage to get your baby to eat an entire pouch of this, he she will get a mere 1 gram of protein, or 6% of the RDA for a baby, .5 grams of fat, and 50 calories.          That makes this a nutrient poor food.  And HappyBaby a pretty despicable company.
