The chocolate chunk cookie mix has one big advantage to it as it can be mixed by hand and come out just as well as when made with a mixer.  I make the cookies smaller than recommended on the package and have over baked them using the recommended baking time.  They come out crisp but keep well and taste very good.  Compared to the complicated chocolate chip recipe I make from scratch, these cookies are absolutely great!
