The flavor of the fruit enclosed is outstanding(bluberry) and if there is  a drawback it is that the blanket that encloses the fruit is a bit thick (unlike this companys fig bars) and pastry textured.Flavored with cane  syrup(not fruit juice).150 cal per bar,and low in fat and the carbs(29) not too bad considering the great taste.
