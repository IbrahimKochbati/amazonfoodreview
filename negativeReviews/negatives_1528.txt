If you like Orange Crush you may become a fan, but it's too much of a hy id for me. The main two ingredients are reconstituted apple and grape juices. It contains something called Acerola juice, which is high in Vitamin C (and indeed the can contains 100% of your C and 20% of your A).          The sugar content is high   34 grams   which  ings the carb percentage up to 12% for the day and the calorie count to 140. I think it tastes too acidic for anyone who is watching carbs and calories to be willing to "spend" them on Switch, which almost tastes like carbonated TANG.  I've tried the Ooba drinks, and they are much lighter and more refreshing. Guess I'm just not ready to make the Switch!
