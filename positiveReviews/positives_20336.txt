I am very happy with this cereal. I am confident feeding it to my infant because it's organic and it has probiotics. My son needed to be on a powder probiotic supplement that was VERY expensive. It's nice to make the transition and have it included in his food at this price point.          When I first tried the cereal, I made a small amount (1 tsp cereal and 4 tsp  east milk) and made it runny (easy to do, as there is nothing glue like about this cereal). He wasn't too fond of the experience   but that's not a reflection on this product at all. He's 5 months old now so I mix 1 tablespoon of the powder with 1 oz of  east milk and drop in one cube of frozen veggies (I make my own food and freeze it in ice cube trays). I heat it all up, mix it well and he's in HEAVEN! He prefers carrots & cereal, and butternut squash & cereal... and his favorite is bananas & rice cereal. I've tasted them all and while it's more bland than I had imagined, it's tasty. It's not sweet, just like a mellow oatmeal. This cereal also retains it's consistency throughout the feeding and also holds onto its warmth   which is great for a son like mine who will only eat warm hot food!          Also, there's been no constipation diarrhea side effects like most first foods will have on your baby   a welcomed relief!
