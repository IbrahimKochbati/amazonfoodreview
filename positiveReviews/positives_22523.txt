I never really cared for popcorn before...at least none of the "home" popcorn.  The only place I'd eat popcorn was at the theaters because the butter flavor was so good.  I purchase a kettle popper for our home and ran across a deal Great Northern Popcorn...... OMG it is GOOD!!  Just like the movies but way cheaper and I can enjoy it in the comfort of my own home!  YUMMY!!!
