I enjoy grabbing lunch at various greasy spoons around the area.  Man, a burrito or the three taco deal from Vallarta with fried onions is making me hungry right now.  So, I need something that combats that after lunch ...  well, you know.  Anyway, these Tic Tacs do the trick.          What would I have wanted to know prior to purchasing these (as Amazon suggests I include in my review) .... humm:          Can I use them like a boomerang?     Is the powermint like the wonder twins powers?     Could I use them to mint coins?     Why is the Tic Tac label green when the mints are blue?     Is the power mint like a power bar?          Unfortunately, I cannot answer the above questions for you.  I pondered them before purchasing the item, but have come to rest with leaving them as some of life's unanswered questions.  I can tell you that these little buggers will knock your  eath back to minty fresh even after that greasy spoon burrito.
