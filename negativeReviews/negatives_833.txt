This hot chocolate tastes like hot sugar water with a pinch of coco in it. Although, even the sugary taste is weak, and tainted by the flavor of the artificial sweetener sucralose. The consistency is watery and bland. This is when I made the 8oz cup as directed by the directions on the box.          I do not recommend this product.
