I don't understand(believe) the ONE negative review posted here. Why are they the only dissatisfied customer?          My 1 2lb Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla Beans came in 2 days, and the whole box had the wonderful aroma of vanilla even before opening it!     My dark, 8" long, moist pliable beans were vacuum packed and tucked neatly in a sturdy zip bag.          Oh the plans I have for these gems!!          I'll be sure to post an update after utilizing my beans!
