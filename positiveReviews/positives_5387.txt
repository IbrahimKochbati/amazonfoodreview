Empty K Cups, miniature filters and lids allow you to use your own favorite ground coffee.  If you buy roasted beans and grind your own, this is the solution for you.  One scoop in the K Cup, put on the lid and pop it into your Kuerig.          I shied away from buying a Kuerig because I love my Kenya AA from Talk 'n Coffee in Deptford, NJ.  They roast it dark, grind it almost to percolator coarseness for me (sigh) and ship it to me here in Florida.  I had tried mesh filters but even with my custom percolator grind, I'd get grinds in the  ew.  The special cup holders looked like a labor intensive solution too so I stuck with my Mr. Coffee.  When I saw the disposable cups on Amazon, I ordered them along with the Keurig.          This works great!  A single fresh hot cup of Kenyaa AA dark roast whenever the spirit moves me and no worries about having to make a partial pot for only one cup.  I'll have Talk 'n Coffee grind the beans a little finer for the Kuerig on my next order.  I re ground my percolator grind a little finer and the portion strength is now perfect for the travel mug size.          Kathy buys loose tea and uses the disposable K Cup for a mug whenever it suits her fancy.  It's a lot easier than the little metal thingie with the chain and waiting for a kettle to boil.          One benefit I hadn't counted on is that clean up is easy and fast   pluck the used disposable K Cup from the Kuerig and toss it in the trash.  No more having to service the coffee pot!          To save time in the morning, I used to set up Mr. Coffee the night before but now I just make up the disposable K Cups a dozen at a time and we fresh  ew by the cup in the morning for several days running. We actually use less coffee after evaporation and "who doesn't want the last cup" considerations.  I think the savings on coffee and Mr. Coffee filters is probably  eak even with the cost of the disposable K Cups so net net, they seem free.          Only one con from me.  It's hard for these arthritic old hands to fit the lid on due to the filter overlapping the top of the K Cup.  Folding or cutting away the overlap causes grinds in the  ew and a clogged lower needle.  I don't think there is a cure without the downside being greater than the problem.  I have found patience and not over loading the K Cup to be the best solution.
