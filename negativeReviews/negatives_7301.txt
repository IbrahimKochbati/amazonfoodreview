I usually buy this at our local Whole Foods or Harris Teeter it's a great product but when I ordered it from Amazon all but 2 out of 12 cans arrived dented. Amazon quickly replaced the order but in the replacement case 9 cans were dented. That is really unacceptable. They did refund my $ but I really want the pumpkin so I am going to try one more time and order it again and see if I can get a case of undented cans.
