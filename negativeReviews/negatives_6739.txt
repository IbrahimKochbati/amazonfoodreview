I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT HAD AN ALLERGY ALLERT BUT IT FORGOT TO MENTIONED THAT IT IS MANUFACTURED IN SAME FACILITY WITH OTHER NUTS AND THAT IT MIGHT CONTAIN EGGS.  WE HAVE A PERSON WITH PEANUT AND EGG ALLERGY AT HOME AND ENDED UP HAVING TO CALL RESCUE AFTER TWO BITES.          OUT OF THE 6 CANS, WE ONLY OPENED 3 AND THEY WERE ALL MELTED OR BROKEN.          TERRRIBLE.
