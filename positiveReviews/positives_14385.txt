We have a 15 year old arthritic Siberian Husky.  We had tried over the counter glucosamine for him, but it did nothing.  A vet then told us most pills sold over the counter are poor quality and do not sufficiently digest and enter the bloodstream...for humans or dogs.  We later tried Zuke's Hip Action, and definitely saw a difference.  We have been using them for several years now.  Our dog's arthritis progressed, so he's now on prescription meds and senior dog food (which also has gulcosamine), but he's doing great...running up and down stairs, playing.  People think he's a puppy!  He quickly tired of the beef flavor Hip Action, but still loves the peanut butter flavor.  We'll continue using this product as long as we have our dog.
