We loved this product and I just received my new order.  I noticed the packing changed which made me check the label.  The ingredients and NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION HAS CHANGED!          Old Ingredients & Nutrition (sample)     Natural Coconut Water     Natural Pineapple Juice     Cane Juice     Vit C.     Natural Fruit Flavor     Sodium 115mg     Potassium 299mg     Sugar 16g     Vit C 172%     Calcium 1.3%     Iron 1.8%          New Ingredients & Nutrition (sample)     Coconut Water     Pineapple Juice     Sugar     Ascorbic Acid     Natural Flavor     Sodium 45mg     Potassium 425mg     Sugar 20g     Calcium 2%     Iron 0%     Magnesium 2%     Vit C 210%     96% Juice          Maybe the new box is misprinted as it says 96% juice and the packaging clearly says "a splash of pineapple and other natural flavors".          No thank you...I'll be cancelling my subscription.  I don't why the change.
