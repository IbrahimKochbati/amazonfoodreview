The FDA has issued a warning about pet treats made in China.  You have to look for the small print on the back of the bag, but these are not made in the USA.  Please don't trust the health of your pets to Chinese made treats.  I have personally lost a beloved pet.  I didn't know about the FDA warning.  Educate yourself before purchasing these.
