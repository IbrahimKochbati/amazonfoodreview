These are great   my entire family loves them.  It is a great addition to my son's school lunch   and I have the satisfaction of knowing it is a better alternative then the normal "chip" out on the market.  Great flavor   BBQ and Sourcream & Onion are our favorites!  Love the single serve bags   wish you could buy them at the store   but for now I will continue to purchase on Amazon...  because of the great service and varieties!
