Despite the other review, this is the best BBQ sauce I've ever had.  It's a mustard based sauce, so if that's not your thing, move on.  It's not really that spicy (used to be called Habanero sauce), in fact, that would be my only complaint.  As much I love shopping Amazon, buy this direct from their website if you're going to order 6 bottles or more, it's cheaper ($55 12).  It's great on pulled pork and burgers.  Try it!
