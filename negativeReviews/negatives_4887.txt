I bought two of these at a pet store. One for 100lb plus dogs. My lab is 45 lbs. She consumed it in minutes.     I also got a small one for my older chihuahua mix, she consumed it within minutes.     Long lasting they are not !          Bull sticks are the only item I have found that last a while. However they smell bad. Even the so called orderless ones.
