I usually order this item from Amazon since our local grocery stores (Walmart and Safeway) do not carry it, but. . .I would expect that buying in bulk would be cheaper, but instead, six bags of 26.4 ounces is eight cents PER OUNCE more expensive than buying six boxes of 11.5 ounces.  Shouldn't it be the other way around? This is not a savings at all.
