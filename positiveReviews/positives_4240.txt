After coming back from living in England for several months, I craved me some coriander (carrot & coriander soup, coriander spiced omelettes...)  But even in the Bay Area, this spice been surprisingly hard to find, especially at a decent price!          Buying it in bulk from this seller, the price is unbeatable, and the quality seems comparable to the name  and, top notch stuff in England.  One thing to note is that the coriander comes in metallic pouches (not resealable), so if you want to keep it in a resealable bag container, you'll have to provide your own.          Also, I wish I had found someone to split this with me, since it seems like even 1 bag will last me forever!
