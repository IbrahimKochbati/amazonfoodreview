These 'ramen like' noodles will be a tasty addition to anyone's lunch repertoire   providing of course you have a microwave handy at the office\shop.  The 'Spicy Chicken Flavor' lives up to it's name.  These noodles bite back!  :)  ((But nothing too bad))  I have a love of all things spicy    but I found these to be somewhere in the low to middle range of heat\spice.  Each bowl contains 2 servings    inging the total calorie count to 380 per bowl (Total Fat   7g, Cholesterol   0mg, Sodium   890mg, Total Carb   28g, Protein   4g).  The package is used as the bowl.  You peel back the lid, and add room temperature water to the easily seen line   then microwave for 3 min.  Or you add hot water and wait 3 minutes.  There were a few small chunks of chicken   ideally I would want more.  The packaging indicates it has 30% less sodium   but at 890mg of sodium I would hate to see that extra 30% back.
