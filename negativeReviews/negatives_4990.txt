The item was delivered here in great condition. My 5 month old American Eskimo likes the tug a jug even without any treats or kibble inside. But after a few uses a small piece of the bottom lid chipped off. My puppy didn't even play roughly with it. It could have been dangerous if he ate it. Luckily I was there.
