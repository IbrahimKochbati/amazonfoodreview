I had the Lavazza Super Crema and loved it but I wanted to give this a try for my espresso.  I really like the Super Cremas flavor, it was nutty, fruity, and a bit of chocolate.  This just tastes like any coffee you get at any gas station to me, at least when making espresso.  Its not bad, but to me its just ordinary. I guess purists may like it, I dunno, when it comes to coffee I may not be as sophisticated as some.  Kinda like wine, I like it sweet and red, not so dry.  I don't want my coffee to taste like coffee, I want it to be a treat.
