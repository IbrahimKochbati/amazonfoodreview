Our 3 month old puppy loves these! She would do anything to get one. I love the ingredients, and knowing that I'm giving my dog something good for her. we've had the bag for a few days now and they're still as soft as ever, which is great. These treats do kinds smell...but that should mean they're delicious to a dog right? :)
