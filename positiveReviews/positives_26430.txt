We started getting these from our vet after W**m**t treats poisened our Bichon Cavilier King Charles mix. She spent 10 days in the hospital on IV's, and at death's door. Our 16 pound Cavachon as well as our 100 yellow lab get so excited when it's time for their daily treat! They have been on these treats for several months without any problems.
