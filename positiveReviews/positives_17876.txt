When I was a boy growing up, as part of a large family, my Mom used to buy whichever meat was the cheapest at any given time ... beef, chicken, or pork.  When pork offered the best value, we were usually fed one of three things ... pork roast, pork ribs, or pork chops. Mom almost always used "Shake N Bake" for the pork chops, and I loved it.  As a parent now with his own family, the missus and I decided to give Shake N Bake (ab eviated henceforth as S&B) a try, to see if it matched the memories of our youth.          Each packet claims to season two pounds of pork, and based on our experience, I agree.  (We typically cook 4 pork chops at a time, that weigh a bit under 2 pounds, and all of the chops were well coated.)  Pork often dries out when you cook it, and the S&B actually helped keep them moist and juicy.  With regards to flavor, it tasted almost exactly as I remembered, which was a pleasant surprise.  Savory, but not too spicy or too salty.  My wife and two of my children also enjoyed the pork chops and flavor.  My third child, a 6 year old, didn't really like it, but since he doesn't like how much of anything tastes lately, I wouldn't count his "no" very highly.          I recommend S&B as a nice way to season your pork or to take a trip down memory lane.  : )
