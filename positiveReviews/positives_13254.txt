I am addicted to this stuff. Price wise, I can buy this at WalMart for $3.50 a package, and using coupons I can get that down to $2.50 a bottle. So now I just buy 6 or so at WalMart when I start running low. I have bought a hundred of these and they are always in good condition with no lumps and alway filled completely. What can I say about a creamer except I love the taste!
