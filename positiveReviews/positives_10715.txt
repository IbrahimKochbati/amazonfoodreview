Lily, my fourteen year old golden retriever volunteered to test Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats. I didn't tell her that they were good for her. After all, treats are supposed to be yummy "extras". When I gave her one to try, she gave it the sniff test and put it down to think about. A few seconds later she picked it up and chomped it up. A bit later I gave her another. This time there was no delay. She ate it with gusto!          Aside from passing the taste test, these treats are really good for a dog. Wheat free, these treats are made from barley, lamb and other natural ingredients. Each treat is a rectangular cookie, scored so it can be snapped into two treats. Lily would like me to point out that there is no reason to waste energy dividing a treat. She has no trouble eating the whole thing. I reminded her that smaller dogs might enjoy a more compact treat, so she reluctantly agreed that the scoring is a good idea; but just for small dogs, not her.          The treats smell good to humans and based on the ingredient list, are a healthy addition to any dog's diet. The price for a pack of six bags (I didn't count, but a good number in each bag) isn't bad compared to other premium dog treats (I pay $5 for a 20 oz box of natural dog treats). The Newman's Own treats are 10 oz to a package, making them a bit expensive, but not bad considering the quality.
