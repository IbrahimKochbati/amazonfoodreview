I want to say up front that I hate the taste of stevia. I tried it years ago when it first became the natural sweetener to try. I gagged. I tried it again in its updated "better" offerings. Still don't like it. Not even the popular Truvia could win me over.          But it's getting to be summer, and though I mostly drink water coffee tea coconut milk, I wanted a nice summery change of taste without calories or sugar or aspartame. So, yeah, I tried this.          I decided to check out the grape first, as that one got consistently good reviews in the websites blogs I visited to see what folks are saying. I got it today.          I'm drinking it now WARM (arrived at my Miami doorstep 15 mins ago, so imagine it's not anywhere near cool here). I figured I'd taste it and, if I didn't like it, not bother to have it take up precious space in my crowded with produce fridge. I had a worry that my stevia repulsed tastebuds would yell, yet again.          Well, blow me down with a carbonated  eath! This is GOOD! So good, I decided to come on and review it positively.          I'm guessing the major lifting work of sweetening is being done by the erythritol (which I've had in stuff before and never bothered me, though I did sense the cooling effect). That's fine by me. I don't get weird rumbly tums from erythritol, and it's never had any funky effect on me like some report with aspartame.          So, hey, I have a summer soda pop! I'm gonna order a six pack of various other flavors to see if they measure up. The grape definitely measures up. And I'm even enjoying it WARM. :) I can't wait to see how it is fully chilled.          And I appreciate that it doesn't have weird purple coloring. It's a clear fizzy liquid in my cup. I hate weird colored sodas.          Thanks, Zevia. Nice grapey treat.
