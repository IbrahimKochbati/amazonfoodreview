Both of my dogs are in love with this product. They get so happy when I give it to them and drink it all up right away. Two of my cats enjoy it quite a bit, but my third cat wouldn't even try it. She sniffed it and walked away. I would definitely recommend this product as so many people feed their cats real milk, which is terrible for them. Cats are lactose intolerant! Feeding cats regular milk can (and usually will) cause loose bowels and real stomach discomfort. This stuff has lactose enzymes in it to help them digest it. Also, it often goes on sale at PetSmart for .99 cents or $1.19. Even at full price it's still relatively inexpensive. The only real negative comment I have is that if you don't use it within a few days of opening it, the spout gets all crusty and the milk at the bottom of the carton gets thick. It may still be fine to feed this to them in that condition, but I am paranoid and often end up throwing out half the carton because I don't use it quickly enough.The ingredients are awesome, actual real low fat milk plus a digestive enzyme plus added taurine (an essential nutrient for cats).          PS  MUCH better than the Whiskas CatMilk. (That stuff is watered down and loaded with a bunch of random, non natural ingredients)
