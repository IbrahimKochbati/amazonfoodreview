I received my Shake 'N Bake today and made pork chops for dinner. This is still one of the best products out there. It really is quick, easy and flavorful. Shake `N Bake makes an ordinary pork chop a little more special. Having Shake 'N Bake for dinner did  ing me right back to my childhood and I was happy that they haven't changed this product over the years. It is a great staple to have in your pantry. I only wish I had gotten more because the chops were so delicious!
