My dogs looove these treats!  They actually smell pretty good..like sweet potato. lol     the only concern I have is that they do say they're a product of China..which obviously concerns me considering the media frenzy about dog treats from china.  But it say's processed in US.  Not sure if that means the quality meats the FDA or not..  so far so good  I have mixed feelings about this product.  I'll probably order it again..simply because there are have been no cases involving duck.
