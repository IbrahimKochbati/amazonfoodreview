Here we have a refreshing drink, not one you'd want to drink three of in a row but just one for a picker upper or to quench an urgent thirst.          The flavor (orange tangerine) is subject to peoples' personal tastes but I liked it okay. It's not the best drink I've ever tried but it's okay for something different. People will have to make their own choice as to whether to buy it or not in regard to the price.          Unfortunately, either the manufacturer, the Amazon Vine people, or both, goofily (is there such a word...? if not, I just invented it) placed two useless stickers on the can which covered half of the nutrition facts on the can. There was plenty of space to put them elsewhere but some non thinker failed to use his or her marketing sense. So all I can tell you on that topic is that there is a 1% sodium content, total carbs are 30 grams, and there are 140 calories per 8.3 ounce serving (1 can.)          I wouldn't buy this product but that's chiefly because I normally drink only non sugar beverages.
