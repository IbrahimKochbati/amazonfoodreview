I have not seen this in stores for years and ran across it on Amazon just last week. I am diabetic and usually make my own soups but sometimes its nice to just open a can and enjoy. This is pretty low in carbs and I was thrilled! I ordered two cases and hope Amazon keeps getting it in. The flavor is great and you can also use this with lc noodles or over chicken etc. Yum!
