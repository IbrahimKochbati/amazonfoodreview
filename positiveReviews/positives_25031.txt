I've had only Zango mangosteen juice and Thai mangosteen juice previously, so I didn't actually know what pure mangosteen juice was like.     It is very much like cocoanut milk. Almost the same color and consistency and an even milder flavor. There is no pulp or plant ground up in it so it is very smooth. Sometimes I drink my dose by itself, other times I mix it in any juice because this mangosteen juice doesn't change the flavor.          I've heard alot of health claims about mangosteen, pomegranate and acai but I really can't say it's done anything for me, I've only been taking mangosteen for a couple months. I just enjoy knowing I'm putting the good stuff in my system.     I like the Amazon automatic delivery system, too, since I can't find this locally, it saves me time and money.
