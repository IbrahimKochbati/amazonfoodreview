I grew up eating whatever peanut butter had the lowest calories, so I'm used to the taste that some people complain about. I've been adding a tablespoon of Skippy peanut butter to my protein shakes and this stuff has 1 4th of the calories and I don't notice a difference in taste.          This stuff is  very  fine. Practically peanut dust. You won't find any chunks of peanut in this stuff and it's really easy to pack it down. I'm afraid to see how much my jar will compact down to because I might feel a little ripped off.          But this stuff is great! As soon as I opened it I sprinkled a spoonful into my mouth   dry! It tasted just like peanut butter and had the same texture as smooth peanut butter. Good stuff. Really wish it was cheaper though!
