Popchip 100 calorie bags are a great snack that help me to control my portions.  I don't trust myself with the full sized bag!  These taste great and have a decent amount in the bags  there enough to satisfy me. They are not bland tasting like some baked chips.  I regularly order these and the BBQ flavor.  I have tried many other Popchip flavors (in the big bags) and these are my personal favorites! I don't know how them make them taste so great for so little calories  but thanks Popchips!
