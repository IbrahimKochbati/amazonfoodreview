This makes decent yogurt but not the best. It is not very good with skim or 1% milk. It does well with whole or 2% and a little powdered milk added in. I have the yogourmet incubater. I have to say the best yogurt I've made in it is Greek style using Yoplait plain Greek yogurt as starter. Very creamy and not runny and has just the right bite to it. I've used the Natren starter also, it is good too.
