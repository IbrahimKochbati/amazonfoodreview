This product is SO convenient. It is so nice to wake up and just hit a button for instant coffee and have so many choices for a different cup every day. This particular model came with a coupon for a first time free box of K cups! Which was a bonus. Only down side to this model is that there are only 2 sized of cups it can make and neither are big enough to fill a mug. Also the machine is noisy, but only when you are  ewing which is about 20 seconds. Such a please to have and a nice design. Loving it!
