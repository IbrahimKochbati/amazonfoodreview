Being something of an energy drink junkie, I was eager to try this out and see what it tasted like.  "Green Thunder"? What exactly does that mean..?  My first impression was somewhere between Monster or Mountain Dew, with the sweet tart ish flavor of Red Bull (even if the radioactive green color is a little unsettling).  Pretty good overall!!  Hard to believe it's zero calorie... I think it tastes great and usually end up putting in more than the two squirts that are recommended. I'm hoping I can use this to wean myself off of Red Bull, seeing as it's much cheaper and waaay lower in calories. In my opinion, Mio has done it again. $4 bottle isn't too bad a price; it's approximately what I can find in grocery stores.
