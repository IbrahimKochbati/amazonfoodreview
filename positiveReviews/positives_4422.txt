I first learned bout Tiki Cat while searching for responsible and healthy food for my cats. I tried many different  ands of cat food before Tiki Cat. I knew I had a hit when even my finiky cat came running for Tiki Cat food time. They seem to like the Sardines best, but I'm sure that every cat is different, and Tiki Cat has so many varities you're sure to find one your cat likes. Amazon has the cheapest price for this product, and it's delivered right to my door! I'll never have to drive to a pet store and pay extravagent prices for good cat food again!
