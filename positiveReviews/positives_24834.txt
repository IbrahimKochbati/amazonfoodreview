*****          This Echinacea Immune Support herbal tea from Yogi Tea is for the natural boosting of the immune system. It's an all natural tea made from organic peppermint leaf, organic ;lemon grass, organic Echinacea root (angustifolia, purprea, pallida), organic licorice root, organic cinnamon bark, organic spearmint leaf, organic fennel seed, organic lemon flavor, Echinacea purpurea root extract (phenols 12%), organic cardamom seed, organic rose hips, organic ginger root, organic burdock root, stevia leaf, organic mullein leaf, organic clove bud, astragalus root extract, organic black pepper, European elder berry extract (30% anthocyanins), natural cinnamon oil, natural cardamom oil, natural ginger oil. Whew! Lots of good ingredients!          The taste is unusual and hard to define, probably because there are so many interesting ingredients. It is slightly tonic y but very pleasant. I love all the things that these herbs are purported to do!          I am definitely impressed with Echinacea Immune Support and with Yogi Teas in general. Echinacea Immune Support comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.          Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Echinacea Immune Support tea is a superior blend of several species of Organic Echinacea Root (Echinacea angustifolia, purpurea, pallida) designed to boost your immune system. Each tea bag is made with organic Echinacea Root and Echinacea Root extract, containing the equivalent of 1,400 mg of Echinacea. Health practitioners for centuries have respected the powers of Echinacea, an herb that supports the body's natural defense system by stimulating production of immune system proteins, interferons, that regulate normal immune response. Furthermore, Echinacea supplies certain naturally occurring plant compounds known as caffeic acid derivatives, including cichoric acid, alkylamides and polysaccharides. These work together to stimulate the body's immune system. The blend is complemented with Astragalus, a stamina enhancing tonic that also boosts long term immune function, and European Elder Berry, which is immune enhancing and supports respiratory function. To support sinus function and promote clear  eathing passages, Organic Peppermint and Organic Lemon Grass are included.* Finally, Organic Cinnamon , Organic Fennel, Organic Spearmint, and Organic Rose Hips add a wonderful fragrant essence to this delicious herbal supplement."          There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. The box says, "When your immune system seems a bit down, drink 2 to 3 cups per day. For increased immune stimulation, drink 4 to 5 cups per day."          This tea has no caffeine and is entirely herbal. Note that this review is for the six pack of 16 count boxes, an excellent value overall. Compare it to other six packs of this same tea on Amazon to make sure it's the best value, though, as they are always cheaper than buying the single boxes, but some are better deals than others.          Highly recommended.          *****
