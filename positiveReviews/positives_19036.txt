Carbquik makes perfectly good biscuits, lousy pizza crust (alas, too soggy or too crumbly or both), and VERY good pancakes (toss a handful of blueberries into the batter for an extra treat).  I'm in the latter phases of the Atkins approach to eating, so I don't have to avoid things like  ead and biscuits as religiously as I did before (there's really nothing on Atkins that you can NEVER have), but thanks to this product I can enjoy dough batter based goodies much more often than I could if I was just eating the regular, carb heavy versions of these foods as an occasional treat.          Carbquik is admittedly a little pricey, but you get a big box of mix that should last you a while.  I ordered this from Amazon, but it actually shipped from the supplier "Carbsmart", which offers a variety of low carb items for those following a controlled carbohydrate approach to eating.  By the way, this way of eating has gotten me back to my college weight in record time, and with no trouble maintaining that weight now that I'm there.          A final tip about this product: be adventurous and doctor up the recipes on the box as you see fit.  For example, some melted butter and or a little grated parmesan cheese in the biscuit batter will make for a tastier, more interesting biscuit, and I already told you about the adding blueberries to the pancake batter thing.  Chopped strawberries in the pancake batter works great, too!  And I'm still determined to find a way to make decent pizza crust out of this stuff.
