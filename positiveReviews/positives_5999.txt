This soup is absolutely delicious!  The chicken tastes like real chicken   not processed "fake" meat.  And, the wild rice adds just a bit of yummy crunch.  For some reason I think it's way better than the chicken noodle one.  If you eat strictly organic, it's perfect for when you don't have time to make a fresh meal.
