It taste different from the peppercorns you buy at the market.  Can't quite put my finger on it, but it is just different.  Tellicherry black pepper is suppose to be one of the best in the world and if you are a pepper expert, which I am not, you might be able to pick out the little differences. Anyway it is a nice pepper and at a very good price through Amazon, also a plus compared to what you pay for just any old peppercorns at the supermarket. I will definitely buy them again and I love the individual little bags. Thanks Melina for a great product.
