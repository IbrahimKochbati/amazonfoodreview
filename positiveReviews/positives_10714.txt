These are great tasting dog treats but I don't like to spoil my puppies too much and would have preferred smaller pieces even for our Corgi. Our other puppy is about half his size. They are the hardest puppy treats we have tried so  eaking them into smaller pieces isn't a simple task even for a man's hands. I was worried how tough they would be for our puppies to chew but they didn't complain. In fact, they took a bit more time and didn't inhale them which is a good thing!
