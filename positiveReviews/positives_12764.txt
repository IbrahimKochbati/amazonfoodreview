This is the perfect after workout  eakfast.  I compared many oatmeals side by side, and this is by far the healthiest and best quality instant oatmeal on the market.  When my local store stopped carying this, I was fortunate to find it on Amazon.  Now my wife and kids started eating this, so we go through a lot of it, but I'm glad they're eating something as healty as this.
