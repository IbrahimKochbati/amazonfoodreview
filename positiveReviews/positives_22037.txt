I can't say enough about Keurig and their K Cups.  I made the transition from a regular drip machine to the K Cup machine two years ago, and I have never looked back.  I have recently expanded beyond just drinking coffee and the experience has been just as good.  These K Cups taste just like making a cup of tea with the bag in the hot water.  The only real difference is that my tea is made a lot faster.  I use the different cup sizes to give the tea different strength levels based off my mood.          Note: Sometimes, especially if you  ew a lot of coffee, you may want to run the K cup machine empty (without a K Cup in it) since this will help flush out any leftover coffee grounds and or "flavor".
