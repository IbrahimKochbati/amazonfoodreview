I love this oatmeal. My baby had dairy allergies so that I had to eliminate all milk products from my diet while I was nursing him. He would have really bad diarheaa whenever I had anything that had even a small amount of milk in it. Shortly after I started feeding this cereal to him, he stopped having that adverse reaction to milk. He has also been very healthy. He's almost 1.5 now and has only been sick once.  Now if only it would do something for his teething.. lol.
