Mine came with a wine soaked variety thats purple   i haven't tried yet , the cheddar is delicious and melts smoothly ...Marigold (actually has marigold bits in it)   very nutty, earthy soooo tasty my favorite so far and the bouche de chevre  mmm runny creamy delicious! I have never been disappointed by any of the igourmet cheese selections even if its different than pictured this is no different!
