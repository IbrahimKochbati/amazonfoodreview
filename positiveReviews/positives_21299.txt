Had purchased from Butcher and Packer some years ago, and most recently became pleased to re order a variety of different spices from themselves.     Package arrived very prompt, shipped very good condition,and each pound of spice packaged very professionally separated from the next.     Logically, Butcher and Packer are among the best assets for Amazon and its customers.     Shall order far more frequently than in the past,cause their level of quality has never decreased.     Anyone wanting to buy spices, i commend this vendor affiliated with Amazon.Keep up the good work.     Will submit same exact review for all items of order cause am not intending to review each one separately.
