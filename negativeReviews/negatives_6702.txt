I love rice and really had hopes that this product would be great. Rice can be a pain to make, with this only taking 90 seconds in the microwave, it was really appealing! Really I should have known better though... a product being cooked in a plastic bag is going to come out smelling like plastic. The smell of plastic was pretty stomach turning, couldn't possibly be good for you....
