So far a great choice for us. We mix this with either  east milk or home made pureed vegetables and our daughter loves it.          I'm just wondering what the natural source of DHA is that is in here, other than that, I am especially happy to see no added sugars, etc. So many commercial products have added sugar for baby food, so I make all other food, but this is great!
