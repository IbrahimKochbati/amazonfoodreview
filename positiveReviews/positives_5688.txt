I bought a bag of the blueberry version of this snack at Costco recently (well not just one bag.. i went back and got four!) They are really really good. Not too sweet, gluten free, vegan and all natural ingredients. At Costco they were $6.99. I was googling it to see if i could find the other flavors listed on the back of the package   cranberry and pineapple mango   and this listing came up. $18.25 is the current price listed. I mean this product is good, but not THAT good. I wonder if the price listed is a typo.
