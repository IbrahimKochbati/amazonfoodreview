Chocolate fudge is the best. The rest of them don't taste good to me. I am type 2 diabetic and went on the Atkins diet. I ate these on the way home from work, before dinner. I ate less, as a result. It took me almost a year, but I lost 32 lbs...felt great.. and was never hungry. I eat these bars even when I am not dieting. I love them. You feel full for at least three hours after eating one, so they work very well as a diet aid.          The Atkins bars are very delicious too, and easier to find here. But, they are not as high in protein and don't keep you full as long as these Think Thin bars do.
