I love hot cocoa and hot chocolate... and have tried many different  ands.          GHIRADELLI is by far the worst that I have ever tasted!  I honestly don't have any idea how they ever became famous for their hot cocoa.          This cocoa has an awful, stale taste... and you can tell that it is made of cheap ingredients.          It even tastes worse than the much lower cost  ands like Swiss Miss and Nestle.          If you want a REAL hot chocolate, look up MARIE BELLE.  It is thick and rich... not weirdly processed garbage like GHIRADELLI!!!
