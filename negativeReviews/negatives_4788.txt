First time experience with Lavazza Tierra! I have been getting the espresso bean from a local roasting company. I don't have any problem, but my wife wants more aroma from my espresso shot. The reason I got the Lavazza Tierra!     But, no success so far. I have the Bezzera bz07 machine with a Rockey grinder. I only got very light crema from Lavazza Tierra! also I don't smell any aroma. I tried pulling a shot with a bottomless portafilter, it looks very awful. I think the bean is old.
