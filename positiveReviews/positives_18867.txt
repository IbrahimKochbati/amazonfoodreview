i've never met a dog who didn't devour this food with tail wagging, tunnel visioned gusto. it looks like tiny pieces of beef jerky and if you have a picky eater they'll probably be delighted with this food.  it's grain free and super expensive but worth it    it has helped curb the awful gas of our 13 lb chihuahua min pin. as a bonus, his coat is shinier too. (now if we could just make his  eath & body odor better).... the only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the price.
