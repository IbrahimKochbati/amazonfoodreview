My sister is the real tea drinker in the family, I lean more toward coffee. But I was attracted to the idea of this tea: a Fair Trade product, totally organic, described as "bold and sweetly smooth," and I wanted to give it a try. Once I had opened the lid (double lid, actually) on the neat looking can and saw the incredibly dark and aromatic leaves, I knew I wanted this all to myself. True to its promise this Earl Grey tea is delicious. A strong tea, a smooth tea, no bitterness (my usual complaint about tea in general), and really does not need the addition of lemon, milk or sweetener   as a matter of fact, I think that would hide some of the more nuanced flavors I tasted here. I will definitely keep a can of this on hand for myself..... and I may even buy one for my sister.
