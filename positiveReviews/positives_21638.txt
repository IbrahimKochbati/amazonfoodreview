This is a fine (though perhaps not spectacular) tea.  I found the flavors  both the tea flavor and the fruit flavors  to be a little on the mild side for my taste, even when seeping the tea for significantly longer than the instructions recommend.  So if you prefer bold flavors, I would suggest you look elsewhere.  But if you prefer lighter, milder flavors, this is a very pleasant product.
