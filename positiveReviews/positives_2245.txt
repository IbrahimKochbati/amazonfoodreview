They melt in your mouth!  I think I found my perfect snack.     I love Oreos, but hate all the fat they provide to my diet.  By diet I mean the ability to eat everything in moderation.  I monitor how much fat I ingest for many reasons, health being the most important.  One package of these cookies had the same great taste of oreos with only 1 4 of the fat.     I also like the fact that they come in individual packages:  They don't go stale;  you can take them on trips, movies, park, etc.     Great tea or coffee cookies too!.... and, of course, good old milk.
