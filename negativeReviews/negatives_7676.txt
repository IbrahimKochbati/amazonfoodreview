As a self professed cookie connoisseur, I was excited to try out Quaker's new oatmeal cookies. Unfortunately I cannot express my disappointment enough. While they may not be hands down the worst cookies ever, they are far from even being mediocre and taste nothing like any oatmeal cookies I've ever eaten. They're a very dry and gritty cookie (I'm talking sawdust dry grit here) that taste of preservatives and, oddly enough, sugary blandness. If cardboard was more crumbly, I imagine it'd taste about the same with sugar and preservatives added. The chocolate and almonds may have an alright flavor, but what little is added isn't enough to salvage these cookies and the rest of the cookie overwhelms the taste of those two ingredients with its grit and dryness. After eating one cookie, I had absolutely no desire to have another one. Ever. Purporting to be a "healthy" cookie (relatively speaking, they are cookies after all), they do have four grams of fiber and three grams of protein, but at 180 calories with two grams of saturated fat, there are much better alternatives out there. Say, ones that actually taste good. And I haven't even touched upon the mega list of ingredients in these suckers, which is long, way longer than any "healthy" cookie should have. While the packaging has the proclamation that these are "Naturally Flavored", they also fail to mention there are artificial flavors included as well. You can be assured I'll not be getting these again and will be cautious about other Quaker products, those that venture beyond regular oatmeal that is, from now on. While each of the six cookies is individually wrapped to easily grab and go, it's almost as easy to take any cookie and put it in a baggie or container. I don't recommend    "
