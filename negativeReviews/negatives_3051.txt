I love awake tea, but I am mad that you can't get the labels off the tin to reuse it. Nor can you compost the nylon bags.  The packaging is not earth friendly.  Even though I love the tea leaves less chopped up, I buy the other packaging.  What's wrong with you Tazo? Starbucks?  It can't be that bad to use a different glue for the cute tins so we can store rubber bands in them!     It can't hurt your profit margin too much to use another fa ic for your tea bags.  As soon as you do I will be a loyal customer!
