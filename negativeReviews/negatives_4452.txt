I fed Canidae ALS (old formula) for 7+ years and my dogs thrived.  Canidae switched their formula (and mfg) and I immediately switched to another food afer the reported of problems.  My feed store talked me into trying their 'new' formula, and I went back to ALS   BIG mistake.  I have experienced 15 20+% weight loss, explosive diarreha, vomitting, lethargy. etc.  I have 5 dogs   60 100+ lbs, varying pedigrees, ages 1 to 12+   all sick (15 20% weight loss, poor coats, vomitting, etc.).  I have had to run complete extensive blood panels to rule out other health problems on all the dogs   bottomline   blood panels were OK, food (Canidae) was the issue.  What use to be a fantastic food is now a very dangerous food to feed.  An entire pack of dogs' health declined on the 'new' formula.  I switched foods (something other than Canidae) and my dogs are now recovering.  If you love Las Vegas and Russian Roulette feed Canidae   if want to avoid major Vet expenses and heartache choose another food.  Do your homework   research the Canidae ALS problems   then make the best 'educated' decision for you and your pets.              It's been a over a year since I originally posted review of this product, and I thought it was time for an update.          I still warn folks from feeding Canidae ALS...other Canidae formuals I don't know.  My dogs have recovered (thank goodness).  They are back to running the fenceline, greeting visitors, etc.   and not as sickly as they had become   aka the lethergic, diarreha, lost weight crew I was faced with.          I know there are a bunch of pros and cons out there on various websites concerning Canidae   and I use to be one of the biggest 'flag wavers' for Canidae....until the formula change and the Vet expenses I was forced to face.  Believe me   with a very heavy heart I cannot recommend Canidae any more.  I do not do this with a flare of being noticed on the Internet, any vindications against the company, or any personnal gain...just a great concern for the illnesses I've experienced with my 'pack' (5+ dogs).  It took several months (under Vet care & dry dog food changes) for my dogs to recover, and I don't want to see any other 'beloved family members' undergo what I've we've gone through.  Please, please, PLEASE check out [...] (a highly recommended (non bias)dog food analysis site).  They are still recommending Canidae ALS as a 5 Star (6 star being the highest rating) premium food to feed   with the caveate 'However, from a position of being a product about which DFA heard very few complaints, the number of animals we hear of that do not do well on this food appears to have risen substantially.'          All I ask is do your own personal research concerning this food, keep an eye on your pet's food reactions, and make the best 'educated' decision for your beloved 'four footed furry' family members.
