At the office I am surrounded by hungry snackers when I pull out these pretzels! I even order them in bulk with of my co workers.     They have a slightly dry taste compared with conventional pretzels but the nutritional content can't be beat. I love feeding my body with the complete protein and fiber the chickpea and wheat combo provide. I have and will continue to order these yummy snacks!
