I used it with my dog a couple dozen times, and she thoroughly enjoyed it.  One time she managed to unscrew the bottom, and with that experience, she fixated on the bottom as the "ultimate solution" for the last morsels that weren't coming out from tilting and dropping the toy.  She cracked through the hard plastic,  eaking both the lid and the jug.  The toy is advertised for "heavy chewers" but the container obviously doesn't hold up.  I hope the store will offer a refund.
