My wife and I have been ordering Larry's for over a year, and we're very happy with it.  It's very good quality, consistent roast, and with "subscribe and save" discount plus the free shipping, at Amazon, it's about $9 a pound delivered whenever we want it.  It's also Fair Trade and Organic, so you can feel vaguely happy for some coffee grower in a far off place while drinking it.  Great coffee, convenient availability, we'll be ordering this as long as they keep sending it at this quality and price.
