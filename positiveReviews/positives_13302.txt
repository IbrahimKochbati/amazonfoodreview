Believe the reviews  this is seriously awesome  I didn't miss the wheat at all, better than the mixes I've used that had gluten beyond a doubt  the only thing its missing is a scoop of vanilla ice cream!  I am a newly diagnosed Celiac, and am so grateful I have something to bake and share with friends and family!
