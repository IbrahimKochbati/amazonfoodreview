My honey has a serious sweet tooth, which I accommodate by preparing him a weekly dessert. Martha White's Muffin Mix is very convenient to prepare because it only requires one half cup of milk, which I toss into my cuisinart; and wah la six beautiful muffins with virtually no prep time. They are moist, delicious, and economic.
