Previously, I thought the Udi's Vanilla Granola was my favorite.  Then I tried the Au Naturel.  It's my new favorite!  Great taste, not too sweet, and nice crunchy texture.  Have it several mornings a week with yogurt and fruit.  Yum!  And the amazon subscribe and save program has been terrific   makes it about half the price that I was paying at a local store.
