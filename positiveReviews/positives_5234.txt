I like carbonated fruit juices and I think this one is fine.  It has a more tangy formula than the name suggests; it's more of a light fruit punch.  It's refreshing and a good serving size, in my opinion.  It's wonderful to have something that doesn't contain high fructose corn syrup!  What's here instead is: 100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola juice concentrates), gum acacia, natural flavors and colors, ascorbic acid (vitamin c), contains soy.  Delicious.  Sweet.  Light.  Fruity.  Tangy.  Yum.
