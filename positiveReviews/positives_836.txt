A friend's favorite candy is "After Eight", but they are not available anywhere in my area.  I couldn't find them on line either.  Amazon.com came through.  These are imported from England and the most delicious peppermint.  These are so thin with a smooth mint cream center and a dark chocolate shell.  If you just want a little taste of mint, this is for you.  Really special with a cup of hot coffee!
