I would have tried this coffee because it is from one of the most beautiful places on earth, the crisp, clear mountains of British Columbia.  This coffee is the best decaf I have ever tasted.  Often decaf tastes like it has a chemical aftertaste, (and some use chemicals in the processing), and some just lack that full bodied flavor.  This one which has its caffeine extracted with mountain water is the richest, most satisfying decafs ever.  You'll also feel great about yourself since it is fair trade. Their fully caffed versions are amazing too.  I became such a loyal customer after coming across their coffee visiting Canada, that we order this by the double bag and have it shipped from Amazon.
