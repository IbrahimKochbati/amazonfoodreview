I have tried a variety of  ands of maple syrups.  This is without a doubt the best!!  I also have never had grade B before as all that is sold around here is grade A.  Wow, the difference in taste is unbelievable.  It's not as sweet as A and has such a smooth maple flavor.  I tried it out today on my waffles.  Fantastic!  I remember reading that folks use grade A for eating and B more for cooking.  This is only be used for eating!!  I'm so glad I signed up for the subscription offering!
