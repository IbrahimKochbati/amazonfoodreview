I'm really picky about the chai tea I drink, and Yogi is the perfect cup of tea. I was very pleased to find it here in bulk   Trader Joe's seems to have ceased selling it. Apparently it was "too spicy" (this is what I found out from a friend's husband who works at one of the TJ's warehouses). To me, it's a perfect blend of heady spices, and it's not too overwhelming.
