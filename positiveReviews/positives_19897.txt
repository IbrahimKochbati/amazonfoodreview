I love strawberry jello. The great thing about this is its fine taste for a diet jello. The fact that you can eat this with a dollop of cool whip and not take in enough calories to sneeze about, is just wonderful.          It's a staple of my diet. Some say gelatin promotes better absorption of vitamins when eaten with a meal. And we need to take in some gelatin for other reasons as well.          Enjoy this dessert without guilt!
