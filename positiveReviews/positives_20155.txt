We love pasta and it was my daughter in law who introduced me to this product, as I love pasta.  This is not heavy, like most pasta.  It is similar to angel hair pasta but more delicate and much more palatable and flavorful.  Perfect for pesto, light marinara or lightly buttered with shrimp (your favorite chicken or fish) vegetables and yet more healthy and satisfying.  It costs a bit more, but well worth it, for those who want to eat more light yet hearty.  My family love it!
