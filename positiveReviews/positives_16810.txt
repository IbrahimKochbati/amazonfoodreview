I just got in a small box of chocolates from Godiva and they were old and stale.     I guess you pay for the pretty box and the name.     Godiva is supposed to be a very old company.          Well, I also got in a bigger box from Chocolate, Chocolate, Chocolate.     They have only been around since the 1980's.     I was shocked at the packaging.  It was surrounded by ice packs.     The box itself did not weight a lot, but he packaging felt like a TV set.          This company really cares about its product!     This is very rare today in America.  Rare that anyone cares at all about anything.          The chocolates were cold, but once they came up to room temp, they tasted like they     were made yesterday.  Fresh and robust.     As long as I have access to this company, I will never buy an over priced big name     chocolate again.  CCC will be my only Chocolate vendor from now on.          Try a box and prepare to be pleasantly surprised by the taste, quality, and caring for the customer.
