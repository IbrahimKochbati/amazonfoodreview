I freakin' LOVE peanut butter. Peanut butter is a good quick snack, but has quite a few calories. This stuff tastes really close, and you can adjust the amount of water to create the consistency you like.  My only problem is the cost. This jar doesn't make an equivalent jar full of the final product.  To demonstrate, this jar makes enough for about 4 or 5 peanut butter sandwiches.  Again, I am a peanut butter lover, and this tastes great.  My only problem is the cost.  P.S. I've lost 130 pounds over the last 18 months, so to me the cost is worth it.  Just purchase it knowing these facts.
