I went searching for charcoal dog biscuits after reading that they help with digestive gas and bad  eath.  This appears to be only one of two  ands on the market.  I haven't tried the other one (I think it's called Sportmix) because the other did not make a biscuit for small dogs.  My dog has been eating one a day and I can't say for sure whether or not they work. She used to have really smell gas; she hasn't dropped a bomber like that in a while so maybe it's due to the biscuits   who knows?  She does like these biscuits very much, so I will surely buy them again.
