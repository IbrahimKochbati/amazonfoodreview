This is a good tasting cereal, probably on the sweet side (the second ingredient is sugar). For taste alone, I'd give it 5 stars but I am deducting a star from my overall rating for "unfortunate" ingredients like disodium phosphate, caramel color, yellow 6, BHT, yellow 5, red 40, and blue 1. I don't understand the need for all the "junk" ingredients and all the coloring.          As for delivery, my cereal arrived fine. There were no problems with shipping, delivery, or packaging. I received it on May 8, 2012 and the "Best Before" date was March 21, 2013.          For a healthier cereal, I like "Kashi Organic Cereal, Cinnamon Harvest" which is made from a small number of ingredients without all the questionable stuff. It's also not as sweet. I give that one 5 stars because it also tastes great (even though it's not as sweet) but the ingredients are healthier than Life.
