I've tried all kinds of hemp powders and this is my favorite.  Hemp is a super source of EFA's and the protein is a highly available type due to the amount of different amino acids. It is good for those with animal milk allergies or who are concerned about cruelty to farm animals.  And it is also good for those of us who need to avoid the estrogenic properties of ingesting too many soy products.          Great, so it's healthy, but how does it taste?  Well, this hempshake is amazing    the taste is really great.  I particularly like the chocolate.  And I'm impressed that although it tastes a 1000 times better than plain hemp powder, it only contains 80 calories and 7 grams of sugar.          As for digestibility, they do add inulin, which is good for the gut, and I don't have any problem with it.  However, the high amount of fiber might present a problem for those coming straight from a SAD (standard American diet), so you might want to begin slow with a small drink and work up to the full dose.          In fact, I'm drinking a Nutiva Hempshake smoothie right now for my  eakfast.  It contains hempmilk (natch), choco hempshake, cayenne, cinnamon, and frozen berries.  It is awesome.
