Whoa! When reviewing this syrup, two things immediately come to mind: #1. Damn this is good syrup! #2.  Damn this is expensive syrup! With about 10 servings per 32 oz. jug (on pancakes) and at $23.00 per jug, you're averaging a little better than $2.00 per  eakfast    just for the syrup! Well, I can't afford that ..... Yet here I am buying ANOTHER jug. It really is that good. Last week in an attempt to save money I purchased a 64 oz. jug of Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup. It was $36.25 for a 64 oz. jug, which is vastly cheaper than Coombs Family Farms Organic Maple Syrup which is about $23.00 per 32 oz. jug; so you're looking at $46.00 per 64 oz. jug of Coombs compared to the $36.00 per 64 oz. jug of Hidden Springs Vermont. Unfortunately for us thrifty shoppers, the Hidden Springs Vermont is not in the same league as Coombs Organic, and even if I saved $25.00 per jug, I'd probably still go with Coombs    that is an indication of just how much I love this syrup.          Quite simply, I've never had syrup as delicious as Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B. I was raised on Ms. Buttersworth and other corn syrup w  maple flavoring  ands; in fact, I didn't try real maple syrup until about 6 months ago, and now I could never go back. I've tried a few  ands including Highlands Sugarworks which was good and Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup which was not, yet none of them hold a candle to Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup.
