Take me back to my childhood with all 25 grandchildren underfoot while Grammy, Mom, the Aunts manned the stove and oven.     Still don't know how they did it but boy, was it fun.     Anyway, the corn pudding ws a favorite and I have carried that over into my repretoire (sp?).     And it is always YUM!
