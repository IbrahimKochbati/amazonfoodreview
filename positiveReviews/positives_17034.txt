I had to review this toy because it is one of VERY few that has not been destroyed within days (sometimes minutes).  Very good durability   the rattling of treats in the jar and the difficulty of getting to them perplexed my golden mix.  She likes this toy, but still prefers her treat dispensing ball as she has become a master at rolling it to extract the treats.  I give the product 4.5 stars (but I rounded up) for standing up to the first two days of her chewing and trying to get the treats out without solving the puzzle.  It loses a half star because she generally gets disinterested after a few minutes of not being able to get treats out.  She does like to carry it around though!  Great toy overall!
