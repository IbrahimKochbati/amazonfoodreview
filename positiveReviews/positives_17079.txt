Our one year old westie can chew up almost anything.  I've spent lots of money on toys that were made for aggressive chewers, and were destroyed 20 minutes later.  This treat dispenser is great.  We've had it several months and it's still in excellent condition.  I read reviews before purchasing, and bought the larger size because it had a rope instead of a plastic piece.  I definitely recommend the rope.  I was afraid the larger size would be too big, but Max loves it.  He weighs 15 lbs.
