My son loves this food.  He is 16 months now and I still use them.  Not all the time, but often.  The reason is that his molars are coming in very quickly and he is in a lot of pain.  He won't eat much when he's in pain, but these are easy on his gums.  They are organic and a quick meal.  My son is strong and a very healthy weight.  I make sure he gets as much organic, wholesome food as possible.  Buying these subscribe and save is a great way to give him good food and still save money.  He loves the whole line.
