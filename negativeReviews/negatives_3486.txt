I was very excited to get this flour in the mail. The consistency is lovely. However, both my husband and I thought the coffee cake I had made with the flour had a funny aftertaste. I surely thought it couldn't be the flour. So I remade the coffeecake a few weeks later with a different flour and it was really good. I'm so sorry.
