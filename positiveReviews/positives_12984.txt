I have to admit, I liked the watermelon strawberry flavor better than this one, kiwi berry, but this was just as flavorful and just as pleasant. Just the right amount of carbonation and sweetness, and I really loved the fact this has no corn syrup or refined sugar. The small can size is also very handy because it's easy to slip into a bag and it's exactly one serving size. As I mentioned with the other flavor, this drink doesn't have a weird aftertaste or leave a lingering flavor on the tongue  it's very clean and refreshing.
