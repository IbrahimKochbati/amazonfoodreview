I don't even like coffee, but this is in a class by itself!          There is no bitter aftertaste, and with the slightest sprinkle of chocolate creamer, it is going quickly to become my drink of choice!  I can't imagine how good it will taste with a shot of liquor in it!          I just wish we had more! (But we will soon...thanks Amazon!)          No matter what Jamaican coffee you buy, make sure it is certified Blue Mountain Jamaican coffee, like this one is! :)
