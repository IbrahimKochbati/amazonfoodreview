I popped my first batch and I have to say this does taste pretty darn close to what you'd find at a movie theatre.  Everything seems to be measured well enough that you don't see any grease stains when using a popcorn bag but you still get that distinct taste and flavor.  The popcorn tasted fresh but there are no expiration dates or lot numbers anywhere on the packaging so I'm not sure how they can trace anything if there's a bad batch. They don't have any ISO 9001 markings so I'm assuming there is no quality oversight of these.          I have zero real complaints about the popcorn or the taste, but I don't think they should add some sort of traceability.
