SWITCH isn't a bad product, but it's not great either.  I like the fact that it's all natural sparkling juice.  The can design is pleasant to look at.          However, the Kiwi Berry flavor is a bit syrupy for my taste.  Also, at 135 calories per can, this beverage has almost 50% more calories per ounce than the average soda.  Too many for me.
