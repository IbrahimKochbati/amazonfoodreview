This tea is incredible. Mind you I  am not an avid tea drinker. I'm more of a coffee person. I bought this tea to alleviate stress and deal with irritability. I was pleasantly surprised to find out it tastes wonderful too. The aroma in itself is calming and the lavender and slight anis flavors are just incredible. It combines the benefits of great flavor,  being really calming without putting you to sleep,  and easing tummy troubles like bloating and indigestion. It is a truly enjoyable tea. I just bought 6 boxes and am about to stock up on some more.
