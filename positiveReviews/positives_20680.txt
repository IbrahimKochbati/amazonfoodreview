This is very good quality tuna fillet and is superior to other national  ands tuna in olive oil. The olive oil is not of the best quality but you can drain it and just enjoy the tuna with little olive oil. The best use is to make a salad with iceberg lettuce and tomatoes and then just add a little vinegar.
