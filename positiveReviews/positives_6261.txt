This tea is perfect for me. I have many food allergies and associated diet restrictions, so I cannot have regular tea and many herbal teas. This is a good tasting alternative to plain chamomile, which was previously my only option for tea. I love it! It's hard to find at stores, and was previously sold out here, so I'm glad to see it's back.
