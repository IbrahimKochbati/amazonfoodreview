If you want 100% Kopi Luwak, this is a good method to acquire some in a relatively cheap manner. It's not as good as some of the stuff I've had, but it's definitely in that special class that Kopi Luwak belongs in. I've served this for guest, given it as gifts, and enjoyed it on special occasions. I've made it in French press, drip, and in one special instance Espresso!          To truly enjoy it, use about 8 grams of beans per 7 ounces of hot water used to  ew. This is the appropriate ratios. Serve black, no cream or sugar as this will ruin your treat. This bean isn't for everyone, but don't worry! It's not an acquired taste, its just a different taste : )          Product arrived fast thank to prime, fresh as I wanted, and the beans tasted just like they do when I buy them locally from Rao's Bakery here in TX (same beans same company).
