We were initially hesitant to try this volume of product, but are happy that we took a chance and were pleasantly surprised. The container tub is constructed of extremely tough material, which was very important because the shipping box arrived quite mangled but there was no damage to the product.  The olives have an excellent flavor but they are very salty though a quick rinse in cold water will deal with this satisfactorily. The olives are great in a summer pasta salad. We like that there is nothing added to the product, just olives, salt and water. We will definitely purchase again much sooner than anticipated as they are disappearing rapidly.
