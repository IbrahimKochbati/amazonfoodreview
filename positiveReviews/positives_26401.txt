I have 3 mixed  eed dogs (husky mix, shepherd mix, lab mix) and this is by far their FAVORITE chewie!  I started giving one to each of them when I'd leave for work in the mornings.  They don't even look up when I shut the door...just happily chewing away.  I definitely think it helps clean their teeth too. My dogs LOVE this product and it's definitely a good price (about $5 cheaper per bag than at the vet.)
