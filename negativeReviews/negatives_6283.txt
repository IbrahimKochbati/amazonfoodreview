Purchased the roasted chicken flavor and product looks just as pictured.  Ingredients seems simple enough and the biscuits actually held up well during the shipping.  The only problem I have is that my dog does not care for it much.  She would eat it if I handed it to her, but the buddy biscuits fail miserably as a motivational tool. If I pull the buddy biscuits out of the box, she would initially look at me then just continue what she was doing earlier.  I know all dogs are different with their own tastes, but my dog loves to eat everything edible (and sometimes non edible). To give an idea how her tastes are compared to your dog i'll list some items.          She would eat...     Dog food  ands (does not matter what flavors I tried with each  and): Natural Balance, Avoderm, Blue Buffalo, Orijen, Pedigree     Veggies:  Carrots, cabbage, lettuce, bell peppers, chili peppers (I have a chili pepper plant in the yard)          She won't eat...     Citrus fruits (lemons and oranges)          Basically, I assumed my dog would love to eat any treat and I purchased this because of the ingredients and cost. Sadly, I bought it in the 6pack and she isn't too fond of the treats.  I'm giving 3 stars for my situation, but your dog maybe different and love them.          Pros:      Biscuits held up well during shipping      Ingredients      Cheap          Negative:      Fails to motivate dog or get her attention          Pros?   Negative?:      Dog will eat it....(although she would spit it out after I hand it to her, then stare at it, then look at me, and eventually eat it if I don't pull out another type of treat)
