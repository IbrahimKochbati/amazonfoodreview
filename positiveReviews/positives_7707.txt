These pork rinds are delicious!  They taste so fresh, plump up nicely, and have the right amount of spice.  Plus, cooking them in the microwave, just like microwavable popcorn, is a  eeze.  I store them in the freezer, along with my popcorn, to keep them fresh.  There is only 1 carb per bag, which makes a perfect snack for my diabetic lifestyle.
