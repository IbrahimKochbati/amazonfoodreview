I, too, first tasted this at a "caf&eacute; next to the Moulin Rouge in Paris" it was about 90 degrees and reminded me of water from a hose washing over an old orange in the middle of the Sahara on a rather off day. In fact I venture to guess that's how its made with the bubbles that are there by some process of heat related fermentation.          My experience in 1976 after ordering was regretting the 4 bucks just spent getting it, but I defend myself by saying I was so thirsty and hoping for a cold drink. Ha ha. I was later to realize that o get that kind of experience you had a better shot by freezing bottles of water in the US, putting in dry ice and hoping for a positive customs experience. That was a far, far better way to obtain a cool drink. At least in Vienne France if gave the nice inn keeper a twenty I got free use of a tiny fridge, which he found remarkably strange to use for my juice, colas or water. But that's off topic.          Here's what you get for the almost four dollars per bottle, a weak watered slightly sweet beverage with a cross of what I hold is a mandarin and orange pulp, minor amount of pulp, some rather dingy looking stuff that's settled in the bottom that's grainy and a lot of off carbonated water. It's what my husband calls (poor word) water, but he likes them. For him they fill a sentimental niche. For me they say....France was very expensive.          But I adored much about the travel and the country. I do like the bottles. I save them, peel off the labels and use them for rosemary in oil and other kinds of herbed oils I like to make. So if he'll drink it up, or I can pawn it off on some unaware visitor then I've got a nice bottle to use making bath oils. Great for lavendar scented bath potions.          If you love it, give up on me in this regard. This is not a Sam I  Am Moment for the two of us. I would not, could not on one foot, in a bar, by a car, I will not, should not in cathedral, for a beagle or by that icosahedral. I can not drink it, Sam You Are, I do not like this watered juice in jar.
