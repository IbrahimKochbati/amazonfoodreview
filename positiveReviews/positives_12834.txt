Switch is a wonderful all natural carbonated fruit drink that is made with 100% fruit juice and 100% RDA Vitamin C, with no added sugar or sweeteners.  I enjoyed the kiwi berry flavor which tastes more of kiwi and less of the berry. It is cool, refreshing and a great thirst quencher.          The only down side is the 135 calories and the 34g carbohydrate content. However you won't find many all natural fruit drinks that don't have the same or similar calories.          In the end this is a great healthy drink that you and your whole family will enjoy and a healthy alternative to soda pop!          I also recommend the Switch Watermelon Strawberry fruit drink, which I enjoyed slightly more than the Kiwi Berry.
