Pros:       These are definitely tasty    especially when taken from the freezer!       Wheat is not one of their ingredients, so they're OK for gluten sensitive but non allergic people.          Cons:       They contain (less than 2% of) soy (lecithin) which is a state recognized allergen.       They contain canola oil which is one of the least healthy oils on the market, devoid of nutrients and chemically processed.          May be a con:       They contain palm oil which unless harvested conscientiously (and more expensively) significantly contributes to the rainforest destruction e.g. in Indonesia. I don't know how Nature Valley's suppliers harvest their palm oil    hence the separate "may be a con" category.
