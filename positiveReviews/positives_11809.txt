I HAD ORDERED BACK TO NATURE GLUTEN FREE CRACKERS EARLIER, I WRONGLY ASSUMED THE CHEESE CRACKERS WERE ALSO GLUTEN FREE. I WAS HAPPILY ENJOYING MY FIRST BITE WHEN I NOTICED THEY WERE NOT GLUTEN FREE! I WAS GLAD I DID NOT GO FURTHER INTO THE BOX BUT SAD WHEN I REALIZED THAT I COULD NOT EAT THE REST! THE TASTE WAS GREAT HOWEVER!
