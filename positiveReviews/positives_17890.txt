You all know Amazon for its forward looking attitude, and this is also obvious in the review pages. That's why, in this review of Shake and Bake Original Pork, I will be calling on my Aunt Agatha to do a special review for all of you.          By Interpretive Dance.          Agatha is getting on now, but in her day she hoped to be a prima ballerina (even though she only made it to centesimo ballerina). She studied under the expatriate star, Tumbelova, and her husband, Serge Trouserin, but to no great effect. But Agatha could never resist the lure of the tu tu, and that's why we have her here today. And here she comes!          Moving quickly yet forcefully, belying her many years, she is flying around the stage, waving here hands hither and thither. Ah, but now she has stopped, striking poses in just one spot. Now a slow but joyous circling of the stage, a plie here and there, almost in the style of George Balanchine. She's reminding us of the Degas painting, "The Ballet Class," but more in imitation of the teacher than any of the dancers.          And so this delightful moment ends, as Aunt Agatha slips off into the wings and onto a chair,  eathing heavily. I think we can all divine what Shake and Bake Original Pork is like from such a performance, but for those who missed the significance, I can say that from eating it, it's somewhat bland, but probably just what the target market expects.          No doubt, when she gets her  eath back, Aunt Agatha will delight us with more interpretations, but for now, we'll let her rest. And you can feel proud of yourself that you were in at the beginning of a new kind of product review, thanks to Amazon.
