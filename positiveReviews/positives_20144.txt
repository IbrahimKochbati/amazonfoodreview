Orangina is a European drink, made with real orange juice and carbonated water. You can see and taste the pulp in it; it tastes like a spritzer, very refreshing and not overly sweet and artificial like an orange soda. It is really delicious as a cold drink! It used to be that you could only find it a finer foods market or deli, but it is getting easier to find now.  Also the price has come down recently since they found an American bottler to manufacture and sell it in the states under license to the French. Also the glass bottle has a very cool shape, and feels good in your hand.
