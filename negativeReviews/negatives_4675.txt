Of my three cats, only one likes this food. I suspect the problem is that there are actual chunks of carrot in the food, and most cats aren't fond of carrots blocking the smell of the chicken in their meal. While the ingredients list is admirable, the chunks of chicken are very appetizing looking, and it does appear to be as advertised  All natural  it's also not very popular in my household.          The Chicken Pot Pie flavor is especially disliked by my cats, as it's very watery. The label describes this as a sauce, but it's really more like a weak  oth that apparently tastes more like carrots than chicken, because even my chicken mooching cat will not consume it. The Sesame Chicken flavor is a little more interesting to him, but he still just picks out the bigger chunks of chicken when he's really desperate, and leaves the carrots behind.          Honestly, I really can't believe any cat would eat those carrots!          My suggestion is to try before you commit to this size of a package, because cats' tastes vary, and in my experience, 2 out of 3 cats will only eat it if they're very, very hungry. The third is the kind of cat that will eat anything, and so she'll dig in. If you have a cat that will eat anything, then you might have some luck with this food. If your cats are a bit more picky about their food, then you may want to hold back and see if you can dig up a single can before buying a 24 pack like this.          I respect what the company is trying to do with their food, but I really question the person who decided they were going to put chunks of vegetables in a cat food. Cats are carnivores, and sticking a carrot in their bowl is kind of an insult to them.          ...And we all know that insulting a cat when it comes to food is one of the greatest sins against cat pride one can commit.          Remove the carrots, thicken the "sauce" and you might have something here.
