I've made these twice in cupcake form, topped with red jam and powdered sugar. Of course it doesn't taste like a normal vanilla cake... more grainy in texture, with a subtle sweetness, and some  spice.     But I think they are super tasty. They didn't suffer from the weird chewy texture I often run into with rice flour based mixes. Also used EnerG egg replacer with no problem.
