I love this stuff! I keep it next to the  own & white sugar in the cupboard. I use it in home made  ead.          My kids like it mixed with milk, although it doesn't easily dissolve. I let them make a little honey milk on the nights they have trouble falling asleep because I heard that both milk & honey have something in them that makes you sleepy. Anyway it seems to get them back into bed pretty well!          Best use is for tea. I drink tea at work & it is very easy to take this to work with me in a little container. And it's a whole lot better than white sugar.
