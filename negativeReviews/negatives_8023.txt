I've tried all the flavors at least once.  Original and Teriyaki multiple times.  First batch of Original and Teriyaki was great, 2nd and 3rd batches too over flavored.  Pepper was too peppery (and I love pepper).  Hickory was too strong salty.  Just not consistent.  Not going to waste more money on this product.
