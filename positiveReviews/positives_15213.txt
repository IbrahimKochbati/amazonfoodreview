I make a lot of my own baby food, but was not about to make a meat baby food. After buying a few different purees, I tried Chick Chick.  My fussy 9 month old LOVED it instantly. I don't know if it is the flavor or the texture (nice with some small bits in it), but she gobbles it down.  It is worth the price (especially if you do subscribe and save) and I am pleased that she is getting a high quality protein meal and I don't have to puree chicken!
