I am a Bisquick biscuit lover from way back, and I thought the biscuits made per the recipe were a little blah, but I think they would be perfect using butter or margarine in place of shortening, so I have hope. As far as the cobbler goes, I made a triple berry using the shortcake recipe on the back (which calls for butter rather than shortening) as the crust. It was amazing.     If you are expecting the ease of regular bisquick, forget it. This is not a "just add milk and stir" kind of product. The biscuits require the addition of egg, shortening (cutting it in, but it is easy and not too messy to mix with your fingers), and milk. Also wish there was more in the box. Most of the recipes on the back require the use of the whole box.
