I've been drinking this tea now for 3 weeks straight. The first weeks I was only drinking in the morning after my workouts and it really helped boost my energy in the morning and was a great part of my morning  eakfast. I also notice that my skin cleared up really nicely. I've never had problem skin but it is smoother now than ever before so I believe the detoxing benefits are kicking in. This last week, I've been drinking it after I get home from work, before dinner and I just can't seem to go a day without it. Very soothing and the taste isn't bad at all.  Would recommend it to everyone. I'm not a big tea drinking but I will buy this tea in bulk because it really makes a difference.
