When I first took a sip it is a shock to the taste buds as this is 100% fruit juice with carbonation.  I liked it chilled and it did taste like a soda from the bubbles yet not as sweet (syrupy) as a soda since there is NO added sugar. It is a healthy alternative to sodas and my kids loved it too. This was a great flavor since we love strawberry and the kiwi flavor added a twist. Genius product!
