This stuff is transcendence in a can!  I swear its that good.  The vanilla flavor is perfect, not too sweet to be artifical, and not too malted to taste funky.     Its velvety smooth and absolutely perfect around the holidays. (although we drink it year 'round.) Like other fans, I order it by the case for myself and my family at home, I take a can or two to work, and usually giving more away as parts of gift baskets and things like that.  Its perfect paired with fresh baked cookies or alone with a good book when you want to snuggle up and feel relaxed.     I dont drink coffee, so Im a connesiur of cocoa type drinks...this stuff is amazing!  Get some and you will see exactly what I mean.
