I was so excited to receive the box of cookies.  Short eads are my favorite and I love to use them in gift baskets.  I was shocked and horrified when I opened the box and 99% of the cookies were  oken.  Cookies taste good, packaging is horrible.  Major disappointment.  I took pics and sent them to Amazon along with a letter stating what had happened. However, I never heard back from them.
