This was so much fun to play with and make all the little suhsi, but I will have to warn everybody that it doesn't taste too good! It was very very sweet and had a little bit of a weird texture. My boyfriend who I made it with liked the taste a little bit, so I'm sure some people will like it and others will not. The little eggs that you make taste pretty okay. It's worth it just to go through the process of making the sushi. I would definitely recommend for an hour of fun or so!
