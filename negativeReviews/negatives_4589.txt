Update 8 11 12  My cat has suddenly changed her mind about this canned food, ever since my last Amazon shipment, and she will not touch the stuff anymore.  I don't know if they changed the formula, or what... Now I have to find something else she'll eat.          My cat, like all self respecting felines, is a fussy eater but this product meets with her approval.  I give her a third of a can every morning and it keeps her happy all day (she eats dry food, too).  The Amazon price is a little more than I would pay at the grocery store, but my grocery store doesn't regularly stock it, so it's convenient to order it here and also not have to lug it home and pay for sales tax.
