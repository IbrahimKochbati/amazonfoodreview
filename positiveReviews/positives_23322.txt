I am a big fan of pamela's products (we use her biscuit mix all the time) & decided to give this a try to make bagels. it's amazing. i like that it doesn't use bean flours (yuck, they remind me of the smell of garbage). i added asiago cheese to some of the bagels & left some plain. i will buy more of this mix, for sure, to make pizza crusts &  eads now. totally worth the cost if you're gluten free.
