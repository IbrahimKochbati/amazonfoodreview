There was a commercial that advertised its product as "good and good for you".  Oatmeal Crisp fits that description. High cholesterol is one of my life ills and oatmeal is supposed to be a good tool against it, but I just can't imagine eating a bowl of cooked oatmeal everyday especially during the summer heat in Chicago.  Oatmeal Crisp on the other hand served with cold milk is a crunchy, sweet taste treat.  It holds up well in milk (soggy cereal makes me gag) and the almond slivers are a perfect touch.  Unfortunately, I have had difficulty finding this cereal on store shelves in my area, but Amazon has proven an adequate fix.  6 boxes at a time are a bit much, but I realize too much of a good thing is better than none at all and I place the additional boxes in the freezer.
