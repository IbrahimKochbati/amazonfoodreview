Pro Treat Beef Liver Freeze Dried Dog Treats are wonderful used as a reward during obedience training. For a dog motivated by food, this is high in protein, low fat, and not greasy so that you may keep it in your pocket! Because a great deal of  treats are used during positive reinforcement training, I have found that by cutting the squares into pieces the size of my pinky fingernail, the dog is not being overfed and will be able to take the treat without having to stop and chew it up, clean the crumbs, etc. This product is especially good when training puppies, because it is a soft treat to chew, therefore, no pressure or pain on those sensitive gums while the pup is in the teething stage. I cut the squares up and place them in a plastic container. When the pieces are gone, there are powdery crumbs left which I sprinkle over the dogs food at feeding time. There is no waste with this product. I have been using Pro Treat for more than 15 years. The quality is excellent, and I found the best price to be on Amazon after doing a considerable amount of comparison shopping.
