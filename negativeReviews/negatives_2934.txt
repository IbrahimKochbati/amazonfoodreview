I bought these cookies for myself and as a gift for my dad for his birthday. Unfortunately, 2 out of 4 of the boxes I gave my dad as a gift had mostly  oken cookies, and were stale tasting. Not a great gift idea, and not really packaged or handled well. I have bought the delice cookies in the past and had no problems other than a random  oken cookie in a box. I have not opened all of the boxes yet of course, but will hope to find a couple that are not all  oken up to give to my dad.
