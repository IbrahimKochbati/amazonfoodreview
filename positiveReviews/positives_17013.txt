My doggie always ate his food in one gulp and then let out a HUGE burp after eating because he gulped too fast! Now he is eating MUCH slower because he has to work for it.  Product is new, so we have to help him still, but this turns it into an interactive play toy rather than a feeder. He never gets frustrated with it because it is fun for him to drag it around by the rope. Durable, fun for him, easy to fill, but I did think it is a little pricey.     Now if only I can get him to drink his water slower...
