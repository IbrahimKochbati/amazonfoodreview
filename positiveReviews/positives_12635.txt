I had received a Keurig coffee maker for the holidays and have been hooked since. I am not a real strong coffee person so this morning blend is perfect. Consistant in flavor. The only reason I gave it a four is once you buy the machine you are basically locked into buying the cups.. It does have the reusable pod tho. I believe the prices could come down. In the store the prices are outrageous, but on Amazom they are reasonable somewhat..
