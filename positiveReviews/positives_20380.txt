My daughter has a tendency to be a picky eater.  I am not sure where this came from b c other kids are not.  But this product, she doesn't seem to 'reverse eat' as we like to call it.  But the product itself is very pricey for the amount that you get (7oz vs 16 ozreg for same price).  But,all in all, the ingredients are good for my little one. We take probiotics, DHA, and eat  own rice, so why would we feed her differently?
