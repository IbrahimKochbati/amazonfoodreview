I like pretty much anything Emeril teaches or sells but this is not that strong and bold of a coffee and was hoping for a bit more BAM but it is pleasant and I will drink my 50 k cups but probably go back to the Timothy's Double Black Diamond  or something with a bit more bump to it. Nice for after dinner but not a real waker upper
