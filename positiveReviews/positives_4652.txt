One of my cats developed a food allergy and was throwing up anything he ate. There are many types of food that the vet recommended trying (duck, venison, etc.) but he refused to eat any of those.          Then we found this food, and all is good again.          Thank goodness there's something he will deign to eat that won't aggravate his food allergies!
