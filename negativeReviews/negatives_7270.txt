I fed this to my three cats. Within a month one of them began getting sick, throwing up his food once a day then every meal. Eventually he began throwing up blood and was passing it from his bottom. We thought he was going to die, these symptoms all happened over a few days time.     We took him to the vet, they ran tons of tests found nothing wrong and gave him a hydration IV and sent him home with instructions for a diet of puree chicken and rice. Days later we gave him a little bit of the dry cat food with his special food. Hours later he was terribly sick again. It was then that we realized the food made him this deathly ill!     DO NOT BUY GOODLIFE it almost killed our cat!
