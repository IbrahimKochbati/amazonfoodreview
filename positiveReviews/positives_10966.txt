My son has been gluten free for at least 10 years and the products that are available to a gluten free diet have grown tremendously.  There was nothing much available 10 years ago.  The crackers and  ead usually crumbled if you just looked at them!  They were mainly made out of rice flour and rice flour is not good for main ingredient in making  eads, cookies and cakes. Good crackers, or just finding crackers that were gluten free was not an option back then either.  These crackers rock!  They are so much like the real thing that I prefer them over the wheat crackers; saltine or keebler club crackers.  I think this cracker is right in the middle of the two as far as taste like. The crackers have a real good crunch factor!  The only down side to my order was that the crackers in each bag did seem to have more  oken then whole.  I was not happy about that.  But,  I will take taste over presentation any day!  I will buy these again definitely!
