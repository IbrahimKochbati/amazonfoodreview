Aside from the obvious benefits of using this product to spice up your food, it also works wonders with multiple other "regular" household problems.  Rusted bolts don't stand a chance against the metal disintegrating power of this product, it works better and faster then WD 40.  It also does wonders for pest control as I had a few ants constantly in my garage so I put this stuff in a dish with some syrup in the middle.  All the ants died crossing this sauce.  I also successfully removed a small grease stain from my garage floor, which isn't as practical as it is possible because you have to use a majority of the hot sauce.          The sauce itself is unbelievably hot.  I'm talking pain inducing I'm too sick to move spicey.  I put a squirt on a chip and thought my nose started bleeding.  I'd recommend you only use this product in LARGE batches of food (large pot of chili).  If you want to experience about as much pain as possible without any long term effects (at least I hope not) take a swig of this stuff.  I'd also recommend a comfortable toilet seat and possibly a magazine subscription and some kleenex if you start crying.  Amazon really knows what to sell if they are trying to increase product sales in other departments.
