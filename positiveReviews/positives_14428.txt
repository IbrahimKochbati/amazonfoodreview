Got these to help perk up our "Olden Golden."  She loved them.  Seemed to help a little.  But, I guess there's no cure for age.          This is a far better way to get your dog to take glucosamine and chondroitin.  We had the hardest time getting her to take a pill.          I will note that the treats get stale pretty quickly if you don't seal the bag well (it's ziplock.)
