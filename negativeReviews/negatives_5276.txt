I am sure that there are people who like Rishi Sencha Tea, but I just don't like it. To me it it smells like hay. Other teas I tried, like Golden Yunnan or Pu erh Tuo Cha Tea are even worst. Out of four Rishi teas I tried only the Earl Grey Loose Tea is acceptable. As for Green Tea   I like the Japan Sencha Green tea packaged by the Coffee Bean Direct. Anyway, You will not know which tea you like until you tried them all.
