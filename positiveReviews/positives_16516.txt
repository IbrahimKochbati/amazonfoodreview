We get the Regular and the Petite, for after meal or instead of meal treats.  Brutus and Popeye review this product at 12 out of 10!  Until we tried Greenies, Brutus turned his nose up on almost everything we gave him.  Now he has something he really enjoys.  Popeye, on the other hand, is a different story.  He would eat the box, so we can't use him as a judge.
