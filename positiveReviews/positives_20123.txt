My Australian Shepherd puppy loves these things! I was looking for chew treats made specifically for puppies, to avoid giving him something that would harm him, so I purchased these and have been giving them to him since he was about 8 weeks old. They keep him occupied for a solid 30 minutes or so, the only problem with them is that they leave an orangy trail on your carpet and, if your puppy is like mine and uses his paws to hold while he chews, they inevitably get it all over their paws too : ( It's not hard to wash out, just a pain and seems kind of silly to have a dog treat that bleeds orange everywhere if you have neutral colored carpet like me.
