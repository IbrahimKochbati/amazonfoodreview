I'm so sick of ppl trying to mislead. I've lost 40lbs over the last year with a few diet changes, no working out, and agave has been one of my changes. People say it is actually bad for you and has a high GI value, always question them! I went onto the GI site, and this has a value of 10 19 (per 10grams), which is low, highs being 70+. Also, not all agave is created equal, meaning, if processed it can ruin the quality and content. So, be careful on who you purchase this from. Less processing, the better.          10 grams of sugar has a GI of about 56.666     10 grams of agave has a GI of about 10 19
