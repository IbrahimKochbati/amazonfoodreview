We like the regular Little Bear cheese puffs so we tried the crunchy too. Excellent! Very satisfying crunch, yummy natural cheese taste, and nothing to feel bad about healthwise (unlike those awful fluorescent cheese colored snacks popular in the grocery store!). This  and is excellent, we highly recommend all Little Bear foods!
