I was a little skeptical about switching over to this  and but I'm happy to say, my dog loves this stuff. I don't even need to add leftover meat scraps or gravy sauce like I did to his old food. This stuff is way better than the crap they sell at those chain stores. Can't beat the price with S&S! Also love that they come in smaller resealable bags which keeps the food fresh. Better to open up a  and new bag every couple weeks than to leave a huge opened bag of kibble in the pantry for months.
