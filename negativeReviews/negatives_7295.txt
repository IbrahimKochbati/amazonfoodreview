I'd really like to see the product description amended to address the dented can issues. That said  my second shipment had two VERY badly dented cans  but the rest were only slightly dented.  (This compared to my first shipment where every can was moderately dented).  Since I am using this for dog food  I have no problem using.  I just don't like to see this product sold as if it has no problems.  I am glad it is available though since there is such a pumpkin shortage.          I'd like to update  my third shipment had only a couple of cans slightly dented.  I don't know if I just got lucky this time, or whatever issues there were have been worked out.          That said, I am upping my review to 5 stars  however as other reviews have noted, the pumpkin is more watery than other canned pumpkin I have used in the past.  For my purposes that is fine.          Taking my review back down to 2 stars.  I just received a shipment with extremely dented cans.  Too much trouble to return  and I will use them to feed my dogs.  I really hate that I don't feel like I have another choice right now.
