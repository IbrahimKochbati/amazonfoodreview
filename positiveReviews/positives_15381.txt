The box stores have begun to drop inventory items and this variety is not available at Albertsons, Safeway and QFC here in NW.     Our cat needs this for an RX for stomach problems.     We were able to find it on Amazon in quantity and at a discount.     Delivery was fantastic and the cat is in heaven as she knows she has a three month supply in the cupboard.
