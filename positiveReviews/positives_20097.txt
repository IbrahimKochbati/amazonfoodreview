I was eating Polaner All Fruit for years until they recently added maltodextrin to it (check the new labels.) I gave this a try as a true sugar free, all fruit alternative that is also organic, which I purchased from my local health food store.          The texture is thick and nice unlike some jellies which are watery. The flavor is good. There are many small seeds in this from the berries which I know some people may not like so I wanted to mention it.          If you are looking for a healthy alternative to sugar laden jellies or those with synthetic sugar substitutes, I recommend this product.
