This coffee tastes better than Folgers. That's not much of an endorsement, but since Folgers is about all I ever drink, it's my only point of comparison. I would recommend you don't try the stupid and counterproductive experiment of replacing your usual caffeinated stuff with a cup of this some Saturday morning, as doing so will only result in one of those headaches it takes three over the counter painkillers to get rid of. And in the meantime, while you're trying to fight off the headache, you'll be completely unable to make headway with that craptastic novel you just got from Amazon, which was reinforcing all your worst opinions of the romantic fantasy subgenre before you had to lie down and commence clutching your forehead.
