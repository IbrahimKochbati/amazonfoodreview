"The Switch" reminds me a lot of carbonated apple cider. It has a carbonated sweet taste (with no sugar added, no preservatives according to the label). The label states that it has 100% Juice. To me it tastes light, on the diluted side, and very similar in taste to the apple cider bottle you serve kids for thanksgiving instead of real champagne. There is a slightly detectable taste of strawberry and maybe kiwi.          Pros:     100% Vitamin C     Low Sodium of 15mg     Tastes good if you like the light carbonated Perrier Like Taste.     Fat: 0mg          Cons:     33g of sugar (although it says no sugar added)     34g of carbs   too much carbs if you're trying to cut down on carbs          Conclusion: Keep in mind that this review reflects my personal opinion of the product beside the facts listed on the can. I personally prefer less carbonated fruit drinks with a stronger taste rather than the very light taste of this product. it is 135 calories for 8.3 fl oz. You also feel you need a glass of water to wash out the after taste. Overall, it tastes good and I can recommend it to anyone who's not trying to cut down on the amount of daily carbs or sugar intakes.
