I hope this may help others whose dogs love this treat like my fussy Lhasa Apso but she's nearly 16 yrs. old and I found she suddenly developed an insatiable thirst; which then caused so many frequent late night forays to go outside to relieve herself we lost hours of sleep. Thinking it was her age we let it go for awhile then I decided to take her off the varied  ands of dehydrated chicken  east (all without additives) and within a week she no longer empied bowls of water and had to go out all night long. It may react on her differently because of her age but for others who may experience this problem you may need to take your dog off this type of treat...I'm now using the Purina Chicken Carvers (I know chemicals) but she no longer is having problems..go figure... I guess dogs are all different too huh?
