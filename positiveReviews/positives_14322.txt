This has become my favorite coffee.  I have tried a lot of different blends from Starbucks (from Breakfast, Verona, Columbia, and house), but a friend took me to the local Peets during a trip to Seattle two years ago and I have been hooked.  Peets has a balanced flavor that tastes great warm or cold.  Outstanding stuff.          I will say that I can get this significantly cheaper ($8.50 per bag) at my local grocery store on the east coast than through Amazon. Its a rare day when you can say something is cheaper than going through Amazon.  Which is a shame because I wouldn't mind setting up a subscribed delivery of this product, but not at these prices.
