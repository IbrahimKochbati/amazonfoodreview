I bought this a few months ago, and my two puppies are still playing with it.  My pups are now about 13 15 pounds, and while they play rough with each other, they aren't too rough on this toy.  I know a lot of people mentioned their dogs chew right through the rope, but this was not the case in our house, which I was glad to see.  They seem to focus on scratching at the purple spiked piece and don't do much flailing around by the rope, so that could be why.          One of the dogs figured out how to use it right away, although it took her a couple of weeks to get a little more aggressive with it.  It took the other one almost a month to not be afraid of it!  It never fails, though, when they go for their toy box, this is the toy they pull out and play with for a good 20 minutes.  I have no complaint about the quality of the product, and it keeps my dogs happy and entertained.
