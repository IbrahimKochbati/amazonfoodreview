It seems all of our friends and family are so used to microwave popcorn, that when we pop this, they start to ask lots of questions.  One of my friends "had" to go out and buy a larger machine than mine!  (It seems he always has to 1 up me)  In any case, this is the closest stuff to movie theater popcorn you can get, however I like it a bit better than the movie theater popcorn served here.  The packs are perfect for the size of machine we have, I just wish I had a larger machine...  I have no complaints about this product.  I have a couple about my machine, but we will leave that to another review!
