My cat will only eat the Whiskas Choice cuts with beef.  My local stores quit carrying this product and I bought any cat food similar to it, regardles of price.  My cat ate only dry food for two months or more.  He lost weight that he can't afford to lose. I am so happy that I found this Whiskas item on Amazon.
