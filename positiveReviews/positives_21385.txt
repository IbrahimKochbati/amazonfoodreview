My dog is on a raw diet, which makes travel somewhat challenging.          This is a great solution for traveling with your canine companion.  He loves the taste, plus it can be fed dry or rehydrated.  It makes a great snack too!          While this product is too pricey for feeding on a daily basis, it's highly portable and practical for those times that you need it.
