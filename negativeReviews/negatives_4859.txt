This is my second box of greenies that I have been quite pleased up until today.  I pull out on greenie and found a WORM along with larvae!! This is horrible.  I had this box for 3 months.  I emptied the box and found about a dozen more worms and was disgusted.  I couldn't believe greenies product was contaminating my dogs.  The expiration date is dated 2013 so this clearly shows that there is something wrong with this product.  I hope someone from the greenies department will give contact me to fix this.  I will be posting these comments on every doggy treat review forum website until I hear from someone so I know that they are trying to fix it and shows how much they value their customers and product.  I don't know how long I have been feeding greenies with worms in them so my two pups will now have to go to the vet.
