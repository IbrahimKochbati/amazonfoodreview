THIS COFFEE REMINDS ME OF STARBUCKS VERONA .  THE PRICE IS LESS THAN WALMARTS. AFTER ORDERING THE COFFEE SHOWS UP FAST.  YOU DO HAVE TO BUY A LOT AT ONCE TO GET FREE SHIPPING.  I GET A KICK OUT OF PEOPLE LINED  UP IN THEIR CARS AT STARBUCKS DRIVE THRU IN THE MORNING WAITING TO GET THEIR CUP OF COFFEE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE WAIT AND $4.00 GAS WHILE PAYING $22 A GAL FOR COFFEE.
