We've been feeding these to our dogs for about a month now and one thing is clear, they love them! We give them as recommended on the package, twice per day for each dog. We tried giving them glucosamine chondriotin in a different type of treat but one of the dogs wouldn't eat it. Not so for these.          I recommend getting subscribed on a monthly basis if you want to save money.          Big Red
