I saw these on sale so I nabbed them.  For anything larger than a 6oz cup, the results will be too weak.  I end up  ewing one with 6oz of water and then a cappuccino or something on top of it.          The peppermint was the flavor I was anxious to try but it ended up being the dark chocolate that I loved the most.  I'm on the fence about ordering hot cocoa k cups in the future.  It might be better to stick with canned cocoa and just use the water from my Keurig.
