Tastes like darjeeling, although, like one of the previous reviewers said, it's missing some of the body of a good darjeeling. I give it 3 stars for taste alone. But for the price I paid for it, I guess it's still a solid deal          You get what you pay for and for the cost of this tea, I guess it's good. :)
