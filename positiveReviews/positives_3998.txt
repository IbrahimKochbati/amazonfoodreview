I have 5 house cats.  One was recently diagnosed with diabetes.  We got his diabetes under control with insulin but I began researching diet information to help us.  All of my research led us to try Felidae grain free.  I spent two weeks carefully switching Louis (and the four girls) from dry Iams to Felidae.  I was immediately able to decrease his insulin and by the time I had him totally on Felidae we were able to discontinue insulin totally.  All with our veterinarian's supervision, a consistent feeding schedule and measured amounts. (It has not been effortless but it has been worthwhile.) Louis has been insulin free for two weeks now.  All five cats (ages 5 to 19) love the food.  Their stools are good, their coats look wonderful & they haven't vomited for weeks. YAY!
