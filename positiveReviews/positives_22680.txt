I received a popcorn machine for my birthday and I have not been able to find the right combination to make popcorn that tastes like you get at the movies.  The local convienence store always has great popcorn and I happened to notice they use this.  I just went through a case in less than a month! It is good stuff!  The 8 oz size is a bit much for my family of four, so I will go with the 6 oz this time.  I ordered two cases this time!
