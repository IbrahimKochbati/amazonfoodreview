I've used Lipton's Loose Tea for almost 50 years now and will never change to another  and unless Lipton's goes out of business.  The loose tea consistently makes absolutely the best glass of iced tea.  Tea bags (any  and) are no comparison, not even close to the same great flavor of Lipton's loose leaf tea. I have a large extended family with many friends, my iced tea is famous among them, for being the best....Thanks Lipton's!  And....thanks Amazon for the wonderful subscription service....Love it!!
