Tired of all the "salt substitutes" that are just shakers potassium chloride with different labels? Those things don't taste like salt at all; they have a slight "bite" on the tongue like a spoonful of salt does, but that's about it. If you dissolve them in water, they has little or no flavor at all, and what flavor they do have is nothing like sodium chloride.          This stuff, on the other hand, is the real deal. It doesn't rely on potassium chloride, nor on only "herbs and spices" as other substitutes like Mrs. Dash or the (in)famous Costo seasoning does do. Instead, it relies on a combination of herbs, spices, and nutritional  ewer's yeast. And it actually tastes (not just feels on the tongue) "salty" despite having no sodium.          With this stuff I can honestly say I have no desire for a salt shaker or to add salt as I cook. This is the real deal. Try it!
