OK...I's serious here. If you like Cajun food or even if you don't, you really need all of his seasoning blends in your pantry.  He's now got a special seasoning for just about everything and I've yet to run across one that was not tasty in the extreme.          Also, you should order a gallon of his hot sauce.  It's the most flavorful hot sauce I have ever tried and it's not so hot that you can't eat what you put on it.          If the US Government operated like he does, we might actually have a good news day once in awhile.
