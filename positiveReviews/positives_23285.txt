We have tried several kinds of gluten free  ead for my celiac son who is three years old.  This has been the best overall in texture and taste.  It smells wonderful when its baking too.  We use a  ead machine on the lightest crust at rapid bake, if the crust gets too  own the  ead dries out too quick.  Keep in the fridge after the second day as it will mold after about 4 5 days, but will last alot longer in the fridge.
