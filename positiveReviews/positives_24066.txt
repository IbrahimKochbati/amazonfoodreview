Advertised as an all natural, gluten free,healthier snack, we tried the BBQ & Sour Cream & Onion flavors.  We have a slight preference for the BBQ over the Sour Cream & Onion because the BBQ has a little more flavor. However, both leave a slightly strange aftertaste shortly after consuming a single serving bag.          The chip crunch is great and adds to the satisfaction of eating the chip.          Overall, a nice snack.  For flavor; however, we prefer Veggie Chips.   "
