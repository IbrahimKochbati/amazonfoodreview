My major gripe with the product is that there is too much oil. It can be fixed by using a colander or something else to drain the oil. Also, keep in mind that the size of the can is 4lbs 6oz. You can keep the can stored in your cupboard for months if it isn't opened, but you need to consume it relatively quickly once it is opened (just something to keep in mind for people who are single or who have small families).
