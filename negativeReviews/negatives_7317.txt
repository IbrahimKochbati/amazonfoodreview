I received Farmers Market Organic Pumpkin 12 pack yesterday. 5 out of 12 cans were pretty badly dented, another 2 not quite so bad. Packaging was not damaged and cans were bubble wrapped inside the box so it wasnt packaging or delivery. These cans were sold and shipped already dented. Don't blame UPS. I will keep and use them they are dated 2013,however this is hardly what I paid for ???? . Someone is obviously taking full advantage of the pumpkin shortage to unload their dented can inventory. Buyer beware!!
