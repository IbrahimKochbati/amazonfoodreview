Shake N Bake is a longtime favorite in our household. This pork version does what it's supposed to do: It gives your pork a tasty, slightly crispy and flavorful coating that doesn't completely overpower the flavor of the pork itself. Don't let the "pork" label fool you into believing it's one dimensional, however, because this could just as easily be used on chicken as well. In the end, it is more expensive than  ead crumbs, but in my opinion the flavor and convenience are worth it. Can't go wrong with a dinner classic like this.
