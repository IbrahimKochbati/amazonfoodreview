Let me start off with some info about myself.     A few weeks ago after my son's birthday I looked at myself and decided I needed to lose weight. Since then Ive lost 14 lbs so far.     In addition to my work outs and my protein shakes I love this meal.     I have the Tasty Bit Jodhpur Lentils for dinner when im at work.     I unlike alot of reviewers enjoy the soupy texture. I add my homemade dried habenero powder to it, because I love spicy foods. I also love the flavor of cumin, I dont find it overpowering or over salty like some think.     I usually eat the whole packet as a dinner option and I get full off of it, I dont need anything with it and it satisfies my appetite.     For the price with the discount and the subscribe and save combined it cant be beat.
