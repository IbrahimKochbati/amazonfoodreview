I have to tell you all this one is the best I've tasted. Seen this at Costco one day a month ago. I only had purchased one 4.5 lb bag. I had like it so much I had gone back for more. Although cheaper than Amazon, I still buy it off Amazon. Since Costco doesn't carry them again. I just placed in another order and he had arrived quick!. When I first did a order the Oats was shipped Next Air via Las Vegas. That's real good service from Amazon. As for this product you can't compare it with anything you buy at Whole Foods nor regular Oatmeal.          I've prepare this produce on the store and in two different type of Steamers. I don't use water method. I only use Silk or Blue Diamond Almond Milk Original on both. I use also Honey from local Farm which I wish Amazon would carry. You really don't have to use Honey but I like it so I use it. I set this to cook for 15 minutes in a Steam Oven I got from Amazon. I also have BPA Steamer I also got from Amazon. That one 11L  I can place 3x glass bowls (pyrex type) In the steamer with water only 3x can be cooked in 20 minutes. In Oven Steamer it's about 15 minutes with the Conventional Fan going. On the store using Ceramic cookware cooks pretty fast though. I like the steamer better because you get the puff of hot steam and the oats taste just right.          I have bowl of this Oats every morning and look forward to the next day to have it! Also clay soup pots can be also use with handles. Pick up one of these bags and try it for yourselves. You won't be without another bag in your home. You'll be hooked like my family is!
