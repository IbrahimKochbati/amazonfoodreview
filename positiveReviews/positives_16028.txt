I ordered this in mid October 2009.  The bags were dated Fe uary 2009.          A friend of mine had visited this region of Guatemala and had  ought me back some of the coffee beans from his trip.  I was astounded by how the coffee lacked the bitterness you can find in most other coffees.  There also seems to be some hints of cherries or some other nutty fruity flavor.  I have used multiple grind settings when using this (drip coffee maker) and found that it tolerates a very fine grind well.  The looser grinds and small amounts of the coffee can leave this weak though.          Highly recommend this coffee.
