This is a nice tea, but it has a tendancy to  ew too quickly and becomes a little bitter. It helps to add a little sweetner of some kind. IT SMELLS AWESOME! and the blueberry really has a nice flavor. Personally, I still prefer Lipton's "superfruit green tea" and would recomend that, but this still a good one to try... just pay attention when you  ew it.      J
