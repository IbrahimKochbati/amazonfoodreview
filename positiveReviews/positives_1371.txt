This 24 pack lasted about a month, and I sampled all of the flavors but only got to eat the barbecue flavor once, as it is my wife's and my favorite. So, I reordered just the barbecue. Great snack for 100 calories. I've purchased the reduced fat Pringles 100 calorie individual packs before, and you get a lot more chips in a Popchips bag than from Pringles.
