I like this blend and the fact that it is organic and fair trade, but I want to make mention that this is not decaf coffee.  My husband drinks decaf and it is getting harder to find good decaf at the big box stores so I hopped on Amazon and searched on 'decaf kcup organic' and this item comes up.  As I was loading up our carousel I noticed how the label looks exactly like the ones on "my" level of the carousel (caffeinated)...yep, it is indeed NOT decaf.  And I certainly get it a lot cheaper at my local warehouse place. Lesson learned to read the description forward and back several times before adding to my cart.  Hopefully this review will save someone else from this mistake. I'm also going to try to report the discrepancy to Amazon if I can figure out the proper channel for doing so.
