this is my favorite.  It's better than Shock coffee, and it's better than the now discontinued Starbucks canned coffee.  I keep one in the car, and I take one with me on long hikes.  The flavor is just right, not too sweet.  Truly tastes like cafe au lait.          I hope I can keep getting these through Amazon because they are not sold around here.
