The first time we cracked open a box of Bisquick Gluten Free and made a batch of pancakes, I was surprised. They were DELICIOUS! Perhaps the best pancakes I've ever had. We did make a couple modifications from the box recipe. Instead of using oil, we use the same amount of melted butter. And we add fresh blueberries to each pancake as it's cooking. Then, serve with whipped cream. So great! I'm looking forward to trying some of the other recipes with this, including pizza crust.
