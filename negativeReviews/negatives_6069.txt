I was really looking forward to this salt substitute but it falls far short in my opinion. Tastes like a glorified version of Mrs. Dash and far from salt flavor. If you want something really good try Himalayan Pink Salt sold through Amazon     it's outstanding !!!! I purchased the one with the grinder and it could not be better. Yum , real salt but good for you.
