This USED to be my favorite  eakfast, but now that they've fallen in line with the Nanny State of The Union and forcibly are choosing our lifestyle and food ingredients, this product is crapola, plain and simple. It used to be wonderful but now is not fit to feed my cat. ( I tried but she wouldn't eat it, either ) Worst stuff I ever tasted when it comes to oatmeal. And what is that horrible biting bitter flavor they substituted for  own sugar or real maple flavoring? Smells and tastes like something left in a cranky baby's diaper. Quaker has lost another customer.
