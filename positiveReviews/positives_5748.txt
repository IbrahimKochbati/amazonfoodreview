This tea is very similar to Paromi Coconut Almond I have bought at Whole Foods.  Unfortunately, I don't live near a Whole Foods!  This loose leaf tea is awesome!  I was first put off by what I considered to be higher than normal shipping charges, but the cost of the tea is so CHEAP when compared to buying it in tea bag form.  I will probably get 50 cups of tea out of this package.  The flavor is so unique...I can't wait to try it this summer in a sun tea jar.
