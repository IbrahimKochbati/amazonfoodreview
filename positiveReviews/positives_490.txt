For those who love salt and vinegar potato chips, this is the one to choose. The flavor is zippy and tart, with no unpleasant chemical aftertaste like the less "natural" versions of this snack. The 2 ounce bags are just right to share at lunch. The chips are a little greasy, and that's why I've given them 4 stars instead of 5.
