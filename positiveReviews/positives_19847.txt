My oh so spoilt, fussy little dogs LOVE this wonderful new treat and I feel good about feeding it to my dogs because it is all natural without any fillers or grains.  Works great for those of us advocating feeding our pets raw, minimally processed, natural food.  The texture is soft and the small sized pieces are easily managed by even little dogs. I feed my dogs a varied diet that includes these treats and also the Ziwi Peak line of daily dog cuisine.
