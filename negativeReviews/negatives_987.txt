Reading other reviews, I was excited to try this mix since it appeared to be Gluten free dairy free.  Technically, the dry mix is GF DF but the basic pancake recipe calls for eggs and milk.  Technically I can use my own egg and milk substitutes but then I could already do this with so many other mixes.  I've found that mixes that request eggs and or milk really are better with the originals not substitutes.  The best GF DF mixes already include a substitute so the directions only require water and or oil or other non dairy ingredients.  In this case, I will return to my old favorite mixes by "The cravings place"   these are truely targeted for a GF + DF lifestyle.  That said, if you are not DF then perhaps this is a fine choice. It would have been better to have a print picture of the back of the package to more clearly see that this is not a great DF option.
