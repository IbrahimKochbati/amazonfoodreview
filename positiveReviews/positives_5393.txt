I recently received a Kuerig Coffee Maker  and realized that the coffee cups would be a costly add on to the product. DisposaCups came to the resue. These durable cups can be filled with your own coffee rather than the expensive Kuerig cups. My only issue with these cups is that when I fill them to save for later use, the tops do not stay on snuggly. Hope they work on this.
