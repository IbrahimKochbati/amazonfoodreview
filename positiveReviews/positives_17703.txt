Surprisingly, Puroast's low acid French Roast blend actually has a rich, full flavor that has a deeper taste than most standard store  ands, i.e. Maxwell, Folgers, Hills Brothers. I expected a flatter taste from a low acid coffee but was pleasantly surprised. But then I discovered that Puroast had received favorable ratings in taste tests conducted by the Wall Street Journal and Newsweek. I also learned that coffee in its natural state is low acid but the roasting process converts coffee to a high acid drink.          Puroast has seven times lower acid levels than the leading  ands of coffee. That is good news for people who suffer from heart burn, acid reflux, and other kinds of stomach irritation. Puroast Coffee [...], rich has its roots in South America, introduced the low acid  ews in November 2005.     Puroast comes in regular, decaf, medium roast, house blends, and organic blends in either whole bean or ground format. Among the low acid flavors Puroast offers are chocolate almond, hazelnut, Irish cr&egrave;me, mocha java, and vanilla.          Puroast coffee products are available at amazon.com and a major chain store I refuse to shop at. If you quit drinking coffee, or cut down on your coffee intake, because of a sensitive stomach you will enjoy the health benefits as well as the rich taste of Puroast low acid coffee.
