I suffer from acid reflux so I have to take omeprazole daily to ease up on the acid burning up my esophagus. I get acid reflux from things like ketchup and sometimes from lattes and soda, so I picked this product primarily based on health rather than previous opinion of taste.          this does taste like old world coffee which is a bit hard to describe. Its not bold, but it is very dark and has a mild taste. Its old diner style quality, which I enjoyed even though I have been used to very bold flavorings such as the ones in Starbucks. I did jack up sugar like no tomorrow just a tiny bit.          It did NOT affect my acid reflux, however, so I recommend this if you are like me and have to take medication for acid reflux, since people who suffer from acid reflux really shouldn't be drinking regular coffee as it can upset the PH levels in the stomach and aggravate the acidity in your stomach.
