It is not the best way to buy Beer Nuts.          Perhaps the product had been exposed to high heat and a "whole lot of shaking".  Most of the "coating" and "flavoring" was off of the nuts.  Even though the individual cans are "sealed", it is like the nuts had been sitting out in a bowl for a long time on a hot, humid day.
