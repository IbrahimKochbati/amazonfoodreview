My three cats, two females and a male (well, they used to be anyway), all have extremely different personalities and tastes in cat food. I tried an experiment to see which of the flavors of Petite Cuisine would appeal to tough guy, and which ms. whiner would like best, and whether or not clingy dependent had a preference. I think I can state for the scientific record that the appeal of all four flavors of Petite Cuisine transcends even personality based inclination.          The cans may be small, but once you pop the top and tip one into your cat's bowl, you see how much was packed in there. The pieces of fish are large and fresh looking (although I was not tempted to go for the  ead and mayo, they smelled good, too). My cats ate every morsel of the food, instead of sucking up the gravy and leaving half the solid to petrify onto the sides of their bowl as they do with other sliced cat foods in sauce.          Petite Cuisine is pricey, but I think I might keep a carton on hand for occasional special treats. I wouldn't be able to afford it all the time, despite the fact that it's actually worth the price.
