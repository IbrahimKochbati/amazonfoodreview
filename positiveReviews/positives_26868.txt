This tea is excellent!  I like delicate teas just fine, but Stash's plain Honeybush is pretty bland.  The vanilla flavoring in this tea is subtle enough that you may not recognize it as such, but it rounds out and sweetens the flavor of the honeybush to give it a body that tastes like more than just muddled water.          I don't care for most black tea because I find it bitter, and I fancy this my black tea substitute.  The flavor is warm, mellow, well rounded, and has just a suggestion of sweetness and depth to it. Tazo Honeybush is also delicious, but has weird mystery ingredients (artifical and natural flavor, anyone?  Mmmm!)          Unlike some of Stash's teas, this is also perfect iced or at room temperature, with no filmy crust of flavoring and tea dust to form on top.  If you have ever liked a honeybush tea, I am confident you will like this one.  The flavor is also similar to rooibos, if you've tried that, but rooibos has a wider range of flavors it can adopt than honeybush does.  Honeybush is always, as its name suggests, just a bit warm and sweet.
