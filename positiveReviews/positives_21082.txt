This is my new favorite coffee!!  Very full flavored, yet smooth.  Wins out over Starbucks, Dunkin Doughnuts, Eight O'Clock or Kirklands...but beware...you will receive quite a caffeine blast.  Two cups and I am ready to roll!  I highly recommend this coffee. It's too bad more people are not aware of this coffee.  It's a great value.
