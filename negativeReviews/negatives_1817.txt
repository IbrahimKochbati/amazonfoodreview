I grew up in NJ and the local Italian food store sold this sauce along with dough and cheese that you could take home to make your own pizza! I loved it then, and I love it now.  The only issue is the price.  At almost 4$ per can it would be hard to justify the cost.  So to be clear, 5 stars for the sauce, but 1 star for the price!
