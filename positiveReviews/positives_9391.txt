Wonderful stuff  cook it just like rice in a rice cooker to make rice or porridge. It has a wonderful texture, very toothsome. I use it like rice, heated with milk and sugar, and add a cup of cooked grain to my multi grain  ead.          Note that the packaging has one typo in English. What is labeled "Gordon Euryale Seeds" in the ingredients should be "Gorgon Euryale". This ancient foodstuff is the seed of a water lily, grown in China for 3,000 years. Botanists named the genus "Euryale" after a mythical Greek Gorgon, sister to Medusa.
