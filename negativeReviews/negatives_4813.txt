The listed ingredients at Amazon are correct but incomplete. Item also contains beef base (FIRST ingredient) & MSG (THIRD ingredient), neither of which we will eat in our household. Those ingredients were omitted on the product page by accident, they say. Really?!?!?!?!          Moreover, the package we received contained crusted seasoning on the container, and the package was dusty & yucky. I literally had to wash the canister & use a bit of elbow grease before even reading the ingredient list! This is a food item, for gosh sakes. Should have repackaged and refused delivery right then & there.          A bad experience with Amazon with this one, that's for certain. Would have never purchased in store, much less handled or  ought into my home. I can't believe Amazon is shipping food products in this condition. I'll definitely reconsider my purchase of grocery items here.
