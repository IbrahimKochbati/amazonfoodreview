This toy is great! It keeps my Aussie Cattle Dog engaged and working for her food at every meal, and makes her think and strategize at every angle. She is not known for her patience when it comes to getting food out of toys, and she'll easily shred or rip apart whatever she has to get to the food in the most efficient way possible. Less than 24hours after teaching her how this thing works, she figured out that the rope was keeping the food inside, so she promptly took it to her bed and ate the rope. We were initially disappointed   it was a sturdy cotton rope! Watching her just inhale the food out of it (literally, she would tip it neck down into her mouth and just pour the food out of it with no rope to stop the food), we decided to put some objects inside the bottle to make it more challenging, since the rope idea seemed to be a little too easy for her. We started with two golf balls, then moved up to two racquette balls, then a tennis ball. The tennis ball is almost impossible for her to get the food because it's so large the food won't move around it, so we went back to the racquette balls. So far, so good. She beats the thing against the floor, throws it into walls, and gnaws on it like it's covered in frozen peanut butter, and it holds up like a dream. She's gone from inhaling her food in under 30 seconds to taking almost 2 full minutes to eat a meal.          Other reviews have mentioned flimsy plastic, but we've found our's is great and made of sturdy, thick plastic. So far she's only scratched it a little on the outside. Others have complained of the same rope issues we had   the dog unravels or chews it off. Adding objects inside the toy that help block the food is a very simple, extremely cost effective way of altering the toy to make it easier or more difficult. We change it up sometimes from the racquette balls to small wood blocks, a variety of smaller objects (plastic Gatorade caps, golf balls, etc)   anything that is too big to come out the neck but large enough to block the food without being impossible. We've started putting it in places she has to work to get to before she can eat from it   on a chair, in an open box, hidden under a pillow on the floor, etc. Not a whole lot of effort on our part, but it pays off in spades when she's mentally tired for an hour or so after dinner!
