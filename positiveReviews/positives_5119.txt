The box is very impressive. So I had high expectations (especially when it comes to chocolate).     The combination of chopped up nuts and small pieces of dark chocolate is  illiant   unlike anything I have tasted before. Amazing flavor   somewhere between velvet (chocolate) and crispy (nuts).  Made me feel almost relaxed... weired...     Yesterday, I had it for  eakfast, instead of granola, with milk. It was really good. I didn't crave food and I didn't snack until mid afternoon. I am impressed.
