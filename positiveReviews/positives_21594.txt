I often wonder if I am the only person in the world who cannot stand microwave popcorn. Give me real corn and a little oil and I am pretty happy. Then I discovered this popcorn at a kitchen store in my local outlet. Then they went out of business and I lost my awesome popcorn connection... until now.          Wabash Valley Farms is the best popcorn you can get outside of your local multi plex (though I really like target popcorn too). You don't need the whirly popper as indicated on the package instructions   I always cook it on the stovetop in a large covered pot; my sister cooks it in one of those fancy carnival poppers.          Each pack contains 5 pouches of product. Each pouch contains popping oil, popcorn, and a buttery salt topping (which I only use about half of   it is very fine and very salty). For those that like additional butter, you can add it after popping. While I cannot attest to the exact amount of popcorn yielded, it does do a good job of filling up my 32 cup Tupperware Thatsa bowl. Thatsalotta popcorn.          The unit cost is about $2.40 per pack (or $1.66 per pouch in the 15 pack), which may seem high when comparing it to microwave popping corn, but you just cannot compare the quality and taste (and when compared to theater popcorn, it is a fraction of the cost). Orville Redenbacher has nothing on Wabash!
