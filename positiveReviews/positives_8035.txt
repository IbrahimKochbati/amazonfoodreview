I am, well was... a York pep patty addict but after reading the ingredients(sugar, semisweet chocolate (chocolate, sugar, lactose, cocoa, cocoa butter, milk fat, soy lecithin and PGPR, emulsifiers, and vanillin,. artificial flavor), corn syrup, invert sugar, egg whites, and oil of peppermint)I realized I did not want to eat corn syrup, which I avoid and why is it now in there when years ago, it wasn't.  I mean the first ingredient is sugar.  Then there's PGPR, I believe a preservative, that also, was never an ingredient, years ago.  Soy which is an  allergen to many as well as eggs.          Ok, enough of that rant.          I have been trying to find a substitute and you can see a review of another honey mint I recently tried. I wasn't totally thrilled.          So yesterday while at my health food store I bought one Honey Acre mint and gave it a try and wow, so yummy!!!  The filling is creamy and the chocolate a velvet consistency and the mint, well minty!  Had I known, I would have bought more than 1.          Sooooo, I just ordered a box of these and they will be my official peppermint patty addiction. :O)
