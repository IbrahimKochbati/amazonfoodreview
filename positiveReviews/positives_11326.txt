Due to "budget cuts" we decided no more Diedrich's K cups.  So bought an inexpensive coffee maker from Walmart and started trying other  ands.  Surprise! the best tasting, and least expensive, turned out to be Folgers BLACK SILK ground coffee.     The 6 pack on subscribe & save is the perfect plan for us.
