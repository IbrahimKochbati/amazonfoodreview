This is a good mix, and sprouts well, except half the smaller seeds   not sure whether it is clover or alfalfa, don't sprout. If all of them had sprouted this would have been five stars!          I sprout using a glass jar or stainless steel vessel, and a tea strainer to change the water. Initially, I thought that I was getting white fungus, and threw out a few batches. Later, I realized one of the seeds ( occoli or radish), has fuzzy hair in the sprout which looks like white fungus unless you inspect it closely.          I got the mix because the seeds are not available in smaller quantities, and I did not want to buy 4 pounds worth of seeds. But given the fact that there are too many blanks in a mix, I think I will try ordering just two individual seeds next time.
