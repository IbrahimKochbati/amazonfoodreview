I used to love these crackers and bought them all the time.  Even my family members who do not have to follow a gluten free diet thought they tasted good.  Then the company started adding sunflower products to the ingredients.  I knew with the first bite that the crackers now had an unpleasant "twang" in the taste.  I gave some to the rest of my family not telling them about the awful taste. They ate them without hesitation since they had enjoyed them in the past.  As soon as it hit their taste buds, they said, "YUK!"          When checking out the ingredients, to find out what had happened to these crackers, I found the sunflower addition.  Unfortunately, besides the bad taste, I am allergic to sunflower products, so will no longer purchase them.          I wrote to the company asking that they return to the original recipe, but never received a reply.
