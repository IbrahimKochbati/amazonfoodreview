Bought these for my little shih tzu a few months ago and he just will not eat or even chew on these things. And he's a chewer! Chews on everything else in the house, anyway. I tried coating it in peanut butter and he ate the first one, but the next time I tried he knew I was trying to trick him and wouldn't go near it.
