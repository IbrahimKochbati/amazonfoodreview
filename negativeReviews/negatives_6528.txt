I use hot chocolate packets to stir into my coffee.  I normally use Land O'Lakes hot chocolate, but I've had trouble getting some of my favorite flavors, so I wanted to try something new.  I ordered the Bellagio Chocolate Truffle flavor, and I suppose that it gets the job done.  But to make my coffee taste chocolatey enough, I've been having to mix in the Bellagio cocoa with a K cup hot chocolate.  The flavor's a little flat, and the texture is pretty watery when compared to Land O'Lakes or even regular Swiss Miss.  I don't hate it, but there are better options out there, so I won't be ordering it again.
