Trung Nguyen Gourmet Blend does not disappoint. It's the closest I've found to the blend of Trung Nguyen that is sold locally in Vietnam.     Do yourself a favor and buy some now. That, and a can of good sweetened condensed milk. Brew it the traditional way, and you be in coffee heaven just like I am now!          The only disappointing side to this review is the cost of this particular blend is not always easy to find, and the price is continually increasing.
