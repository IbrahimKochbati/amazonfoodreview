This has been my favorite tea for more than a decade but I can't find it locally. I had been ordering directly from Twining but placed this order with Amazon because of the free shipping for orders over $25.00 which saves me at least $1.00 per tin. Saving a buck is always exciting to one of Scots descent and since I drink a pot every day, it can add up over time.
