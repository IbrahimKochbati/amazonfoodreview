This is the favorite green tea in our household.  Been using it for years.  Was happy to find it here on Amazon, otherwise we had to travel about forty miles to an oriental grocery store to purchase it.  Can't even buy any leaf tea of any kind in regular grocery stores any more.  By the way "Ban Cha" in Japan simply means common or everyday tea.  Not ceremonial.
