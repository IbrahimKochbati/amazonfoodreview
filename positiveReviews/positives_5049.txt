This candy is similar to the Cry Baby tears that you find in the boxes only, as the seller mentions they are coated which doesn't seem to bother me. One thing you want to keep in mind unlike the individually boxed Cry Baby tears these ones do not contain the grape flavor. Great Candy it's too bad that this is so hard to find in stores.
