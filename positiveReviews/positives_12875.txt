Of the four flavors this product comes in, this is my fav. It is light, fruity, and refreshing. There is no weird taste, no bitterness. I'm willing to give up the 100 plus calories this has per serving to get 100% of the RDA of vitamin C and feel really refreshed. I think this product is so good because there is no sticky sweetness, no heaviness like regular juice has. The carbonation and the proportion of the various juices fits my palate perfectly. I would love a larger serving, but the calories would get out of hand. I may never go back to straight juice again.
