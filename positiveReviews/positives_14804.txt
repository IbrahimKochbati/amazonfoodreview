I am an avid tea drinker and have tried so many teas, both loose teas and bagged teas, looking for the perfect cup of Earl Grey.  Rishi hit the ball out of the park with this one.  The flavor is strong and full, but still sweet and comforting.  It is not as bitter or as harsh as many other Earl Greys.  It has a fresh taste and smell.  The tea is superbly balanced and tastes as if there is more to it than tea leaves and water.          To compare to some other teas, to give you a better picture of what I mean, it is a fuller flavor than Bigelow, Twinnings, or Ahmad, while being not as delicate as Numi.  It does not have the synthetic taste and smell of Stash.  It is not quite as pungent and bitter as Tazo (which I do like).  Mostly, it compares to Teavana's Earl Grey Creme, which I also highly recommend, but is a more robust flavor, with less of the creamy mouth feel.  I highly recommend this tea.
