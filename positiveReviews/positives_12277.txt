Bought at Casa Fruta in Gilroy, CA and love it! I put it in my ramen soup. I must confess that I put a lot more than most. My bottle is running low now so I will get some more. I would love to try them all. I think that blossomvalleyfoods.com has good prices but I just wanted one bottle. Thank you Amazon!
