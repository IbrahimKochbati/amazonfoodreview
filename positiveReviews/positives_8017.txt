This is a great product for those who need gluten, dairy & casein free foods.          Of course it doesn't taste like REAL macaroni and cheese! Geez   do you really think shelled hemp nuts and other things are going to give you a creamy cheesey texture or taste? If you're looking for something to replicate annies GF mac and cheese (which DOES contain dairy) then you will search in vain. You cannot get real cheese flavor from non cheese products.          However, if you're realistic and are aware that non cheese stuff won't actually taste like cheese yet you want something similar to mac & cheese then this is a great option! We really like this mix. It has a unique taste. We tend to alternate this stuff with Road's End Organics GF Cheddar Penne & ChreeseÂ®    "
