After reading reviews and testing these out with friends, I can say this: Everyone's tastes (and tastebuds) are different. What is not sweet to one person is super sweet to another. So be ye warned, results for these may vary.          I found that the tablets didn't make things "sweet" as much it cut down on the sourness, almost like a numbing effect.  Ever put sugar on a lemon slice and bit into it? The sour kick is still there, just canceled out. I'm certainly not going to be eating them like candy as some reviews suggest.          Tried out a few beer types, with mixed results: Beers that are fruity citrus ended up gross, as it would taste like I mixed in a mouthful of juice with the beer. Dark beers like an Irish Red were my favorite.          I really recommend going out to eat so you can try a variety of things. Certain foods will take you for surprise (ranch dressing, for example, was notably different and very good).
