I am a peanut butter fanatic, and I get excited every time Amazon offers a bulk order of peanut butter at a low price.  I use peanut butter as a mid day energy boosting snack    straight off the spoon and without any other food to supplement it.  It's just THAT good to me.          I was more than happy with Skippy Reduced Fat Creamy.  I like the smooth texture it has, and it has a great mouth feel that isn't the thick "stick to the roof of my mouth" kind that requires a glass of milk to be able to eat.  I don't feel that Skippy reduced the flavor from its original peanut butter along with the fat to make this product    it tastes delicious and satisfying.          If you're a peanut butter lover like me, please look out for the fantastic prices Amazon has on Skippy Reduced Fat Creamy    you won't regret buying it, and the reduced fat intake is a bonus!
