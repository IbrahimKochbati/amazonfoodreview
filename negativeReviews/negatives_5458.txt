I cannot say I had high expectations for a low acid French roast coffee.  It was rather bland so the flavor does not live up to the full bodied flavor one would expect from a dark roast coffee.  It is not bad an certainly an alternative if you are susceptible to acid but it is not in competition for any premium coffee awards.
