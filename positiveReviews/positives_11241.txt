Note, the back of the package gives you options as to what you can add to the mix.  There is a cake like optin, fudgy, non oil, etc...  I used the "fudgy" recipe and it was FABULOUS!  They had a wonderful flavor.  I got them on a whim, suspecting one of my children may have a problem with gluten.  Even if he tests ok, I will buy these again, I actually prefer in some ways to the Duncan Hines  and I normally use.  My son has eaten them up!  We do not notice any aftertaste (which has been mentioned in other reviews).  Maybe they used a different recipe than fudgy?  I actually did notice the chocolate had a very rich taste, like they used a high quality coco powder.
