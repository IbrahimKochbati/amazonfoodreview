Fondarific usually has glowing reviews... everyone on the cake forums seems to love it.  My batch was either old or just crap.  Very disappointing.  Will go back to making marshmallow fondant.... cheaper and WAY easier to work with.  Also bought the black but didn't open it because the white was such crap.  Had to use it because I ran out of time to make MMF for the cake I was making... DUE TO THE FACT THAT I PRE PURCHASED fondant to use.          I love working with Fondant, and thought that maybe I'd use something easier this time, but it wasn't.  Good luck with this.          Taste however, was quite good.
