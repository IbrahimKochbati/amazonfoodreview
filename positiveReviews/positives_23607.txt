Of all the "Subscribe and Save" products, this is the one I've been waiting for    Rosarita refried beans are a real staple, my #1 comfort food and #1 earthquake preparedness food. With my Prime membership this works out to about a dollar a can, which is a decent price, and these cans are heavy to lug home on foot from the market! Add a tablespoon of chicken stock or water if the beans are too thick for your tastes. They're ideal with scrambled eggs, you want them to make a burrito out of, they're great on their own, maybe with some salsa or grated cheese    I really love these beans. Very highly recommended! I'd read that Californians who had moved with their jobs back east to the Carolinas would have people visiting California ask "Do you want me to  ing you some beans?"    they're that iconic and that good. I've made my own refried beans from scratch and it's not a simple task. I am so pleased to be able to buy these from amazon.com!!!            Help!! The price went from $22 to $42 in two months!!!! Not such a great deal any more!!!
