The Switch Kiwi Berry is 8.3 ounces and has 135 calories, 15 mg of Sodium, 34 g of carbs (11% of daily value), 33 g of sugar and oh yeah 100% of your Vitamin C daily value. Mind you, a 12 oz can of Coke has 140 calories, 50mg of Sodium, 39g of carbs and 39g of sugar. So apart from the no sugar added, preservatives and all the added artifial stuff, there is not much of a difference in nutrition between these two products. Need the Vitamin C? Drink orange juice. Yes, the Switch may be a tad healthier but it is still a can of empty calories. Moreover, a can of this may not be enough for most people, so double the calories if you decide to drink two.          As for taste, it is too sweet. I agree with the reviewer that said that this tasted like apple juice. It does. It tastes like over sweetened apple juice. There is a slight (very slight) hink of kiwi and none of berries. The sweetness is too strong at first but it does grow on you.          This soda has way too much sugar, almost as much as a regular can of soda, and it tastes like it. It is too sweet for my taste. Frankly, giving the calories for this small can, it is not worth it. Now, I would like to try the Diet version if there was one.          As for price, each can is about a dollar. Way too expensive. This is like paying $1 for each of those small Coke cans (the 8 oz small cans). Would you pay a dollar for one of those? Neither would I.
