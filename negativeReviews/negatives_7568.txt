I am so disappointed, these berries have a very bad aftertaste. I got a little nauseous after eating about an ounce...kinda makes me worry...Im going to try them for a few more days if i get nauseous one more time im going to attempt to return...One very odd thing...i didnt get any paperwork w  this order, so returning may be a huge hassle...
