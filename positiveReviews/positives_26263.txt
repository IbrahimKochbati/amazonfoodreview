I saw this on youtube from a friend, and had to get it right away. It shipped super fast as usual.          I had so much fun making this candy, and it tastes awesome. The textures are really cool too. I'm going to get more for my boyfriend's kids, I think they will really like it. Make them work for their candy. :D          The instructions are really easy to follow due to the pictures and colors, so you don't need to be able to read japanese to follow along. Super cute and fun.
