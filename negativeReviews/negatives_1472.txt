After eating this product, I had a stomach ache followed by hours on the toilet. Those of you with a gluten intolerance and Celiac disease know exactly what those symptoms mean... somehow this product is contaminated with gluten! It is NOT gluten free! Please spare yourself the pain and suffering. These cookies are not worth it.          For those of you who are tempted to continue eating this product even after you have been informed that it is not gluten free, please keep these facts in mind:     1. If you eat gluten, it damages your intestinal lining.     2. If you keep on eating gluten the damage to your intestines will get worse and so will your symptoms.     3. If you further continue to eat gluten you will end up in malabsorption, increase your risk for intestinal cancer, and lead to all sorts of problems including infertility, autoimmune disorders, oteoporosis.     In other words, cheating on your diet is not worth it!     Don't eat Nana's products!          Instead, I suggest you buy something like Pamela's chunky chocolate cookies. They are one of my favorites.
