This is the best gluten free pasta I have ever purchased, HANDS DOWN.          It's firm and holds up to stirring with a spoon while it's cooking, and it's really delicious. I tastes like very high quality traditional pasta. My only complaint is that it's expensive. Compared to regular pasta, it's like 5 times more expensive. But if you have gluten senstivity, or if you prefer a  own rice pasta (healthier alternative) it is the BEST one on the market.          I bought this one and the elbow, and both were equally good. So I assume that all of the  own rice pasta by this company is going to be good.          It also takes a little longer to cook   about 17 minutes. And you should stir it frequently so that it cooks evenly. But I don't see these as a drawback   just an FYI.  It really does taste very good.
