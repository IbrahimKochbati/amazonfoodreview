My cats are crazy for this food, including the one that has turned up her nose at all wet food for 6 years! Unfortunately the price makes it prohibitive as an every day meal since I have 5 cats. Also, I've heard that too much fish is not healthy for cats, they need meat too and they aren't that crazy about the Petite Cuisine Chicken.  I still buy the tuna and just feed it occasionally as an extra treat. The food itself looks and smells just like tuna for humans, maybe even a little better. Some of it has tiny little (whole) shrimp and some pieces of codfish   it also has a lot of tuna oil, which I guess is what the cats like about it because the first thing they do is lap up all the "gravy". I thought maybe if I bought human tuna in oil and spiked their usual soft Friskies, they would enjoy it more, but that didn't work, so I continue to buy Petite Cuisine.
