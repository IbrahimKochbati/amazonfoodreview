I have a 3yr old female Alaskan Malamute who is a power chewer! She just loves these.  and they are really good for her teeth also. i took her to the vet 2 wks ago for her annual check up and shots, and the vet said "her teeth are in excellent condition." I give her  2 chews a day  1 in the AM and 1 in the PM.
