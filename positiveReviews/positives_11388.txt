I used to drink a lot of soda pop until I started having problems with calories. Then I switched to diet sodas. After drinking such beverages for years, I was finally convinced that diet sodas weren't doing me any good. Whether they were harmful is open to debate. In any case, I'll still drink a diet soda if nothing else is available and I don't worry any about it. However, I discovered the Crystal Geyser flavored spring water and enjoyed it very much. I first tried the lemon and lime and the latter was my favorite. More recently, I picked up a case of the Orange. It's good! It has a nice zesty carbonation and a nice very light orange taste. I like it ice cold. It goes real well with meals and the 18 ounce bottle is just the right size.          Gary Peterson
