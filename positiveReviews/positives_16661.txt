Since all Greenies are the same I would suppose that only the suppliers of Greenies could make the difference, and this one certainly did!     We received our order for an amazing cocker  iel in very good time, which made us all very happy!     And as far as price goes, that was really a surprise!     Even with postage these healthy treats cost less than we had been paying for them in pet stores here in Salt Lake City!     You can surely look forward to many more orders from us!     Thanks for the great treatment!!!!     Ray, Joan and Taz          PS  I HAVE NO IDEA OF HOW THE IDENTIFYING PICTURE OF THE PRODUCT I REVIEWED GOT SWITCHED!          HOWEVER, PLEASE DO NOT LET YOUR DOG EAT THE MICROFIBER CLOTHS (EVEN THE GREEN ONES)!!!!!!!!!
