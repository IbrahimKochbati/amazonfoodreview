These tablets definitely made things sweeter    like lemons, limes, and grapefruit.  But it wasn't to the point of sheer amazement.  They also had an interesting effect on cheeses and vinegar, but still did virtually nothing for beer and wine. The tablets are a bit pricey but they do work.  If you've got extra money, sure, give them a try, but if you're looking for some amazing way to get your kids to eat  occoli or something along those lines then this is not the answer. Fun experiment, but not life changing. :)
