I work for a veterinary hospital, and after the big food scare I found myself calling around to different food companies to see who made an AMERICAN product. And by American, I didn't mean imported products thrown into a food assembled in the United States so it could be called "made here." I wanted meat grown here, veggies grown here, and no imports. FOUND IT.     This dog food was recommended to me by a bloodhound  eeder. Bloodhounds are known to have gunky skin (must be all the wrinkles) and they are prone to eye infections, allergies, bloat, and numerous other conditions. Well, most bloodhounds. Not her dogs. Her dogs have healthy glowing coats, shiney eyes, and just  ing her lots of ribbons in the show ring.     My dogs are couch potatoes, but I feel better feeding them something good for them. At first I was worried the smaller bite size might interfere with good tartar control, but now months on this food NO TARTAR. At all, and my one dog had had a tartar control problem for a long time. His doggy  eath has never been better. If I could give this food 10 stars, I would. I'd recommend this food for toy  eeds as well as giant  eeds.     It used to be when I opened a bag of food I'd keep my nose away because the dog food was stinky. Not this food, now, I'm not saying I want a mouthful, but it is NOT stinky like some dog foods. You can actually smell the herbs they use.     This product is on my wish list at Amazon. Anyone who wants to get me a good gift, get me a bag. It is definately a gift I'll use!
