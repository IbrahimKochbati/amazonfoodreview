The others like it a lot and I think the taste is good, but the texture is just off to me. Its very soft and tender, but kind of crumbly. I prefer the honey pepper. Not too spicy, either, so that's nice. Over all its ok and the others in the office will buy more, but I will stick to the other kinds.
