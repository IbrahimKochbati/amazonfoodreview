Ew...I love Canada Dry and Schwepps, and I decided to try this  and because it was cheaper and it looked authentic. Not sure how the regular (non diet) kind compares, but this tastes so diety  it's gross. I usually drink diet soda and don't mind the taste of diet coke, diet dr. pepper, diet sprite, (other diet gingerale, too) but this is REALLY GROSS. don't get it! You can definitely taste the ginger, but the overly saccharine taste ruins it.
