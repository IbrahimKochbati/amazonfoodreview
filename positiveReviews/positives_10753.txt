Dog treats. What do you do with dog treats? Well, if you have a dog that is very food centered, then dog treats are the best thing going as you can use them as the necessary treats for helping in training your dog, or maintaining his her training later on in their lives.          We have a big dog, so training her is a must. These treats are definitely a hit with our pooch! They are also small enough that we do not feel too bad using several during a training session. They are dry squares with a look and feel of thick crackers. Once you open the bag, there are many pieces, but there is a line through the center which means that you can  eak them in half pretty easily. This extends the amount of them you can use by two.          I cannot vouch for how they taste but they certainly attract my dog and she is very attentive when I  ing the bag out. The label talks about the ingredients being organic, consisting of Lamb and Barley   which is all to the good as there are dogs that are not happy with corn based products, etc.          All in all, it's a nice product and one that my dog appreciates, and I would definitely consider purchasing them at my store.
