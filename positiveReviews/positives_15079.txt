I have been using this product for 5+ years and have enjoyed it much.  I sometimes will mix in chopped hot dogs or sausage for variety.  Spicy sausage works well.  The main complaint I have is the amount of salt they put in the mix.  I can almost smell the salt!  Unfortunately they do not have the reduced sodium version where I live so I will try to order it online.  Overall, it's very flavorful but too salty.  It's much more flavorful than the similar Goya product.
