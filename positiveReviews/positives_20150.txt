One of the things I miss about Austin, TX is this little soft drink, Orangina. First came up on it in a Greek fast food place near 9th and Congress just south of the Capital. Then, found it in Central Market. Was a two bottle a day man by the time I had to get out of Austin. A must try if you like a just right natural orange flavor soda.
