I first tried coconut sugar after Dr. Oz mentioned it as being better for you than regular sugar. Prior to this, I had also tried organic cane sugar but, this is just wonderful and TASTY! It substitutes one to one for regular sugar but has this delicious taste to it. You can use it in baking, etc....but I mostly use sugar in my coffee. I had been using Truvia recently but this makes the coffee so must more delicious!!! The only drawback is that it has calories, just like sugar does but....YUM!!!
