JUST GOT THIS SEASONING LAST NIGHT AND MADE SOME TURKEY TACOS WITH IT.....THEY WERE EXTREMELY NASTY.....ABSOLUTELY NO FLAVOR.....I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THAT ITS A NO SALT SEASONING BUT MAN , IT TASTED HORRIBLE AND HAS MADE ME SICK. I WILL JUST TRY A LOW SALT TACO SEASONING UNTIL I FIND A NO SALT ONE THAT IS AT LEAST BAREABLE AND DOESNT MAKE ME SICK....UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS.....
