If you've got hard chewers (like one of our dogs), these things won't really work for the ' ushing' aspect    they're bussted up and swallowed pretty quickly. We have three Chihuahua mixes, and they dispatched these petite ones too quickly, so we get them the next size up (small, I think). But the product is good, and they really do help a bit with  eath    although the biggest bad  eath maker is teeth that need  ushing, and there is no substitute for real  ushing cleaning.  These are good as part of the process though. We have, and will continue to purchase this product.
