Before I begin my review, let me say this... I read the product specs, ESPECIALLY THE DIMENSIONS...     I measured the space I have, and armed with that knowledge, I ordered the item.          The item is exactly as described and pictured... and because I pre measured, I KNEW it would fit (unlike other reviewers who apparently couldn't be bothered, and then give it a low rating as a result).          It's a simple design, and well built.  It's sturdy enough to hold the weight of my LARGE Cuisinart k cup  ewer, with a full reservoir.  It's a solid wire frame build, and the rails the drawer runs on are part of that wire design.  The mesh walls are a tad light weight, but they aren't load bearing, and are only meant for aesthetics and to contain the k cups. (I also store Splenda packets in one column of mine.)          Other than my 'normal' blend, I tend to have up to 5 additional flavors for a weekend treat, or just to mix it up on occasion... keeping these loose on the counter, or bouncing around mixed up in a box made it a pain to pick through them... but now I keep them in line in the segmented rows in the drawer.  Having a lack of storage space in my cupboards and kitchen drawers makes this the natural and ideal choice.          Many have been disappointed that it didn't "fit"    but all you need to do is measure your  ewer's footprint, and it's height beneath your cupboards (if applicable).          It's not a PERFECT item (the mesh could be a tad better grade, or the price about $5 lower) but otherwise highly recommended purchase.
