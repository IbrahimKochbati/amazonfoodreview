I am constantly trying new foods, and when I read about the nutritious value of almondmilk, I decided to get a two pack. About two weeks later, I opened my first one and gagged when I added it to my cereal. The taste was just unbearable, and for once, I found my vocabulary lacking in adjectives to describe it's taste. I checked the expiration date, which wasn't for another 8 months, and left it onto my refrigerator. Perhaps I purchased a bad batch, because the other one started bloating just sitting on my counter (I purchased the shelf life ones and refrigerated them after opening).          The only way I can tolerate the taste is to put some protein powder in it and mix it with some agave syrup. I've eaten a lot of MRE's in my time in the Army, and this easily ranks below any nasty thing I've eaten (or drank). I'll stick with my regular 2% milk and continue with a vitamin supplement for nutrition.
