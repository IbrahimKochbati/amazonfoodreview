Wonderful flavor. Grade B is richer and darker than Grade A which is lighter tasting. The price on Amazon is comparable to non organic elsewhere. We never use the grocery store type syrups as they are mainly sugar. This must be kept refrigerated.          I often make cleansing drinks either with raw organic apple cider vinegar mixed with a bit of maple syrup or the lemon (I usually use key limes or limes as I like them better than lemons), cayenne pepper and maple syrup recipe that many use for cleanses (master cleanse). So many micro nutrients, and now that the honey supply is in question with honey bee shortage (see Dr. Mercola's recent article that 75% of our honey is actually a product coming from China, including that in big box stores)maple syrup is even more immportant to us as I am not comfortable buying honey.
