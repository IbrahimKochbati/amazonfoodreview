I had been buying all sorts of super premium, super expensive foods.  My local stores kept discontinuing them.  So I did my research and found Newman's Own Organic.          It is certified organic with no hormones, antibiotics or chemical additives, corn or wheat.          And my dogs love it (of course they eat anything including grass and bird food and several unfit to post on line).
