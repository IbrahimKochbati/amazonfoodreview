Nantucket Blend is perfect. It's a smooth medium blend with just the right amount of caffeine to wake me up in the morning. It's almost creamy and it almost tastes to me like it has a very slight vanilla flavor to it. But don't take my word for it being slightly vanilla as I'm definitely not a coffee connoisseur. I guess I think this because it's so creamy and yummy tasting.
