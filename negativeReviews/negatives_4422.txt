I ordered 3 of these for each of my daughters. They are not what is pictured. It actually comes with a cheap adjustable plastic pearl ring and some extra deformed plastic pearl earings. The chain to the necklace is a snake chain and those are great but thats it. One cage would barely open and was bent, another was not going to open at all, the last one opened but the chain was in a knot. Come on... for the price I was not expecting fine jewelry but this was very tacky looking. I would have been embarassed to give this to anyone!!
