Except I'm getting oats plus a whole bunch of other grains. If you want an oatmealish(but whole grain instead of cut rolled chopped) food that's also got lots of other grains in it this might be something to check out. I usually put it in my rice cooker with a cut up apple, cinnamon and a little honey for  eakfast. Or with seasonings and chunks of meat veggies(add veggies at the end to steam) if I want a quick meal.
