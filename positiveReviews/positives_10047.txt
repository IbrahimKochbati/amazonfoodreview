I admit to being one of those annoying self confessed coffee snobs who insists on using fresh beans which I grind daily myself, but I got the Melitta ground coffee to sample and I'm pleasantly surprised. It's smooth and tasty, definitely not too acidic or overpowering by any means. Of course, a lot of the time, coffee taste and flavor will depend on how you prepare it, but comparing it to my regular  ews it was on a similar level, though I think I'll always stick to the freshness and enjoyment of grinding the beans myself every morning, and trying different varieties.
