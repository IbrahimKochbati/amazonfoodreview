This is a lighter version of Earl Grey tea and has a pleasant citrus undertone and bouquet. When you open the tin (which is well designed, pleasing to the eye and also worth keeping as a container for all sorts of small objects) and look inside, you are pleasantly surprised with a colourful mixture of full leaf black tea, leaves of dried blue cornflowers and small bits of citrus peel. We first tried the tea bags, which were handy, however, we prefer the loose tea.  If you like Earl Grey tea try this one you will like it!
