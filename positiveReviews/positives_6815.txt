The 12 pack is a great gift idea because Omaha Steaks packages them in two boxes of 6.  This makes it cheaper than the 6 pack if you are buying more than one quantity.  Omaha is always fast at shipping too.  Though I've had other Omaha Steaks products, I have only purchased these as gifts, so I can't comment on taste.
