This product have no flavor at all, I could not taste apple or any other! It was just something sweet. Also it had a bad smell!     Am used to the Haribo bears, sold in the US market, they have a noticeable taste, they are made in Turkey. While these bad Frogs are made is Spain....maybe that why they taste and smell funny!!?
