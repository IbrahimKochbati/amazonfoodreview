Hate to say it, but these were pretty dry and tasteless.          My daughter and I both tried one, and the first thing my daughter said was, "These have chocolate chips?"          I said, "Yes."          She studied the cookie as she ate, then said, "I can't even taste them." Then she picked one of the chips out of the cookie and ate it on its own. "Are they REAL chocolate chips, or fake?"          I read the package. "Says they're real chocolate chips."          "They don't taste like any chocolate chip I've ever eaten. They taste fake."          I agreed, but I do understand that to deliver a soft cookie that stays soft, but is still preserved, you have to put stuff in the cookie that's not exactly what Grandma would put in her own cookies. They do have a slightly chemical taste, but that's typical for this kind of cookie. I would have liked them to be a bit less dry. I found I had to drink a whole bottle of water while I ate just one of these.          While they do have slightly more healthy stuff than, say, a normal packaged chocolate chip cookie, (I did like that they had 4 grams of fiber), I just felt myself wishing they would taste slightly better.
