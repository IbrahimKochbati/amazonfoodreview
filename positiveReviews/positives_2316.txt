This product is both effective and convenient. We were able to assemble it and have it working within 30 minutes. It worked great as a "maternity ward" for our alpaca millay and her new cria. We were able to give them some private time while not feeling as though they were separated from the herd. I highly recommend this product and will have many uses for it in the future!
