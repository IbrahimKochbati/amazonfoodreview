Our source for this dog food went out of business. It was highly recommended by our dog trainer and wasn't out of line on cost. We couldn't find it anywhere and I jokingly asked my wife to check at Amazon. To our shock, you had it, at the same price and you had it delivered right to our front door, all at the same price.  Unreal.
