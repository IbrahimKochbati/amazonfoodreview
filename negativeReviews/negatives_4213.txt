Okay, decent drinking wines are $20 for larger bottles! What gives? And don't tell me it's because it's organic and because it's for Japanese cooking. This is the USA where people cook all kinds of ethnic food and they use lots of mirin, when they can find it. Btw you can find this exact bottle of Eden Mirin for 1 2 this price and free shipping, elsewhere.
