I tasted these apples at a store with my 3 yr old daughter, and we both really liked them.  Most dried apples I've tasted are really soft and thick.  These are a little thinner and crunchier.  And Amazon had the best price I could find.  We will order these again when we run out.  A great snack to have in the car, too.
