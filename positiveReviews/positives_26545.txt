Hi!  I have that coffee maker at home   the Keurig thing.  I love it.  And I love coffee   I have some every single morning.  I can't live without it.  I love my coffee maker   and I tried many, many, MANY of the numerous types of coffee that are available for it via these "K Cups".  Let me tell you, that as an avid coffee drinker, this is hands down my #1 favorite  and to make at home. It's mild, it's not overly bold, it's nice and mellow, it's not bitter in the least, it's not watery, it's PERFECT.  I like my coffee with milk and sugar and this one is just the BEST.  I am sick of the "Extra Bold" coffees they make for this machine   they all taste the same and are just too harsh for me.  This one   this Caribou one   ROCKS.
