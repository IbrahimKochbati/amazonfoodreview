We've had our Keurig since December and love it.  We tried the Twinings Earl Grey tea K cups and, although the coffee is uniformly great, we had a bit of pessimism whether a Keurig could " ew" a good cup of tea.  The Twinings K cups more than passed the test and have become a favorite in our household.  The tea is  ewed just right, flavorful and refreshing.  Twinings (and Keurig) have become a big hit in our home.
