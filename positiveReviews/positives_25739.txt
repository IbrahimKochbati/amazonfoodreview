I love oatmeal cookies and these are no different. They are soft and a decent size, the whole family likes them. Since they only came in a box of 6 i suspect i will have to buy two boxes at a time in the future because they are very popular at my house. Quaker has always been a good  and and it remains true with these cookies! Well done indeed!
