The fact that this tea is 'detoxifying' really intrigued me and so I picked it up at my local grocery store. :) So far I've been drinking it for a few days and I'm liking the way it makes me feel, although for any real health benefits I'm sure I'll have to drink it for longer.          When I first opened the box to use it I have to say I was disappointed. For me the smell is kind of off putting and I was sure I wasn't going to like the taste. But I'd already bought it so I decided to  ew a cup anyway just to see how it turned out.          I love adding fresh lemon slices or small 'cutie' mandarin oranges to my tea for sweetner (because I don't use sugar), and so for this tea I added the juice of one mandarine orange (along with the actual little orange pieces, love having them and seeing them in my tea!) And it turns out as much as I hate the smell (still do...) I love the taste! With the fresh mandarine oranges it really gives it a taste reminiscent of apple cider (weird, but true, and really good). Also, I absolutely hate black licorice, but I really like this tea, so I'm thinking it won't be a problem for others who dislike licorice as well...          It's a very strong tea with bold flavors and is a really good replacement for coffee, at least for me. :) Don't be afraid to try it. :)
