Pure Ghee is a staple in our home. Although it may seem to be a luxury to spend on a condiment it will become one of those ingredients one cannot live without. I have tried many 'health food' store commercial  ands and I have tried to make my own, but they pale in comparison. My 14yo son loves to cook eggs in ghee and is quite disappointed when we are running low and usually adds ghee to our Amazon cart. It is essential for those who follow a GAPS diet, Wise Tradition, or other 'healthy fat' lifestyle. If not, no matter. Pure Ghee tastes great on toast, popcorn and ANY Indian Indonesian recipe and great for traveling camping pack backing because it doesn't require refrigeration. Some spend on expensive coffee, great wines or cheeses, or other gourmet products, but if we had to choose Pure Ghee always comes first in our home.
