I was a bit nervous trying this kibble after reading all the negative reviews, but I decided to give it a go since it's one of the only reasonably priced wheat & corn free "premium" kibbles available where I live.          The ingredients list looked respectable (first 3 ingredients are human grade meat meals), as did the nutritional information (meets AAFCO profile for All Life Stages).  Also, all the ingredients are apparently from the U.S.A, so no worries about melamine (the two recent melamine scares were from Chinese wheat gluten and Chinese milk powder).          We're on our 3rd bag now   my girl thrives on it, and likes it.  She's hard to keep weight on, but this food is good for that as it has a very high energy content compared to most kibbles.          I do feed partially raw & partially kibble,  not just Canidae, so perhaps that makes a difference to how well the dog does on it.  But I can honestly say I've had no problems with this kibble at all, & will keep feeding it.
