I've tried all of the national products and this is not only the best, but it is actually GOOD.  My gluten tolerant kids prefer it to store bought regular  ead.  We use olive oil when making it   rather than regular vegetable oil.  Don't know if that makes a huge difference, but everyone loves this  ead.  Highest recommendation!
