I am so happy I found this product! Charlie can  eak through almost any toy but not this one. I was very surprised by how thick the "jug" is (I purchased the large.) He loves chewing on the rope which is rubber and so far it has not been  oken. The dry food I put inside comes out in the right amount, it doesn't fall out like some toys and it is not to difficult like others. I am very very happy and recommend this toy to anyone with a dog that likes to chew and needs to be kept busy.
