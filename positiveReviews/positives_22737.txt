I will not be trying any other popcorn for as long I can get this from Amazon. The 4oz portion pack is perfect for our whirleypop and the popcorn is great.  As I have read in other reviews the oil can be solid while in the package, but once you put it to the heat it melts fast.  We have had a couple packages that had a few extra unpopped kernels, but no more than any other  and we have tried and with the subscibe and save price you can not beat the price.
