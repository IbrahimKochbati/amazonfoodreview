My son and I are allergic to sesame, so these nutritious little seeds are a good alternative. They're great to add to homemade crackers or even to pasta dishes. Everyone in the family likes them. The reason for 4 stars is that there are some black hulls mixed in that are pretty hard and get stuck in our teeth.
