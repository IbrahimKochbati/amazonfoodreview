This mix makes nice pancakes. They smell rich and vanilla y, but you don't actually  taste it as strong as it smells. I won't buy them again because there are easier mixes out there that taste pretty darn close. I'm just as happy using a Krusteaz  and mix that only requires the addition of water (no eggs or milk or flour necessary). Heck, if you want that vanilla smell and taste, add an eighth or quarter teaspoon of some extract to your batter.          Edited for grammar's sake.
