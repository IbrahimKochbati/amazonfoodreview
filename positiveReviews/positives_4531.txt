wow.  I read the great feedback on this product and took the plunge and was not disappointed.  We had bought some other walnut oil at WF and this one blows that out of the water.  The flavor, aroma, and price are second to none.          My fav recipe so far:     take a large yam sweet potatoe, cut in 1 4 inch strips lenthwise (like a long potatoe chip).  baste in oil and salt.   oil for 10 min per side.  enjoy!
