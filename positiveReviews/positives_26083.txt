I strongly believe in paying more for higher quality food now to avoid paying high health costs later. Natural Balance is a little pricey BUT it is high quality food and my cats love it. I have noticed a positive change in my cats' health, from the shine of their coats and clearness of their eyes to their digestion and activity levels. We live in a health oriented household where we buy mostly organic food and drink filtered water. I want my cats to live long healthy lives and I think with Natural Balance it just may happen.
