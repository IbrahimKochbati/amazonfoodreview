This coffee is sold as a low acid alternative for those that experience stomach problems from reflux and heartburn. Their research backs up this claim. For those with those issues, I recommend that you give this  and a try. Not only does it work, but it has a great coffee flavor. I also like that it is pre packaged in 3 oz bags, which is great for taking on trips, and avoids the daily routine of measuring.          For me, my morning coffee is something that I truly enjoy and will not compromise on. I'm a Seattle's Best fan and have been drinking their French Roast (now #6) for years, so I was looking forward to trying this French roast and doing a comparison. The first good sign that I noticed is that this is a fine grind, which allows me to use a little less to get the results I like. I used six tablespoons of this coffee to prepare about 7 1 2 cups of coffee, so one 3 oz packet will make a complete pot. It came out just right and tasted very much like the SB. I did not notice any aftertaste or stomach issues.          Again, give it a try, especially if you experience stomach problems from regular coffee.
