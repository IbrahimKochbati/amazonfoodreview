Coconut Water with a splash of Pineapple          This is refreshing!  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  The coconut flavor isn't pronounced, and the pineapple isn't so overpowering that it tastes like syrup.  It's clean tasting.  According to the packaging, "it has five essential electrolytes, more potassium than a banana, no fat, no cholesterol, and no preservatives."  There's a smidge of fiber, 0.8 g of protein and 16 g of sugars.  I suspect most of the sugar comes from the pineapple, but "cane juice" is one of the ingredients, too. The 8.5 fl oz carton comes to 75 calories.          If you sign up for subscribe & save, it's less than $1 per carton.  Actually, the carton is the only thing I don't like about this drink.  It's sort of hard to drink directly from because there isn't any air getting let in when you drink, which makes a vacuum.  This was solved by pouring it into a glass.  *whew*          This was good.  I will definitely get more, and I highly recommend this to people who like pineapple juice.
