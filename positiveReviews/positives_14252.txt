I am a ginger fanatic and this is the best candy I have found. Soft, chewy, full of great ginger flavor and 'heat'! And the packaging is the best. With other  ands I have tried, while they have been very flavorful, it was difficult to unwrap them without playing tug of war with the wrapping. These are wrapped in powdered parchment and then an outer wrapper, easy to remove and pop in your mouth. And the Amazon 5 pack price cannot be beat. I paid over twice this price in a local health food store. Stock up   they have a long shelf life!
