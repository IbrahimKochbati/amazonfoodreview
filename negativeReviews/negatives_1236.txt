Our pediatrician told me to include some form of meat at dinner for our baby. Unfortunately, two of the four varieties don't include meat. I don't think Summer Vegetable should be included in a dinner variety pack, that's what the vegetable variety pack is for. Also, the chicken and sweet potato is extremely runny and hard to feed to a baby.
