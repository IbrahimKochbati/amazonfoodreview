I use these little wonders in many of my recipes   mainly my homemade applesauce.  When supply was runnng disturbingly low, started shopping to replenshish supply around Valentine's Day like I have done for years.  This  year it was impossible until Amazon came to the rescue.  Bought the 2 lbs. package and now just go to Amazon when fesh supply is needed.  Thank you again for solving my problem.
