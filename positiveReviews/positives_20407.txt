Happybellies was the answer to my prayers. We first used Earth's Best and had allergy problems. What a mystery! I though rice cereal was supposed to be pure and natural....but discovered that not all  ands have nut or soy free products. We switched our daughter to Happybellies and she's an eating monster. Not only is this product iron fortified, but also has probiotics. Thank you Happybellies!
