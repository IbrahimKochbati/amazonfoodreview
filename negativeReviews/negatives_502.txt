You order (and pay for)D.O.P. Certified San Marzano tomatoes but you will receive "CERTIFIED" which means absolutely nothing. A true SM tomato will have an EU D.O.P emblem on the label plus the Corsorzio San Marzano stamp. This is false advertising.  If you enlarge the picture shown you can see on the upper left side partially one of the stamps. You will not receive this DOP label.  You will  receive another tomato from somewhere in the region under the Cento name. Typical marketing hoodwinking. Amazon refuses to take returns on this item, so beware.
