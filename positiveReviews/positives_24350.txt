I love this tea, it is very refreshing and the aroma is full as well.     i can not believe that i have to resort to ordering it online, as this type is the only one that has a nice rounded taste. The other options, makers, including the organic version taste all watered down to me.     Swanson delivered the tea quickly and the package had no damage   good service!
