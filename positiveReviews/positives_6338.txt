bought both the savory seafood and the chicken and wheat germ, as the kittens liked the fish, chicken and liver flavor.  They are not so fond of it, but will eat if there is nothing else.  Also, they will only eat it as soon as a can is opened, there is no hope of putting half a can in tupperware and feeding it to them later. Oh, yeah, and STINKY.  But a good product if your kitty likes the taste.
