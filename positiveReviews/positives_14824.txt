For starters, I am a coffee lover.  I have my own Behmor coffee roaster, and everything from Columbian to Ethiopian green coffee that I roast and drink regularly.  I started looking for a good afternoon early evening tea, and prefer English Breakfast or Earl Grey.  Once I came across Rishi's Earl Grey, I was hooked.  From opening their container, you immediately get a blast of aroma that permeates full of Orange Pekoe that follows through to the cup.          I don't want to write a long opinionated review, but I believe this is a must try for any black tea drinkers out there.  You might not be as impressed or in love with Rishi's Earl Grey as I am, but you won't say it was a waste of money or time.
