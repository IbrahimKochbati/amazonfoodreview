I bought this to hopefully help with acid reflux (chewing gum   more saliva, supposed to help neutralize excess acid + real mastic gum is supposed to be helpful with getting rid of some of the "bad" bacteria).          I'm not really sure if there are any health benefits yet, but it does taste different+ good. Somewhat like the scent of pine trees, but muted not strong.          The ingredients in order are:     Gum Base, glucose, Sugar, corn starch, natural identical flavor (mastic), glazing agent (carnauba wax), permitted color (e171).          So I'm not sure how much natural mastic is in there, but it's probably more than regular gum ;)
