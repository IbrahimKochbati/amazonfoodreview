We've ordered Great Northern Popcorn from Discount Tommy for about a year now. The popcorn is for a machine we keep in our employee lunch room for "Popcorn Fridays".  The portion packs are great because anyone can just snip off the top and pour it into the kettle.  No measuring or mess to clean up afterwards.  And the balance of butter and salt is perfect (other  ands can be too salty or too greasy).  We've tried other  ands but the employees complained about the taste so we switched back to Great Northern and everyone is happy again. It tastes (and smells) just like the popcorn from your favorite movie theatre.  Yum!!
