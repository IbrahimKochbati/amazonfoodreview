This coffee was deep and rich, and did not have a bitter taste too it.  I did have to use a little more than what was recommended to get it the way I drink coffee.. but coffee is a personal thing everyone has their desired strength.  The coffee was fresh upon opening but began to go down hill really quick as far as aroma and taste goes, so invest in a good air tight container.  I liked this coffee, but it I could go on in the morning if I did not have it.
