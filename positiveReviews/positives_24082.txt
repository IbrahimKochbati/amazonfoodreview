I love potato chips.  I could eat them by the bagful but thanks to the powers that be, this would not provide anyone with enough nutrition to survive.  Nonetheless I have eaten my share of potato chips over the years, and perhaps as a result I have been watching my weight lately.  I discovered these great popchips and they hit the spot in a number of ways.  First they are a low calorie alternative to regular potato chips, meaning I can eat a normal sized portion and still keep on target with my weight loss goals.  Second, they are gluten free, which is great for those of us who have gluten intolerance issues.  Third, they taste great   light and airy, crispy, rich in that great potato flavor that keeps me reaching for another one.  This is a great product and I hope it stays around for a good long time.
