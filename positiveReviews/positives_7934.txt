I was not expecting much from this tea. After all there are literally dozens of products out there each day claiming to be magical cure all. So, does this detox tea work? I have no medical training other than first aid, but I will say that I do feel refreshed after drinking it. I have tried it hot, warm, cold, sweetened (with honey) and unsweetened. The tea has a very light chai flavor to it, which I enjoy. But I have to say that around $20 for 120 bags (about .60 per bag) that if you are not a fan of tea then I would have to say that this is not for you when you can go to the grocery store and buy plain old tea (that also has 'detox' properties to it) for around $5 for the same quantity. But for something different from the usual, which what I was looking for, I have to say I am pleased.
