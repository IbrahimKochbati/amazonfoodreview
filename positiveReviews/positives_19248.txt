The Rover Rescue ball is perfect for all sizes of dogs.  I have 2 3 lb. yorkies and they love this toy.  The little rover inside has a great squeeker.  You put it inside the moon ball and the dogs go crazy to try and get the rover out of the ball.  This toy will keep them entertained for hours.  Also there is no material to rip get torn...the entire thing is a soft rubber and is completely washable.
