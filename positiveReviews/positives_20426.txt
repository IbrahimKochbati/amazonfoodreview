I planned to make a batch of blackberry mead (honey wine)and needed a good honey for that.  I'd read reviews of this honey, and most were glowing reviews.  One was even from a fellow mead  ewer.  While some reported tasting or smelling a light blackberry flavor from this, I have to say that I didn't.  It is a dark, rich honey without the "hay taste" of clover honey.  My wife is not a fan of honey at all, having only eaten the supermarket garbage.  Even she loved this stuff, and kept going back for more.  I have my mead  ewing (6 1 2 gallons), and the  ewing yeast seems to love it too.  I ordered a second 12lb bucket of this honey for my next batch of mead, which will be black cherry.  Anna's Honey is the best I have ever tasted!
