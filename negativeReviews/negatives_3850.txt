I am a  big fan of carbonated soft drinks and juice drinks. So while I strongly disliked the Switch Black Cherry flavor, I wanted to keep an open mind to Switch Kiwi Berry. While I started off with an open mind, after drinking most of the can I wished I kept a closed mouth. I found the carbonation level to be satisfactory, but I felt the so called Kiwi Berry flavor could be summed up in one very technical term    Yuck! Not only was the flavor bad going down, it left a lingering unpleasant aftertaste. Further, the 8.3 fl oz drink is high in total carbs (34g), sugar (33g) and calories (135). My overall opinion of this product is the same as it was for the Black Cherry variety    i.e., it is not worth drinking even for free (as I did thanks to the Vine program). If these observations don't turn you off, drink up and enjoy!
