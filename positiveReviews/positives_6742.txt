I was camping up on the Mendicino coast and ran out of coffee. I stopped at a market in Gualala cute sea coast town and bought a jar of this coffee seemed expensive to me until, I tasted it. Wow! its totally amazing! This is instant?? why use my coffee maker any more? Hard to find, though. I'll buy it on Amazon. Absolutely a gourmet treat.
