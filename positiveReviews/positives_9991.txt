Hey, coffee prices are going through the roof like everything else so I searched on Amazon and EBay for some decent prices.  I am a whole bean person and grind my beans fresh each morning.  This coffee has Starbucks beat without any doubt.  From the moment I opened the package I knew this was good coffee.  My home smells of fresh coffee beans.  With Amazons free shipping how could I go wrong.  A little over $7.00 per pound?  You can hardly buy Folgers at that price even on sale!  I will be buying from Coffee Bean Direct many more times in the future if they keep these prices down.
