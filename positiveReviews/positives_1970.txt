Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseeds are an excellent way to ingest some Omega 3.  96 ounces are delivered in 4 packs, and if you don't use it all immediately I suggest storing the seeds in the freezer to keep them fresh.  Grind them right before you use them, and they have a mild taste    milder than  own flaxseed. I've ordered this product several times, and the quality has been consistently high.
