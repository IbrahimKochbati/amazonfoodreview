I am an avid chip eater. Ever since I was a child (I'm now 29),I was always a 'salty' tooth.          I've gone through Ruffles and every other type of chip.          The problem is that no matter if I buy a small or large bag; I'd have to finish it in one sitting.          I read about this item in my "Shape" magazine for being a low calorie food and yet being yummy.          I tried to find at my local stores but haven't been able to (I live in the Seattle area).          Thankfully, I found on Amazon and anxiously awaited my case to come. I was a little nervous to commit to a whole case but was pleasantly surprised when I opened my first bag.          I chose this size (0.8 oz over 3 oz) cause I think it's about the right size for a lunch bag.          The flavor has a little bit of a kick with it, not too spicy but definitely not a boring bbq flavor.          I highly recommend anyone who loves chips but can't stop with just one to try a bag of these. They definitely satisfy and don't taste like they're not fried.
