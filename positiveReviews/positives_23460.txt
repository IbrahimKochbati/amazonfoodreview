I have been looking for a cheaper way to get good chai than continuing to pay several dollars at a coffee shop.          Most  ands I have tried, including more expensive stuff, either smell funny or have a single spice that is too strong and stands out.  Bigelow's chai doesn't have any harsh standouts, and results in the unique even taste I liked about the expensive coffee shop tea.  On top of being my favorite strictly by taste, it's also one of the cheapest  ands on the shelf.          Two handy features:             Each bag is inside its own envelope.  It's nice to be able to transport one or two bags without having to touch them directly with dirty hands.  Other  ands leave the individal bags naked and have a nice sealed liner in the box, which is really handy if you plan on wandering around with an ENTIRE BOX OF TEA.             Each bag has a dipping string tab attached to remove the bag from your cup.  It's 2007 and some teabag manufacturers still won't spot us a 2" piece of thread.
