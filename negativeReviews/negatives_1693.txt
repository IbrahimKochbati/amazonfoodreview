We use the K caps so that we can re use our K cups by refilling them with the coffee we like.  We have lost or given away several of the caps over the 2 years that we've been using them; so I thought I would buy some more K caps.  It turns out, the prices for them have increased substantially; so I went in search of another alternative that would be less expensive.  I found these and thought I had found the answer; but they don't quite work as well as the original K cups.  They actually caused the Keurig to spew water in directions other than the intended direction and then allowed enough coffee grounds to escape that the holder for the cups became clogged and had to be disassembled and thoroughly cleaned before it could be used again.  Good idea   but not quite right.
