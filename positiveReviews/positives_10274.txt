This is the second Beaba freezer tray that we've purchased, and still use both.  We bought the second tray so that we can make and freeze more baby food at a time.  The tray makes perfect sized serving portions, and clean up is very easy.  We run hot water over the back of each cup for one or two seconds, and the frozen food pops right out.  We store the individual servings in ziplock sandwich bags, makes it really easy to grab his food for the day and go.
