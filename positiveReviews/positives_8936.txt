I originally ordered this product because of a Dr. Oz episode in which a naturalist stated Ghee could be used to cure dry noses. I know it sounds funny, but its true. Before I ordered it I did not realize what Ghee actually was. Once we received are VERY TIMELY shipment of Ghee, I put it in the kitchen cabinet and waited for a first use. My husband had run out of coconut oil, which we do most of our cooking with and so he turned to the Ghee. And we haven't turned back! The flavor is amazing and it is good for you. Particularly, I really like this seller of Ghee because it is natural and grassfed. Good work!
