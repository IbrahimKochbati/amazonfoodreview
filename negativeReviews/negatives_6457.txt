If you are looking for the Broadway rolls you knew as a kid, these look like them and have the same name but don't be fooled.  When I found them (and I have been looking for a long time) I was excited so I ordered a 24 ct box.  I sat on the edge of my seat until the package arrived a few minutes ago.  I  ought it in, opened it right away and prepared for a walk down memory lane for my taste buds.  The first thing I noticed was that they lacked the nice red color and when I got the individual package opened they were stiff.  Not at all like before when they would come out of the package smelling wonderful and the sections would come apart easily and pliable.  Wish I could show a picture here so the difference between the item picture and what I got could be seen.  Perhaps the boxes that are being sold came from an old warehouse where they have been sitting for 25 years because that's what they look, feel and taste like. So Very Disappointed!     "
