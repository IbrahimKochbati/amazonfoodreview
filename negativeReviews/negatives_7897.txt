This is the sort of thing that is handy to keep on hand for quickly doctoring up a simple meal.  It's definitely not awesome pesto; think of it more as a condiment, like mustard or ketchup.  What I typically use it for, in that regard, is as a spread on sandwiches, when I'm tired of the usual versions.  It works well in particular on sandwiches featuring cheese or poultry.  It doesn't have much kick on its own as a sauce for pasta; but it can be added to things like frozen pasta dinners or canned soups etc. to give them a little more flavor.          One thing I want to mention too is that this product can "spit" and spatter when trying to squeeze it out.  When you are ready to open a tube, be sure you pierce the opening fully, so that any chunks within won't get stuck; and keep the bottom of the tube squeezed and rolled up to compact the remainder in the tube as best you can.
