You can taste the wood in the respect it taste like the coffee was roasted over wood.  It is VERY smooth, I detect no bitterness or over roasting.  Nice flavor.  My newest favorite amoung the k cup line.  My old favorite was Donut Shop but not any more.  I am not as pleased with the other Caribou flavors but this one really surprised me.
