This is a good value in flavored coffee. Most of them are 3 4 pound or less at this price. This is a full pound of lightly flavored (vanilla, nutmeg, cinnammon) medium roasted coffee. I'm using it in my single cup  ewer and it yeilds a very smooth, non bitter, light cup of coffee. I havn't tried using it in the 10 cup drip machine but most coffees are just a little stronger done that way.
