I was really hoping this grain free canned cat food will work for my 3 cats; looks like it has good ingredients but none of my 3 cats will eat it. In fact one of them will smell it and start doing the scratching thing like he smells poop. Another weird thing is the whole can is kind of soft and meshed like baby food but there are some whole green peas in it, not sure if that is by design or some green peas escape the meshing.
