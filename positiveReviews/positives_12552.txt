I got some samples of Green Mountain from BzzAgent, and I really liked it and the fact that I can have it pretty much instantly.  Only downside is that when I drink it I don't really feel that kick as if I had a lot of caffeine.  But it's great if you like the taste of coffee just for coffee's sake.
