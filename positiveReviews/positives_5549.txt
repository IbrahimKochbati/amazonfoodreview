I loved the Foods Alive garlic and onion flavor flax crackers.  When I finished my entire order of 6 bags, I decided to try the Mustard flavor since I love all mustards on almost everything.  Well...I just finished my first bag of it last night and it's ok   Organic, Crisp & fresh for sure.  But doesn't compare to the strong & powerful garlic & onion flavor.  Maybe the mustard is too mild on my palate.  But I just thought the flavor was too bland for my taste.          If you like a mild mustard & always wanted to try organic flax crackers made with pure ingredients & no fillers or chemicals, then this flavor is for you and I would recommend that you try it.
