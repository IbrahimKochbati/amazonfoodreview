I really like this tea!  It has great flavor and is really easy to make.  I like it with just a tiny bit of sweetener and a wedge of lemon.  That being said, to get the amount and strength I like for my tea I have to use 2 k cups for one cup of tea.  I usually do two 6 oz  ews and it is just right.  I can go up to an 8 oz  ew and still have good flavor but I want more than 8oz at a time.  For me it is just too expensive to use 2 k cups at a time.  I have compromised with myself and still keep the k cups around to use if I am in a hurry (or just extra lazy) but I mostly just use the tea bags of the same flavor.  I find it really isn't much more difficult or time consuming to use my keurig machine for hot water to steep a tea bag in.  The tea bags are just much more economical for me.
