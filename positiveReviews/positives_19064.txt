My first meal using Carbquick was chicken and dumplings. Like it stated on the box you have to cook it gently or it will fall apart. Mine did. But by the time I actually got to eat it I didn't care how it looked. It had been two years since I had made chicken and dumplings. And three months since starting on a seriously low carb diet. I wanted some dumplings. Even though it fell apart it was delicious. The kids ate it and loved it once I could get them to try it. None of them had ever tried chicken and dumplings before. They looked at it like I was offering them slugs for dinner. But hunger won and they tried it. My husband even loved it. We gave it 10 thumbs up. Later we made pancakes. They were also yummy. The only downfall is the price. We cant completely replace flour for the whole family with this product or we would blow our whole grocery budget. So for now we are keeping it just for the low carb eaters. Sadly this means I will have to cook two batches of anything made with flour. One for the dieters and one for the non dieters.
