Fell in love with these chips years ago when I got outta a vending machine at a previous employer.  They are hotter then any chip I've tried but tastey as all heck.  I research and found out u can only GE these via internet not in any store,  which is a bummer but extreme food website and Amazon always have great special.  So I recommended purchaseing a lot so you don't run out.     These are a great conversation piece at parties everybody always says same 2 things     1.  OMG THESE ARE SO HOT.     2.  I can't stop eating because these are so good.     Definitely have milk around to help the heat factor.  I now have my boyfriend hooked and a fan.  This last purchase I orders him the 14 5oz bag set.  He is in 7th heaven.  Definitely will last a while cause u can only eat so many cause of the heat but so tastey u wanna keep going back for more.     Remember have milk on hand LOL enjoy.
