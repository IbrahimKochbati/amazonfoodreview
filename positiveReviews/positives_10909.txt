I have four dogs, two males and two females, of the Heinz 57 variety, all sizes and shapes, and they LOVE these treats!  Since this was something new, they were of course a little hesitant at first, but after eating just one they caught on really fast and all begged for more.  As I removed each treat from the bag, I had each dog's most rapt and focused attention.  I like the ingredients, nothing fancy, just good stuff for dogs.  I will be buying these again.
