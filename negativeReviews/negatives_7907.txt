I got this in a sampler package.  I won't be buying it again.  It had a sort of stale taste, like coffee that has been sitting in a pot for hours.  I like fairly strong coffee. Coffee People Donut Shop for example.  But this doesn't come close.  It's not weak, just stale.  And no, it wasn't even close to the expiration date.
