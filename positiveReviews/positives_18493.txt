These Popchips are my absolute favorite. I love Popchips because they are super crispy and light. They're air popped instead of fried or baked and all natural. You can pronounce all the ingredients on the list. Vegan, kosher, gluten free, no cholesterol, no saturated fat, no trans fats, low sodium (220mg or 6% USRDA), no preservatives or artificial flavors and colors, there's nothing in here for me to complain about.          1 bag is only 100 calories (30 from fat), which is about 1 3 less than regular potato chips. I could eat the whole thing without feeling guilty. The salt and pepper taste is very pronounced and adds a really nice bite to the chips. When I was done, I found myself running my finger through the inside to pick up the remaining seasoning bits and crumbs.          I've tried the BBQ flavor as well as several of the others. This one is my favorite. Highly highly recommended.
