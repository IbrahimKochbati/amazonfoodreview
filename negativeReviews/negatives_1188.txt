I started out thinking they were OK, a little more substance than the  eakfast bar from Whole Foods.  But after I ordered a 12 pack (I didn't realize it was 12 boxes of 8), and had eaten them for a couple of weeks as I was flying out the door, I realized they were not really very tasty and kind of dry.
