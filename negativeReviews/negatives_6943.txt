Although this  ead tasted decent. My husband had a severe allergic reaction. When he contacted Pamela's Products they told him many has had an allergic reaction to this mix. He advised them that they should post this information. Whether they will or not is up to them. This reaction caused his stomach to close and he had to go in and have it ballooned back open. If they would have posted "many people" having allergic reactions, we may have thought twice about trying this product and could have saved him a lot of severe pain plus the approx. $4000.00 for the procedure he had to have done. He has had no reaction to the Pamela's Baking and Pancake mix and the pancakes are really good. Good luck to those trying this product.
