In general, I hate tea.  I have tried so many different kinds and have never found one I liked.  But after trying this, I LOVED it!          I started eating healthier about a week ago and bought a pack of the Detox tea planning on pinching my nose and gulping it down solely for the health benefits.  But I was pleasantly surprised to find out how much I liked it.  Not only does it taste good, but immediately after my first mug I felt more energetic and strangely my vision seemed to be clearer.  I will definitely be keeping this on hand in the future!
