I love oatmeal, and occasionally make steel cut oatmeal in my ricemaker, but I've been eating more Quaker Oats Maple & Brown Sugar Instant Oatmeal   for years.  Pallets of it.  Literally, I had bought lots of "value pack" 24 packs the last time they went on sale at Shop Rite, and when I finally ran out, a couple months ago, I bought the "new" improved package at Stop & Shop.          The new flavor is horrible   not just compared to the original, or to McCanns, but truly horrible.  I couldn't finish it.  Tasted a little like coffee grounds.  Even adding  own sugar or a little milk didn't change it at all.     How could you screw up a decades old favorite like that?  Why not offer it as a new product, and leave your loyal customer's with their proven favorites?  (Why didn't Coca Cola just release "New Coke" in the '80s, instead of screwing up their  and loyalty?  And why didn't Quaker learn from Coke?)          Since then, I've been buying the Stop & Shop  and, and it's not bad.  Not as good as the original Quaker Oats Maple & Brown Sugar, but good enough.  Quaker has effectively removed themselves from the instant oatmeal market, in my opinion.  Hope they correct their mistake, but I don't think that happens very often.  I'll be waiting for one of those "We heard you, and we're making it right" commercials... Until then, it's store  and oats for me.
