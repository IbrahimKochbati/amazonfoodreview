The bonsai tree that I received is tiny and unattractive. It looks like someone stuck a twig in some dirt. Unlike the image of the advertised tree, it only has one  anch. I am not happy with the bonsai tree at all. It also has a little green  anch jutting out from one side that adds to the unattractiveness of the piece. Horrible false advertising.
