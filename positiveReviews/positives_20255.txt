I am a long time fan of beef jerky, since I was a kid reading about its origins.  Too often, commercially available jerky is just so much crap; poor quality, no taste, lousy texture, etc.  Usually, the only good stuff you can find is with small "boutique" (boy, that seems out of place!) vendors, the kind you mind find at good "county fairs".  The only really good jerky I've ever purchased was from Bread & Circus in the early '90s...          This jerky is pretty close.  Very good texture (if you like it moist), and little gristle.  Very nice flavor, and some spice   mind you, I really like it hot, so for those who like things milder or moderate, this is probably near or beyond your limits.  The only jerky I know that is hotter is my homemade version using Mad Dog Inferno!          Great Product!
