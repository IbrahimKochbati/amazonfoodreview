It's very nice that the company put 100 calories packages out  great marketing idea.  They taste okay to me.  A bit subtle on the chocolate IHMO.  Mostly they're lightly flavored, chocolate, wheat crackers.  They have very little nutritional value but over 39% sugar.  The 100 calories is achieved by a very light product  it doesn't weigh much.  So, 100 calories sounds great  but only if you eat but one package.  Not easy to do if you're hungry.  Still, it's a convenient snack to put in a backpack, lunch box, carry on (now that they don't feed you much when you fly), etc. with less calories than most alternatives.  Could also tide you over between meals.  Still, I'd personally prefer something a bit healthier.  But that's why there's chocolate & vanilla  oops, they left out the vanilla!
