My dog was on Canidae for almost 2 years and she loved it.  She was healthy with a full, shiny coat and plenty of energy.  Then suddenly around December she started vomiting and having loose yellow stools, and became very lethargic.  We took her to 2 vets and after several hundred dollars in tests they couldn't find anything wrong with her.          I did some research and found that there were numerous people having the exact same problems I was!  It turns out, they recently changed their formula, changed manufacturers, and decreased the amount of food in their package.  Do some research, it's not the same high quality food it used to be!
