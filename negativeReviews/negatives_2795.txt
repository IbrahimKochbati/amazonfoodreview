I really wanted to like these, but I just found them to be to sweet sugary.     I generally stay away from cliff bars for the same reason, and had hoped that these would be as good as they sound.          Sadly its just to sweet tasting for me.          Special note: The packs I received Oct 2010 have 20g sugar, not the 17g listed in the Amazon nutrition section.     There may have been a recipe change . . .
