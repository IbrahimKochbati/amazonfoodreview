I also purchased this potting soil and repotted all the plants in my home. Now I have gnats everywhere. I thought this was the best potting soil and paid more for it only to end up with gnats. Hundreds of them. I wish I had read the previous post before. Do not buy this product. Now it will cost me double to buy another  and and the work of repotting about 40 plants.
