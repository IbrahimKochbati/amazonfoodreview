Wow, I have to admit these are really yummy. I don't know how they did it, but they don't have that "imitation sugar" taste at all. They're small little bars (slightly bigger than the normal hershey's miniatures), but for only 30 calories a piece, they are a perfect afternoon treat when you need something sweet at the office.
