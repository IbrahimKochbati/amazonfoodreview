The Lowrey's Microwave Pork rinds that I received was unacceptable.  I ordered 36 bags and the bags only popped 1 4 of the bag.  All rinds popped but for the amount of the money that I paid for them I could have gone to the store and bought a $2.00 bag already popped and gotten a full bag.  I feel that it should have popped at least half of the bag.  I understand that everyone is counting their pennies but I also think that the consumer should get something for their money.  I really enjoy this product but I probably will not order any more for this reason.
