I bought Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Venison Recipe on the advice of my vet, when food allergy was suspect in a rash my dog had. Turns out the dog had a run of the mill skin rash, but since switching over to this a few months ago I see my old girl having more energy and readily eating at mealtime.     My usually picky dog LOVES it and I feel really good about feeding this good quality food to her.     The convenience of buying it online from Amazon with free shipping, and having it delivered to my front door is an added bonus.             "
