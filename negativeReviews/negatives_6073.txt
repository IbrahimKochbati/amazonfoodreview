I completely liked these things     BEFORE I got the gigantic 5lb bag. I'd actually prefer to keep them as a treat rather than something to just get sick of. After just a few, the taste gets worse and they are just way too gummy. I am already sick of them and have like 4.5 lbs left.          Too bad they didn't have the small bags in stock when I got these.
