On May 24th, I bought this item for $28.99. Today, the price for the same product is $58.89. I have no idea how they can justify doubling the price overnight, but if you pay the $58 you are paying way too much.          As to the product itself, the caramels are tasty and everybody likes them, but the last box they sent was stale.Time to look for a new source.
