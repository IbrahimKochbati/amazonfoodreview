I remember Cracker Jacks from when I was a boy in the 40s and 50s. I loved Cracker Jacks. Plus, in looking back on it, they were one of the better candy treats. Sure, there was the sweet candy coating but underneath was nutritious corn and peanuts with nutrition and fiber. It was a good treat, no question. All this came to mind when I was in my local grocery store with my 3 1 2 year old son and spotted a display of Cracker Jacks. I wondered if he too would like Cracker Jacks. Well, the answer was yes, as expected. We got the only size bag available, 4.25 ounces, but it's exactly the same Original product as listed here. And it tastes just as I remembered.
