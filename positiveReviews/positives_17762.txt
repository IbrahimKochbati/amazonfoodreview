I don't know what some of the negative reviewers are used to drinking, I'm guessing major name  ands with HFCS as the main ingredient.     We bought this at a local organic store, and loved it. We also love the New Century Cola by Blue Sky. It tastes like real root beer. It does not have a heavy licorice taste, nor does it taste like cough syrup. Maybe they reformulated the recipe since the negative reviews were posted. But I also think that if someone is used to commercial soda by major manufacturers, which tastes nothing like REAL root bear, cream soda or ginger ale, then they will not like this.     If you aren't sure about don't buy the 24 pack. Find it locally, try it, then buy it in bulk.
