When I'm working, I always carry my own lunch. It's so much better than the food court, and I have much better regulation of my nutrient intake. Finding items having high protein without high fat is the most difficult task. Tuna is excellent and these little Chicken of the Sea White Tuna Cups fill the bill. Put one in the lunch with a few fresh fruit and veggie items and perhaps a few dried fruits and nuts. It's good nutrition, and there's no worry about weight gain. Also, when I'm camping, I like to take a batch of these tuna cups along. In both cases, the cup size just the right for one serving.          I had a minor problem with the latest tuna cups, and it might be just a batch problem. My latest tuna was very dry. I almost had to choke it down. And it seemed rather tasteless. I've had these cups in the past and they seemed much better. I have not been satisfied with the present ones. However, I like the product and the serving size and It will not deter me from future purchases.          Gary Peterson
