With English parents, I grew up drinking many many pots of tea. I used to hold Earl Grey as may favourite until I stumbled across Lady Grey.  If you enjoy Earl Grey you will love this tea.  The aroma is magnificent and the flavour excellent.  It is smoother that Earl Grey and even when over  ewed lacks the acidity and overpowering tannins that darker blacks can produce.  The nose of the tea greatly enhances the drinking experience.  Don't miss out on a possible favourite!
