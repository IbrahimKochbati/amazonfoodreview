i love chicken teriyaki and sesame chicken heatlhy choice meals, so i figured i would give this a try. BIG MISTAKE. the rice does cook the be nice and fluffy but the sauce and chicken taste horrible. for one there is not enough chicken in it and the sauce was far to overwhelming. had trouble swallowing it and threw the rest away. Yuck!!
