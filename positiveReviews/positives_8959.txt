My cats just love the Seafood Medley Temptations.  They can't get enough of them.  We go through 10 large packs in about 2 3 weeks.  We have only 2 cats, a 3 year old male and a 17 year old female. They will eat only the Seafood flavor.  The male cat will eat only dry food and Temptation Seafood Medley and whatever he can catch outside.  The female loves can food with gravy, dry food and Temptations Seafood Medley. She doesn't hunt anymore but she will eat some of whatever the male catches.  I will definitely be ordering more. Thank you for such a good product and very good service. I recommend them to my friends with cats.
