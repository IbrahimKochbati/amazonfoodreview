The Switch Kiwi Berry carbonated fruit juice tasted good, but it was too sweet and had too many calories for my liking. I could drink a regular can of soda. Going forward, I probably would not buy this beverage because I do not like to drink that many calories (135) or sugar (33 grams) in one sitting.
