I've never liked to eat fruit, and sure never liked applesauce.  But when my wife  ought one of these home she offered it to me in front of our three year old, knowing full well I wouldn't refuse in front of our little mimic! I tried to steel myself to suck it down without grimacing so my daughter wouldn't decide she didn't like it either, but I knew I was going to hate it.  WOW, was I shocked!  This stuff is great!  No mess (the reason I don't like fruit), wonderful fresh sensation, smooth creamy texture and absolutely great taste.  I'm careful about preservatives and additives in our food, and Buddy Fruits pass my muster easily.  My daughter loves it and I'm now an addict.  It works especially great in the afternoon when my sugar drops and I start wearing out.  Beats energy drinks for a quick and lasting pick me up.  And being on subscribe and save makes it easier to handle the cost, which is cheaper than our local grocery stores.
