I really love this coffee, great tasting and bold.  However, on about 1 3rd of the pods, the foil separates from the cup and blows grounds into the  ewer and my coffee cup.  I can usually predict which ones will do it because the foil on the k cup is not puffy like it has pressure, but flat and wrinkled.
