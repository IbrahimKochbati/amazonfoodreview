Ok, so I may not know how exactly my dogs feel about the taste of these treats.  I do know that my dogs snapped these up and went to their perspective corners to enjoy these treats.  Going to your special place to enjoy a treat at my house only happens when the treats are tasty.  So I believe these passed that test.  I liked that these treats were are organic and not made with a lot of fillers, but rather quality grains and lamb.  I will definitely be reaching for these treats again.
