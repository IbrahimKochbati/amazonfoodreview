With British food's reputation for tasting like recycled garbage, and a dubious name at best, Spotted Dick sounds more like leftovers from the Saw movies than anything edible.  Nonetheless, I gave some to my girlfriend...and she also ate Spotted Dick.          This soggy  ead in a can is delightful.  Straying from the typical rubbage on British plates, the injection of flavor from Spotted Dick is a welcome taste.  A sweet treat with hints of cinnamon, this is perfect for a party filled with Dick hungry guests.          At ten ounces, each can is roughly four servings based upon the nutritional facts.  That's roughly 1000 calories with about 360 of them fat calories for a total of 40 grams of fat.  To say that this Dick is fat would be an understatement.  With trace amounts of calcium and iron   or so the rumors go   there are some healthy benefits to this charming confection.          Highly recommended.
