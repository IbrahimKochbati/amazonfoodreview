My youngest cat is very particular about what he eats.  He absolutely will not eat if something doesn't meet his expectations.  Between that and the recent pet food recalls, I've had a really hard time finding cat food that I can feed him.  I'm happy to say that the Merrick Turducken clicks with him, plus it has no wheat gluten or other fillers.  The texture of it is appealing, too . . . it's not just "mush" or Spam looking like many foods.  I'll continue to buy Turducken and plan to also try out some of the other Merrick flavors.
