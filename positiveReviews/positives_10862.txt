We have a lot of fun watching out special dog (Bandit) get a treat.  He runs with it, and he often tempts you to grab the treat from right in front of him when he finally stops.  He runs in circles and acts really funny.  To make this time even more special for him, I often try different treats to make sure it truly is a "treat" for him.  I was interested to try these Newman's treats because of the  and recognition.  To determine if he liked them, I fed him one, and we played his little game.  The next day, I laid three different treats out to see which one he would grab.  He didn't grab the new one.  I did that again for a few days.  He consistently grabbed the Newman treat second.  So, based on this in depth scientific research, I would say he liked the treat as well as we like green beans.  We like green beans, but they're not the same as a piece of cheesecake and not gross like a  ussel sprout.
