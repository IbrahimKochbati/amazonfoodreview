WHILE BARISTA ITALIAN ROAST COFFEE IS A BIT PRICIER THAN MOST OF THE KEURIG'S STYLE COFFEES, IT HAS A GREAT RICH FLAVOR AND IS WORTH IT.          BY ACCIDENT, I RAN A SECOND CUP OF WATER THROUGH THE KEURIG ON A PREVIOUSLY USED K CUP.  THE COFFEE WAS STILL RICH AND YUMMY.  SINCE THEN I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT I CAN GET AT LEAST TWO SERVINGS PER EACH K CUP.
