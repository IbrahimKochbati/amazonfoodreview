I don't know if I got a bad batch or something, but I could'nt get these to cook right. I followed the instructions and after about two minutes, the bag stoped expanding. I opened it and found everything badly burnt. the next bag I waited about one and a half minutes. I opened it and found half the chips uncooked. I never could find a time that either left some uncooked or some burnt. (I shook the bags and scattered the chips inside them well before microwaving each time)
