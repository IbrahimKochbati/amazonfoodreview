I was very pleased to find that I could purchase "Pamelas Bread Mix" on Amazon because my husband was recently diagnosed with Celiac disease, and good tasting "Gluten Free" mixes are hard to find.  I was thrilled to find the product, the price was less than I had spent at the Health food store, and I was able to get 10 bags for FREE shipping!
