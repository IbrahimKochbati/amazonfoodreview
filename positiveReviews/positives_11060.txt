Love these individual creamers for morning coffee! I'm not normally a coffee drinker (I think it's too bitter), and don't want to add too much sugar, so this is the perfect alternative to give it a creamy consistency and sweet flavor. Highly recommended for anyone who may be a first time coffee drinker who likes the taste of sweet french vanilla.
