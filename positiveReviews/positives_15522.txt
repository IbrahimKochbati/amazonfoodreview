This is my first bonsai tree and I was a little wary about buying one online, unseen, and especially at such a low price, thinking it might be lower quality... well I received it last night and the tree is beautiful! Very healthy, well packaged for transit, and the pot is of nice quality. I definitely recommend this, especially at this price   you can't beat it!
