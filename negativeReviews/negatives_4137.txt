It's a relatively smaller jar that you get..about comparable to the smaller jars of PB you buy at a grocery store.  I love peanut butter but had cut it out of my diet because of the fat.  This was good when mixed with jelly, jam or honey..you can eat it just like that or spread it on  ead toast.  Yucky when mixed with water to dip fruit...wasn't salty enough and had a funny texture taste.  Haven't tried it in cooking yet.          ON BACK OF JAR ~ 2 Tb serving:  1.5g fat, 94 mg sodium, 5g carb, 2g fiber, 5g protein.  Ingred: roasted peanuts (defatted and powdrd), sugar and salt.          Apparently there are other local places where you can get it much more cheaply and without the shipping.  Way too expensive for one jar and the exhorbitant shipping charges.
