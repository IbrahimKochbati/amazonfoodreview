I don't like sweet potatoes but I do like sweet potato fries.  I love these Popchips Sweet Potato Chips, they are very tasty.  There isn't a lot of salt, fat, or carbs.  My only complaint is each bag only contains .8 ounces, but I guess they wanted the bag to be exactly 100 calories.          The rest of the Popchips line is great too.  Not fried or baked, and reasonably healthy.
