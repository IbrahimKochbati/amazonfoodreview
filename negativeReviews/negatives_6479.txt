its alright, I have had premium white and I will not say this is as good.. its a nice tea but its not as floral as the other whites out there, but its a good affordable white tea and if you love white tea but cannot afford the more expensive blend then this is for you. Also note if your not familiar with white tea it tastes totally different than green tea so if thats what your thinking this is.. your going to be dissapointed. Decent tea tho.
