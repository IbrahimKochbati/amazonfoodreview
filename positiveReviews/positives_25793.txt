My first "pod" coffeemaker was a Senseo, now relegated to the garage. Limited coffee options. Weak tasting coffee. Bought the Keurig based on Amazon reviews and liked it from the first. Now I love it, because I found a dark, deeply satisfying roast that makes my day. Full on coffeehouse flavor with no bitter aftertaste. It's one of three featured varieties in our office   Timothy's Breakfast Blend, Coffee People Black Tiger, and Tully's Italian Roast. We have all three on subscription and they're a hit with both staff and client partners. BTW, my personal choice is almost always this one.
