I ordered this cupcake mix because a coworker was having a birthday and our supervisor has Celiac Disease.  Needless to say, I wanted to make sure he got to eat a cupcake too, but I didn't want to buy a bunch of weird flours and get stuck with the excess.          One box didn't make 12 cupcakes like the box said, although if you don't fill the cupcake cups up, i'm sure you could get 12 out of the mix.  I like to fill my cupcakes a little fuller though, for aesthetics, so I ended up using both boxes to make about 18 cupcakes.          The flour mixture itself was very fluffy and well sifted, which always makes for a nice cake consistency.  I didn't use the box directions, and instead used the weight watchers reecipe using orange soda and egg whites instead of eggs and butter.  The vanilla flavor wasn't completed covered up by the soda, so I imagien in a vanilla preparation it would taste pretty good.  The only off putting part was when the cupcakes came out of the oven, they smelled a bit liek corn muffins.  but by the time they were frosted and decoarted, I didn't notice the corn smell.          For the frosting packet, I used the butter and milk as described, but added orange flavoring to go with the orange soda cupcakes.  I think the buttercream mix was basically just confectioner's sugar that was processed without gluten 9since I think alot of corn starch used in regular powdered sugar is processed with wheat).  It didn't make very much frosting though.  Both packets together wouldnt have covered 24 cupcakes, but since I only ended up with 18 it came out perfectly.          I made the cupcakes the night before they'd be served,  and the next day they were a little gummy, but not really much worse for the wear.  If I made these again, I'd probably store them covered on the counter, then frost the day of to keep them from getting gummy in the fridge.          All in all, they got the job done   without any reactions(!) and all the 'normal' eaters still liked them!
