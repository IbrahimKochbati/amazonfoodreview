This Assam tea is delicious, and a good deal, especially for organic and fair trade. I will say that I expected it to have a bolder flavor, which I am used to with other Assam teas I have tried. It has the same flavor characteristics of other Assam teas   it just doesn't  ew dark and strong even with a lot of leaves in the infuser. That said, I am enjoying this somewhat more delicate Assam tea a lot, and the price was right. The listing promises "fair trade certified" and "certified organic", but the label on the bag doesn't have any fair trade certification. Hopefully the advertising is correct.
