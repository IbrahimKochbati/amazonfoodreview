This is my go to seasoning blend now. I wish I had discovered it sooner! I use it on everything...including fish, chicken, pork, shrimp, burgers, steak, potatoes, veggies, and in dry rubs, marinades, soups and stews. I've even been tempted to top my ice cream with it, but so far have been able to restrain myself! : ) For a blackening seasoning, I find it has a nice all around blend of seasonings, herbs and spices without being too over the top spicy or peppery. Flavor is key here...not "melt your face off" heat.          The larger cansiter is a much better bargain than the little 2 ounce containers, in my opinion. Amazon also has the 2 pack 24 ounce cansiters, and it's what I usually order when I'm running low. If you've never tried this stuff before, pick up the 2 ounce size to see how you like it...when you realize how good it is, you'll be glad Amazon has the big cansiters.
