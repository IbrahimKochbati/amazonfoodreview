My husband is the coffee drinker, I just love the aroma!  He loves this coffee and I purchased this big box of it to save money and I sure did.  It won't be the last box I buy from Amazon.com.  I would recommend this coffee to anyone.  My husband says it's not too strong but sure strong enough to get you goin' in the morning.  My husband doesn't like silly coffee flavors and was so happy when he found out he could get Folgers in K Cups. It was their best move as far as he was concerned.
