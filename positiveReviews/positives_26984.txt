One pound goes a long way.  The flavor is very addicting; like doritios or something.  you get a whole pound in the pack so it lasts a while.  It is dry and stringy but that is what I like.  The price is very economical.          I recommend a smaller pack first, to make sure you like it.  Then if you do,  you can buy this bulk pack.
