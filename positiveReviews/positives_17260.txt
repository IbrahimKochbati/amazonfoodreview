You'll feel like a kid again after pouring yourself a bowl of Cocoa Krispies, adding the milk, and waiting for the cereal to "talk" to you. You'll be hearing the snap, crackle pop of your childhood.          An extra bonus is this cereal tastes chocolatey good while providing some healthy nutrition. Use low fat milk to stay healthy or go decadent and enjoy your bowl of cereal with a bit of half and half. When using half and half the cereal will almost taste like milk chocolate.          Yum! Yum! Good!          Recommend.
