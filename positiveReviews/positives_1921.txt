This is a close second to my all time favorite, Jack Links Beef Steakhouse Steaks, which is the filet mignon of beef jerky. They're very similar in taste and price, but the Steakhouse edges out this one oh so slightly. Still pretty awesome jerky, very tender, and not a hint of fat or gristle. Bon appetit!
