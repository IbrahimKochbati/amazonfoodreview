I had been frustrated trying to figure out how to store the K cups on my counter top.  The carousals were not only spendy, but took up too much space.  I love this product.  Yes it does raise my machine up....but isn't that to be expected when it goes under the machine? I get a kick out of people putting down a product when it is exactly as described and the reviewer didn't have the foresight to see this. Besides, mine does not sit under the cupboard, so its not a problem.  The drawer slides easily and the top does not sag or buckle under the weight.  It is perfect for my limited space. I would like to find one just like this one, but a little smaller for my smaller machine at work.
