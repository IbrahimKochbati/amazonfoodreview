I became a fan for Dave's Gourmet Dave's Burning Nuts about 3 years ago.  This is a very addicting snack. A hefty dose of heat with just the right amount of saltiness. I've introduced them to a number of my co workers who are now big fans.  I have tried the other spicy nut products on the market, but so far, Dave's is by far the champ!
