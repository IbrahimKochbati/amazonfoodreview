In marketing terms, I'm not certain what "classique supreme" is supposed to mean    if anything. Reviewing coffee is a matter of taste, literally as well as figuratively, and I found this to be a fairly standard, but not at all bad, mid range roast. On some tastings, it reminded me quite a bit of McDonalds coffee, which isn't necessarily a bad thing though it probably isn't either as "classique" or as "supreme" as the folks at Melitta would like. It was very drinkable across the course of a morning, neither aggressively dark and bitter nor bland and tasteless. Though I might venture out from time to time into other roasts and blends, this would be a perfectly serviceable day to day option for coffee fans.
