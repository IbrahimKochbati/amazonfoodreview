I just got it yesterday and used it as a spread on  ead.I never want to be without it,it tastes so buttery.Before I used to use different spreads like butter,cream cheese,mayo but now everything is getting replaced with this grass fed ghee because not only is it a much healthier option but it tastes so much better.     I get my organic free range eggs from a local feed store and I bet they will be great fried in ghee.Ohhh and popcorn....     I found when I put it in the fridge it got to hard to be manageable so I keep it in the pantry.     It is a little expensive but I think a little goes a long way,really don't need to use that much.
