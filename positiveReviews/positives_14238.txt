We've been looking for a way to obtain greaat anchony flavor that only anchovies can deliver. The cans are so expensive and you waste most of it as you only need a smidge of anchovy flavor to pick up any ssauce or pizza. My honey says she doesn't care for anchovies, they're too strong a flavor. When we used to get them on pizza that often was true as whole anchovies were strewn over the pizze(we go way back) It's amazing how everyone loves my pizza sauce and how tasty and full bodied it is, not bland. Thyme, oregano and basil can deliver just so much. We just don't mention the smidge of anchovy paste we put in it. It's a great product and in using a tube far less expensive as it stores well in the fridge. So great in flavor, so convenient in a tube with absolutely no waste, so easy to use EXACTLY  the amount you need, we very happy puppies in our house now.
