I ordered this syrup after my daughter started in on her pancake kick.  Every single day for  eakfast she wants pancakes and I did not want her eating that nasty corn syrup grocery store pancake syrup.  This stuff is delicious and has a beautiful color.  I like that it is organic and from a family farm.  I will continue to buy this product again and again!
