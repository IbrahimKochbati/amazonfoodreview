The Cocoa wasn't too bad. The taste is ok and as good as other hot chocolate mixes.  I was disappointed though when I went to a local store and saw it for less than what I paid just for shipping.  I really thought I was getting a good deal until I went home and checked the ticket.  I just paid three times as much for a box of hot chocolate to be delivered to my house! SO DISAPPPOINTED!!:(
