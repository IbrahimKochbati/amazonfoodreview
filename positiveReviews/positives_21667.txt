Dagoba (pronounced duh GO buh) Dark is the best chocolate I've ever tried.     A previous reviewer said they threw this chocolate out because of it's "artificial taste". Some people are so used to Tootsie Rolls and Ho Ho's that they honestly have no idea what chocolate tastes like.     As my gramma used to say, "there's no accounting for taste."     Dagoba is chocolate. Pure, organic, fairly traded, and delicious chocolate.     I used this to make  ownies (per Cook's Illustrated's suggestion) because mine always seemed to lack deep flavor. Dagoba fixed that. Try making one batch with the cheapest semisweet chocolate at the store (Nestle or Hershey's or whatever) and one batch with Dagoba Dark. Then serve them to your friends and see which they prefer. It makes an obvious and remarkable difference.          And for plain old eating, it's equally tasty. I've tried just about every plain dark chocolate bar at the fancy grocery store and I can't find any I like better than Dagoba Dark. Some that cost the same or even more are terrible. Some are almost as good, but none are better. Dagoba Dark is expensive, but it's a good value. There are a ton of chocolates that the real aficionadoes like even better that but the prices on those ultra premium  ands like Amedei and Michel Cluizel are insane   $14.50 for 1.8 ounces! Can you believe that nonsense?     For $2.50 a bar, if you like flavorful chocolate, I don't think you can go wrong with Dagoba Dark.     The ONLY thing I'm not pleased about is that Dagoba is now just another division of a mega corp (Hershey's) so you never know when they'll try to save a penny by compromising quality or organic or fair trade principles.
