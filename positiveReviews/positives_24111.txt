We all know and have heard of the benefits of pure, organic honey that is not adulterated or pasteurized.  There are countless articles on the internet that describe the health and even curative benefits of pure honey.  Greek mountain honey is no exception.  It is truly one of the last great tasting honeys of the world, with health benefits if imbibed in reasonable amounts.  This honey tastes very different than the typical, commercial and pasteurized junk you find on your mass supermarket shelves, so at first, you may be unsure about the taste.  Rest assured that not only is this honey delicious, with amazing flavor and notes  it is also one of the healthiest and purest honeys made by unique bees that differ from the ones in North America.  I even used a Greek honey and organic cinnamon lemon juice regimen to rid myself of a cough and sore throat due to a flu! It worked like a charm.
