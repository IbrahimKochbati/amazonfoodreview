We converted to Grade B Maple Syrup about a year and half ago.  We have tried several different  ands and they have all been good.  This is by far our favorite.  The flavor is excellent and it is always a joy to open the bottle and pour out this delicious treat.  Works great on pancakes waffles french toast as well as in cookies baked goods and sauces (my favorite...part of the glaze I use on smoked ribs...mmmmmmmmmmm).  Amazon has an amazing price on an amazing product.  This is our 3rd bottle of Anderson's Grade B and we will continue to purchase it as along as it is available.
