...and the stuff that's there is mediocre at best. Drug store chocolates, and this "Life Is Like A Box of Chocolates" box that is filled with tissue wrapped Halloween candy.  If your chocolate gift needs to show class, this isn't it. The basket is great. What in it leaves a lot to be desired.          Disclosure: I am a chocolate snob and have 3 hand made chocolate companies that I love, so I go for the good stuff and I mean, better than Godiva.          p,s, They sent me a second basket saying the first, with the color laser printed wrappers, was a prototype and never meant to be seen, but the final version, other than the printing, wasn't any better. The chocolates were the same low quality drug store  ands.          p.s.s. If you know chocolate, then you know that chocolate that is old gets a white film on it. The chocolate covered peanuts were totally covered in that film.  This is not a basket to give to any chocolate lover who has any knowledge of what good chocolate tastes like.
