This is the perfect storage for the baby food I make at home. I am a working mom, so time is not on my side when it comes to doing things for my son. But, it's important for me to make him healthy homemade meals and this container helps me by allowing me to make large batches of food on the weekends and fill them up for the freezer. I have 2 of these storage containers that are kept in the freezer with the food I prepare on the weekends. Each night, I pull out my son's food for the following day and allow it to thaw in the fridge. The flexible material makes it really easy to pop out one portion at a time. Highly recommend this food storage.
