I hate healthy anything!          But I am overweight, so I need an alternative to my normal routine of Doritos potato chips. The only reason I tried these chips is because of the other reviews, so I am contributing my 5 stars toward the product.          From just looking at it, I was expecting it to taste more like rice cake... but I was pleasantly surprise. The chips tastes great, very crisp... I don't really know how to explain it.          All the flavors are great. My favorite is the BBQ. The Original is a bit too salty, but still very tasty.          Highly recommended! At least give it a try before disregarding it for being a healthier snack.
