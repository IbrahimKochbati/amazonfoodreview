This is what happens when you try to cross a juice with a soda and it somehow works.  Carbonated, slightly sweet, and 100% juice, this drink gives you the bubbly soda experience without the sticky sweetness that makes you feel slightly ill.  The berry flavor is not too strong and the carbonation is just the right amount.          The only downside is the size of the can.  For some reason this comes in Red Bull sized cans, which leave you wanting more.  A regular 12 oz soda can would have served this excellent drink better.
