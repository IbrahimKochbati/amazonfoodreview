I'd definitely see if there's a health food store that gives samples, or an organic restaurant that carries this, or a friend with it  try it before buying.          I was used to French's and Heinz's yellow  staples in my fridge along with Grey Poupon and Gulden's. But I have been, in the last year, switching to organic products and produce. I purchased this to replace my about to expire French's yellow mustard.          Well, this stuff is awful. I don't know why it has that odd taste  the vinegar, the particular mustard seeds?  but I put this on a sandwich and hated it. Then I decided to try again, a different day, and again, scraped it off the turkey. I could not bear it.          I threw the nearly full bottle away.          For now, it's back to non organic mustard until I can taste other organic mustards and find one that doesn't make me wanna spit out my food.          Pity.          Mir
