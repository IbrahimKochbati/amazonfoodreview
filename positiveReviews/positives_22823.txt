This tea is too delicious! I can't believe how much flavor it packs. I drank this when I was losing weight and needed something sweet. I don't know how, but it really tastes like vanilla caramel, but there are no calories. When I was feeling saucy, I would add a teaspoon of sugar, and it was just a dessert in a mug. It's perfect for a crisp fall evening. I love this tea!
