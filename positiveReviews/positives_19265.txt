Im out working in the daytime and feel real bad that my energetic pup is home bored to death! So finding this toy calmed my fear of doggy daytime boredom. It has seven (my favorite number) treat chambers that challenged my dog to lift each cup in order to reveal its prize!          It is a must have when teaching the basics of eating obedience command. It also taught him important problem solving skills. I had to turn the pieces upside down at first because my dog smelled the treat through the space but cried because he was too inexperienced to figure out how to get it. I suggest this technique if this puzzle is too challenging for your dog; at least till they figure out how to successfully pull the piece off when turned the right way.          The Non skid pads on bottom is an amazing feature. I guess the makers knew mischievous dogs would push the entire toy around as an additional part of the game lol. Its base material is plastic which is perfect for washing. My dog chooses to use his teeth to pull up the pieces not his paw, so slob is usually all over this toy. I'm so glad it's plastic!          Its a must have because it provides hours of fun, and I encourage anyone with a curious doggy to get one!!!
