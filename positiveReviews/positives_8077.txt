The bar tastes good, if you're looking for something that's not too sweet. And on that note, you should know that you can probably find a better tasting granola bar, but it probably won't be as healthy for you as this one is.          It's a good bar that isn't too sweet, and if you can buy them for less than 75 cents per bar, then I'd say you made a good purchase.
