This cereal has changed for the gross.  I didn't buy my latest can on Amaon, rather Target, so it's obviously a Happy Bellies issue & not Amazon.  The color of the cereal is a nasty grey green and it smells awful.  I was wondering why my babies weren't really that enthusiastic about eating.  I like the added DHA & probiotics, but looks like I'll be going back to Earth's Best Oatmeal cereal.  Another company trying to skimp out on high quality ingredients, just to make a quick buck.
