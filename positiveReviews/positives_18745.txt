I work nights and there often is not anything to eat. I keep one of these in my locker, you don't need a bowl or plate...you don't need a can opener. Easy open lid and a microwave cover so you don't have to clean your microwave if it bubbles! This one is delicious. Just add water to the line and dinner is done.
