I like that these are organic and don't have corn syrup.  My kids and I both like them.  I'd give them 5 stars but I noticed earlier this year that they changed the recipe.  The crackers are lighter and flakier than they used to be and they  eak more easily.  And if you have kids under 5, you might understand how upsetting  oken crackers can be.  The taste is still great, but I preffered the old texture myself and definitely for my kids who cry when the crackers  eak while they are eating them.  And when you order these in the mail, like I did last time, don't expect many full graham cracker sheets   most are already  oken in two, and quite a few are  oken at the edges as well.
