I first drank this tea at Naniboujou Lodge on the North Shore of Minnesota, and bought a small packet up there. I was hooked, so after I had drunk the first bit I bought I wanted to get more of this tea ASAP. Was glad to see it for sale in such a high quantity here. I used to be a coffee drinker, but I much prefer tea    specifically, Ashbys Afternoon Tea    now, and I just gave away a bag of coffee I'll never drink. I never quite got why British people are so into tea, but    whether this is a typical British tea or not, I don't know    I now see why they'd build their afternoons around a high quality tea like this one. Sublime.
