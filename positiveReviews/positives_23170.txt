My wife can no longer eat products containing wheat, so she had to give up sandwiches, her morning toast and other  ead based products.  This excellent mix solved the problem and returned all of those treats to her menu.  The mix worked perfectly in our  ead machine.  Just follow the simple instructions.  We use extra large eggs in our home, so I adjusted the recipe to use a bit less water to compensate.  Worked just fine.  We will try more of this company's products in the future.
