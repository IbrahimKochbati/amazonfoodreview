What a mess.          These were not packed well.  No buffers.          Just bags tossed into a box.          Of the thirty bags.. SEVEN were busted open.     And when we opened the box.. we had a super STICKY mess on our hands.          Waiting to hear from Amazon regarding this.          Nearly 1 3 of the food items were ruined contaminated.          Buyer Beware!
