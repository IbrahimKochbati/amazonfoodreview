I was very pleased with these disposable k cups.  I read other peoples comments that the lids are hard to get on.  I found that true at first until I just used one finger and pressed them on in the center.  I heard a click and they were ready to go.  I will order a larger amount next time to save on shipping.  The hot chocolate K cups prefilled are terrible, but these filled with your own chocolate mix are very good.
