THIS IS STRONG STUFF!!!!!!!!!  I mean really, I would really really advise against drinking even a small drop! The package it came in stank (in a good way) of peppermint so hard that I used it as an air freshener in my car for a week before the smell went away :D     Great for putting in my water when I work out to "cool" me down a bit, I highly recommend! The only issue on my part is it says alcohol(95%) on it? Weird, but I don't think its a big issue because it wont catch on fire (I tested just to make sure it, well you know, was not actually 95% alcohol) :)     Great buy
