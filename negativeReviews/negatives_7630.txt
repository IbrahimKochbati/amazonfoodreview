I don't expect the taste of home made from a store bought cookie   it's a naughty pleasure, and I expect a consistent chewiness and not too crumbly texture combined with sweetness and, when chocolate chips and nuts are involved, some pleasing chunks of crunchiness and bursts of chocolate flavor.  Well, Quaker Oats got the TEXTURE right...          These cookies were a TOTAL disappointment.  There's just NO richness to them at ALL   the flavor is mostly a sort of mechanical reference to the taste of oatmeal in a real homemade cookie. Even when licking one of the chocolate chips directly, the chocolate taste just sort of  iefly tantalizes then evaporates, and the nut bits are too small to be noticeable.          I won't be looking for these in stores!
