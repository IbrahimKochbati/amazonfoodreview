The first couple of bags were great. Really fresh, smooth, great taste. I thought I'd found the perfect coffee bean!! The next 5 bags .. stale. I canceled my order and went back to buying whole bean coffee from the supermarket. You pay a little bit more, but I've found that most of the time, the supermarket coffee is fresher. I prefer the taste of Weaver's but too many stale bags.
