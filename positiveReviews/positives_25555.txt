I ordered the hibiscus tea based on information that drinking two cups per day would help reduce blood pressure.  I have not been to the doctor yet to see if this working.  The product arrived promptly.  I drink two cups per day sweetened with a little stevia.  My only critical comment would be that     the packaging doesn't give instructions for preparing the tea, such as how     long it should steep.  I have been steeping it for five minutes.  If that is too long or too short of a time I hope someone will let me know!
