I didn't mind paying the $20+ a bag because my dog loved them. These are so expensive that I didn't look on the bag to see where they were made until ANOTHER recent recall on Chinese dog treats food that was killing dogs....when I looked at the Happy Hips bag, I was pretty ticked off to see that these are made in China.          I used to joke that my dog was addicted to these, but now I am actually a little concerned that there may be some addictive substance in these Chinese "treats"
