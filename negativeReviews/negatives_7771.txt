I was greatly looking forward to an occasional hot chocolate treat. This product smelled great dry. Once in water it had no chocolate aroma and was sickeningly sweet with almost no chocolate flavor. It also had some kind of whitish particles floating on top. I guess they were supposed to be "foamy" but they looked more like partly dissolved cornstarch or something. I won't drink anymore of it and feel I wasted my money.
