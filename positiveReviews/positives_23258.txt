Firstly, let me say that this is a great product if you are looking for a wheat free  ead as I was.     It's moist, tasty and great for  ead machines.          The only reason I ordered this was because of the big 23% OFF sign, however what they reduced in product price, they made back in shipping.  Also, there was NO DISCOUNT for buying 6 packets.     Price including shipping was $36 and change.          Bottom line is that instead of waiting several days to buy this product, just go to your local Fred Meyer where it's sold for $6 per packet! If they had not "reduced" the price by 23%, then you would be getting ripped off severely as you would be paying close to $10 more   you can get an entire grocery list delivered to your home from Fred Meyer for about the same!!     When you factor in that you also get club card rewards, you are better off buying it from Fred Meyer than direct from the manufacturer....I won't be ordering online again.          But good product!
