For lunch today, I had a can of "Wild Planet" wild sardines packed in Extra Virgin olive oil. I served them over a bowl of  own rice and I pored much of the olive oil onto the mixture. For a bit of flavoring, I added a small amount of Mae Ploy sweet chili sauce, an Asian treat from Thailand. Good lunch. Good mix of nutritional ingredients. Excellent sardines, by the way. Really good tasting.          Gary Peterson
