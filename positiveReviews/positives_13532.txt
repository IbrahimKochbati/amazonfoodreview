I bought some for my 86 year old aunt who has severe sinus post nasal drip allergy. It gets so bad it keeps her up sometimes with the coughing and exhausts her. She uses so many medications trying to get some relief, plus the Neti Pot plus an electric irrigation system, plus ginger and thyme tea and Vicks. Since her health is otherwise good, I do what I can just to make sure she stays healthy and is as comfortable as can be.          She has been drinking the tea for a week now and says it is defintiely helping. Thank you! Anything I can do to keep her alive and comfortable is a good thing. She also says it tastes pretty good. And I like that it's not another medication to have in her body but is all natural. She likes drinking tea very day anyway and it's nice to be able to help her feel better.
