I bought this product and it arrived in a crushed case as Amazon does not re box the shipment. I like reduced packaging, but in this case, the product suffers as a result, and several (10+) of the packages were open and perhaps not safe for use.  The other issue is the packages are more than a few months old at the time of shipment.  Several months ago Kellogs started adding fiber to certain cereals, including Special K, and these do not have any fiber  they are probably working off old stock. In spite of all this, I would purchase again  these are great for portion control, which is difficult for cereal, and these would be perfect for food service, day cares, day camps, churches and other groups. I plan on throwing some in my suitcase for travel  most processed prepackaged foods are approved for entry into other countries and these will be good on the go. Hopefully in the near future Amazon will get newer stock with the added fiber.  Make no mistake, Special K is not something most people would consider healthy  high fructose corn syrup is one of the main ingredients and with the lack of fiber, this is little better than a kids cereal, but I do like it for a treat when I am craving something sweet.  Plus they are only 70 calories per portion, and you can add your skim milk right to the container. These portions do not cost any more ounce per ounce than the regular boxes I purchase at the grocery store.
