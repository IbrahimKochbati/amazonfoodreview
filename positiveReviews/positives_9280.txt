My dog loves them.  I purchased them way cheaper at Amazon than at the market.     Theoretically, they have an adequate amount of glucosamine and chondroitin.     My dog won't eat the pill (even in a ball of peanut butter).            MJG           Follow up to my review of Dogswell Happy Hips. Since my original review, I have checked this product at Consumer Lab. According to their lab results this product has only 6% of the glucosamine and 14% of the condroitin that it claims. Don't buy it expecting to help your dog with joint problems            MJG
