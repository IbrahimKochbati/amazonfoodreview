I buy Jack Links Peppered Jerky every month.  I tried these as this was the first time seeing them.  Don't waste your money.  They are so tough even the kids wouldnt eat them!!  They do not taste anything like the other "Peppered" jerkys.  Stick with the 1 oz or the 2 oz sticks they are moist and not so much grizzle.
