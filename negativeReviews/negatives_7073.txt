We opened the box to find the jelly beans sitting directly in the box.  No bag, no plastic container (as the description states)...just literally a cardboard box full of jelly beans.  How clean are cardboard shipping boxes?  The box was taped on top to seal it but air, bugs could easily get through the unsealed edges.  The jelly beans were good and still tasted fresh but we were very disappointed in the packaging.
