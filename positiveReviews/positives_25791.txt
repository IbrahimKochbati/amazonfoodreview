I have been taste testing so many  ands and roasts of k cups to determine our favorites that I feel like a 'lab rat.'  The Tully's Italian Roast immediately stood out from the rest  love at first sip! The other reviews are accurate by describing it as aromatic, smooth and flavorful, not bitter nor weak. I make my first cup of the morning by using one k cup on the large cup setting, then I make my add'l cups of coffee using one k cup and a combination of both the middle and smallest cup; that way I get more coffee using one K cup. It still holds a robust flavor but just not as heavily as the first, which is what I like to do after drinking sev'l cups.  I use cream & sugar, so this routine works for me.  You may or may not tend to tweak your ritual the same way, but it just goes to show you that you can "think out of the k cup."
