The Caribou Blend k cups have fulfilled our household's need for a plain old cup of coffee in the morning that isn't anything fancy, but still gets the job done.  We were searching for a blend that was smooth and flavorful while still being easy to drink and mild.  I particularly like medium roasts and I don't care for a coffee with a lot of acidity and a bitter aftertaste, so this one fits the bill.          The only downside to this k cup is that the aroma.  It wasn't the most appetizing after the first cup was  ewed, but it made up for that in taste.  This isn't a point that really bothers me, but I could see it being a downside for some people.          When I  ew this blend on my way out the door, I often throw in some french vanilla creamer and it's my perfect morning caffeine kick.          So far this is the best average blend we've tried.  We're open to others but until we find something better, we're sticking with the Caribou Blend.
