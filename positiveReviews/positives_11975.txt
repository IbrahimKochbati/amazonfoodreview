When I first go my Havanese puppy 1 1 2 years ago, the  eeder suggested these liver treats for using when training.  My dog will do ANYTHING for these treats.  They even use them at the name  and pet hotel we use in Phoenix.  You have to be careful not to give too much, but my dog, Tanner, got over his separation anxiety when I started the routine of asking for a kiss, then giving him a treat and then leaving.  Now he just wants the treat, I have to beg for the kiss.
