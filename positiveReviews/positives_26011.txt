I nursed our daughter for over 4 long months. She was very colicky and had reflux. We kept getting nowhere with our family practice physician so switched to a pediatrician at 6 months old. After I quit nursing her, hoping putting her to formula would stabilize her diet, we went through formula after formula trying to find one that wouldn't make her gassy or throw up. She ended up having multiple food sensitivies, although not allergies. (She was sensitive to soy, dairy, and goat's milk as far as formula options before the age of 1.) Finally, we visited a pediatric g.i. physician a few times. They were the ones that told us to try this formula, saying give it 2 weeks to really see if it is working for  her or not. After 2 days, our daughter was a different girl. So much happier. she had been on  reflux meds all this time too, with no real help from them alone. Getting her on this formula really turned her around. What a relief. Not saying this will work for all babies everywhere, but it was a great finding for our daughter. Yes, it smells bad...to me. Our daughter made no faces ever and never refused it even once, even though the g.i. doctor cautioned us she might because it doesn't taste very good. She had no issues with it though.
