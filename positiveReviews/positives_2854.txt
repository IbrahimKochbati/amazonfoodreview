And I don't mean just for Asian sauces.  This is easily the best sauce ever!  I put it on everything.  It's gotten out of hand.  I go out of my way to see what else I can have it with.  My latest thing is pouring some over peanuts and coating the peanuts with the sauce.  Then I eat the nuts with a spoon to keep my hands clean.  Sounds gross but it's so delicious.
