My parents gave us this syrup (Dad's an Amazon Prime member, he gets EVERYthing on Amazon!) and we really enjoy the taste but we try to get Grade B syrup and wish Highland Sugarworks would come out with a B grade. We actually wrote them recently to make sure we just haven't missed it. Grade B is the healthy maple syrup, the REAL STUFF, and at first tastes a little darker than this and others you've had (which are almost surely the cheaper and more processed Grade A) but is far better for you and much healthier. If they can maintain this quality but offer a Grade B, we simply will NEVER get anther syrup  and again. As it is, we combine our Grade B which we get mail order from a place in Vermont right now with this since this has such a zesty taste to it.
