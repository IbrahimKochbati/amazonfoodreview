I thought an acid reduction was a great idea, yet  the taste just isn't there. Tasted & smelled bitter, flat & slightly weak.          Doesn't taste like any French roast I've ever had. Needs more work in the taste area.          Comes in a single use foil pouch for coffee maker or French press.          The science may be there & it didn't bother my stomach, but it didn't taste the best either.          I'd rather get a great coffee & take an antacid with it to get the great taste. I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but like a nice cup of great coffee every once in a while.          Might be OK for every day coffee drinkers that buy regular, bulk coffee  ands, but not for me.
