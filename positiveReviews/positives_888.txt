Not paying attention, I thought this product was simply vanilla extract when I purchased it, tried it in my coffee, and got a shock. Yummy!  I had to go examine the bottle, and realized my yummy mistake.  I wonder what glycerin is, what it's made of...? is it a fat?     At any rate, it is delicious!
