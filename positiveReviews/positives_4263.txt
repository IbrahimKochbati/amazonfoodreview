This reminds me of Summertime in my childhood when my mother would  ing a ice tinkling pitcher of Kool Aid out to the backyard, and serve it to us while we sat splashing in the wading pool!  So, I was very pleased that Amazon offers this, since it is getting harder and harder to find in the Seattle area. I do most of my grocery shopping on line at Safeway, and they don't offer it or any Suger Free Kool Aid flavors. I think the price is a little high, but I ordered it on sale and also subscribed to have it delivered bi monthly, so the price is more reasonable. I also purchased the grape flavor, but Tropical Punch is still my favorite. Next time I will get the Cherry flavor, because I like it mixed with Crystal Lite lemonade! It disolves very well in cold water, and to me does not taste sugar free at all.  And of course it is even more refreshing and delicious served up in my vintage 1960's Kool Aid pitcher and little Kool Aid cup!!!
