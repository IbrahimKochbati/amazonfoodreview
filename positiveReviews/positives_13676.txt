buying candy in bulk is the only way to go!          delicious! one of my favorite haribo candies. when this bad boy arrived, i partitioned it out into a few zip lock bags and ate away! candy arrived fresh and stayed fresh for as long as i cared for its freshness (zip lock bags, my friend!) after a few months of haribo frogs, i had to dump them for the next candy on my list.          i would totally buy in bulk again. esp if you dont want to spend $3 on a small bag at the grocery store every weekend.
