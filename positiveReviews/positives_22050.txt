I love wasabi peas and have ordered different  ands and have bought every type imaginable off the grocery store shelves.  The peas from JR Mushrooms & Specialties are the best I've had to date.          I like my wasabi peas to have a little kick, so if you like them that way too these are the peas to get. The shipping was fast as well.  I even ordered some when I was in Afghanistan and they were delivered quickly and in perfect condition.          As far as price goes, you can't beat it.  I usually order the 5 lbs of peas and it comes in either 1 large or 2 medium sized zip lock bags so you can take what you want and seal it up for later use.
