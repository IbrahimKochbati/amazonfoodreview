This is great stuff!  You can use in place of peanut butter in lots of ways and the calorie difference really helps the waistline!  The flavor is just like peanut butter   I sprinkle on top of a piece of toast with fruit spread and it tastes like peanut butter and jelly!  Also use it in wraps for a "thai" flavor and in smoothies   yum!
