Shake 'N Bake Original Pork seasoned coating mix is easy to make. Just follow the simple directions and your pork chops will come out moist. Flavor is great and kids love it. If you are looking for something fast and simple, use Shake 'N Bake. I only prefer the pork chop seasoning. I don't really care for the other seasonings they have.  A+
