This blueberry and vanilla tea is excellent! I love all kinds of tea, and friend gave me some of this blueberry and vanilla (and a couple other Dilmah varieties).  They're all great, but this is one of my favorites.  The blueberry vanilla taste is delicious but not overpowering.  I usually add milk and sugar to my tea, but this one doesn't need it.  I highly recommend it!
