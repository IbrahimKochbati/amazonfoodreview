I got the hickory smoked version and it's packed with salt. I know jerky tends to have a high salt content, but this is the first time it has ever bothered me while eating it. It's usually an after effect like being thirsty. I really regret buying this and would much rather go back to Jack Link's X stick which are less nutritious and taste more like meat flavored than real meat.          Salty taste aside, the pieces are thick and are of medium toughness (i.e., prepare to use some mouth muscles), which are good. Unfortunately, I sometime run into overly chewy pieces.
