HANDS DOWN the best formula on the market.  Sadly, my  east milk dried up so I had to fine a formula.  My poor son has so many GI, stomach, gas, crying, reflux, etc issues.  We were on Alimentum for over a month.  We even tried the ready to eat b c I heard it was corn free.  I also tried the hypoallergenic version by Enfamel.  Nothing made him better.          After researching DHA ARA...I found some scary things.  Basically, it is made by using chemicals.  There are some babies that have had a horrible reaction to this b c of the toxins.  You can google it.  Anyway, I found this organic formula that didn't have it in it (you can buy DHA ARA seperate made from eggs organically and no chemicals).  I was nervous...b c my son had so many issues...I didn't want to make it worse.  But I tried it!  Seriously, it has changed my son's life!  He is a completely different baby!  I no longer even give him acid reflux meds anymore...I mean of course it is still there...but that is how much better it is.  My son has been on this since he was 6 weeks.  I know it says toddler, but if you go to their site it is FDA approved for infants.  They say toddler b c they fully support  east feeding for the first year.  It has the same cals, fats, nutrients, vit, minerals pretty much as the other leading  ands...it's just organic...no DHA ARA..and they don't use corn syrup.  Seriously, try this formula!
