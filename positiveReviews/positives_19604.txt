You have found it!  I have bought baklava products from literally hundreds of bakeries, including many online bakeries.  No other mail order has even come close to the excellent quality of Shatila.  And price?  Wow; tremendous value for the quantity.          Harry and David?  Figis? Please, don't make me laugh. :P          So far, I have tried the Mixed Pastries, Cashew Fingers, and Burma.  All are fabulous!  All received raves from my guests; so delicate; so fresh; so well crafted!  I need to give a special shout out for the burma; this incredible creation was hard to keep around for long; absolutely everyone went nuts for it.          Mmmm, Shatila; anyone who lives in Michigan is very lucky to have such a fabulous bakery.  From 1500 miles away, I appreciate that even though I chose standard delivery, 6 days did absolutely no harm to the freshness of the items; they were so well packaged, and in such nice display boxes.
