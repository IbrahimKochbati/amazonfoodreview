Switch Kiwi Berry Soda:          First thing you notice is the light pink color of the soda. It is very lightly carbonated as there are almost no bubbles, yet it is carbonated. It has a pleasant aroma, light yet fruity.  Its taste is also light but sweet. Fruity with definite berry overtones.  There is though, a slight metallic aftertaste. It's not overwhelming but I notice it. The can has just over 8 ounces and may not be a large enough serving for those used to 12 ounce cans. I on the other  hand find myself often spilling out a few ounces of soda so there may be less waste overall, for me.  As in the other flavor I sampled (Watermelon Strawberry) Kiwi , Raspberry and Strawberry are mighty low in the list of juices in the soda. Still I find this flavor far more palatable than the other. I give it 4 stars and find it an acceptable fruit soda.
