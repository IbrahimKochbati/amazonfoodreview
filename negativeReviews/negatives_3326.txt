I can't give these less than 3 stars because... well, dogs eat them.          However, be aware that these are another  and of extremely hard dog biscuit, while most dogs I have known seem to get most excited by softer (and stinkier) treats.  In fact, these might even be harder than the common milkbone stuff.  I can't comment on taste, but soft and stinky definitely get the biggest reactions.
