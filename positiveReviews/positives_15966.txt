Complex, maybe more nasal than some of the coffees I use in my Gaggia Classic.  There's almost none of the Ethiopian velvety slick feel, it's almost all European in taste, meaning the flavor tones are more coffee and less fruit and chocolate, the mouthfeel is clean and not coating cloying.  Great aroma from the crema, and great aftertaste, lasts twenty minutes or more easily.          This makes a great straight doubleshot. I don't mix this one with milk foam, it's good enough on it's own.  I never have an issue with grind, pour pull rate, or crema production.          Not overly caffeinated, it doesn't have Robusta, causes very little 'over the temple' headache when overpulled thin underdosed, it's pretty temperature insensitive.          While I do appreciate some other coffees with thicker mouthfeel and darker flavors (Klatch Belle Espresso, Black Cat), this coffee is lighter and more 'focused' in flavor than those.  I find I pull shots of this LaVazza about twice as often as I pull 'boutique' shots.          Just solid coffee, and sets the bar for the standard bean I keep in my kitchen.
