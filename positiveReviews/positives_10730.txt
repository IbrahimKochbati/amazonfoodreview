Since having our son 4 years ago, it's been even more important to give our dogs organic healthy food.  The reason for this is for some reason, my son thinks since the dogs eat the food, he can too.  I've tried following this with snacks as well, but we have rather picky dogs.  Most organic or holistic treats are met with either a turned up nose, or eaten without enthusiasm.          I loved the ingredients in these (organic lamb, organic barley, and other organic ingredients).  So I thought I'd give them a try.  As soon as I opened the bag, my dogs came running.  I can easily  eak them in half so the treats are a little smaller (although they are still too large to be good training treats), and my dogs sat, stayed, then came when called to get at these new treats.  They repeated this process several times, which is all I can ask from any treat, especially one that is so healthy.  These treats are scored in the middle, so it is easy to  eak them.          And yes, my 4 year old son did take one and try it, and he says they are really tasty too!  Our dogs are both 75 pounds (a very picky Akita husky mix who won't even eat raw meat, and a big  own mutt that doesn't like peanut butter), so I'm not sure if these treats would be as good for small  eeds.  The pieces when  oken in half are a little over an inch square.
