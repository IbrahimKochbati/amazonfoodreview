These biscuits were a great purchase. My dog absolutely loves them.  Since she's been eating them, the arthritis that usually slows her down has far less effect. She's jumping around like a puppy now. I used to use a vet recommended supplement for her once daily but spreading the biscuits and helpful contents out throughout the day seems to be more effective. I highly recommend this product.
