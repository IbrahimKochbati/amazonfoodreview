Impressed with a couple of other Asian Home Gourmet Products I gave this one a try. I was not disappointed. I've been longing for the creamy Korma like the Indian Restaurants. While not quite the same it is close.          To fix you use a finely chopped (finer the better) onion that is sauteed till cooked, then add your meat (I use chicken) till  owned, then throw in water and cream and let simmer. Serve over rice.          The first batch I made was a tad on the watery side, I had used a knife to chop the onions and powdered coconut milk for the cream. I thought it was ok but the rest of the family loved it.          Understanding the dish a bit better the second time around I used the food processor for the onion, this gave a more even smooth paste like base. Then I used coconut cream on a 1:1 basis for water. That turned out MUCH thicker and tastier. Everyone in the house loves it, personally I'd prefer a bit more punch but if your looking for something with good flavor and no heat this is an excellent choice. I will be stocking up on it.
