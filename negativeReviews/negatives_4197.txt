I ordered this product on Amazon to get some of the flavors we can't get in the US, namely, bacon, worcestershire, and prawn cocktail.  The photo of the product was so small and the description was so vague that I didn't realize until it came that what I was getting were actually 3 flavors of crisps that I can get down the street from my house:  cheddar cheese and onion, salt and vinegar, and regular flavor.  I was VERY disappointed.  Instead of trying again to order online, I will ask friends in the UK to shop and mail them for me.
