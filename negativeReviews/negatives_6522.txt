I am a gadget holic.  I just had to have this one.  I had 12 potatoes to peel so was excited to be able to do them in "8 seconds" each, as the commercial states.  They do fail to mention that you have to boil the potatoes first.  The gloves are huge   I normally buy a large in dishwashing gloves.  The fingers are so long that they were flopping around and the gloves are so big and cumbersome that it took me about 2 minutes each to get the first 2 done..  After that, I threw this useless "gadget" in the sink and got out a knife.  The instructions say to just rinse them off and let dry   yeah, good luck with that.
