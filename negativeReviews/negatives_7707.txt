Totally do not like the flavor of this coffee on it's own. It smells great when you first puncture the k cup, but then it's all down hill from there.  It's fruity, no nuttiness at all, with a strange aftertaste, and kind of weak on a 6oz  ew.  It works fine with a cocoa for a mocha, but not good at all by itself.  This is coming from someone who likes the "Dark Magic" and "Double Black Diamond" k cups.
