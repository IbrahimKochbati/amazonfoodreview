I bought this before I purchased the MXL Micmate. It is plastic, and very cheaply made. I felt like it would  eak very easily, and would not be something that would last me a while. So then I bought the Micmate. It is solid metal, and is way better sound quality than this. I beg you to buy that over the Icicle. Buy the MXL used (Like New) from "TheMintMovieMan", a great seller and it is a great product.    "
