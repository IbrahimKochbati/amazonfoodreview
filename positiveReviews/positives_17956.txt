I've never used any Shake n Bake product so I didn't know what to expect. The instructions said to use 4 pork chops about 1 1 2" thick and to cook at 425 degrees for 15 minutes or until done.  The instructions didn't tell whether to cover the pork or leave it uncovered.  I chose to leave them uncovered for about 20 minutes and when I saw that the pork chops weren't yet done I decided to cover with a sheet of foil to keep the heat in better.  Big mistake.  10 minutes later when I checked the pork, it was cooked all the way through but the crispness that was on the pork chops before had disappeared.  They had turned soggy.  I wish I had given it longer (maybe 35 minutes) uncovered to see the results, but I'm afraid the  eading might have burned at that temperature after so long.          Despite the sogginess (in other words, juiciness, LOL) the FLAVOR was actually pretty good.  My husband and kids loved it and I thought it was "okay."  I'm sure it would have been much better if it weren't soggy.  I would be willing to give this Shake N Bake a second try.  I deduct a star for not giving better baking instructions.
