This all in one pack of popcorn is great! Cut the end and dump it into your popcorn maker. I use the stove top maker to make mine. Though you really need a HUGE container (6 quart) to make it properly. While the popcorn is still popping I have to empty out the contents into a bowl because it makes a ton. The popcorn is very salty. I usually hold back a little of the salt to get the perfect taste. I really like this popcorn. Just like popcorn at the movies.
