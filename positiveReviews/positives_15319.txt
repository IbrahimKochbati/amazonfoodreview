I bought this for my wife as a birthday present.  She absolutely loves it!  We love to drink coffee but hate the thought of having to make a full pot when we just want a cup.  The Keurig  ewer solved that problem for us.  So when we want a single cup, we just pop in our favorite pod and BOOM! There is your cup of coffee.  Love everything about this  ewer except for the price of the pods.  Can't wait until the patent expires at the end of this year...that should lower the prices on these pods significantly!
