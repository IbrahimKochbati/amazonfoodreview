I love the Tofu Shirataki noodles (angel hair, spaghetti & fettucini). I eat 2 bags most days. Very filling and only 40 calories. I am not much of a cook. I prefer the simplest of methods to cook. I rinse off quickly in cool water, then throw on a non stick frying pan. I used to use Olive Oil but have found I don't need that, either. I sprinkle with Mrs. Dash or Vogue vegetarian chicken base. Just stir for a couple of minutes to get some of the water out. It's great. Last night I  ought an unopened bag to a Cajun restaurant with me, and they agreed to cook with it in place of the traditional pasta that was supposed to come with my meal. The owner was surprised how much it tasted like pasta. For  eakfast I sometimes use a little Almond Milk and Stevia for sweetener. I think they taste GREATTTTT, very very similar to pasta (unlike the shirataki without the tofu that isn't refrigerated and is more gel like and not as similar to pasta). The product is great for your digestion and fills you up. I often stir fry one and put into a plastic container with cooked vegetables and reheat for lunch. I'm addicted to House Foods Tofu Shirataki. However, if possible, search at your local grocery stores. The shipping online is expensive because it needs to be refrigerated. Highly recommend!!
