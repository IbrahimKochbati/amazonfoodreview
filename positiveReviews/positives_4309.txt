My Dad has been a Yuban fan for as long as I can remember. The stronger the better! When you  eak the spoons stirring it, it's just right! He even goes so far as to plan his shopping and the stops on the trips that he takes, at stores that serve Yuban coffee. Why, I don't know, I'm a sweet tea ice no lemon guy so I have no opinion on coffee, Yuban or not, one way or another. I can say that it smells good  ewing but then so does Play Doh and some of the old magic markers. I'm just trying to report about what I've been exposed to.     Here I buy the packs of 12, every 6 months for him and give them to him at Christmas and Father's day. They stay fresh and save the public from being exposed to the mad, half clothed emergency trips to the store that my 70 year Widower father makes to score the base component for his and the "house guest of the moment's" (see *1 below) daily ritual sunrise aperitifs. We've asked about his dedication to Yuban coffee to which he replies, "it's perfect black, but better with something in it!" He is apparently referring to its flavor when mixed with any of the typical 'southern flavorings' (taxed and untaxed, regulated and unregulated) that he occasionally adds to his morning  ew. He is definitely one satisfied customer and it makes my life easier (one less present to find each occasion) so take his actions and my word for it!          (*1)...If she only comes over for  eakfast it sure seems like a long way to drive, and please, tell me again, why does she  ing so many clothes? No sir, I did not know that, do tell. When exactly did the CDC recommend showering before  eakfast?
